10,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"'The last date on which duty was collected on imported bananas was the 27th May.

IMPERIAL CONFERENCE: ANGLOJAPANESE ALLIANCE.'",20
11,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"As the reports of the proceedings of the Imperial Conference which reach, us are not very complete, can the Acting Prime Minister inform the House of the stage which has been reached in the negotiation of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and can he give us information as to the stage which the business of the Conference in general has reached? /",20
12,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If I had information regarding the progress of the negotiations about the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, I should consider it very unwise to make it public at this juncture.

15,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Las t year a deputation from the Country party waited on crediting Australia. the Treasurer, asking that the income tax forms might be simplified. Since then the State and Commonwealth Income Tax Offices in Western Australia have been amalgamated, and I have here a copy of nexion ? the new income tax form. Honourable members will see that taxpayers are quired by it to answer a large number of questions extending over several pages, and they are liable to a fine of £100 they make any mistake in doing so. ask the Treasurer if he will ascertain from the Income Tax Department whether it would not be possible to save much printing and paper by shortening .the forms, and making them easier for those who have to fill them in ? Sir JOSEPH' COOK - The sheets which the honourable gentleman has handed to me constitute a formidable document. I understand,, however, that somethingis being done to simplify the income tax returns. I believe that ib is intended to provide a special form for taxpayers who draw only salary or wages.",20
16,Mr STEWART,Unknown,How.bi g will it be?',20
17,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It will be comparatively small. The only way in which there can be any radical reform is by amending the Act, which is the source of many complications. I hope 'that we may soon attempt that, (hough it will be a difficult piece of business. I am afraid that even when we have done our best to simplify the schedules, we shall find that, owing to the variety of interests and conditions inseparable from a big continent like this, they will not be as simple as we should like. The nearer we can attain to simplicity and uniformity the better; but I doubt whether we shall be .able to secure uniformity until the public opinion of the country takes the matter in hand and insists upon it . The Federal Govcrnonent is quite unable to do it at the momeut. WILD DOGS IN AUSTRALIA.",20
18,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he observed that, in the course of the debates on the - Tariff, honourable members of the Country party made the statement that unless Australia was wired across with cheap wire, wild dogs would overrun New South Wales?

RESUMPTION OF WORK ON H . M . A . S . ""ADELAIDE.""",21
26,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister a question with respect to information I have, to the effect that the resumption of work on the Adelaide at Cockatoo Island is being delayed through the fact that there is some difficulty with regard to the removal from her present moorings of the Braeside, one of the wooden ships moored at Cockatoo Island. Will the right honourable gentleman say whether this is a fact? Will he say what the difficulty is, and whether it cannot be removed ?",21
27,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is a fact, and steps have been taken to remove the obstacle at the earliest possible moment. Urgent representations have already been made to the representatives of Kidman Mayoh for the removal of the Braeside. That vessel is at present moored alongside the Adelaide, and is in the way. If those responsible for her do not move her, some other means will have to be adopted to shift her out of the way. NA GERMANY.",21

' Question not answered. COCKATOO ISLANDDOCKYARD : PAPERS. REPORTS OF ROYA L COMMISSION.",21
37,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RESUMPTION OF TRADEWIT H,"(B y leave.)I present reports from the Royal Commission on the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. There is one report signed by all the members of the Commission with the exception of the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams). There is an addendum or separate report signed by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Eyan) and the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony). I understand that there is a third report to come from the honourable member for Franklin. I am informed that it has been presented, but it has not yet reached me. When it does, I shall be glad to present, it to the House. I move That the 'papers be printed.",21
38,Mr RYAN,RESUMPTION OF TRADEWIT H,"West Sydney) [3.20] On the motion for the printing of these papers, I should like to ask for some information from the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook). An interim report was made some time ago, I think very early in June. It was a unanimous report, signed by all the members of the Royal Commission, and was presented with the object of having work immediately resumed at Cockatoo Island. Apparently, nothing was done in connection with that matter until, I think, Monday last, when some little work was recommenced at the island:",22
39,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RESUMPTION OF TRADEWIT H,Some work was commenced there last week.,22
40,Mr RYAN,RESUMPTION OF TRADEWIT H,"There may have been some little work taken up. My point is that the purpose of the interim report was to have work resumed at Cockatoo Island Dockyard at the earliest possible moment. That purpose was stated in the report. I should like some statement from the Government as to when operations will be in full awing again, and whether those operations will involve the re-employment of all the men who were so summarily dismissed from the works at Cockatoo Island. This is a matter of very grave importance to the men who were employed there. Whilst I do not wish at this stage to initiate a debate on the whole question, because I have no doubt an opportunity will be given to debate the-subject later on, and of dealing with, the subject-matter of the various reports from the Royal Commission, I think it is due to us, and certainly due to the employees who were dismissed, that we should have a statement at the earliest moment as to what are the intentions of the Government with regard to the re-employment of the whole of the men who were dismissed. - Mr RICHARD FOSTER - Will the Acting Prime Minister endeavour to have the reports printed and circulated amongst honourable members at as early a date as possible?",22
41,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RESUMPTION OF TRADEWIT H,"Parramatta-Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.21] - That is what I wish to do. Whatever delay has occurred in the resumption of operations at the Dock has not been due to anything the Government have done. It has arisen, in the very nature of things from the transfer of control from the Navy Board to the new Shipbuilding Board; and, as the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) will recollect, that was a definite recommendation by himself, amongst others, in the interim report. The recommendation was that the work to be resumed in connection with the new programme should be carried out by the Shipbuilding Board under the terms of its appointment. I understand that the new Board has taken over the Dockyard, and that has involved a valuation of plant and a consideration of the relationship of that plant to the one at Garden Island and naval requirements. Several ticklish questions have had to be considered, and they, no doubt, are causing the delay. I have been urging the Board to recommence operations ever since the interim report came to hand. As to whether all those men who were irnfortunately discharged will resume work, I cannot say. There is work to be done, and there is a Board to do it, and that is all that I can say. The sooner they get to work the better I shall be pleased. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA COMMISSION: PAPER.

' 11,517 *These amounts are small comparatively owing to the fact that calculation of leasehold interests is made on owuers' valuations. The departmental valuations .are to be applied. 3.

48,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PILLAGING ON WHARFS,"On Friday last the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr . Richard Foster), asked a question with reference to a High Court verdict regarding a case brought before the Court by a shall South Australian Commonwealth official. This matter is already before the Commonwealth law officers, who are considerPostmaster-General. ing carefully the whole question. NA The following paper was presented':Public Service Act-Regulations ) AmendedStatutory Rules 1921, No. 122. - TARIF F BOARD..BILL. "" SECOND READING. Debate resumed, from, 6th - July (vide page 9726), on motion by Mr GREENE'. That this Bill be now read a. second, time. Mr Watt, (Balaclava) [3:28*] - At the outset of my remarks I congratulate the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr closed, Greene) upon the wonderful 'zeal and ability with which he has applied himself to the great constructive work building during the last, six /months. Now that, the ^Tariff has, been' sent, another place honourable members may 'considerably'."""" cast aside, for.a moment their fiscal differences and - congratulate ' the Minister generously, and give, open acknowledgpermanent'.Board'; ment of their views as to the remarkable research work which the Minister exanomalies hibited at every stage in the Committee of Ways and Means, the monumental think, character of the work be undertook, the temperate Way in . which hisarguments were advanced to the Committee, and the patience and tact which', throughout the ing to remedy, .existing defects. long drawn out proceedings-, he exhibited to membersgenerally. I have' been connected with this Parliament for only'six or seven years,-but I doubt whether there has ever been - a case' where' greater assiduity and devotion to duty have been exhibited by a Minister in the whole course of our union. I note sympathy and concern the fact that these sustained labours have made serious roads upon his health and vigour, and' think I express the sentiments of honorordinary able members generally when I voice the hope that he will shortly be restored to usual health and powers. Two difficulties confront a Legislature such as this in endeavouring to determine the basis, and details of its Tariff enactnition ments. The first difficulty is the obtainhe ing of accurate, reliable, and unbiased formation as to the conditions, prospects, and requirements of particular industries. We have two sourcea of supply. The firstcient is that-of the Minister^ backed by his partment; the second is that .of the interests affected-. Both these; sources' are : Bid. 9885 in ordinary circumstances liable to suffer from prejudice, and to be consequently unreliable. The Minister would be more than human if he did not use his departmental data to support his - recommendations in the Tariff, and . every Minister must be expected, however broad, or wide his experience, to exhibit unconscious bias in favour of his own proposals. The rival recommendations of ""the importers and .the' manufacturers respectively are , heavily laden' with self-interest, and hbn'oratfle'members have felt, at'critical times during ' .the didcris'sion ' Which has now the difficulty of' depending altogether upon the ex p'ari'e views 'conveyed to the in about the condition's of certain of Tariff industries. "" '.' .' to . Mr STEWART' - Some of them varied",23
49,Mr WATT,PAPER,"They did^ 'according to the points of. view! '[ The creation . of a to conduct 'research - work, and to suggest 'the rectification of or the' alteration pf principles where' circumstances have changed is, I J a, recognition of the weakness of the position, and, with certain-reservations to which I shall have occasion to refer, I welcome the attempt the Minister'is maltThe second difficulty is the lack'of elasticity in. a Tariff when it is. completed. Industry, as we know, is evolutionary. Its circumstances change, and the Tariff, as wo have hitherto known it) is not sufficiently mobile to meet the changes as they with occur. Duties that may be appropriate according to our. conception of circum, instances today may be obviously wrong I in twelve months' time..' That is so in circumstances,' but it is doubly so at this time,, when the conditions of his industry are transitory and abnormal, and when we must expect swift changes, arising partly out of local developments and partly out of world conditions, as they occur. I am glad the Minister, in recogof the defects and difficulties which has confronted, has had the construcintive courage to submit this Bill for the consideration of the House. He very wisely said that he did not expect this Board, effiand all as he hopes it to be, to Deproduce an industrial millennium, to cure ,all the evils; .or to allay all'the arguments and. disputes: that, undoubtedly must exist, after this Tariff has gone through, between the manufacturing and importing interests. . Mr STEWART - It would be a remarkable tribunal that could cure all the evils arising out of a Tariff.",24
50,Mr WATT,PAPER,"The Minister is wise enough, as I am sure the honourable member is also, not to ask us to hope too much from this offspring which he is launching upon an unsympathetic and merciless world. He has been very plain about it ; but if the powers given to this body are properly drawn, and if the personnel of the Board itself proves to be satisfactory, I think it may, in the present kaleidoscopic condition of affairs, contribute a very useful service to the mercantile community, to Parliament, and to the Government. Now, as to the proposed functions. I think, as elaborated in the Bill and explained by the Minister, they are wisely drawn, and cover a very desirable and necessary scope. Properly used, they may be fruitfu l of much good, and, so far as I am able to judge, of no harm. All this is in unqualified a'pproval of the measure. I have mentioned certain reservations which are in. my mind, and I propose now to deal briefly with them. There are at least three features of the Bill which I think, on reflection, would suggest themselves as worthy of amendment. The first is the clause, or rather the clauses-becaus e several of them are related-whic h deal with the Minister's powers. The vital clause is number 15, under which the power is technically given to the Minister to "" take action,"" to use the words of the clause, upon the recommendation of the Board. The Minister, when his attention was drawn to that phase while he was submitting the Bill for its second reading, announced that it was not the intention of the Government, in bringing the Bill before Parliament, to give the Minister legislative authority or to impose on the Executive any of the powers of Parliament.",25
51,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,I said that our intention was to leave. the Minister's power exactly as it is now.,25
52,Mr WATT,PAPER,"I understood so. I am only a layman, and although laymen, after some experience of Parliament, either as Ministers or members, do acquire a certain proficiency in interpreting Acts of Parliament, that proficiency is not accepted unanimously by the lawyers in the Chamber or in the community, and I therefore do not propose to dogmatize on that point, but my impression is that, if the Bill finishes as it now stands, a Minister reaching after power may discharge legislative authority, either of a negative or a positive kind, which I think this House would decline to give.",25
53,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,Do you mean that he might be able to raise or lower the Tariff duties ?,25
54,Mr WATT,PAPER,"I do not mean that so much, but I have selected from clause 14, which is the power and function clause of the Bill, certain things which he may be able to do, notwithstanding the Minister's statement of intention. My honourable friend in charge of the Bill will, of course, exonerate me from suggesting any sort of impropriety in his mind, or that any attempt would be made by him, after his assurance to the House, to exercise powers which might be technically conferred upon him. The powers which I think might be exercised by the Minister without impropriety, as clause 15 now stands, are, for example, those contained in clause 14, sub-clause 1, paragraph d. This provides that ""The Minister shall refer to the Board for inquiry and report the following matters:The necessity for new, increased, or reduced duties, and ""-the n these words, to which I draw attention-""the deferment of existing or proposed deferred duties."" If the Board, under this compulsory form of reference, which is obligatory on the Minister, had the question referred to it , generally or specifically, as to whether certain existing duties should become deferred ones, or certain deferred duties should be still further postponed, and submitted, after inquiry, a recommendation in that direction, the Minister, under clause 15, could give effect to it. That is my. suggestion. - Mr MASSYGREENE --That is true, in so far as the deferred duties in the Tariff are ""concerned, because the Customs Tariff Bill itself confers that power.",25
55,Mr WATT,PAPER,"If the Customs Tariff Bill , when it becomes an Act, does specifically confer that power, then the M in ister, has for the exercise of this power other statutory authority than this Bill would confer, but the Customs Tariff Bill does not confer the power to postpone the operation of existing duties, so far as I know.",26
56,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,"Of course, it is not suggested here that that should be done.",26
57,Mr WATT,PAPER,"No , but it could he done.",26
58,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PAPER,I do not thin k this Bill ought to depend for its effect on any other Bill .,26
59,Mr WATT,PAPER,"The Minister (Mr . Greene) has pointed out that in the Customs Tariff Bill the power to further postpone deferred duties is already conferred on the Minister, and I do not propose, therefore, to reflect on it . This Bill does not affect or override that Bill . It dovetails into the enactment already sanctioned by this House, but that is not so serious a phase of the matter as the other. If we said that a particular duty should operate on and after the 1st January, 1922, and the Minister thought, after fulle r knowledge and a wider survey of the developments in the industry, that that duty should be postponed for another six or twelve months, I would not hesitate to give the Minister that power, if he asked for it . But I would hesitate to give power to postpone existing duties.",26
60,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,"Oh , yes!",26
61,Mr WATT,PAPER,"Disregardin g that point for a moment as one that does not matter so much, and one already covered by other forms of enactment, I suggest to the Minister the necessity for altering clause 15, either to make the legal meaning clear, or to remove a doubt, 'to use his own phrase when introducing the Bill , so that that kind of function cannot be discharged by the Minister without Consulting with Parliament.",26
62,Mr RYAN,PAPER,You suggest that no more powers should be conferred on the Minister by the Bill than he already has?,26
63,Mr WATT,PAPER,"Precisely , or which Parliament will authoritatively, in deliberately-worded sections, give him.",26
64,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,We do not more.,26
65,Mr WATT,PAPER,"Of course, it has often been complained, and I think with considerable reason, during the war and before the war, in a large number of Legislatures functioning as ours does, thab the tendency of Executives is to gradually encroach on the powers of the Legislatures. That seems' to be the inherent desire and inevitable effect of strong Executives, and I believe that Parliament will always be wise in correcting it , and in saying that no legislative power, excepting what is imperatively necessary to meet an important contingency or emergency, shall be conferred on the Executive without special ""consultation with Parliament. That is the general attitude I assume in criticising these phases of the Bill .",26
66,Mr RYAN,PAPER,That leads to another conclusion-that this Board can do only such things as the Minister now can himself do without the Board.,26
67,Mr WATT,PAPER,"We l l , that may be so. The difficulty which I have alluded to in a few passing sentences is simply that Parliament cannot be asked every year to review the whole Tariff, and Parliament, recognising the inelasticity of a Tariff when made, and the necessity for periodic review, is seeking to invent a machine that will keep constant purview of the movements of industries, and where circumstances change, suggest particular changes which'can be legislated for swiftly without invitin g the revision of a whole Tariff, and rectify anomalies which, I have no doubt whatever, will be found to exist even in the present Tariff. Already honourable members are being told, to cite one case, that the relationship between the duty on leather, which is the finished product of the tanner, and the duty on boots, which are the finished product of the bootmaker, has been wrongly established. Although I happen to have been acquainted with this industry, and to have served considerable time in it in my earlier days, I frankly admit that I am unable to reconcile the statements made to me. I have not been able to pay sufficient attention to the subject to enable me to say whether the bootmakers have had a bad deal and the tanners an over-generous one. or whether things are all r i g h t : but I would readily consent to such a Board as is now proposed, if properly functioned and staffed, desire any reporting to Parliament the exact effects in this particular case, eliminating the element of self-interest, and contributing helpfully to the information and educabefore tion of honourable members.",26
68,Mr JOWETT,PAPER,Provide d Parliament finally decides.,27
69,Mr WATT,PAPER,"Provided Parliament other finally decides. As to the form of the cisions, I shall speak in a moment. I wish to deal with another power under clause 14, which, I think, the Minister could operate in accordance with the powers conferred by clause 15. That power condid ferred by clause 14 is in paragraph gAny proposal for the application of the British preferential Tariff or the intermediate Tariff to any part of the British Dominions or any foreign country Here are the words on which I dwell-*together with any requests received'from tralian producers or exporters in relation the export of their-goods to any such part country. I cannot conceive for a minute that the Minister, even with the assurance he that voluntarily gave us, would' attempt to legislate individually with regard British preferential Tariff in an improper way, or to use the conditions of the intermediate Tariff without consulting Parliament. But I , wish to know exactly what is meant and what powers are contained, or possible of discharge, under the termining words of the clause. I do not think the Minister should have power deal with requests received from exporters or producers which might vitally affect the principles of a Tariff or the relationceiving ship between classes of duties without conferring with Parliament. Mr MASSYGREENE.:-What we had in mind were requests from producers in relation to reciprocal Tariff arrangements-that and nothing more.",27
70,Mr WATT,PAPER,"If that is what it and the Minister .is clearly of the opinion that neither he, nor any successor of his, would be justified in operating a reciprocal Tariff, except under conditions of Statute, I am quite satisfied.",27
71,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,"The Tariff Bill lays down that, although this is done by proment clamation, a proclamation can operate only after receiving the assent of both Houses of Parliament.",27
72,Mr WATT,PAPER,"That is quite satisfacciple, tory; and. if the: conclusion of paragraph of clause 14 is held by the Minister and the House% to> cover only matters going enactment.' Parliament-that is, reciprocal Tariffs-the Statute already covers it I am now brought, more by the Minister's interjection than anything else, to the question of how far a Minister will deconsult Parliament', and what his methods should be, after the creation of such an investigating body as this, in the consideration of its recommendations. I do hot know what the Minister proposes, for he not make the point clear in introducr ing the Bill. The decision might be in a positive, form,, such as the Minister referred, to in regards to reciprocal Tariffs, or in a negative form. In certain matters, I think, the form should be positive. More important changes that might be recomr Ausmended by the Board, and approved by to a Government;-change s that strike at or vital relationships in the.Tariff or condition big interests-should , I think, be placed in the positive legislative form'; is to say, Parliament' should be asked by resolution, in a definite and specific to the way, to affirm them.",27
73,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,In the ordinary way.,27
74,Mr WATT,PAPER,"Yes ; but there may be some minor matters, provided for in declause 14, which Parliament would be quite content to leave to the'Executive, to asin the case of regulations of certain kinds; that is, to have regulations laid on the table for thirty days before rethe force of law. I think the Minister would' be well advised to confer with his legal colleagues, and put a clause or clauses in the Bill conditioning clause 15, and showing how many of these powers will be operated positively, and how , many might be dealt with by regulation.",27
75,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,"The regulations means, will have to be very specific.",27
76,Mr WATT,PAPER,"I assume that Parliar ment has that matter in its own hands. For example, if a minor matter in clause 14 were put in negative form, and the Minister laid his regulations before Parliait ment within the prescribed time, Parliar would be able to move if they were not satisfactory. . In minor matters, Parliament would be inclined to trust the Executive; but, as to basic matters of prinr I think that, as the head of the g. Government (Sir Joseph Cook) has signified, we should have a positive form of",27
77,Mr JOWETT,PAPER,"May I suggest a concrete case? Suppose exporters in F i j i complained that, owing to the prohibition of bananas, their trade was injured, and they went before the Board, what would be the final steps to be taken to have a question like that reopened?",28
78,Mr WATT,PAPER,"I know what, in my mind, the final step should be. We have had a most illuminating debate in this House on bananas, led by the honourable member for. . Lilley (Mr. Mackay), backed - by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser), . in one of his most interesting, eloquent, and ferocious speeches - I venture to think that no Minister in ' his senses would dare to confront two such heroic representatives of the northern State without first having consulted Parliament upon the matter.",28
79,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,Unde r the B i ll could not do anything else.,28
80,Mr WATT,PAPER,Unde r - the ' Bill cpuld. That is the point.,28
81,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,It is a matter opinion.,28
82,Mr WATT,PAPER,"Technicall y the Minister could do something else. ever, the honourable gentleman has stated that he has no intention of doing anything in that direction, and I suggest, therefore, that Parliament should register the intention of the Government in the indelible Statute law of the country. I shall now leave the question of legislative authority, because it appears that the Government and myself are in perfect agreement as to what is desirable in this connection, so that it is merely a matter of phrasing' in Committee the changes which we deem it necessary to make in the measure. I come now to the constitution of the Board. I believe that the Minister has acted wisely in recommending that the chairman of this body shall be an administrative officer of the Customs Department. I think that the country is very fortunate in having at least one officer-and I think more than one-wh o is well fitted to discharge this important and onerous task. I shall not . embarrass the Minister by mentioning names, but I do not think that he - will experience very much trouble in selecting for the post an officer who will command the confidence of this Parliament, and when itB members know him, the confidence of the mercantile community as well. The other observations which I propose to make upon the question of salaries may, perhaps, influence the Minister to alter the figure which he has put against this officer's work. I am, however, most concerned with the position of the other two. members of the Board. After having given the matter what thought I have been able, since the measure was brought before the House, I do not think that the Minister is going the right way to secure the proper sort of colleagues for .the chairman of the proposed - Board. I do not think that the honourable gentleman will get the best men upon this Board for fees of £5 5s. per day. Although I believe in the proposal, I am not prepared to vote for a scheme which will one provide part-time men for the discharge of this important work, at least during one the first three or five years. I do not. know whether you, sir, have acquainted yourself during recent years with the of salaries which are being paid to good men by big mercantile houses in all parts of Australia, as well as in other communiHow- ties. We cannot get the best men for £1,000 or £1,500 a year. During my association with the present Government we invited applications for an office, the filling of which involved the possession of commercial qualifications and organizing power, and with a salary of £1,500 a year offered, we were six months endeavouring to get somebody whom we regarded as qualified to fill the position. I would far sooner see the Minister confer upon the Governor General in Council power to pay any fees which are necessary to secure the best brains for this work. I believe that a review of the industrial and manufacturing circumstances and possibilities today is so important that it would be profitable for the Minister to pay £2,000, £3,000, and even up to £5,000 a year each for the services of two good men. I would more confidently hand these large powers of research and recommendation to a body composed of such men than I would to the body which the Minister proposes to create.",28
83,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,You could not get the right men for the sake of the fees.,28
84,Mr WATT,PAPER,"For what else will you get them? We need to eliminate self interest from this body. When a man is called to such an important advisory service, we require to be certain that he give the Crown the benefit of his best advice.",29
85,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,"Otherwise , we shall not get the best. men.",29
86,Mr WATT,PAPER,Our only hope is that we shall be able to offer such a reward that competent men with experience and with futures will be justified in withdrawand ing from their present associations to serve the Crown in this capacity.,29
87,Mr RYAN,PAPER,"Does the honourable member suggest that the chairman of the Board should still be retained upon the £1,400 a year mark?",29
88,Mr WATT,PAPER,"I suggested a few moments ago that the remarks which I was about to make in reference to the chairman's two colleagues might justify the Minister in reconsidering the pay of the chairman himself. If an administrative officer from the' Customs Department be appointed chairman, he will still be identified with that Department, and his rights will be preserved under this Bill. Even after the Tariff Board has lived and died he will retain his association with the Public Service of this country. But the position is altogether different when we call a man from outside to serve the Commonwealth in a special capacity for three or five years. The very best men should be obtainable for these positions; they should be free even from the suggestion of prejudice, of preconceived ideas, and of self-interest. Parliabeen committed. ment, then, would be justified in giving to the Board the largest powers that the Minister desires to confer upon it. The only other question upon which desire to speak relates to the penalties two. which are sought to be imposed by the Bill. These penalties start at clause 22. penalties. There it is proposed that a fine of £500 shall be inflicted upon any person who has been served with a summons to attend the Board and who fails, without reasonthey able excuse, to do so, or to produce documight ments, books, or writings which are in return a verdict of not guilty. his custody. Clause 23 makes a fine £500 imposable upon a man who refuses to be sworn or to give evidence. Under clause 24, the number of days upon which he continues to thus infringe the Act are held to constitute separate offences.",29
89,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,After a conviction.,29
90,Mr WATT,PAPER,"Yes . Consequently, if a will man did one thing which the Court held to be wilful and to fall within these particular clauses, he could be fined £500, and, if he remained recalcitrant for ten days, he could be fined a further sum of £5,000. Clause 32 sets out that any person who inflicts injury upon a witness shall be guilty of an indictable offence, shall be liable to a penalty of £500 or imprisonment for one year. Clause 33 provides that any employer who dismisses an employee for anything which he has said before the Tariff Board shall be liable to a fine of £500 or imprisonment for a year. Some of these penalties seem to be too Draconian in character; and without pausing to argue them at length, I suggest to the Minister that our experience in various parts of Australia is that the more severe the penalties which are inflicted the more difficult does it become to secure convictions. Thus, there is a very real danger that in our endeavour to impose heavy punishments we may overreach ourselves, and thus permit of the escape of guilty men. The Minister would be well advised to reconsider the penalty which should be imposed for a first offence as against the penalties which may be inflicted for recurring offences, and also the advisableness of encouraging Courts of summary jurisdiction to extend, not sympathetic, but fair consideration to the accused, and to the circumstances under which the offence is supposed to have",29
91,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,There is another side to that matter.,29
92,Mr WATT,PAPER,"There is, and I shall I probably speak of that in a minute or",29
93,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,Thes e are maximum,29
94,Mr WATT,PAPER,"That is so, but if a man were arrainged for an indictable offence, the jury having regard to the fact that if brought in a verdict of guilty, he be fined £500, might be tempted to This is of a reasoning which all juries might be persuaded to adopt, as no doubt the Aoting Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Ryan), who has so frequently appeared with signal success before juries of his fellow countrymen, will admit.",29
95,Sir ROBERT BEST,PAPER,As counsel or l it gant ?,30
96,Mr WATT,PAPER,"In both capacities-re ceiving, in the one case, substantial fees, and in the other, the sympathy of his admirers. I do not desire to detain House further. A f t e r careful considerapositions. tion, I am uninfluenced by the fact that this proposal means the creation another Board, and I shall, on some future occasion, if the opportunity prehitherto, sents itself, deal with the question generally conferring upon Boards power, a course which all Governments are more or less prone to adopt. In this case I think that this Board, if properly posed, will pay for itself many hundred times over and materially benefit the community as a whole. Notwithstanding that the present is a time for the closest scrutiny of every item of expenditure, particularly at this period of the year when new Estimates and new Budgets are either in contemplation or in course, of preparation, I still would be prepared to justify on any platform in the country the creation of such a Board as the Minisa ter designs to set up, and feel sure that the community, when it sees it properly try. staffed and working, will believe that investment is a good one.",30
97,Sir ROBERT BEST,PAPER,"Kooyong) [4.4] - I welcome this Bill which has for its object the creation of a Tariff Board. state of the House. As Minister for Customs myself some years ago, and as the outcome of a great many years' experience in State and Federal politics, I came to the conclusion that it was essential, in connection with the administration of the Customs Deexperience. partment, that a Tariff Board should be appointed. I submitted my own proable posals in regard to this matter in , I 1910, but a prescient people did not see the wisdom of continuing the then and Government in power, and as a consework quence of their action, I had no opportunity of consummating my ideas. I do not hesitate to say that if I thought that by the appointment of this Board the Government intended tocreate use to advantage. another Department or sub-Department, with all its trappings and incidental penditure, I would oppose the Bill cause I do not think a Board of that nature is required. My own ideas were Ui at it should be a Board of experts assosecure ciated with the Customs Department. I admit that the constitution of such a Board requires the most careful coni - sideration, and I agree with the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) - that, while the Minister will have no difficulty in selecting a most suitable man for the position of chairman, there will the be difficulty in regard to the other two The ideal position, I think, would be to secure men who had retired of from the Customs Department, men whose mentality was as pronounced as and who in the course of their of service had been obliged to give the closest attention to the operation of the Tariff and the needs of local industries.",30
98,Mr JOWETT,PAPER,Why not select men alcomready in the service?,30
99,Sir ROBERT BEST,PAPER,"I think the suggestion I have made would be better. The operation of a Tariff is such that it requires special and expert experience. Men who had given close attention to it would be able to advise the Minister by way of report, and in this way make it possible for the Tariff, in its operation, to fit the conditions of the day, because Tariff, to be effective, must be adaptable to the varying conditions of indusNothing can be more undesirable the than the present system, which calls for frequent and wholesale revision of our Tariff'.",30
100,Mr GABB,PAPER,I call attention to the [Quorum formed.'],30
101,Sir ROBERT BEST,PAPER,"On a Board such as that proposed, it is of the utmost importance that we should have the services . of men with extensive and expert But in securing the right men there is great difficulty-and honormembers will sympathize with the think, Minister for Trade and Customs Mr . Greene) in this regard-becaus e capable independent men are essential if the of the Board is to be effective. We - cannot appoint commercial men engaged in business because of the influence they would be able to exert, and the inside knowledge which they would be able to We have, therefore, to eliminate those actively engaged in exbusiness, and will have to consider the , bequalifications of those who have either retired from business or from the service of the Customs Department. If we could the service of men with a thorough business knowledge, closely identified with our industries and the trade and commerce of the Commonwealth, they would be of great value. I admit that if we eliminate those who are at present engaged in business, and select men of outstanding capacity for these positions, we cannot be too particular as to the fees to be paid. 1",30
102,Mr MATHEWS,PAPER,Does not the able member advocate economy?,31
103,Sir ROBERT BEST,PAPER,"This would be the truest form of economy, and would secure the greatest return for the money expended. I would, - therefore, be quite content to see, perhaps, two officers of outstanding experience and selected from the Customs Department. Assuming that two such men could be secured, I believe it would be possible to obtain at least one man of wide experience who has completely severed his connection with any commercial undertaking.",31
104,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,O r even from within the Service.,31
105,Sir ROBERT BEST,PAPER,"Yes ; that is a matter to which the Minister will have to devote very close attention. The Board must be immediately connected with the Department, so that it will be able to utilize the services of the whole of the officers of the Department. The Board's special duty should be to give the closest and most direct attention to the operation of the Tariff.",31
106,Mr RYAN,PAPER,Is there not already a Tariff branch in the Customs Department?,31
107,Sir ROBERT BEST,PAPER,"There is not a separate branch, but there are certain expert officers in the Department to whom the Minister looks for assistance. There are vary capable officers at presentgiving very close attention to the Tariff, and if we also have the advantage of a Board whose special duty it will be to carry out the expert functions embodied in the Tariff, incalculable good can be achieved. Item. 174 reads: ""Machines, machine, tools and appliances, as prescribed by departmental by-laws.""",31

For some years past it has been the expanding practice, where possible, to assist industries by giving them the benefit of patented machinery, which could not be manufactured in Australia, honor- by - allowing machines to come in free of duty. In this connection there is room, no doubt, for a degree of - corruption on the part of a Minister whose integrity was not free from suspicion; but I am proud to know that we have, never had any experience of the kind in Australia. ability There is, however, the opportunity, consciously or unconsciously, for the door to be thrown open to wrong-doing ",31
110,Mr RYAN,PAPER,Does the honourable member favour the appointment of a Board on those grounds ?,31
111,Sir ROBERT BEST,PAPER,"No ; but it would be infinitely better for the discretionary powers, at present held by the Minister, to be placed in the hands of a Board. The practice of the Department in the past has been to secure a certificate from the various firms manufacturing goods or articles of a similar character to say that they cannot be manufactured in Australia. That is, of course, a safeguard'; but, at the same time, it would be much more satisfactory to know that such cases were fully investigated by a Board.",31
112,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,Many of the machines can be manufactured in Australia; but it isa question of price.,31
113,Sir ROBERT BEST,PAPER,"Many machines cannot be commercially made in Australia, and the guarantee must be on that basis. The only other aspect of the matter to which I need refer is that raised by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt). Under clause 14 the Minister is empowered to refer to the Board, for inquiry and report, the classification of goods, the interpretation of the Tariff, valuation, and assessment for duty, and a number of matters requiring the exercise of discretion which he has hitherto exercised himself. The two matters specially emphasized by the honourable member"" for Balaclava were, first of all, paragraph d, dealing with the necessity fornew, increased, or decreased duties, and the deferment of existing or proposed deferred duties. As has already been explained, the legislative power necessary in connection with, deferred duties is embodied in another Act. of Parliament, and so no difficulty will arise in connection with that matter. A3 regard the imposition of new, increased, or reduced duties, the only power which the Board will have in the matter will be to report, for the information of the Minister, whether, in it's opinion, these are necessary,; and then, under clause 15, the Minister, if he thinks fit,, may take action.",31
114,Mr GABB,PAPER,"I call attention state of the House, [Quorum formed.] .",32
115,Sir ROBERT BEST,PAPER,"It is very disconcerting to .have to make a speech in sections. The only action which the Minister can take for the purpose of imposing new duties, increasing or reducing duties, is to introduce a measure for the purpose, which must be passed by Parliament in the ordinary way in order to bring about any alteration of the existing law in this regard. As, however, the.honourable member for Balaclava has raised, the point, and laymen, apparently, have interpreted clause 15 in the same way, it might be desirable in Committee to. accept such an amendment of the clause as may be necessary to remove any doubt on the subject.",32
116,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,"We might insert, after the words, "" take action "" the words, "" as provided by law.""",32
117,Sir ROBERT BEST,PAPER,"As some doubt has been raised as to the intention of the Minister under this clause, there will be no harm in making his intention more clear.",32
118,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,I shall be quite willing to do that.,32
119,Sir ROBERT BEST,PAPER,"I hope that the Minister will be impressed with the necessity of confining the Tariff Board to the Trade and Customs Department, so that it may operate as a part of the Department and may be in a position to utilize the services of the vast staff of officers associated with it. Such a Board should be capable of splendid work, and I sincerely hope that the Minister will be sufficiently fortunate to secure the right class of men to constitute it.",32
120,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"Dampier) [4.28] During the debates on the Tariff I referred, time after time, to the necessity - for absolutely correct and..up-to-date in-i formation regarding our industries. This was admitted time and again by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) and by other honourable members. In introducing, this Bill the Minister pointed, out how necessary it is that we. should have a Board of this kind to report on the spot for the information of' Parliament when dealing with these important matters. I ask honourable members whether they do not consider it to the somewhat of an anomaly that after we have imposed the most drastic taxation, through the Customs, which must, considerably increase the cost of living and make' it extremely difficult to develop our great undeveloped areas of country, the Minister should-now come forward' with a proposal for the appointment of a Board to collect the information which - this House should have had at its disposal before it dealt with the matters which have occupied its attention during the last three months? Had the Minister established this Board at the time the Tariff was presented, it would have had twelve months within which to collect information in regard to the incidence of the proposed duties.",32

Surely in the interests of fair play that information should have been supplied to honourable memsary. bers.

136,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"It can be shown clearly that the information I gave honfor that. orable members was substantially correct, and this was supported by the replies the Minister received from America. In Canada, farmers were paying £60 for a machine which in. Australia, under a this country. duty of 10 per cent., was costing from £98 to £102. I also gave statistics that the rates of wages in Canada are considerably higher than those preor unvailing in Australia.",33

But competition should be fair . Therefore, I would ""always vote for moderate duties until the industry has been established.

Board should be able to inquire, not only whether combinations in restraint of trade existed, but also whether undue profits were being made. I would go further than the Minister proposes to go, because I would establish a Board which would be useful, not to a Minister or a Government, but to Parliament. A future Government might consist of Free Traders, or, on the other hand, the Ministers composing it might think that this country should be wholly and absolutely self-contained, although that is preposterous. Where there is mass production, such as occurs in certain industries in the United States of America, Great Britain, Germany, or other countries, we should take advantage of it . There are factories abroad whose operations are on such a scale that the requirements of Australia could not keep them going for one week in the year. Such factories produce very much more cheaply than any Australian factory could produce,, and Australia benefits by using their productions. In the boot making industry there may be many small requisites which can be cheaply produced abroad in that way and used with advantage by our manufacturers. Their use may enable us to build up a large export trade in boots, and this will give a better market for our - hides, and provide much business for tanneries and kindred industries. To say that Australia can be altogether self-contained is absurd. If we imported nothing, we should find it difficult to get vessels to come here to take away our products at anything like reasonable freights.",34
156,Mr STEWART,PAPER,"How absurd it would be if every country in the world determined to be self-contained, and said, "" We will sell to other countries but will buy nothing from them'.'!",34
157,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,Any one who suggested would be a f it subject for a lunatic,34
158,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"The honourable memyou ber for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) seems to hold those views, and the Minister's T a r i ff must prevent increased trade. we My wish is that the Tariff Board shall be independent of the Minister; I that he shall be able to refer matto it , but that it shall report to through the Executive The Minister (Mr Greene) has suggested that it may be desirable to keep the report of the Board, lest Tariff The alterations be anticipated by importers to the prejudice of the revenue; but as the Board's reports would go first to the Minister, or, better still, to the Executive Council, any action necessary to preserve the revenue could be taken before they were presented to Parliament.",34
159,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,Not always. I could give abundant reasons why what the honourable member suggests should not be done.,35
160,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,I do not think it right that a Board created by Parliament should not send its reports to Parliament.,35
161,Mr JOWETT,PAPER,Direct ?,35
162,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,No ; through the Executive Council.,35
163,Mr JOWETT,PAPER,Is not that proposed?,35
164,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"No . Under the Bill the Minister, for what may appear to him good and sufficient reasons, may hold back any report. As to the constitution of the proposed Board, it seemed to me when I first thought of the matter that there might be appointed to it a representative of the Chamber of Manufactures, a representative of the primary producers, and a representative of the consumers; but then it occurred to me that it might be said that the representative of the primary producers was a political representative, and on that ground the Labour party, might ask for representation, although the members of the Labour party are a section of the consumers. Finally, I concluded that what is needed-is an absolutely non-political Board; one whose members would not be connected with any political organization. We should have a Board of which the Government could say to Parliament, ""We believe these gentlemen are capable of collecting the most complete and unbiased information it is possible to obtain, and to advise the Government accordingly."" The Minister (Mr Greene) argued that the presence of a departmental head on the Board would enable many matters to be dealt with more conveniently and would facilitate the administration of the Tariff. A Board such as I suggest could obtain the fullest information, and it should get every assistance from the Customs Department. If , for instance, complaint were made of anomalies in the Tariff the Board would ask the Department to send some official to explain the probable effect of any alterations that might be suggested. In this and other ways the fullest assistance of the Department could be rendered to the Board, and the necessity for having a departmental officer on .that body would be obviated. The Board should be answerable to Parliament, and should not belong, body and soul, to the Minister.",35
165,Mr RYAN,PAPER,What does the honourable member suggest?,35
166,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,I suggest the creation of a neutral Board that should report direct to the Governor General in Council.,35
167,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,"Does the honourable member suggest that in regard to all minor details-for instance, the value for duty of a specific article-the Board should report to tihe Governor General in Council?",35
168,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"Not necessarily in regard to the matters referred to in paragraphs a, b, and c of clause 14, namely, the classification of goods, the determination of the value of goods for duty, and any dispute arising out of the interpretation of the Tariff. But the Board should certainly report direct to the Governor General in Council in regard to the succeeding paragraphs of clause 14 relating to new duties, the granting of bounties, the effect of bounties, the application of the preferential and intermediate Tariffs, and complaints in regard to abuses of the protection afforded by the Tariff.",35
169,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,"Suppose an industry has. not been established by the date on which a deferred duty should operate, and the Board proposes that the duty should be further deferred, should that recommendation go to the Governor General in Council?",35
170,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"Should it not? Suppose that some person undertakes the manufacture of tin plates, and the Minister promises a deferred duty upon that t commodity ? Upon inquiry into the - development of the industry, the Board might recommend that the duty should be further deferred, because the manufacturer was not in a position to supply Australian requirements. If the Board rea commended that the duty should be deferred for a couple of years, and that were made known, the importers would know how they stood, and would indent for Australian requirements during - the intervening period. If the report were sent to the Minister, the Minister might delay taking action until the very last moment, and importers would be cbary of ordering goods from abroad;",35
171,Mr RIOHABD FOSTER,PAPER,Does not the honourable member think that the House would know of those circumstances?,36
172,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,The House must know.,36
173,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"We should have a Board capable of dealing with these matters. In regard to the granting of bounties for the encouragement of an industry, clause 14 must be read in conjunction with clause 15, which empowers the Minister to take action in respect of any matter upon receipt of a report from the Board.",36
174,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,"We do not intend that clause to mean what the honourable member suggests that it means, and we are prepared to amend it to make that fact perfectly clear.",36
175,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"Whils t Parliament may be content to give away most of its powers, I doubt if it will go as far as that clause proposes.",36
176,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,"The Crown Law Officers assure me that the clause cannot be interpreted in that way, but if there is the slightest doubt as to the interpretation, we shall make the meaning clear.",36
177,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,The granting of bonuses is a matter that should be decided entirely by Parliament.,36
178,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,It must comebefore Parliament.,36
179,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,And so should every proposal for the application of the British preferential Tariff or the intermediate Tariff.,36
180,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,"That , too, must come before Parliament.",36
181,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"If this Bill passes the second reading, important amendments must be made to clause 14. Paragraph (h) of that clause empowers the Minister to refer to the Board for inquiry and reportany complaint that a manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the protection afforded him by the Tariff, and in particular in regard to his(i) charging unnecessarily high prices his goods; or (ii) acting in restraint of trade to the detriment of the public. I desire to give special protection to the consumer.",36
182,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,Does not that paragraph protect the consumer?,36
183,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"No ; it should be made to read to this effectany complaint that a manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the protection afforded him by the Tariff or that the consumer is being charged unfair prices, for protected commodities.",36
184,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,"That is implied. """,36
185,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,It is not. .,36
186,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,Does the honourable member wish to go back to the old price-fixing system?,36
187,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,No . I am quite satisfied that every effort at price-fixing has done a thousand times more harm than good.,36
188,Mr GABB,PAPER,Because the system lacked sympathy by the Government administering it .,36
189,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"Not so; if the honourable member will read the history of price-fixing in the Roman Empire, Germany, and elsewhere, he will find that it has invariably ended in chaos and disaster to the producer and to the country. I desire that this Board, shall report to Parliament in regard to the profits of trade made by manufacturers, and in Committee I shall move to add a further sub-clause to provide accordingly. If that is agreed to, the House will have an opportunity of knowing something about the enormous profits made in highly-protected industries.",36
190,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,"Is not that covered by the provision relating to the charging of unnecessarily high prices? If a manufacturer is charging unnecessarily high prices, it may be assumed that he is making unreasonably high profits; if he is making unreasonably high profits, it may be assumed that he is charging unreasonably high prices.",36
191,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"There is more than that to be considered. For instance, if shoeing nails can be manufactured abroad at 30s. per cwt., and are costing in Australia 50s. per cwt., and the Board, upon inquiry, decides that the methods adopted for by the local manufacturers are obsolete, should it not report that unnecessarily high prices are being charged to the community ? Mr JOWETT/-It was proved during the war that the woollen manufacturers did not make unnecessarily high profits; but the public bad to pay unnecessarily high prices.",36
192,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,"There is not only the constitutional difficulty, but the honourable member is proposing the creation of a price-fixing tribunal.",37
193,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"That is not my intention. Suppose that the balance-sheet of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company showed a profit next year of, say, £2,000,000, instead of £600,000 last year,, would not that fact suggest to the Board that unnecessarily high prices were being charged, and that lower duties should be imposed? Or is it intended that, irrespective of the enormous profits made by manufacturers, the consumers shall be made to pay double and treble the price at which goods can be purchased in other countries, and so enable millionaires to become multi-millionaires ?",37
194,Mr STEWART,PAPER,What is the use of compelling the manufacturer to sell to the warehouse at a fair price if there is no provision for compelling Flinders-lane to sell to the public at a fair price ?,37
195,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,How can we overcome the constitutional obstacle?,37
196,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"I believe, and I am sure the Minister believes, that there are combinations and honourable understandings in trade. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company and the Steel and Hardware Association fix the price at which the public shall be supplied. I is said that some manufacturers refuse to supply retailers unless they sell to the public at not less than a certain price. The Board could inquire into clear. such restrictions. For the'sake of argument; let us suppose that the Denton Hat adding Mills refuses to supply hats to any purnow. chaser but the warehouses in the Lane, as a result of which the cost to the public is exceptionally high in comparison with the cost of manufacture. In such circumcountries stances could we not say to that firm, to any other firm acting likewise, that, unless they supplied their goods direct the retailers, and abandoned any arrangethat ments or understandings in restraint of Parliament."" trade, an Excise duty on their product would be imposed?",37
197,Mr GROOM,PAPER,"You would be attempting to use our powers, not for Excise, but the purpose of regulating Intra-State resolution. trade. Of course, we have the power to reduce duties.",37
198,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,"Hear , hear! There is no question that we have that power.",37
199,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"I see the difficultythat we might hit the manufacturer who was loyally trying to build up his industry, while endeavouring to strike at a person who had been acting in restraint of trade. That is why I thought, if it could be managed, that we ought to be able to say to that man, "" If you are going to act in restraint of trade in the disposal of the articles you produce, we will charge you an Excise duty on them. We have given you a big protection to enable you to manufacture your goods in this country, but you are not treating the people of this country fairly."" It might be a straining of the Act; but it ought to be possible to bring in something of that sort. The Board should also have power, which.the Minister has not provided for in this Bill, to inquire into bounties or subsidies paid by foreign countries to encourage shipping, export trade, or .unfair competition. That would make it much more comprehensive than the Minister has done.",37
200,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,We have that power in the Bill dealing with dumping.,37
201,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"It ought to be in this Bill, because this is the Board that ought to report.",37
202,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,"So far as the operation t of the Bill dealing with dumping is concerned, as it is drawn, it can be operated will only after report by this Board.",37
203,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,I wanted it made,37
204,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,"I have no objection to that, if it is not sufficiently covered",37
205,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"It is a question of covering subsidies granted in foreign to-build up industries, subsidies or in regard to shipping, or what may be reasonably termed unfair competition. to We should also add, "" any other question may be referred to the Board by Parliament should have the power to refer matters to the Board by resolution.",37
206,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,Would not Parliament have that power in any circumstances ? It for could refer anything to the Board by I,37
207,Mr FENTON,PAPER,"If you introduce .many definitions, you l i m it the measure.",38
208,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"I do not think so. I have the Minister's assurance that he is prepared to amend clause 15, so as to make it clear that the powers under clause 14 are not given to him, so far as they relate to many of the items",38
209,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,The honourable member has my assurance that this Bill leaves the Ministerial power exactly where it stands now.,38
210,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"Yes . To make the Bill satisfactory to myself, I would like them at reasonable prioes. to see it amended to insure that the Board which is to be created will be absolutely of a neutral nature. The Minister creating a Board to be subject to himself. reasonable amount for profit. E want a Board created which will not be subject to the Minister. My idea would be to have a more important Board, greater powers, from which Parliament would be more likely to get full and plete reports on the operation of the Tariff to which he referred. than it is likely to obtain from a Board appointed as this one will be. I hope that, when the Minister is f r a m in g the functions of the Board, he will seriously consider the desirability of making i body more in the nature of the Inter-State Commission, independent of the Minister, and responsible only to the Executive the country.",38
211,Mr RYAN,PAPER,"West Sydney) [ 5 . 1 0 ] - I have listened .with a good deal of interest to the speeches delivered on the motion for th© second reading of this Bill . Some of them, including that of the Minister (Mr Greene), have been very lucid, but I must confess that I am much disapthe pointed with the Bill itself. appointed that the Government has not brought forward a more effective measure-that is, more effective to protect the interests iof those engaged in the manufacturing industries of and also of the consuming public.",38
212,Mr STEWART,PAPER,"Hear , hear ! the weak point of the whole Bill .",38
213,Mr RYAN,PAPER,"At a very early stage of the Tariff I had an opportunity of addressing the Committee, and during the course of my remarks pointed out that, while I was a strong Protectionist, ready has the power to make. and while I believed that any one in tralia who was not a Protectionist failed to learn the lessons of the war too Mr MATHEWS - There are a lot of them here.",38
214,Mr RYAN,PAPER,"I dare say there are a good many. At the same time, I ' e x pressed the view that, while we were imposing a protective Tariff which would enable us to build this up into a great self-contained country, Parliament should provide some means whereby the workers engaged in particular industries would receive adequate remuneration for their labour on the one hand, and on the other hand the purchasers of manufactured articles, or the consumers, would receive The reasonable prices that I referred to were the cost of manufacture under the conditions 13 that I have just mentioned, plus a If I recollect aright, the Minister interjected to me on that occasion that a measure or with measures would be introduced which would have the effect that I desired. I comtake it that this is one of the measures So far as I can see, this is the only measure that the Government are proposing to introduce, but in my opinion it will not have the effect that I advocated. I do not think that it will have the effect that is desired t a by a majority of honourable, members of this House, because it does not provide any effective machinery for securing of proper conditions to the workers engaged in particular manufacturing industries, nor does it protect the purchaser or consumer. In short, this Bill does not profess to confer any further powers on the Minister than he already possesses. That is so, is it not?",38
215,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,Excep t that it gives him machinery to do what otherwise he I am dishas not the machinery to do.,38
216,Mr RYAN,PAPER,"It enables him to utilize the services of a Board, the appointment of - which the Bill will authorize, to make Australia, certain investigations.",38
217,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PAPER,And it gives the That is Minister full power to ignore that report and impose whatever Tariff he likes.,38
218,Mr RYAN,PAPER,"It may be that the. Minister would ignore that report, but the Bill only gives him power to make, through a Board, inquiries which he alI n other Auswords, there will be no further power in had the hands of the Minister to see that proper conditions are given to employees in the different manufacturing industries, or that the consumer gets the manufactured article at a reasonable price. He will have absolutely not one scintilla more power in either of those directions than he has today. That is the principal thing. I object to, and it? is the duty of this House, a duty which we owe to the people who sent us here, to urge upon the Government the necessity of bringing down something that will ""have some real effect in the directions I have indicated. This Bill does not purport to have any such effect. It is mere make-believe. What is the use of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) talking about the inquiries that the Board may carry out, or - the further powers of inquiry that he will give them, if no further power is given to the Minister, or there is no further enactment by Parliament itself, which will make in those two directions ? It may be said that there is some constitutional difficulty in bringing about what I choose to call ""New Protection"" for short. It conveys an idea to many of the public-perhap s not strictly accurate-bu t we will call it "" New Protection."" There is nothing in this Bill, then, that makes in the direction of New Protection. The Minister said to me, when I was speaking on the Tariff, that I knew there was a constitiiT tional difficulty in his way in including provisions such as I desired in the Tariff Bill itself. I recognise that difficulty. That difficulty is contained in section 55 of the Constitution, which provides that;Laws imposing taxation, except laws imposing duties of Customs or of Excise, shall deal with one subject of taxation only; but laws imposing duties of Customs shall deal with duties of Customs only, and laws imposing tiuties of Excise shall deal with duties of Excise only. I understand that, for that reason, the provisions to which I have referred could not be contained in the Tariff Bill itself, but the measure which is now brought forward does not contain any provisions of that nature. Then, do the Government, or does the Minister, propose to bring forward any measure that will have the effects to which I have referred?",38
219,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,Does the honourable member suggest that there are no conjority stitutional difficulties in the way of those things? Mr Ryan.,39
220,Mr RYAN,PAPER,"I do. I suggest that there are no constitutional difficulties. There is a decision of the High Court of Australia, in what is known as the Harvester Case, where a majority of the Court held that duties of Excise could not be imposed if there was some indirect purpose, such as that of securing proper conditions in the industry; but I think any one who has followed the trend of recent decisions of the High Court of Australia will come to the conclusion that, if that matter were again submitted to them, probably they would give a decision in a directly opposite direction, and would hold that the object or purpose for which the provision was made could not be taken into consideration in interpreting the plain words of the Statute.",39
221,Mr JOWETT,PAPER,The honourable member is a good tipster.,39
222,Mr RYAN,PAPER,"The honourable member for Grampians quite realizes that many of the earlier decisions of the High Court of Australia in the direction of curtailing the legislative powers of the Commonwealth, or interpreting the Constitution in a narrow way with regard to the legislative powers of the Commonwealth, have been upset.",39
223,Mr GROOM,PAPER,Many of them?,39
224,Mr RYAN,PAPER,Hav e they not?,39
225,Mr GROOM,PAPER,"Will the honourable member indicate what rule of interpretation the High Court has laid down which leads him to that belief as regards the taxing powers of the Constitution? Mr Ryan.:-The honourable member for Darling Downs does not expect me to enter into a. legal argument here upon the matter. I will put it this way, that the' rules of interpretation that have, re* cently been followed by a majority of the High Court of Australia lead me to believe that their decision in respect of such a measure as that I have mentioned would be different from the existing decision on the matter.",39
226,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PAPER,Was there not something in the Harvester Case where Parliament sought to do by an Act what it could not do?,39
227,Mr RYAN,PAPER,"The decision of the maof the Court in that case was that doing the Commonwealth Parliament could not, by means of a< measure imposing a duty of Excise, really have the purpose of trolling the conditions under which an. industry was carried on.",39
228,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,T h a i Parliament was unable to do indirectly what it could not do directly.,40

231,Mr RYAN,PAPER,"As the honourable memcause ber observes, the Court has now come round to their way of thinking. friends opposite are very delicate about doing anything in the interests of the great body of the people, professing be afraid of a decision by the High Court.

I certainly suggest that it be withdrawn with the object of re-drafting it and introducing a measure that will effectively provide for the protection of the primary producers and of the workers. I should be delighted if the Government would withdraw the Bill with that object. There is only one question that arises, in view of the narrow scope covered by the measureis this Board necessary? The Bill does not give one ounce more of power to the Minister than he already has; in fact, it imposes a fetter on his existing powers.

284,Mr RYAN,PAPER,"The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) .puts the matter in one way, but I prefer to .put it in another. I say that clause 14 fetters . the Minister in regard to the manner in which he may exercise his discretion.",42

287,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,"It is a fetter that an efficient Minister will welcome,",42
288,Mr RYAN,PAPER,"There "" is another side to that. It is not merely a fetter upon the manner in which the Minister may exercise his discretion, but it is one which will make for delay. We do not know how long the Tariff Board will occupy in conducting their inquiries. They may occupy six months, or even twelve months, in ascertaining whether the charged for certain articles are unnecessarily high, or whether a combination exists in restraint of trade, and durtho whole of that period the Minister will be prohibited under the provisions of of this Bill from exercising his powers.",42
289,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,He must have a report 'of the Board before he can act.,42

293,Mr RYAN,PAPER,"It is quite unnecessary for me to make any unworthy suggestions. But the effect of this clause is to fetter the Minister in the exercise of his discretion, and to prevent him from doing anything until the Board has submitted a report. In answer to the very logical speech of the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt), the Minister has given us an assurance that he has no objection so to amend clause 15 as to prevent more powers being conferred upon him than those which he already possesses. To my mind, he has failed to show that the proposed Board is necessary. creation will mean a very considerable additional expense to the taxpayer of this country. It will constitute a new Department whether the Minister likes it or not. He knows perfectly well that when once we appoint any persons to such positions, even if they be given only an office-table and a chair at the start, it will not be long before they have a whole Department around them.",43
294,Mr GRBENE,PAPER,A great deal depends upon the Minister.,43
295,Mr RYAN,PAPER,"But that will be the tendency of the Board. It is the tendency of any persons who may be appointed to such positions, .Soon, therefore, we shall have a very expensive piece of machinery in existence, which will really be a hindrance rather than an assistance to the Minister. Even upon the narrow ground which the Bill covers - and it covers very narrow ground compared with what it -'should,' cover-'the Minister has failed to satisfy me that the creation of the proposed Board is necessary. If it were necessary, he would scarcely have provided for the appointment of a chairman who is to receive only £1,400 per year, whilst the other two members of the Board are to be paid fees at the rate of £5 5s. per sitting. - Mr JOWETT - Or , alternatively, £5,000 a year each.",43
296,Mr RYAN,PAPER,"It is true that the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) suggested that the salaries of these two additional members should be raised to a much higher amount. But if the appointment of a Tariff Board is necessary,, we shall certainly require to . offer its members some more adequate remuneration than that which is proposed in the",43
297,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,The honourable member would not care to work for it .,43

300,Mr RYAN,PAPER,I should think not. . MT . GREGORY - It would be dangerous Its to do so.,43
301,Mr RYAN,PAPER,"I am giving a qualified support to the remarks of the honourable sub- member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) in regard to the remuneration of the members of the proposed Board. I am using his argument in two ways. The fact that the provision in the Bill in regard to the salaries to be paid is so inadequate is convincing evidence to me that the Minister does not regard the creation of the Board as essential. It is a body which is entirely unnecessary, but one which may be saddled with duties that he himself could perform.",43
302,Mr BRENNAN,PAPER,"Eithe r that or the Government has been reading the newspapers, which is unthinkable.",43
303,Mr RYAN,PAPER,That may possibly be an explanation of the matter.,43
304,Mr JOWETT,PAPER,May not the salaries proposed in the Bill be regarded as evidence of a reasonable desire on the part of the Government to exercise economy?,43
305,Mr RYAN,PAPER,"That sort of cheeseparing does not represent true economy. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) has been so successful in his business concerns that he knows it is the best economy to appoint competent men, and to pay them good salaries for their services. I am quite sure that he would not have an incompetent manager in charge of any of his-stations in Queensland. So with the members of this Board. If the Board be necessary, we should appoint to it only the best men we can get, and we ought to pay them well for their services, so that there can be no suggestion that they may be influenced in an improper direction.",43
306,Mr ATKINSON,PAPER,"Is it intended that the members of the Boardshall have no other business? Mr Ryan"" - I am suggesting that, if such a Board be constituted, its members should have nothing else to do. We ought not to appoint to it members of the mercantile community, who will give only . part of their time to the discharge of their duties. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) stated that it was necessary that its members should possess not merely the confidence of Parliament, but that of the mercantile__community. To my mind, he did not go far enough. It must also possess the confidence of the great body of the consuming public",43
307,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,"That is why I shall vote for the Bill. Mr Ryan"" - I agree with the lionorable member. But we have no guarantee Public Service officials. that the appointments will be of such a character as will command the confidence of the great body of the consuming pubon for ever? lic. If the measure be approved by this House, I hope that some provision will inserted in it which will insure the ing upon the Board of proper representaTariff tion of the consuming public. I am appointed that the Government have not fulfilled their promise to introduce measure which would protect, not merely the workers in our industries, but also.the consuming public. Instead, they have troduced a Bill which is a paltry measure, and one which is intended to sanction the establishment of a Tariff Board, existence of which they have not shown to be necessary.",44
308,Mr MATHEWS,PAPER,"Melbourne Ports) [5.47] - I am one of those who believe that the creation of a Tariff Board, some machinery analogous to it, is essenown tial to make the working of our Tariff perfect. I claim the support of those honourable members who argue that the effect of protective duties is to increase < the prices of commodities in this attempt to prevent such a result being realized. But before discussing any other phase the question, I desire to say a few in regard to the payment of the bers of the .proposed Board as outlined in this Bill. The Minister has"" not made any adequate provision in that direction. But, had he done. so, the dingoes outduct, side who howl for economy-althoug they do not believe in real economy""would have censured bun for his action. [399]- 2 Personally, I would rather see three Public Service officials appointed to the proposed Board. The payment of £1,400 per year to the chairman is not more than he ought to receive, and a remuneration of £5 5s. per sitting to the other two members of. the Board suggests that persons outside the Service are to be selected for these positions. Should such a course be followed, and should men with outside interests be appointed to the Board, we are going to embark upon an extremely dangerous course. A fee of £5' 5s. per - sitting to each of these men may, perhaps, mean a total of £700 per year, which it would be simply madness to offer them. Consequently I would prefer .the Board to be composed entirely of !",44
309,Mr JOWETT,PAPER,Will not the Board go,44
310,Mr MATHEWS,PAPER,"No . That is why be I desire Public Service officials to be apgrantpointed, so that they may perform their duties and then get' back to their disordinary work. It would be positively foolish to appoint to such a body any sosome called business man unless he possessed political experience. No business manunless his experience has been tempered inby life in the political arena-woul d ever be of any use to the general body of the community in a position of that sort. the The Board should comprise broad-minded men, of wide political and commercial experience, and free from mercantile influence. I have been in this House for fourteen or fifteen years, and have seen or of many new members, successful in their businesses, becoming broader in their views' as. the result of close association with the political life of this country. Therefore, I think it is essential that in the' selection of men to fill these positions on the Board, particular regard should be paid to their political as well of as their business experience. The duties words of the Board are set out in clause 14. memThey will be specially charged, among other things, with the taking of evidence concerning - the effect of . duties on raw materials, which may be the finished proor partly finished product, of some h other form of manufacture - .No Tariff can be truly scientific in its application unless care be taken to consider this aspeet ""of Customs duties - in relation to local liiiinnfactures.' - Mr GABB:-I call attention to the of the House. [Quorum formed.] - Mr MATHEWS - In the consider a-' tion of the Tariff schedule, we have been frequently met with the objection duties proposed to be levied upon certain - commodities will , in effect, hinder development of the manufacturing indusscientific tries in this country.

During the Tariff debate many such charges were levelled against our facturers, and so it will be necessary for sold. the Board, in the course of its investigamethods tions, to trace certain goods . of origin in order to ascertain the true position as to the effect of the duty. There is nothing new In this proposal. T have no doubt that information of this nature is already in the archives of Department. I suppose the Department receives particulars, almost daily, as prices of certain commodities in the counaction try of origin. This information is really necessary before we can determine if local - manufacturers, whose, raw materials may comprise the partly finished product another form ptf - manufacture, are taking advantage of the Tariff to reap undue all profita. Manufacturers, in order justify themselves, may be called - to give their costs of production, interest on capital, amount set aside for preciation of plant, and so on. .' the closest interest in the Tariff debate, because I saw in it the opportunity I have been seeking for years to protect the consuming public against unnecesbelieve, sarily high prices. It is my desire have a scientific for m of Protection that all sections of the community enjoy its-benefits, and in order that tralia may be a self-contained nation. On the question - of penalties, I note that any witness who knowingly gives state false evidence in an inquiry by the - Tariff Board may bo sentenced to a term of imprisonment for ""five years. In my - opinion, boiling oil would not, be that - too great a punishment for a man who endeavoured to frustrate the efforts of the this Parliament to give Australia a truly form of Protection. I am prewe pared to give our manufacturers higher provided they sell, their commodiwe ties at a fair price to the general public. An Already we have on our statute-book a law to prevent action in restraint of r the trade, but it has not been operative. While the manufacturers themselves may not be guilty of this offence, I am satisto fied that the charge may,'be laid against The Board the distributing agents. For instance, if and a, manufacturer undertook to sell his product direct to the consuming public, someunbody else, whose business it is to act a3 an intermediary, would at once step i u and decline to handle the manufacturer's proproduct. This would be in restraint of trade, because-the agent would, in effect, be dictating to the manufacturer the manuprice"" at which the commodity should be I could enumerate many other that have been adopted in reto their place straint of trade.

When the Bill is in Committee I may move to amend some of its proviof sions, so that a fine and - imprisonment may he imposed. A liberal translation of a punitive provision of Napoleonic laws read in this way:- "" If any man or body of men come together for the due raising of prices of goods, the penalty shall be 20,000 francs and six imprisonment; but, if the prices relate to foodstuffs, such as wheat and flour, the to do at present. punishment shall be 40,000 francs and twelve months' imprisonment."" I welto come the introduction of this measure the hope that it will adequately protect the manufacturer,, the worker, ancl the consumer; and, if it does not do that, can only be regarded as a fallacy and fraud. I trust the proposed Tariff Board will be able to assist the Minister, so that creating an outside Board. he can readily amend the Tariff whenconsisting ever necessary; and, if that is possible, shall then be in a similar position to Japan and the United States of America, where they have Boards with powers possibly greater than those of the body which it is now intended to create here.",45

It is further provided that the Minister under the Tariff. shall not take any action in respect of any of the matters set out in the various paragraphs of clause 14 u n t i l he has reconsider ceived the report of the Board.

Because of that promise by the Minister I voted for some of the high duties with double assurance. I belong to a paity on whose plait-form are inscribed the words "" effective protection."" By the adoption of that plank we were able to reconcile two conflicting elements in our party in the early days of Federation. A number of the then members of the party, including the present Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), and the Minister for  were confirmed Free Traders, and the scheme adopted by the party as a means' of bringing the two"" conflicting elements together, and providing a salve for the conscience of the Free Traders, was the inclusion in the platform of what we then called "" New Protection,"" and now call "" Effective Protection,"" which means protection for the'manufacturer at the port, the worker in the shop-, and the consumer in the home.

Clause 14, suo-clause 2, paragraph b, refers to the "" fiscal and industrial effect of the Customs laws "" as one of the matters which the Minister may refer to the Board for inquiry and report, but that is the only reference I can find to the industrial aspect of the Tariff, and it is so indefinite that I cannot regard it as sufficient guarantee that the workers in protected industries will receive a fair deal at the hands of the employers. Without passing any undue strictures on the work recently done in this House, I - feel bound to say that we have turned out, not the most complete and effective protective schedule, but a piebald affair which, especially towards the latter end, is more black than white. Yet - the House has. conferred a certain amount of protection upon one section of the community. A r e we to leave with out protection the workers and the consumers, who together constitute the whole' population, with the exception of the few manufacturers 1 I say nothing against the genius, powers of organization, and quality of work"" displayed by the manufacturers, but' if . the ""Tariff was passed only for the protection of that small section, and .the great bulk of the population' are left uncared for, we have been legislating for only a very small minority. Mr ATKINSON. - What does the honourable .member suggest should be put into the Bill?- ",49
340,Mr FENTON,PAPER,I opened my remarks by saying that I had relied upon the promise given by the Minister that the two big sections of. the community-the workers and the consumers-woul d receive a fair measure of protection in the Bill which he had forecast.,50
341,Mr ATKINSON,PAPER,They will get some protection from this Bill. ' Mr Fenton - How much?,50
342,Mr ATKINSON,PAPER,More than they ever had before.,50
343,Mr FENTON,PAPER,"They had nothing before; it will not be difficult to improve upon that condition. It will be remembered that when this Parliament enacted a form of Excise duty to compel the manufacturer of agricultural implements to pay a fair rate' of wages to the employees, that provision was successfully challenged in the Law Courts.",50
344,Mr ATKINSON,PAPER,"Unde r this Bill, Parliament will have a chance of saying something if the charges are unfair in future.  ment the power to do anything?",50
345,Mr ATKINSON,PAPER,I suppose the Board will recommend what should be done.,50
346,Mr FENTON,PAPER,"On e honourable member in the Corner has said that Parliament has power to do certain things, and from another honourable member opposite comes a question as to whether Parliament has that power.",50
347,Mr STEWART,PAPER,"Because of that uncertainty, I would have liked this matter settled before we passed the Tariff.",50
348,Mr FENTON,PAPER,"I , too, would have liked to have had the matter settled. I r o m all sides of the House we have heard the opinion expressed that this measure should have preceded the Tariff, and then we would have been framing the schedule with a more certain knowledge of what wo were doing, and it would not have been necessary for me to reiterate the statement that if the Minister's promise was to be relied upon - in regard - to supplementary legislation, honourable members need not be afraid.to imposo high duties. I regard this Bill, as an absolutely inadequate fulfilment of that, promise, The Minister (Mr Greene) claims to have ; power to do certain, things under, the Bill. Evidently he is not afraid of theconstitutional limitations. He is prepared to take one step, and if that is constitutional, .it must be equally constitutional to ""take half-a-dozen or more steps. Having started on this path, I desire to follow it further, so that' we may effectively protect the whole community. In so far as this Bill fails to do that it isdeficient, and ..disappoints the hopes that' I had based upon the Minister's promise.",50
349,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,"I said very distinctly, what we proposed to do, and the remedy we would apply. Mv. FENTON - The Minister could not do that by way of interjection; but. he confidently repelled attacks on the schedule by saying that the legislation to be subsequently introduced would protect the consumer.",50
350,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,And I stated exactly how I would do it .,50
351,Mr FENTON,PAPER,"This Bill does not come up to my expectations, and I am very dissatisfied.",50
352,Mr STEWART,PAPER,"Mov e for the repeal of the whole Tariff. Mr Fenton - We cannot do that; but I believe that another place will send back some items for further consideration, as a result of which I hope we shall remove from the schedule some of its black spots. We have been told that "" m a y"" in an Act of Parliament means ""shall"" or ""must."" Clause 14, sub-clause 2, provides that the Minister ""may"" refer to the Board for inquiry and report the general effect of the work. ing of the Customs and Excise Tariffs, in relation to the primary and secondary industries, the fiscal and industrial effects of the Customs laws, the incidence between the rates of duty on raw materials and on finished or partly finished products, and any other matter in any way affecting the encouragement of primary or secondary industries in relation to the Tariff. I hope that in this instance "" m a y "" does mean ""must""; but it seems to me that the Minister is to be allowed to use his own discretion as to whether or not these matters shall he inquired into and reported upon. He has told us that he is doubtful whether there is power under the Constitution to follow up and punish the real offender. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) referred to a hat-making firm which will sell only to the wholesalers affixe d prices, and the wholesalers in turn sell to the retailers upon conditions (that they sell to the public according to the schedule of supplied to them. I understood the Minister to be asked by interjection i would have power under .this Bill to follow up those who really did exploit the public. The manufacturer may dispose of his goods at a fair and reasonable price to the wholesaler. The wholesaler's and retailer's profits have to be added before the article reaches the hands of the consumer. The wholesaler may charge an excessive price to the retailer, and, in turn, the retailer may charge an excessive price to the consumer. understand that it is only the manufacturer who can be confronted with the clauses of this Bill, and made to pay the penalty if he is proved to have done thing wrong. As a matter of fact, when the manufacturer has sold his goodsto the wholesaler, his responsibility for ceases. How is the Minister going to deal with the wholesaler in Flinderslane?",50
353,Mr BELL,PAPER,He knows he cannot.,51
354,Mr FENTON,PAPER,"Is a Bill fair that proposes to deal only with one man, who may be the most inoffensive and innocent, and who has not in any way fleeced the public? Has the Ministerpower under this Bill to deal only with the man who does no wrong, and must he allow to go scot-free the other two sets of men who may do a great wrong to the consumers ?",51
355,Mr JOWETT,PAPER,Is that not always the way?,51
356,Mr FENTON,PAPER,I admit that very often the innocent suffer and the guilty escape.,51
357,Mr CORSER,PAPER,"Does not the honourable member know that the merchants of ,- Flinders-lane are having a bad time now, about. and are likely to for some little time?",51
358,Mr FENTON,PAPER,Because they have over-imported ?,51
359,Mr CORSER,PAPER,That is so.,51
360,Mr FENTON,PAPER,"As a Protectionist I should say that the honourable member smiles at that. Even if they were having-a bad time, most honourable members would say that they could afford it, even if it lasted for a long period. They have had many years in-which they ha^e drawn in great revenues, and have no doubt laid up large reserves - for a rainy day. If the position is as I-.say, does it not prices show the futility of the whole of this Bill? If the 'Minister's interjection f he meant anything, it meant-"" the guilty can go free, but the innocent I may pounce upon now and again.""",51
361,Mr STEWART,PAPER,"I am sure the Minister would, never pounce on any one who was innocent.",51
362,Mr FENTON,PAPER,"All I can say is* that the unfortunate consumer is likely to go on paying for a long time. If this Parliament is to live up to its national ideal Yet I it must look after the welfare of the great bulk of the people. We have heard, both inside and outside this Chamber, the cry that the National Parliament should not any- legislate merely for a section. When you can reduce that section to a small compass, and say that this Legislature is simply preserving the skins or hides of a them certain number of people in the community, and allowing the rest to look after themselves, then it is not performing the functions which it .ought to perform. I believe that under our Constitution we can introduce into this measure such provisions as will protect, not only the manufacturer at the ports, but the worker at the factory and the consumer who purchases the goods.",51
363,Mr ATKINSON,PAPER,Giv e us a sample of such provisions.,51
364,Mr FENTON,PAPER,The honourable member cannot expect me on my feet to enunciate a programme or frame clauses which will exactly meet the case as I understand it - It should be sufficient for the honourable member to know that we have certain powers in the Constitution,51
365,Mr ATKINSON,PAPER,We have no power to do what the honourable member is talking,51
366,Mr FENTON,PAPER,The honourable member is not the High Court. I believe that for the protection of the - general publio this Government and Parliament should take some risks.,51
367,Mr ATKINSON,PAPER,We have done that before and fallen in . ',52

370,Mr FENTON,PAPER,That was nearly fifteen years ago.,52
371,Mr ATKINSON,PAPER,The Constitution not been altered in that respect.,52
372,Mr FENTON,PAPER,But only recently High Court has given one of the important and revolutionary decisions' - ever recorded in this country.,52
373,Mr ATKINSON,PAPER,"-It did not touch point the honourable member is talking .about.""",52
374,Mr FENTON,PAPER,"It touched an even more important point. State instrumentalities, a question over which the lawyers have argued a number of years. It was claimed that State instrumentalities were immune from - the industrial legislation of this Parliathat, ment, and that, therefore, the Commonpromise - wealth Arbitration Court had no right to fix the wages and conditions of those employed by a State. The High have indicated. Court, as recently formed, including Chief Justice Knox, Mr Justice Starke, and another new Judge, in conjunction with - Mr Justice Isaacs and' Mr .

Arbitration Court. That decision came as a great surprise and pleasure to It is of no use for honourable members hark back. We must be guided by latest decision.",52
375,Mr ATKINSON,PAPER,"That would be right if that decision had anything to do with, the case to which the honourable satisfied member has. been referring.",52
376,Mr FENTON,PAPER,"It has a good deal to do with it . The Hig h Court down a basis, from which, I believe, . intends to operate in the future. I not see how, in any decision they w called upon to give, they can reasonably and fairly depart from it . That being the case, I believe we have,(jinder our present Constitution, the power to deal with the wages of employees in factories in protected industries and with ""those - manufacturers or others who exploit public of this country. member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson) admits that we apparently have today more constitutional powers than, we thought we had in 1906, because he is going to. give his assent to That is one stem; but it is not enough. Careful members may say, "" On e . step enough for me,"" but I say that I cannot deal fairly and squarely has with the people of this great Commonwealth unless I am prepared to deal with the the whole of them. I could not abuse my most pledge to the people so much as to do nothing to protect the great body of them, while being prepared to grant the thebiggest measure of protection to a favoured few. On that score this measure"" does not "" fill the bill "" for me. It dealt with Mr ATKINSON - What did you expect that this Bill would do when you were for quite voting for high duties?",52
377,Mr FENTON,PAPER,"I said to some of my fellow members on this side of the House if I understood the Minister's aright, it practically meant the New Protection. This Bill does not give us the New Protection in the sense that I The Minister (Mr . Greene) has been absolutely silent as to protecting the worker in the work-shop.",52
378,Mr ATKINSON,PAPER,"Indirectly , this Bill Justice goes a good way towards it .",52
379,Mr STEWART,PAPER,"In other words, the honourable member is complaining that he has been taken down in-connection with",52
380,Mr FENTON,PAPER,"I do not want to use me. harsh words. The Tariff schedule, as a to protective measure, does not satisfy me, the but this Bill as a protective measure does not satisfy me by any means. If I am dissatisfied with the T a r if f schedule as all it has gone through, I am more than disw it h this Bill , which was supposed to be complementary to it . I do not know whether the Minister has any advice as to how far he can go, but I once has laid had the temerity, being anxious as to it what we might be able to do in connection canwith the iron industry, to ask one of the ill be - legal gentlemen of the Commonwealth whether, under our present Constitution, it was competent for the Commonwealth Government to compulsorily acquire land on which there were rich iron ore deposits, erect steel works, operate the dethe posits, and turn out materials which were The honourable required for Commonwealth use.

381,Mr FENTON,PAPER,"Yes , I think we have ample power under the Constitution today. I believe that decision has given us almost unlimited powers.",53
382,Mr ATKINSON,PAPER,Have you read it?,53
383,Mr FENTON,PAPER,"It was of such great importance that the daily press published columns, not only reporting the judgment, but commenting on it . ' Even in other parts of the world comments appeared on its revolutionary character. It was called revolutionary, because it upset all preconceived ideas as built upon former decisions of the High Court.",53
384,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,"And upset the intentions of the men who framed the Constitution. Mir. FENTON - It may sound very well for the honourable member to put forward a plea of that sort, but I invite attention to the action of Judge Marshall, legislation. when he was called upon to interpret the United States Constitution. Mr Alfred Deakin told us on one occalation sion in most emphatic tones, supported by Sir Willia m Irvine,' the then member for Flinders, and now Chief Justice of Victoria, that Judge Marshall, instead of simply observing the letter the Constitution, stretched it almost to breaking point, realizing in his wisdom, as Sir Willia m Irvine said, that the coat which had been made for the boy was much too small for the man. This was a. wise and broad interpretation; and it is what is needed in Australia. While pay- - Mr MCWILLIAMS ing all honour to.the late Chief Justice Bill ? of Australia (Sir Samuel Griffith), the late Mr Justice Barton, and the late Mr . tice O'Connor, I believe that the interof pretation they placed on our Constitution was unduly narrow.",53
385,Mr ATKINSON,PAPER,In my opinion they followed Judge Marshall pretty closely!,53
386,Mr FENTON,PAPER,"Not at all ; instead following Judge Marshall, and making the Constitution fit for the Australian people, they narrowed it in a way never contemplatedby its framers. Now, however; our High Court is so constituted as to lead us to believe .that, we may do all those things which we were told we could not do according to the old decision. A new road has been, given for us to travel on; and there are no bounds to what we may do, especially for the protection of dethe people. The honourable member for West Sydney ..(Mr,-Ryan), both beforehe entered, this House '-and immediately after he took his seat, said that he could d r a f t ' legislation under the Constitution which would enable us to deal with those!who - were exploiting the people and causing the high cost of living, and that if wepassed special Acts with that object, and they were violated, there would be power to bring offenders before the Commonwealth Courts, who would uphold thaGovernment.",53
387,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,The honourable* member never said that.,53
388,Mr FENTON,PAPER,"Prio r to the decision by the High Court, the honourable member it quite for West Sydney expressed the opinion that if we passed such special legislationwe had the power to impose it on the people.",53
389,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,"But you say his that the H i gh Court would allow that,",53
390,Mr FENTON,PAPER,The honourable memThe late ber for West Sydney said that the legiswould be constitutional; and what and he was more could he say ?,53
391,Mr JOWETT,PAPER,"The honourable member for West Sydney is present, and, perhaps,, of will tell us what he did say.",53
392,Mr FENTON,PAPER,"The honourable member for West Sydney believes that under our present Constitution we can deal, in this connection, with the manufacturer, the men in the shops, and the consumer.",53
393,Mr RYAN,PAPER,"I have no doubt of it? - Then , why this",53
394,Mr FENTON,PAPER,"Our powers must be Jusspecifically enacted. Before the decision last year one case was ruled out by the Court because the offence had not been specified in legislation, the inference being that if it had been so specified the proceedings -^re likely to have been successf u l .

Mr Fenton.y-I believe that if we brought some of those manufacturers book today in regard to their employees,, - or the disposal-of their goods, our action, under properly worded legislation,, would be upheld by the Court; indeed, I do not think the cases would be fought by the - offenders.

By the insertion pf these words Parliawill ment will do its duty to the whole of taxpayers. If the Bill, is passed in present form, it will fail to carry out what I regard as one of our chief funcsaid-anc tions, namely, the protection against ploitation of those who have not the power to protect themselves.

The honourable ber for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) has given considerable study to the subject, and has shown the House a way out of the difficulty in which a number of people have found themselves in regard to the Tariff. When I spoke on the general - question, I took care to show exactly where I stand as a member of the party to which I belong, ancl the honourable member for Maribyrnong has also intion. formed the House that we on this side disappointment. support the - principle of what we call the Now Protection. That simply means the ment! protection of, not only manufacturers, but also primary producers ancl consumers - a n all-round form of Protection.",54
397,Mr ATKINSON,PAPER,"We all stand for that principle if it can be carried out.  honourable member has now an excellent - opportunity to show that he really stands - for the principle by voting for this amendment, .' Mr ATKINSON - Perhaps you will show me how it can.be carried out?  the honourable member credit for honesty in his interjection; and a - great number of other honourable members'have declared that this New Protection is the kind of to protection they desire. There is now an excellent opportunity for allthose honourable members - who have shown such a consensus of ""opinion that'they really believe in all-round protection.

' If we have not the constitutional power - to do what we desire, it does not seem to. me that any-power be given to Parliament to carry out the the recommendations ' of the proposed 'its Board, if the Board makes any.

400,Mr JOWETT,PAPER,"That is so.  think it is the opinion of the House. That being so, I do not see how the honourable member, in view of his speech, can vote against the amendment.",55
401,Mr JOWETT,PAPER,"That is another matter; I might easily vote against the amenddone ment.  the honourable member will be voting a way opposite to that in which he spoke. The honourable member for Mariyears byrnong, by his amendment, seeks to give protection to the primary producers and consumers generally. . Duties have been increased upon agricultural implements, but, quite apart from the New Protechonorable tion, I do not agree with those who that the price of those implements have thereby been increased more than they would have been under Free Trade conBill ditions. I hold that if we wiped out the object. duties entirely we should still increase the prices of agricultural implements our primary producers by leaving them the mercy of the overseas Combine. I stand for protecting our primary producers, not merely against the overseas Combine, but also against Combine that we may have in our own midst. Of course, if we must have Combine which will take advantage of Tariff, I prefer that it should be a local Combine. But I desire some guarantee that our people will not be exploited any such organization.

The only argument which can be advanced against the amendment is that we have no power to give effect to it. But recently quite a lot of things have been which go to show that we possess the power to do things which at one time it thought we had not the power to do. in The honourable member for Wilmot (Mr. Atkinson) will remember that for. many it was thought that we had not the power under our Conciliation and Arbitration Act to deal with the railway servants of a State.

407,Mr GABB,PAPER,"I call attention to the of the House.

The honourable member also knows that the view which they then expressed been upheld in the latest decisions of the High Court. That fact shows (Mr. that the old order of things has quite changed. When, therefore, the honour the able member affirms that we have power to do these things, he is'basing remarks upon what occurred many years who ago. As a layman, of course, I recognise my limitations in discussing these legal matters. But the recent decisions of which I have spoken confirm me in impression that we have full power to now do everything that is necessary in the direction suggested by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton). Consequently I cannot understand why his amendment should not be carried. If they the proposed Tariff Board be merely intended to provide fat billets for certain gentlemen, I shall not be a party to the passage of the Bill unless the members of the Board are empowered to extend but an effective measure of protection to whole community.",56
408,Mr ATKINSON,PAPER,"The Board are going to do something all right, because the effective Minister is bound to refer certain matters to them.  that the. honourable member will show us exactly what can be done under the Bill, and that he will explain precisely how amendment. it is going to. extend an effective of protection to the consumers of. this country. Of course, the Minister Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) may accept the amendment which has that been submitted. When, speaking upon the Bill he seemed quite sincere in his statement that something should be done in the direction which has been outlined.",56
409,Mr CUNNINGHAM,PAPER,"He was most phatic at various stages.  the Bill is a disappointment. The only state argument which has been advanced against the Tariff by some few honourable) members is that it will have the effect of the prices of commodities, and that it will increase the cost of agricuitural implements to our by primary producers. The whole of their speeches were devoted to a reiteration of statement. Having such a bad case, I suppose they imagined that by frequent repetition of the statement, they has would make their case a good one. The honourable member'for Grampians Jowett) spoke with many voices on Tariff and voted and failed to vote in no regard to many items. I now want to his show him and other honourable members endeavoured to prove that incresaed duties would have the effect of raising the cost of agricultural machinery to the primary producers, that if they are really the sincere and want to do something to obviate such an unfortunate result, they have a splendid opportunity. They have said on many occasions that the Tariff went through because the Labour party supported the Government, whereas know that if the Labour party had its way the present Government would not be in office at all. They now have a way out. I am not making any charge in anticipation against the Country party, I shall look, with a great deal of the interest, to the manner in which they vote upon this amendment. If they are really sincere about protecting the primary producers, and in their desire to provide protection all round, they can show their sincerity by voting for. the amendment.

410,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,"Wakefield) for [9.20] - When I attenSpted to speak earlier in the debate I began by saying I intended to support the Bill, but ' that my support was not so whole-hearted, as I would like it to be, because the Bill does not accomplish all that I desire it should. But I accept it as an instalment. emI am not looking for the impossible. There are some matters that I would like to sec within the compass of the Bill, but which, I know, cannot be placed there because of constitutional objections, in .dried fruits. spite of whai honourable members oppoI site have said about the powers of the Arbitration Court. During the last tion we were told by members of the Government that we wer,e to have a Proit tective Tariff, framed on scientific'lines. The Minister (Mr Greene) has given' a Tariff that may be regarded - as a God-scud by those who believe in high Protection, and he must' give me in credit for having stretched my coniota scienc'e very considerably to come someas where within measurable distance of his desires. I support the Bill because provides for the appointment of a Tariff Board to assist the Minister in his adbusiness ministration. If we are to have a Tariff ns promised by the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) at Bendigo, worked on scientific lines, wo must have a Board composed the best experts obtainable to assist Minister. I am perfectly satisfied to as chairman of the Board an officer of the Customs Department, but I would certainly protest against a Board convestigation stituted entirely of officers Of the Departtors ment, or, for that matter, of officers the Public Service.",56
411,Mr JOWETT,PAPER,Why ?,57
412,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,"Because I want the public to have complete confidence in the Board and the administrathe tion of the Tariff; and because I believe that a Board, constituted wisely, will one means of obtaining a truly scientific Tariff. I endorse much that has been said as to what took place during the cussion on the Tariff. There was no lobbying, so far as I could see. When - former Tariffs were under discussion, basement of Parliament House was like half-a-dozen warehouses, filled with exinvestigations. hibits, and lobbying was then practised on an extensive scale. On this occasion the lobbying was quite open, and the Queen's Hall, f should judge, was one the most popular places in Melbourne, for the time being, with the result that honourable members got a good deal of interested data furnished by both sides, and they were deluged with unscientific . and more or less unreliable information. . The honourable member for Hume (Mr. Parker: Moloney) furnished us with illustration. At the end of the Tariff debate he asked for a duty, of fid. per lb. on That was not scientific. want daylight to be let into, the operations of the Tariff by experts, .so that the elecconsumers may know what is the real . position, for there is a limit beyond which is not possible to go in Tariff matters and at the same time encourage local us production of commodities. I agree with much that has been said as to the constitution of the Tariff Board. I believe the principle. I am not influenced one by what the newspapers - have said to the so-called hypocrisy of members of Parliament professing to be anxious to it bring about economy. This land of criticism is not in keeping with ordinary principles. Here is a Tariff that has returned to the Treasurer £32,000,000 per annum. Can it be said that it would not pay to employ the very best experts of possible in order to insure efficient adthe ministration of this machinery? Would have not any big business concern in any part of the world adopt some method ofinto advise its responsible direcas to the best policy to pursue, .just of as is proposed by the appointment of this Tariff Board to assist the Minister ? The people outside want to know something about the operation of this Tariff. Some honourable members have ""suggested that the Inter-State Commission would have '' filled the bill.'' That may be true, but Inter-State Commission is not now in existence, and I prefer a Tariff Board as be is proposed, to the Inter-State Commission as it was constituted. Unfortunately, the recommendations of the Inter-State Comdismission had to be set aside because they secret were out of date. I do not complain about that, because conditions changed the so rapidly. The Inter-State Commission occupied, I think, many months in their",57
413,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAPER,About eighteen months.,57
414,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,"They were of occupied for over a year, I believe. Were not the investigations by that Commission fair and unbiased ? I am anxious that the inquiries by the proposed Board shall also be unbiased. I believe the honourable member-for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) honestly expressed his opinion, but it is amazing that he and the.'honorone able member for Hume should be so troubled concerning the interests of the nien in the factories, because if there is any one who is "" bossing the show"" tO;day it is not those who own. the factories, but the employees. If the men in the factories are not controlling industry it is those who, hy misleadT ing them, are continually Creating unrest throughout the country. The appointment of an independent Board of experts to follow out the cost of production of the items on which high duties have been imposed is necessary. The honourable member for Hume desires to protect the farmer; but I do not know how he is going to do it under the amendment. Honourable members can talk all the nonsense they like concerning the possibilities in ' a country such as Australia, with a population of only 5,000,000; but those who say that a high Tariff is good for the farmer are exaggerating the position. A high Tariff in a country fully developed, and with - an enormous population, might be of advantage; but in the Commonwealth, the fringe of which we have not'yet developed, it is ridiculous. In the Commonwealth 53 per cent, or 54 per cent, of the population reside within the city boundaries, and high protective duties which are justifiable in other countries are lutely unwarranted in Australia. We can protect certain rural industries, such as dairying and fruit growing, but the great staple products-whea t and wool-ca n have no protection. If the Board carries out the functions proposed, the real facts will be submitted to Parliament periodically, and the primary producers will know where .the money goes. The great body of consumers, who ought to have some assistance and consideration, will also be able to learn whether the prices they are being charged are just or otherwise. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) suggested that the three members should be selected from the Customs Department, but that is undesirable, because they are interested parties, and would view the matter from one side only.",57
415,Mr JOWETT,PAPER,They are not interested in any business whatever.,58
416,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,The honBoard orable member had better tell the Gramthe pians farmers that they are disinterested. [400],58
417,Mr GREGORY,PAPER,"The Customs officers-T have been largely responsible for suggesting many of the high duties which we haye imposed, and it ""is necessary to have a' Board on which outside interests are represented -;",58
418,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,"I would? be satisfied if the Chairman of the Board were a Customs officer; and in opposing the inclusion of other Customs .officers I do not wish to reflect on their integrity 5 or ability in the slightest degree. The Taxation Department is conducted' by a Commissioner, who sends his men out prospecting every day in the year to see where they can raise a little more revenue, and a Customs officer would view investigations merely from the departmental stand-point. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) realizes that a reclassification of the Tariff is desirable,- because at presented any anomalies exisfcFbr instance, a carving knife, fork, and steel included in the same case for presentation purposes are classified under tliree different sections in the Tariff. In discussing this phase of the question with three interested parties, two out of the three said that they did not favour an alteration, because at present there were men who understood the system, and if a change were made it would mean that absomuch of their education would have to be gone over again. In discussing the appointment of the proposed Board with business men, I was informed that the opinion prevailed that the Government intended creating another' Department; but when I had the opportunity of explaining the position, they were convinced that the Government were making a move in the right direction. Those who operate on the raw products of the country should be able to compete with the whole world under a moderate Tariff; 'but. in some instances we have imposed duties of 45 per Gent, and 50 per cent.",58
419,Mr FRANCIS,PAPER,It is not enough in some cases.,58
420,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,"It is more than enough. If the honourable member for Henty (Mr Francis) does not consider the duties adequate, he should support the honourable member for Hume, who is prepared to tax products up to their full value. The proposed will have power to investigate transactions of manufacturers, who are protected to the extent I have ' mentioned, to see whether we are build.ing up a community of millionaires as ithey did and are still doing in the United States of. America. If the Board is satisfied that the assistance is being abused, that rich men are being made richer, and the public is being crushed, it may recommend that the duties be reduced or abolished. On the other hand, if struggling industries are not sufficiently protected, it will have power to recommend the impositionof additional duties. The Board cannot reduce, increase, or abolish duties, but can make recommendations, and the decision of Parliament will be final. I ask honourable members if it is not better to have investigations made by highly-trained men?",58

424,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAPER,"I have just told the House, but I will put it the workings of the Tariff. in another way, though the honourable member will still not appreciate it. my view, the intention of many in porting the Tariff which we have just passed was as much to feed the Arbitrathe tion Courts as to promote the industries - of the country. But we are approaching time of reconstruction, and shall be fortuhigh nate indeed if we can pass through i within a couple of years, and this country will be tested to the utmost of its resources. Do honourable members think that the workers in our industries have - not ample consideration? But there men who everlastingly cause industrial unrest and promote strikes, and these are coming to the end of their tether. wish to prevent the unnecessary increasand ing of the cost of production. The time must come when people will realise that economic laws are unchangeable, and arbitration awards must be governed by them. The financial outlook would not be so grave if all men would do their best and work for the country as our of satisfaction. soldiers fought for it .",59

In Committee, however, an opportunity will be afforded for the moving of amendis ments, and. the measure can thus be made what members generally desire it to be. I would have liked the Minister (Mr. Greene) to propose a Board to be constituted entirely of officers of his Department, because 'those officers have a thorough grip of the Customs laws and of We were ably assisted by them during the recent In discussion of the Tariff schedule. The suporiginal proposals of the Government show that the Customs officials advising Minister are not men who would - build a wall round Australia to keep out a imports. It was difficult for those with protective leanings to secure for the t manufacturers of the country the protection which they thought to be necessary, and it certainly could not be said that the Customs officials showed themselves had to be more than moderate Protectionists. are At the same time, it cannot be thought that if three of them were appointed to men a Tariff Board they would attempt to I .use the Tariff for revenue purposes alone to put aside the interests of the manufacturers.

I hope that when we get into Committee such amendments will be made in the Bill as will make it an effective meairure to accomplish the desire for which the Tariff was introduced and passed.

435,Mr RODGERS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"Wannon-Assistant Minister for Repatriation) [9.58] move That this Bill be now read a second time. Theenactment of this measure becomes advisable by reason of circumstances which I shall briefly relate. Under section 7 of the War Service Homes Act it is provided that a person who is an uncertificated bankrupt or insolvent shall be incapable of being appointed Commissioner for War Service Homes. Commissioner referred to in this validating Bill is Lieut - Colonel Walker. At the time of his appointment he was an. uncertificated insolvent. That fact was not known to the Government at the time. Immediately' it became known steps were taken by the Government to declare the original appointment n u l l and void. Action was taken at the same time to appoint an Acting Commissioner of War Service Homes in the person of Colonel James Micthael Semmens, pending the valid appointment of a War Service Homes Commissioner under the Act . The question arises as to the necessity of also validating the acts as such of the Acting War - Service Homes Commissioner. The view is held that if the War Service Homes Commissioner was not validly appointed, not being the Commissioner, there could not be an Acting Commissioner appointed when the appointment arises of the Commissioner was declared n u l l and void. The Government deem it advisable by this short measure to validate first of all the acts of Lieut - Colonel Walker under his original appointment, and also the acts of the Acting Commissioner, purporting, to be the acts of the Acting Commissioner.",60
436,Mr RYAN,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,Where did the Government get the power to appoint an Acting Commissioner ?,60
437,Mr RODGERS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"Unquestionably there is power in the principal Act , in varying circumstances, for the appointment of an Acting War Service Homes Commissioner. I ask the House to be good enough to pass this short measure without'very much debate. I am aware that there may be a temptation under cover of this measure to discuss the activities of the War Service Homes Commission generally. I hope that that course will not be adopted, because I promise to BILL. give honourable members a full and free opportunity to discuss the past and f u t u r e policy and activities of the War Service Homes Commission in connection with a I motion for the printing of a statement which it is my intention shortly to make in this House.",60

The Treasurer will also be asking for Supply, so that the House will have an ample opportunity of debating the whole matter fully at a more opportune stage. I would very much like, before we have any discussion in connection with repatriation,- to have before us the full report of the Public Accounts Committee, so that if mistakes have occurred we may be able thoroughly to understand what they are. A paragraph appeared in the Age this morning concerning land purchases. The Minister should try to find out, as early, as possible, what truththere is in those statements in. regard to purchases of land that have increased so wonderfully during the past few months. If they are correct, some drastic action ought to be taken in regard to those responsible for such purchases. As I recognise that the Minister should get a validating Bill of this sort through before we adjourn, I am prepared to allow it to pass all its stages without comment. """,63
478,Mr BRENNAN,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"Batman) [10.19] I quite appreciate the force of - the contention that the second reading of this Bill may not be a fitting opportunity for a general discussion on the question of War Service Homes; but, on the face of it, it affords a very suitable opportunity for the discussion of the standing and position of Lieut - Colonel Walker as former Commissioner for War Service Homes. I have not the pleasure of even a casual acquaintance with the late Commissioner, and do not profess to be well informed on the matter, but I have had the advantage of having a statement of the case, from the point of view of the late Commissioner, placed in my hands, and T say that that statement is of a kind, in my view, to merit a very serious answer from the responsible Minister. I gather from the terms of this Bill that the late Commissioner was suspended or relieved of his office in March of the present year, after operating for a considerable time, as one may put it , ultra vires, as an uncertificated insolvent. Now, after the expiration of a still further number of months, the Minister arrives in hot haste to inform us that it is of the very highest importance that a Bill validating. everything the late Commissioner did while he was still purporting to act as Commissioner should be passed without delay. Why this urgency?",63
479,Mr RODGERS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"It is also vitally important that the acts of the gentleman purporting to be the Acting Commissioner, who is still in that position, should be validated.",63
480,Mr BRENNAN,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"I quite see the relevancy of that contention. The Ministry first appoint somebody to act as Commissioner, whom they now discover to have been ineligible for that purpose after he had been working for two years, and after he has been relieved of his office for four or five months they count it a matter of great haste that the person who is acting as Commissioner should have his position recognised and validated by this House, since he>could not correctly be an Acting Commissioner if there was no one properly constituted as Commissioner - I take this opportunity of saying that it is due, not only to Lieut - Colonel Walker, but to the country, to know whether justice has been done to him. If he has been relieved of his .duties for what I have already described as the severely technical reason that he was an uncertificated insolvent, and if he was made an uncertificated insolvent while he was still on active service, the first thing we ought to do, before we proceed to validate what he has done, is to validate his re-appointment as Commissioner for War Service Homes. We should not dispossess a man of his office and discredit him in the eyes of the world by reason of an absurd technicality, which could have been very easily got over by a short legal enactment. If , on the other hand, there are genuine and more deep-seated rea- . sons why Lieut - Colonel Walker should be deprived of his office, then, in like manner, the country should be informed how it comes about that the Ministry, in making the choice of a man to fill one of the most responsible and'important offices in the Commonwealth, came to appoint a person whose qualifications cannot now be disclosed to the general public. I do not propose to pass judgment on the wisdom or unwisdom of discontinuing Lieut - Colonel Walker's appointment. have not the facts before me, but I do know that Lieut - Colonel Walker has made out a primd facie case which ought to be publicly answered. The introduction of a Bill of this kind, which is designed to deal with his administration, and with the regular appointment of - his successor, would have presented a very suitable opportunity for telling us something about the real facts of Lieut - Colonel Walker's appointment, and of the discontinuance of his office. .",63

Lieut - Colonel Walker, however, has taken trouble to compile a statement of his case. Before dealing with that I may mention that Lieut - Colonel Walker makes certain allegations here which, apparently, can be borne out by correspondence as truth f u l. I do not know what is behind the mind - of the Government in this particular matter. Knowing nothing about that, one would naturally come to the conclusion that Lieut - Colonel Walker did not have the capacity for the job, and that some excuse or reason was sought to discharge him, and that by discharging him under a pretence or excuse the Government protected itself. That is what appears to me, and what, apparently, appears to quite a number of others. I think that, in justice to the House, the Government should make a frank statement; at least 'the members of the House are entitled to a truth f u l statement in regard to the whole position.

Millen approved of Lieut - Colonel Walker's appointment: on 6th March, 1919, Lieut - Colonel Walker was appointed Commissioner by the Governor General; and on 14th July, 1919, the bankruptcy was annulled. Lieut - Colonel Walker's prepared statement contains the following:In March, 1919, the position of War Service Homes Commissioner was created, and l/iciifc - Coloncl Walker, an applicant for position, was appointed. On the 25th February, 1D19, the Comptroller of Repatriation n. wire to Mr Cupples, the manager, London Bank, Brisbane, as follows:-""Lieut-Colone l - Tames Walker under consideration for Housing Cominissionorsbip under Soldiers' Homes Act. Senator Millen will be glad to be favoured with your confidential opinion as to his character and capacity. Unless you see objections, will be glad to have collect wire."" To that, Mr Cupples replied:-""You r telegram yesterday. Party is brave and energetic. Had long experience building contracts, North Queensland. Ability lies in that direction, and good with men rather than as an administrator. During absence Front was made insolvent under old mining guarantee. Judge expressed sympathy with absentee, whereupon Bank of Australasia, discontinued pressure. Consider fill outside position admirably.""",65
496,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,Has Lieut - Colonel 'Walker himself furnished the honourable member with that statement?,65
497,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"Yes ; all members of the Parliament have received this statement. What I have quoted is a direct and distinct negative to what the Minister has told us to-nighl. Lieut - Colonel <. . Walker's statement goes onThis wire Mr Cupples confirmed by letter dated 28th February, 1919. On the same day, Licut - Cplonel Walker interviewed the Minister, Senator. Millen, w.ho produced a wiro from Mr. Cupples, and Lieut - Colonel Walker explained to Senator Millen the facts ^concerning his bankruptcy. At the close of this interview, Senator Millen informed Lieut - tiolonel Walker that lie would be appointed, and confirmed his statement by a. letter to Lieut - Colonel Walker written the same day. Lieut - Colonel Walker was appointed to the position of Commissioner on the 6th March, 1919, and remained in that position, administering that Department until 11th March, 1021. The appointment was made by the. Governor General, and it is clear that at the time of such appointment the Minister who was responsible to the Governor General was aware that Lieut - Colonel Walker was .an uncertificated bankrupt. The statement then goes on to set out the letter from the Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr Rodgers) to Lieut - Colonel Walker, stating the appointment was. null and void. Frankly, I do not know Lieut - Colonel Walker. I know nothing of his case except what has been, put upon record here. ""But, in order to clear up a doubt which exists in my mind, and in the minds of other honourable members, will the Minister be good enough to secure a copy of the wire which was sent by the Comptroller of .Repatriation to Mr Cupples, manager of the London the Bank, Brisbane, also a copy of the wire sent from Mr Cupples on the 26th February, 1919, and a copy of the letter forwarded by him to the Comptroller of Repatriation upon the same date? If the honourable gentleman will do that, I shall be very pleased. Now that the Minister has made certain allegations which make it appear that Lieut - Colonel Walker has contradicted himself, I think that the latter should make a frank statement to the members of this House, .either by means of a letter or through the newspapers, in order that we may know exactly where we stand. If necessary, it is up to hiin to sign a statutory declaration backing up his circular to honourable members, or else to withdraw the whole thing. In the meantime, I would urge the Minister to obtain a copy of the communications to which I have referred. 0 Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. ,; In Oommittee: ' Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2 (Validation of certain acts). ' Mr MCWILLIAMS (Franklin) [10.37]. - I trust that the Assistant Minister (Mr Rodgers) will not take the Bill out of Committee until the documents to which reference has been made have been laid upon the table of the House. From the information which is in my possession, I am driven to the conclusion that Lieut - Colonel Walker's bankruptcy was known to the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. Millen) before an appointment was made to the position of the War Service Homes Commissioner. Probably the matter has since escaped Senator. Millen's memory. As the Assistant Minister has promised to lay the whole of the information before honourable members, I ask him not to proceed further with the Bill this evening. What position shall we occupy if that information be riot of a satisfactory character? .",65
498,Mr GROOM,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,This is merely a validating measure.,66
499,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"This is the proper time to clear up the matter. If the information which is before me be correct, a terrible injustice has been done to a man who went to the Front and did his bit there.",66
500,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,This Bill has nothing whatever to do with the merits of Lieut - Colonel Walker's case.,66
501,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"I merely desire to have the matter cleared up. If Lieut Colonel Walker's statement be correct, a very grave injustice has been done to him, and there is only one place in which that injustice can be remedied. This is the final Court of appeal. - Mr Wise - Lieut - Colone l Walker's final appeal has passed.",66
502,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"Parliamen t is the one body which can put this matter right. I deny the statement of the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) that Lieut Colonel Walker's opportunity for a final appeal has passed. There is no Statute of Limitations in regard to action by this House. As one who has read the evidence in this case, I am of opinion that a frightful mistake has been made. Even the men who declared Lieut - Colonel Walker bankrupt affirmed that he had [401] committed no offence. We are not asking too much, therefore, when 'we ask that he shall be given a chance to make good his claim.",66
503,Mr RYAN,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"Does the honourable member contend, that Lieut - Colonel Walkerwas otherwise competent for the position? ' Mr MCWILLIAMS!- I am not' in a position to judge. If he were an incompetent, let him be dealt with as an incompetent. I feel strongly upon this matter.",66
504,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,So strongly that when the honourable member had a chance to keep Lieut - Colonel Walker in his position he did not do it. . Mr MCWILLIAMS - What chance did I have ? ..,66
505,Mr WATT,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,This is a tribunal' where it is never too late to mend.,66
506,Mr RODGERS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"I regret that the honourable member for Franklin was not present when I introduced the Bill, because he would then have known that it deals only with a legal matter, which is quite distinct from the facts of Lieut - Colonel Walker's case. I purposely refrained from discussing them.",66
507,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,I know that. I am aware that if the Bill be passed it will have no effect whatever Upon the gentleman in question. But this is the one opportunity which we shall have of righting any wrong which may have been done to him. All I ask is that' the whole of the information at the disposal of the Minister shall be submitted to Parlia-. ment before the Bill is put through its final stages.,66
508,Mr WATT,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"Balaclava) [10.45] - In the exceptional circumstances of the case;, the Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr Rodgers) is justified in asking the Committee to pass the various clauses of the measure and the House to dispose of the Bill this evening. I join with the honourable gentleman in expressing the belief that had the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) heard his explanation in introducing the measure he would not have resisted the proposal of the Government. The-Minister's statement was to the effect that this was a - purely technical matter, that it was urgent, and that there were legal grounds for theurgency. It was an assurance which the .honourable andlearned Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Ryan) and the learned member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) accepted; both desiring further opportunity for the proper consideration of the late Commissioner's case. The Minister said there were two other opportunities, the one general and the other special, when honourable members would have ample occasion and freedom to consider the Commissioner's case and the whole of the War Service Homes administration. This Committee can safely accept the Minister's assurance that the Bill does not vindicate the Government, or commit any member on either side of the House to a judgment of Lieut - Colonel Walker's merits or demerits, or of the prudence or fairness of the Government in treating him as they have done. I speak with some memory as a former member of the Cabinet, concerning Lieut-Colonel Walker's appointment, but I am as ignorant as any other honourable member as to his present position, but we may rely upon the Minister giving us ample opportunity for debating the whole of the War Service Homes proposals. I urge him to say further - that, in addition to his. statement, which should be ample and cover all the War Service problems, any papers which the House should desire shall be laid on the table.",66
509,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,I do not'think this matter ought to be mixed up with a general debate on the War Service Homes administration.,67
510,Mr WATT,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"I am not sure they can be separated. I have my own impressions as to the circumstances of the dismissal of Lieut-Colonel Walker. I am trying to read through the newspaper criticism or gossip on this subject. If the Minister will promise that this week, or next week, in addition to a ful l statement, there will be ample, opportunity to debate this matter on motion, and that any papers which the House may require to enable it to judge the truth of the statement circulated about Senator E. D. Millen's knowledge as to this problem long ago, will be made available, this matter will no doubt be cleared up here, as it was in the Senate, by a statement from the Minister himself.",67
511,Mr CORSER,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,B y a positive denial.,67
512,Mr WATT,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"Yes ; and in addition to the question of fairness to a returned officer enjoying the confidence of the Government for a period, and who was prima facie qualified for his appointment, there is the larger and much more urgent question of fairness to all the men who are expecting benefits under the original Act. That,. I take it, is the reason why the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Ryan) suggests that criticism should be invited by the Minister, because the country urgently demands it .",67
513,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,I did not say a word against the Minister.,67
514,Mr WATT,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,But the suggestion was made that the House was being misled.,67
515,Mr NICHOLLS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,I said so.,67
516,Mr WATT,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"Listenin g to the Minister's statement to-night, I think he was perfectly clear in his assurance that there will be every opportunity for any discussion that the House may think necessary.",67
517,Mr NICHOLLS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"Macquarie) [10.51], - I made the statement that I thought the Minister (Mr Rodgers) was misleading the House, and I adhere to it . The Minister gave as his reasons for wishing to rush the Bill through Committee that there were certain, legal technicalities attached to it . The question of the late Commissioner's bankruptcy came into the argument, and he said he knew nothing about it , although he has held his position for two years. I am not saying anything against the Minister himself, but he declared that the Government knew nothing about this matter, although on Lieut - Colonel Walker's own statement Senator Millen knew.",67
518,Mr CORSER,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,That has been denied.,67
519,Mr NICHOLLS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"It has not been denied publicly, at all events.",67
520,Mr RODGERS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"It has, as the* honourable member for Balaclava has pointed out.",67
521,Mr WATT,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"I think the Minister emphatically denied it in the Senate. Mr - NICHOLLS-If the Minister can show honourable members that there has been a denial, I am quite prepared to apologize.",67
522,Mr RODGERS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"Wannon-Assistant Minister for Repatriation) [10.54]. I would not have risen again to delay the passage of the Bill except to give a further assurance, following upon the remarks made by the honourable member for - Balaclava (Mr. Watt), and in order to clear up one or two points. There will be ample opportunity for Lieut - Colonel Walker's friends in this House to state his case as fully as they desire..",67
523,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,I have never seen him.,68
524,Mr RODGERS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"The Government lave no desire to be unfair to - any returned soldier, and I would be very loath indeed to be unfair, especially in the case - of a man who held a distinguished position such as Lieut - Colonel Walker occupied. I want to make it quite clear that when it came to my knowledge that Lieut - Colonel Walker was an uncertifi-cated insolvent, I got in. touch with the - Crown Law authorities, who, in turn, got into direct communication with our 'Crown Law authorities in Queensland, in order to obtain confirmation of the statement, and when this was obtained I immediately communicated with the Leader of the Government and my colleagues. AISO communicated with Lieut - Colonel Walker. I called him to the Commonwealth Public Offices and put to him the ""position as disclosed by the investigations. He admitted the statement as to his insolvency, but said that information on 'the files would show that "".Minister for Repatriation (Senator !E. D. Millen) was aware of the :fact at the time of his appointment. Before declaring null and void the appointment of Lieut - Colonel Walker, I ssaw the telegram from, the Comptroller, - and also the reply of Mr Cupples, and, instead of terminating his appointment, "" I gave Lieut - Colonel Walker leave of ab-senee, with the undertaking that no - action would be taken to remove him 'from his position until he saw the Minister for Repatriation on his return. Tm.mediately the Minister for Repatriation - returned, Lieut - Colonel Walker was .afforded an opportunity of interviewing him, which he did, and later he saw the Minister in my presence, when he accepted .Senator Millen's definite assurance that he was not aware of his insolvency - at the time of his appointment. That 'is on record, together with the tele.grams; and that information will be laid before the House, when honourable members will have a full opportunity of debating the whole question. I idid not feel in a position to recommend Ahe . re-appointment of Lieut - Colonel Walker; but there will be a ful l opportunity, as I have .said, to discuss the matter. As far as I was personally concerned, I would have preferred Lieut Colonel Walker to be immune from public , criticism; but if Lieut - Colonel Walker and his friends in this House desire that the whole question of his administration-whic h is today the subject of investigation by two bodies-shal l be fully inquired into, I shall be prepared to deal with it. To clear up the question of the denial of the Minister for Repatriation, I desire to quote theffollowing statements made in another place. On the 30th June last, Senator Gardiner saidIf the information at my disposal is correct,, the Minister for Repatriation (Senator R. D.' Millen), when appointing Lieut - Colonel Walker to the office of War Service Homes Commissioner, was aware of all the circumstances surrounding his insolvency. - Senator B. D. MILLEN - I want to give that I an absolute and flat denial. The Minister for Repatriation later saidEven if Lieut - Colonel Walker had been restored to his office, as has been suggested, this Bill would have still been necessary, and it is necessary to validate the acts of the Acting Commissioner. I , therefore, presume that the the Senate agrees to the passage of the Bill. I desire to. repeat what I have said already by interjection, that I give an absolute, flat denial to the reiterated statement' that at the time of his appointment I had a knowledge of Lieut - Colonel Walker's bankruptcy.",68
525,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"-Therefore , the Minister could not have been shown the telegram from the Comptroller. . Mr Rodgers - I leave the matter at that stage, and ask honourable members to pass the Bill through all its stages. I am prepared to give a further assurance, if it is necessary, that every opportunity will be given to discuss the matter, and in the meantime, I may say that, in my judgment, Lieut - Colonel Walker should not adopt the role of an injured innocent",68
526,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"Franklin) [11.0]. - The position has not been met by the statement made by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt), or by the Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr. Rodgers), who said that Lieut - Colonel Walker's sendees had been dispensed with for reasons other than those given.",68
527,Mr RODGERS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,I have not said so. I stated that there were reasons why heshould not be re-appointed. .,68
528,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"The Minister has said that, although his services were ""dispensed with because he was an undischarged bankrupt, there were other reasons why he would not re-appoint him. If that is so, he is doing Lieut - Colonel Walker a great injustice.",69
529,Mr WATT,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"I do not know what"" the Minister knows. I was merely reading between the lines and drawing my own conclusions. I may have been unf air, but that is my opinion.",69
530,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"I think the honourable member was unfair. I have never seen this officer, but I take the stand that his services were dispensed with because it was discovered after he had been a considerable time in a responsible position that he was an uncertificated bankrupt. According to the evidence I have read, that information was at the disposal of the Minister at the time of his appointment.",69
531,Mr GOSSEB,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,That has been denied.,69
532,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,I know that.,69
533,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,The Comptroller and the Government knew.,69
534,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"The Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. Millen) has said that he didnot know, but definite evidence has been given to the effect that a telegram reached the Department conveying the information. desire to say distinctly that if this officer had proved incompetent, or if there were any serious charges such as those suggested, and which are now being inquired into-this is not the only officer whose actions 'are being inquired into-it is not fair - that any advantage - should be taken, on a technical matter such as bankruptcy. There was nothing detrimental to the honesty or 'character of the officer, and there is not a man who will not agree with the manager of the bank, who said that it was an unfortunate occurrence for which the officer in question was not morally responsible, although he was legally so.",69
535,Mr RODGERS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,There is a definite legal prohibition under the Act:,69
536,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,If the officer has proved incompetent he should be dealt with on that ground alone.,69
537,Mr RYAN,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,The honourable member's point is that he should never have been appointed if the Government were aware of his bankruptcy ,69
538,Mr RODGERS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"That is admitted. Mr MCWILLIAMS : - ! am raising that point. As a matter of fact, the officer was appointed after definite statement's had been made and information sent to the office. I do not say that the Minister saw it, because this was only one. of a number of matters that had to pass through the hands of an exceedingly busy Minister.",69
539,Mr RYAN,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,The honourable member Gannot have it both ways. The Government either knew of it or did not know of it.,69
540,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"The information came to the Department, and if the Minister did not know of it, surely it was not the fault of the officer in question.",69
541,Mr RODGERS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"The honourable member's statement is not correct. The officer in question did not take any steps to inform the Minister, and it was a departmental inquiry that led to the disclosure. At no stage did the late officer take any steps to inform the Minister.",69
542,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"A searching departmental inquiry was held into this officer'sfitness,for the position before he was appointed, and if he was an undischarged bankrupt the Government should have discovered that important .fact. Butthis officer distinctly states that the I information was available, and was forwarded: If that is so, it was not his fault.",69
543,Mr RODGERS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,It was his fault.,69
544,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"Unquestionably , the matter is in a very unsatisfactory position at the present moment. If the Minister gives, us the assurance that the House will have a full opportunity of dealing with it later, that is all very well; but I do not wisb it dealt with in a general discussion of the War Service Homes administration. There are even more' important matters to be discussed then. However, I do not wish to prevent the passing of this Bill. If the telegram was sent, it must be on the files of the Department, or, if not, there are other means of obtaining a copy of it .",69
545,Mr BRENNAN,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"Batman) [11.7] There is one statement, made by the Minister (Mr Rodgers) which I do not propose to allow to pass unchallenged, the statement that "" the friends of Lieut Gblbnel Walker in this House"" will i - 4 ! have the opportunity to do certain things later. The Minister is absolutely wrong in suggesting that those who have spoken from the Opposition side of the chamber have addressed themselves to the. question as the friends of Lieut - Colonel Walker, and he would do well to dissociate himself from that suggestion. I have already said that I have never met Lieut - Colonel Walker, and that he is not an acquaintance, much less a friend, of mine. I address myself to this matter entirely as to a public question of interest and i m portance.",69
546,Mr ROPGERS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"I had not the honourable member in mind, and, so far as he is concerned, withdraw what I said.",70
547,Mr BRENNAN,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"I accept the withdrawal. It is a question with us whether full justice has been done to Lieut Colonel Walker as a person appointed to a very important office, and whether the public interests have been properly served.",70
548,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,Surely those questions are not raised now. The Bill must bo passed in any case.,70
549,Mr BRENNAN,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"I am aware of that ; the matter was mentioned by the Minister. There is this further aspect of the case. The Minister, by the introduction of the Bill , proposes to for t i fy the position of the Government in regard to the things done by Lieut - Colonel Walker while purporting to act as W a r Service Homes Commissioner. The Government are curing their own position, but they are taking all sorts of care not to give Lieut Colonel Walker the coincident opportunity to cure his, or even to state his case. Suppose the Souse were to say, 1 "" We shall not allow the Government to validate its position until it permits Lieut - Colonel Walker's position to be discussed "" ? The two matters should go baud in hand. As we have been asked to put the - whitewash brush over what the Government have done, we should be'given an opportunity to consider whether L i e u t . Colonel Walker should be reinstated. express no opinion on that point: but there should have gone together a frank statement cf the circumstances of Lieut Colonel Walker's appointment and the termination of it and the proposal to validate what he did, the two things being inter-related. It is now, and not during a general and very wide discussion of the War Service Homes administration, that we should consider the special case of Lieut - Colonel Walker, which, by the terms of the Bill , we are really invited [402] to consider. In my view, Lieut - Colonel Walker's successor is, possibly, as able a man as was ever appointed to an administrative position in this State.",70
550,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"Darling) [11.12] The interjection of the Minister (Mr . Rodgers) makes the position worse than it was. I resent the sneering manner in which he spoke of the "" friends of Lieut -. Colonel Walker in this chamber.""",70
551,Mr RODGERS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,I certainly did not. mean to speak sneeringly. Perhaps I used the wrong word.,70
552,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"I , at all events, resent the implication conveyed. I have never spoken to Lieut - Colonel Walker, and would not know him were he in the gallery. I only had his written statement, and it was on that that I spoke to-night. The position is a remarkable one. Steps were taken to advertise extensively the position that was vacant. Many applications were received, the office being one of the most important that could be filled by any Government, because the War Service Homes Commissioner was to handle millions of. pounds, and to deal with huge contracts. He was to have one of the biggest jobs in Australia. The Comptroller of Repatriation received the applications, and took steps to have inquiries made about the applicants. He should have known what the Government proposed to do, and should have informed himself of any bar to an applicant's appointment. Bankruptcy is a disqualification that attached to this appointment, not only under the terms of the War Service Homes Act, but, generally, as it attaches to all appointments to the Public Service. Y e t we are told that the Comptroller of Repatriation did not bring under the notice of the Minister the fact that there was this disqualification. I do not knew whether he has been made a scapegoat.",70
553,Mr RYAN,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,Who is the Comptroller of : J. Repatriation ?,70
554,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"I do not know. It is extraordinary that one of the most important positions in the Public Service of Australia should have been filled by a man who, obviously, was disqualified for appointment to it .",70
555,Mr RYAN,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,Was not that typical of the general bungling of the Government],70
556,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"That brings us a step further. I am not prepared to allow the Bill to go - through unless we have thepapers before us, and I therefore sugwe gest that the Assistant Minister would do well to report progress.",70
557,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"Honourable members have been told that they will have the papers before them, and will be given hope."" an opportunity to discuss them ",71
558,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"There is this fresh aspect of the matter to be considered, that a gentleman holding a high position them. in the administration of this country, namely, the Comptroller of Repatriation, is found, according to the statements made here to-night, to be unfitted to be kind. even an office-boy in the service of the Commonwealth.",71
559,Mr CORSER,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,He is not now in the Service.,71

561,Mr RODOERS,COMMISSIONER VALIDATING,"I undertake to do this: Instead of embodying the references to Lieut - Colonel Walker's administration in the general statement concerning the activities of the War Service Homes Commission, I will make it the subject of request. . a separate statement upon which there may be a separate debate.",71

It is not necessary that it should go through on the night of the 12th July. It might be passed on the night of the 13th.,71

It might be that some of the transactions intended to be validated by this Bill will be amongst those for which Lieut - Colonel Walked was responsible, which will be called into question.

Notwithstanding anything contained in the War Servioe Homes Act 1918-1920 or in the Australian Soldiers ' Repatriation - Act 1920, [402]- 2 James Michael Senunens shall not, by reason only of his employment as Acting War Service Homes Commissioner, be deemed to have vacated his office as a member of the RepatriaCommission, and shall not, by reason only of his employment as a member of the RepaCommission, be deemed to have vacated offico as Acting War Service Homes Commissioner."" reason why this clause is necessary is because section 17 of the Australian Repatriation Act contains a prothe hibition against a Commissioner in the - The Commissioner or Acting Commissioner. be deemed to have vacated his office if he engages during the term of his office in any employment outside the duties of his office. Colonel Semmens was an officer immediately available to the Government, with experience and knowledge that enabled him to straight way discharge the office of Acting War Service Homes Commissioner That would be a serious thing if by so acting he should inhave disqualified himself for the office of Commissioner under the Repatriation Act. There is a similar prohibition in the the. War Service Homes Act, section 12 of which providesThe Commissioner or the Acting Commissioner (if.any) shall be deemed to have vacated his office if(o) he engages, during his term .of office, in any employment outside the duties of his offico. . . . of It is clear that we might inadvertently disqualify a valued and distinguished' public servant because of his having come to the aid of the Government on the retirement of Lieut - Colonel Walker. The bo Government are under an obligation to assurColonel Semmens for having BO acted, aud I wish to dissociate him from much the of the public criticism that falls on hisshoulders by reason of his .being a locum . tenens in the office of Commissioner.. He has indeed rendered-distinguished service to the country. Proposed new clause agreed to. Title agreed to. I Bill reported with amendments.
