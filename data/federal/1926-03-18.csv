Whilst it is admitted that the passport requirements cause some inconvenience to individuals, experience shows that, so far as Australians are concerned, there are many advantages in continuing the system. It affords ready means of identification for Australians visiting other parts of the world and having banking and other business to transact. Another most important feature of the is that it enables the Government to keep a check upon, and close control over, the number of alien migrants who might seek to further gain admission to the Commonwealth.

In the Argus of Monday, 15th March, under the heading, "" Federal Politics,"" the following statement is published as information concerning the proceedings in this Parliament:- Not having been consulted the Opposition felt aggrieved, the result being that Mr. Makin, of South Australia, vigorously "" stonewalled "" the Power Alcohol Bill, and made progress impossible. I did not speak at all on Friday on the Power Alcohol Bill , and, therefore, the impression likely to be created in the publio mind by the Argus report is quite erroneous. I am sure that the House would not for a moment entertain the suggestion that I would be guilty of such public misconduct as to "" stone-wall "" any measure. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT. BOARD.

27,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,"On the 12th February the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) asked the following questions : 1. Will the Minister for Defence state the amount of defence material shipped to Australia during the past twelve months? 2. What proportion of such material was f o l - shipped by the Commonwealth Line? I am now in a position to inform the honourable member that during ithe twelve months ended the 31st December, 1925, C. 2,73l£ tons (measurement) of defence material were shipped to Australia, and the proportion of such material shipped by the Commonwealth Line was 1,5955 tons.

I told the honourable gentleman that I would obtain the information for him. I have obtained it , but it is so lengthy that it would occupy a great space in Hansard, and as much of it has already been published, I have had a return placed on the table of the Library.",16
29,Mr FENTON,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,"On a point of order, I should like to know whether it is competent for the Prime Minister, in replying to a question, to say that because the reply is somewhat lengthy will be laid on the table of the Library instead of being published in The time may arrive when members may wish to turn up Hansard to obtain that information. authority the Prime Minister has to determine that information asked for by honourable members shall be tabled in the Library, and not printed in Hansardl.",16

ELEVENT H GENERAL REPORT.",17
31,Mr BRUCE,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,"Elinders-Prime Minisister and Minister for External Affairs) [2.46] - I lay on the table of the House the Eleventh General Report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, and move That the report 'be .printed. Under the Public Works Committee Act, the reports of the committee must be laid on the table fourteen days after the date appearing on them.

32,Mr MACKAY,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,"Lilley) [2.47] - The delay in presenting the report was caused by the general elections, and the need for the appointment of a new committee after the assembling of Parliament. When the new committee met, the annual report was immediately prepared, and submitted to the Governor General, as required by the act. Question resolved in the affirmative. LEAGUE OF NATIONS . ADMISSION OF GERMANY.",17
33,Mr BRUCE,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [2.48] - In reply to several questions asked yesterday regarding the position that had arisen at Geneva, I indicated [70] it that if possible I would make a statement on the subject today. I ask leave to Hansardl make that statement now. (Leave honourable granted.)- I regret that the information contained in the columns of the AustraI ask what lian press yesterday, that Brazil, one of the non-permanent members of the Council of the League of Nations, had definitely refused to allow unanimity to be reached regarding the admission of Germany as a permanent member of the Council, has now been officially confirmed. As a result of that action it has been impossible to admit Germany as a permanent member of the Council, and the whole matter of Germany's admission to the League has been postponed until the September meeting of the Assembly. I very much regret that this position has arisen, and in the circumstances I think it desirable to inform the House of the whole of the facts regarding the genesis of the recent proceedings at Geneva, and the course which the Government pursued during the recent sitting of the Assembly there. That meeting arose out of negotiations which took place at Locarno, which culminated in the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee to which Great B r i tain, Germany, France, Belgium,- and It a l y are parties. One of the conditions of that treaty was that it should not come into operation u n t i l Germany had been admitted to the League. Germany undertook to apply for membership, and this she did. She had to apply for admission in the same way as any other power which might desire to become a member would have to apply. A special meeting of the Assembly was called to consider Germany's application. If such a special meeting had not been held, the matter could not have been dealt with u n t i l the ordinary meeting of the Assembly in September next. To delay the matter u n t i l then would have delayed the operation of the Treaty of Locarno. Accordingly a special meeting of the Assembly was summoned, and invitations to attend it were sent to the 55 nations which are members of the League. A second question to be considered was the appointment of Germany as a permanent member of the Council of the League. Three of the parties to the Locarno Treaty are permanent members of the Council of the League, and those powers, and the other signatories of the treaty, had agreed that Germany should become a permanent member. Consequently there .had to be a meeting of the Council at the same time as the meeting of the Every one will agree that the provision that Germany should be given a permanent seat upon the Council of the League was wise and proper and in accordance with the spirit of co-operation which the League is trying to world peace. It was the spirit that permeated the Locarno negotiations and ""led to the signing of the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee. The permanent members of .the Council of the League are Great Britain, France, Italy, and Japan. time of. the framing of the Covenant of the League it was contemplated that the great powers should become members of the Council, and that there should also be four-increased six-elected non-permanent to be chosen from time to time the other nations who were of the League. Provision under the Covenant for increasing the permanent or the non-permanent members of the Council; but any recommendation made by the Council for such an increase must be unanimous. unanimous recommendation of the Council goes before the Assembly, because any new member of the Council must be approved by the Assembly. The Assembly can act on a majority vote. At Geneva it was found that the necessity for securing a unanimous recommendation Council would be a serious obstacle to the admission of Germany to the League, and the failure to obtain has led to the present unfortunate tion. It has come about through the ambition of certain nations permanent seats upon the Council of the League. It is possibly not that countries should aspire to permanent seats on the Council, and two countries in particular-Brazil and Spainhave long held this ambition, and have been working very hard for its realization. The application of Germany also led to a new claim by Poland, based upon the many complicated and difficult that are outstanding between that country and Germany. Poland bases its application for a permanent seat on the Council upon the argument that it is not fair or just that, in these circumstances, it should not be in an equal position with Germany. This caused a troublesome situation; but Poland's case could have Mr Bruce. been met by her appointment as a nonpermanent member of the Council, and Assembly. I think that the good sense of the Assembly could have been relied upon to keep Poland on the Council so long as there were difficult and complicated questions outstanding between that country in and Germany...There were thus at Geneva promote grave elements of disunion on matters on which it was absolutely vital that there should be a spirit of good, sense and cooperation. This is to be regretted. We should, however, recognize the efforts that were made to overcome the diffiAt the culties which arose. While we are forced to the conclusion that one nation showed a spirit that was hardly in accord with permanent the ideals of the League, there were other nations which showed that they later to were prepared to act in a spirit which members, would assist to establish the position of from the League and to assure its influence in members the world. Unfortunately, the diffiwas made culties could not be overcome. Sweden either and Czecho-Slovakia, both of which are. non-permanent members of the Council, tried to ease the situation, and to bring about the admission of GerThis many into the Council of the League by voluntarily offering to resign to make way for Poland. Notwithstanding that offer, Brazil was adamant, and refused to give way. She took up the attitude that unless a permanent seat was given to her upon the Council, she. was from the not prepared to allow unanimity to be reached by the Council, which, of course, prevented Germany from being given unanimity a permanent seat upon the Council. I situa- do not want to comment on or to criticize the action of any other country; but to obtain I certainly think that it is deplorable that one nation should have been able to unnatural do so much to destroy the spirit which enabled the Locarno treaty to be entered into, a treaty which every one will admit is the most important step taken towards securing the peace of Europe since the signing of the Armistice, it is regrettable that a country which is so far away from the storm centre of Europe should questions be able to take action the consequences of which, if they cannot be avoided, may again throw the world into a devastating war. I shall now put before the House the attitude of the Government regarding the. questions that arose at Geneva. I would remind honourable members that it was a special meeting of the Assembly, and the outstanding question to be determined was the admission of Germany to the League, with a permanent seat on the Council. The Government's view was that nothing should be done to imperil Germany's admission to the. League, and the honouring of the undertaking that she would he given a permanent seat on the Council. A second question of equal, if not greater, importance arose, namely, the further enlargement of the Council beyond the admission of Germany to a permanent seat, and in regard to this the Government considered it imperative that it should express its opinions promptly and definitely. It accordingly represented to the British Government, and instructed its delegate at Geneva, that it considered most undesirable that there should be any increase of the permanent members of the Council beyond the admission of Germany. The framers of the Covenant of the League of Nations contemplated that permanent seats on the Council would be given only to great powers having worldwide interests, whose influence and sense of responsibility arising out of such interests would enable them to play an important part in the affairs of the world. At that time it was anticipated that America would enter the League and have one of the permanent seats on the Council. But in order that the Council should not be composed of great powers only, the Covenant provided for the election by the Assembly of six non-permanent members. If the League is to succeed it must be guided by considerations of practicability. However much we may desire that the nations of the world shall be on a footing of absolute equality and have permanent seats on the Council, we cannot ignore the fact that the League will be destroyed if the Council be so constituted that the smaller, but more numerous, powers can dictate to the great powers. If that state of affairs is allowed to develop inevitably the League will collapse. To-day it has the goodwill, co-operation, and assistance of all the great powers, and its strength is steadily growing, but if by an increase of the permanent members the great powers are placed under the control of a council dominated by the small powers, who have no world-wide interests-powers , for instance, that have no interests outside South America- a fatal blow will be struck at the League. Where, then, ara we to draw the line? A line of demarcation is fixed at the present time in such a way that no unrest or discord is created in the League. It distinguishes between the acknowledged great powers which have permanent seats on the Council, and the lesser powers which are entitled to a definite number of non-permanent seats. If the demand of Brazil for a permanent seat had been acceded to, many other nations would assert that they had an equal claim to similar representation.",17
34,Mr CHARLTON,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,All the powers would demand a seat.,19
35,Mr BETJCE,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,"Exactly , and the rivalry between the nations that were seeking permanent seats on the Council would it create a deplorable position. Because of these considerations the Government stated quite frankly its opposition to any proposal to progressively enlarge the Council.",19
36,Mr COLEMAN,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,Did the views of the Commonwealth Government coincide with the views of other dominions?,19
37,Mr BRUCE,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,"I am not in the position to say how strongly the governments of other dominions have expressed themselves. I have explained that on the immediate issue before the special meeting of the Assembly, the Government's attitude was that nothing should be done to imperil Germany's claim to take a permanent seat on the Council immediately, and that every effort should be made' to obtain her full co-operation and assistance in the spirit of the Locarno Pact.",19
38,Mr MANN,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,Were any conditions imposed ?,19
39,Mr BRUCE,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,No .,19
40,Mr WATT,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,Does the Prime Minister feel at liberty to explain the attitude of the British Government towards the enlargement of the membership of the Council ?,19
41,Mr BRUCE,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,"I do not. That is a matter to be dealt with by the British Prime Minister in the House of Commons ; but, so far as Germany's admission to the League is concerned, the British Foreign Secretary, SirAusten Chamberlain, went to Geneva with instructions from his Government that Germany's admission to the League and a permanent seat on the Council should be facilitated. The second issue did not arise directly out of the recent special meeting of the Assembly, but it has been so much disbeen cussed that the Government felt it perative to express emphatically the view that it is most undesirable to break down the present constitution of the Council, which the permanent seats are reserved for the recognized great powers, and lesser powers, in rotation, are given nonarisen, permanent seats. The Government was believes also of opinion that, should any country of purely local interest, be found to be especially concerned in matters to be dealt with by the Council, it should be left the good sense of the Assembly to take that fact into consideration when electing the non-permanent members of the Counof cil.",19
42,Mr HUGHES,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,Are the other dominmembers ions in accord with that?,20
43,Mr BRUCE,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,"Generally , I think; but I cannot say whether they have expressed their views quite so definitely as has Commonwealth Government.",20
44,Mr HUGHES,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,They have not opposed the Commonwealth Government's view?,20
45,Mr BRUCE,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,"No . As to the future, it is impossible to say what is likely occur between now and the next meeting of the Assembly in September, or at the quently. Assembly itself. It is inconceivable that the work so happily terminated at Locarno should be stultified by the of any one member of the Council of the League. It is unthinkable that any one country, particularly one which is far moved from the region which is directly and immediately the object of the Locarno Treaty, should persist in its attitude thwarting the consummation of the Locarno settlement, and the active operation of Germany with the League. unfortunate. The recent proceedings demonstrate how necessary it is that all the nations which are members of the League, and which, above all, have received the great honour ratified ? and responsibility of sitting on the"" Council, should use their position and in the fluence, not to satisfy purely selfish tions, but to collaborate with the rest the world in a spirit of goodwill. That the only possible basis of international co-operation. Without such an attitude no association of states or League Nations can hold together. I would greatly deprecate any exaggeration what has happened at Geneva. I do not think that the League has suffered real injury or that, its foundations in any way damaged. If a spirit of imselfishness has been displayed in one quarter, good sense, compromise, toleration, and even self-sacrifice have been disby played in other quarters. The Government, however much it may regret and the deplore that the present situation has does not regard it with alarm. It that a satisfactory solution will be found at the next meeting of the Assembly in September, -'when a real spirit of conciliation will animate all the memto bers and Germany will at length enter the League and take her seat on the Council in circumstances befitting the dignity a great power. I might have made this statement on the motion that a paper be printed, and thus have afforded honourable an opportunity to debate it. But I suggest that the present time is not opportune for such a debate. Before Australia's delegates leave for the next the meetingof the Assembly of the League, an opportunity will be afforded the House to express its view upon the important and vital matters which will arise at Geneva, and which unquestionto ably will require to be considered at the Imperial Conference to be held subse",20
46,Mr WATT,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,Does that promise cover action the Locarno agreement also?,20
47,Mr BRUCE,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,"Yes . When that time comes members will be better qualified reto gauge the situation and estimate the trend of events at the Assembly. If the matter were discussed now, we might be of apt to express our condemnation of recent developments in language which subsecoquent events might prove to have been",20
48,Mr COLEMAN,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,Will the Government accord the House an opportunity to decide whether the Locarno agreement should be,20
49,Mr BRUCE,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,"The House will have opportunity to discuss the agreement, ambibut I do not say that a decision can be of arrived at before the matter has been is discussed by the Imperial Conference. Recent unfortunate events may remove the need for ratifying the agreement, but of I trust that that will not happen.",20
50,Mr CHARLTON,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,"Havin g regard to the concluding remarks of the Prime Minister, any I do not propose to say much regardhave ing the situation that has developed at Geneva. The right honourable gentleman said that the provision of the constitution of the League, requiring that any decision of the Council shall be unanimous, interferes considerably with the operation of the League. That is kernel of the trouble, and I suggest that the time is opportune for the Prime Minister to take action for the purpose of bringing about an alteration of the procedure. It was apparent to me when I was at Geneva, as it appears to have been to the Prime Minister, that some such change is essential if the League is to function satisfactorily.",20
51,Mr BRUCE,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,"Is the honourable gentleman dealing with the point that unanimity is essential in regard to many subjects? Mr Charlton"" - Yes .",21
52,Mr BRUCE,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,Then I shall have to define my views very much more clearly than I have already done. I do not desire that the honourable gentleman should have the impression that I said that unanimity was undesirable.,21
53,Mr CHARLTON,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,"The time has arrived for an alteration of the constitution of the League. Honourable members must realise that if one vote is sufficient to prevent action from being taken, whether it be in relation to the admittance of a new member or on any other matter, intrigue and compromise are bound to ensue. The League cannot be expected to prove a success if there is room for dissatisfaction regarding its procedure. I believe that the League will not continue to exist for very many years unless an alteration is made to its constitution. I , therefore, stress the necessity of this Government making representations to the Imperial Government to take steps to that end. Where it is necessary to secure absolute unanimity it is an easy matter for a comparatively strong nation to influence a smaller nation in the direction of taking action which will effectually prevent the League from functioning satisfactorily.",21
54,Mr HUGHES,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,Unanimit y is very necessary for the protection of Australia's interests.,21
55,Mr CHARLTON,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,I go so far as to say that there must be a state approaching unanimity.,21
56,Mr HUGHES,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,"What chance would Australia have if unanimity were not essential? As it is, Great Britain's vote must go against us before anything can happen to us. Mr Charlton"" - If it were provided that a number of nations must disthe approve of certain proposed action to prevent it from being taken, the League would occupy a far stronger position. Absolute unanimity is quite a different matter. I would not object to a proposal that two-thirds, or even three-fourths, of the members of the League must consent to any proposed action. Had I , as the representative of Australia at the F if t h Assembly of the League, had the right to vote upon the matter, the Institute of Intellectual Co-operation would not be in Paris today.",21
57,Mr HUGHES,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,That principle is embodied in our own Constitution-the principle of equal representation.,21
58,Mr CHARLTON,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,"That is quite a different matter. Unanimity implies that every nation must agree to every proposal. The right honourable gentleman is well aware of that. I wish to see the League function properly, and do some' good in the world. That is not possible with its existing constitution. I shall reserve for a 'future occasion any further remarks that I have to make.",21
59,Mr BRUCE,CORRECTION OP NEWSPAPER,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [3.18] - I do not wish the honourable gentleman to remain under a misapprehension. I dealt with an unfortunate result of the requirement of unanimity, but I did not desire honourable members to think that it was my view that unanimity was not necessary. That is a matter which would necessitate very full discussion, and it could appropriately be debated in this House. I have no intention of arguing against the principle of unanimity that at present operates in regard to many of the decisions to which the League may come. PAPER. The following paper was presented: Pacific Island Shipping and Mail ServicesStatement regarding. NA (BONUS SHARES) BILL . In committee (Consideration resumed from 12th March, vide page 1619) : Clause 3 (Validation of refunds).",21
60,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Y a r r a ) [3.23] - This is the principal clause of the bill . proposes to validate the refund of certain moneys which were collected in respect of bonus shares that had been distributed from accumulated profits. During the second-reading debate, three or four speeches relating to this particular matter were delivered. Whilst I admitted that the re-collection of this money would cause great difficulty, and might impose certain hardships, I said then, and I now repeat, that it is the duty of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) to tell honourable members precisely what those difficulties are, so that they may judge as to whether the action which the Government took should be validated. He has not done that. I complain of the honourable gentleman r.hat he haa Inolt treated honourable members fairly. they are able to satisfy themselves that the bill is necessary, well and good; I cannot. A large sum of money which had been legally collected was illegally refunded because of the misinterpretation of a judgment of the High Court. ""Sufficient care was not exercised in the making of that interpretation. Admit tedly, illegal action has been taken, and a large sum has been refunded to persons from whom it was legally and justly collected. A f t e r the lapse of three years, we are now asked to validate, those refunds. If the Government can prove to us that the blunder which it committed, serious though it was, cannot be rectified, that it is impossible for it to retrace its steps, we shall have to accept the position.",22
61,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The Treasurer said that that was the position.,22
62,Dr EABLEPAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I gave a long exadministration planation, and mentioned about seven different reasons why the money cannot be re-collected.",22
63,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,It was longer than i clear.,22
64,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"It was neither long nor clear. If honourable members will the Treasurer's second-reading speech, they will find that he made a few general statements dealing (with the difficulties report was presented. that might be apprehended, but did not out of date. furnish the House with any information. He is the only person who possesses in side information. What is the use of saying that the existence of trust funds and the probable death of certain shareEven holders who had refunds made to ' them have occurred. render it impossible for the money to It be re-collected? He has not stated the exact position. There cannot be a large number of shareholders affected. We should be given a general statement, secting out the number of assessments affected, the amount of money involved, the particular instances of hardship that could arise, and their number. The whole of that information is in the possession of the honourable gentleman.",22
65,Dr EAKLEPAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,It is not.,22
66,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"If it is not, there must be something radically wrong with the administration. Surely the department has a record of the refunds, and a receipt for each amount?",22
67,Dr EAKLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,That record is not separated from every other taxation reIf ceipt or refund.,22
68,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,It would appear on the file of each individual affected.,22
69,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"There would be 400,000 or 500,000 of them.",22
70,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"There would,not be that number of refunds.",22
71,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I refer to the total number of cases. They aTe all mixed up, and it would be necessary to search through the lot.",22
72,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Then it is about time a change was made in the bookkeeping methods of the department. We have two parliamentary committees-the Public Works Committee and the Public Accounts Committee-that inquire into certain aspects of the expenditure of public money. There is greater necessity in this than in any other phase of administration for an investigation by a committee of honourable members. Very few honourable members are informed regarding the and the activities of the Taxation Department, which I regard as thp most important of our departments. We have to wade through large numbers t was of documents to obtain even a surface knowledge.",22
73,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,We have had a very exread tensive survey by a Toyal commission.,22
74,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That is so. It was a very useful survey, and a most valuable But that is now Judgments of the court which have been delivered from time to - time have altered the whole aspect of our his legislation; and very few members are in a position to discuss them with authority. in the last five years great changes Yet we continue to amend legislation without having definite information as to the full effect of our actions. Only yesterday it was reported in the daily press that a claim for £40,000 had been withdrawn. I was not able to gather from the abbreviated report of the proceedings why the case was withdrawn. If it was wrongly withdrawn the Government has lost £40,000 which it should have; if it was correctly withdrawn £40,000 was wrongly claimed.",22
75,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The claim was not for in come tax.,23
76,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"No ; it was for wartime profits tax. A special appropriation was made by Parliament to enable refunds of taxation thought to have been wrongly paid, to be made to applicants who applied within six months of the date of the announcement in Parliament. It has since been found that that taxation was legally imposed, but the refunds were made. Now the Government desires to validate them; but apparently we have no record of the amounts or receipts in respect to them. If the money was not refunded in the loose way which I suggest, and a proper record was kept, it will be easy for the Treasurer to supply the information that we require. I shall not hammer this matter any more. The simple fact is that extraordinary action was taken by the Government without a due regard for the facts. was led to believe that the High Court held certain things which, in fact, it did not hold; and that certain moneys were collected illegally. It was subsequently proved that the money was collected quite legally. In tEe circumstances the Treasurer should supply us with the number of persons to whom refunds were made, the amount of the refund in each case, and a return showing whether the persons-concerned are how dead or alive. Having that information before us, we should be in a position to judge whether or not we should validate the repayments that were improperly made. the paucity of information supplied to us, honourable members on this side of the chamber wil l not take the responsibility of voting for the bill .",23
77,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Balaclava) [ 3 . 3 4 ] - I do not know whether the Treasurer proposes to afford the committee any statement of the difficulties of the Taxation Department in supplying the information which the honourable member for Y a r r a has requested. It is perfectly clear, as the honourable member has said, that if more books were kept in the Taxation Department, statistical information such as he desires could be easily supplied to us; but, to my knowledge, as one of the administrators who presided at the Treasury for a time, the Taxation Department kept as few books as it thought necessary, and I believe still does so. The provision of statistical information by a department which collects revenue from , perhaps, 500,000 taxpayers, is most expensive; and if we desire it , we shall require to add largely to the vote for its administration. Refunds of - taxation-are made under headings whose number is legion. I do not think the b i ll is as important as either the Treasurer or the honourable member for Y a r r a thinks it to be, nor that it will matter a great deal whether we pass it or not; in fact, in my opinion, it might just as well be thrown under the table as be passed.",23
78,Mr SCTJLLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The right honourable member means that the three-years' l i m it is nearly up;,23
79,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Yes . There is a statute of limitation-of lamentation for some people-and the bill has been introduced almost at the expiration of the period prescribed - The Treasurer should have Parliament brought the measure down as soon as the law made it manifest that it was necessary.,23
80,Dr EAKLEPAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"It was introduced last year. "" Mr Watt - But it was not passed. The Treasurer introduced it as diffidently as he might introduce a blushing bride, giving us no chance to look at it .",23
81,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,It was introduced as an earnest of the Government's intention.,23
82,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The best earnest of intention in a matter of this kind is action. If In view of the Treasurer had given us last year the information that he has given us this year, I believe that honourable members would have passed the bill without delay; but it does not matter now whether we pass it or not. The bill affects to deal, in its three major clauses, with profits that have already been taxed. That fact was overlooked in some of the arguments of the honourable member for Y a r r a .",23
83,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Oh , no; it was not!",24
84,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"May I say that I consider that the. honourable member's speech on the second reading of the bill was one of the most industrious, clear, far-sighted and excellent efforts that I have ever heard on a subject of this kind since I have been a member of this Parliament. The honourable member had evidently studied the matter with very great care, and under some difficulty, for he did not pretend to be personally associated with any enterprise that distributes bonus shares. He had bad to read up the subject, and for that reason - his educative * speech on the principles of taxation ing this measure was the more praiseworthy. I disagree with him on one vital point. I think that we should argue, not as to the merits of taxation refunds, the difficulty of making them, the necessity for indemnifying the Government, and the wisdom of passing retrospective legislation, but as to whether we should ever have attempted to tax bonus shares in the way that we did. The honourable member for Yarra knows that, in all eases, this taxation has been paid on money represented by bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits, on which a double tax has been paid. If a company made - a profit of £50,000, distributed only half of it, and reserved £25,000, which in subsequent years was issued in the form of bonus shares, a double tax wa3 paid on the amount so reserved. The flat rate was levied year after year on accretions of capital before they expressed themselves in the shape of bonus shares, and when later the Taxation Department determined to follow to their destination bonus shares, and to tax the recipient shareholders on them, a double rate was paid. The money which all these shares represent has therefore been taxed at more than double the average rate.",24
85,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I said that they had not been taxed at the full rate.,24
86,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The honourable member said that the flat rate was not the fair rate in all cases. I do not say that it was; but the fact remains that the shares were taxed at a higher than the flat rate.,24
87,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The amount of was based on the flat rate, I think.",24
88,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The department erred in its own favour, and the rate of tax that, was levied on these shares was a higher average rate than the recipients should have paid. My experience in regard to the levying of taxation is that you cannot get absolute justice; you can only get as near to the fair thing as practicable. Our effort was to fix a rate which would approximate to the average. Unfortunately, the general opinion of honourable members who would tax bonus shares seems to be that 99 per cent, of shares of this class are received by the wealthy taxpayer, or the ""fat affectman,'' as he is commonly designated. I venture to say that if we had time in our busy lives to examine carefully the share registers of the joint stock companies, from the banks, the wool firms, and the shipping firms, right down to the smallest corporations of the kind that are operating in Australia, we should be astounded at the width of distribution of their shares. I recently examined the share register of one of the largest companies in the country, which has a capital of £2,500,000. It is a successful concern, and was originally promoted by courageous, wealthy people. It would not be fair for me to mention the name of the company. I only wish to say that I was astounded, as I wandered through the register, to find that of the many thousands of shareholders, there were very few who held 1,000 shares. The corporation was composed, very largely, of shareholders who held from 100 to 500 shares, and they belonged to all classes of the community. I should be glad if , at some convenient time, a few of the more thoughtful members of the Opposition, who speak upon these subjects, and are interested in them, would join me in making an examination of the share registers of some other big companies. In the last ten or fifteen years, joint stock enterprises have covered well nigh the whole of our productive and industrial field, and while, originally, the shares in them are taken up by a few wealthy persons, they soon become parcelled out, and pass into the possession of the general community. Trustees, widows, and minors, in very many instances, hold shares in these companies. I should like tax the honourable member for Yarra to bear this fact in mind in his consideration of the bill. Many of the people who pay the flat rate on shares of this kind have incomes lower than the amount of the exemption.",24
89,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,That is unjust.,25
90,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"No refund of taxation would be possible in those cases. think it would be almost impossible to collect the amounts that have been refunded; and instead of spending time evading taxation by on arguing as to the practicability doing so, we should be well advised to rate. devote our consideration to the merits of not altogether a good thing. subjecting to further taxation money, represented in bonus shares, which already been taxed. In my opinion, such taxation is inequitable and unjust. The b i ll does the best it can in a tardy to rectify matters, and for what it worth, deserves support. But prompter action should be taken should it be sary in the f u t u r e to give effect decisions of the courts altering the pretation of the law accepted by the biner cial community or the department. The taxpayers have been misled, the big trading corporations have been misled, and the Government has been misled, and I think the judges have faltered varied in their views of the intentions of been paid for. Parliament as expressed in the laws lating to taxation. I am sure that the honourable member for Yarra would find carry on without assistance. worthwhile an examination of the width and extent of the distribution of the joint stock shareholding in Australia. examination of the register of only Gippsland. a few companies would, I am cerand tain, surprise him and other honourable members. Take a corporation like the Bank of New South Wales, the shares was shut up. of which are sold singly in the share markets of Australia. originally held in large parcels. fact that they have been split up so much indicates to me that the people believe this to be the era of joint operation. Enterprises have been started in Ausbusiness tralia, since the war, by joint-stock tion of dividends. methods, which could never have been established had the ordinary private firms of a few years ago been left to inaugurate them. The corporations have been responsible for their establishment have had to invite the people generally to invest their savings in them, and the joint-stock corporations that have been established are beneficial to the community, and tend to stabilize the national credit. Such huge accretions of capital cannot help doing so. There is one other theory in relation to bonus shares that I desire to mention. When we gave the Commissioner of Taxation power to say I that companies should distribute a cerretain amount of their income, it was with the object of preventing them from being subject of to a flat rate lower than the average That, in m y opinion, was I believe that companies such as I have in mind has should be encouraged to reserve a good deal of their profits for the expansion of the industry in which they are engaged. way I noted, for example, in this morning's is newspapers that, perhaps, the richest proposition that Australia has ever necesknown in the State represented by the to the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr . interWatson), the Golden Horseshoe mine, is comnow asking for Government assistance. If I remember aright, no less than £13,000,000 was taken out of one or two shafts in the Golden Mile at Kalgoorlie and distributed amongst the shareholders and after working expenses and plant had But a period of relaretive poverty arrived; poorer ore had to be treated, and the company cannot now Something of the same kind occurred in connection - with one of the richest mines ever known The in Victoria-the Long Tunnel mine, in That mine was torn open dividends paid tq its shareholders as fast as they could be dug out until a smaller lode was reached, and the mine What takes place in connection with mining may take place in They were connection also with big productive enterThe prises of other kinds. We should encourage people engaged in these enterprises to pay reasonable dividends only, and put surplus profits back into their for expansion and the equaliza",25
91,Mr WATSON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,If that had been done in Kalgoorlie that town would not be in that the position it is in today.,25
92,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Quite so; and Western Australia would not be getting a grant of £450,000. I hope that honourable members generally will recognize that it is impossible to argue the question concerning joint stock companies and corporations fro m one side only. ter we understand these organizations, the more we realise the benefits they are distributing throughout the community, the manner in which they are extending the power of this nation to carry its war debt, and providing for the payment of satisfactory wages and the giving of continuous employment. In other words, this is an era when, without the operations of joint stock companies, we could not have tackled many of the biggest things we have successfully achieved in this country.",25
93,Mr FENTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Would it not be advisable to adopt the principle of exempting from taxation profits used for the expansion of an industry.,26
94,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That is not done, and there might be a germ of justice and benefit to industry in such a proposal. We adopt a reverse course. that secrecy is the badge of crime. It is assumed that a company that does not distribute all its income must be trying to defeat the tax collector, and that the saving and storing of profits isa bad thing. In recent years the last Government and the present Government have seen the necessity and wisdom of refraining from unduly penalizing companies which, although doing things for their own benef it , are at the same time expanding the industries in which they are engaged. I hope that the Treasurer will take a lesson fro m what has occurred, and if he has retrospective legislation to propose, will not delay it u n t il it becomes bluemouldy. This legislation is late ing its appearance, so late that it scarcely matters now whether it is passed or not. But on the ground that it intends to relieve bonus shares of double taxation, I support the clause and also the clause that follows. Dr. EARLE PAGE (Cowper-Trea surer) [3.50] - I do not intend to follow the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) in a general discussion of the wisdom or otherwise of the taxation of bonus shares. That, in my opinion, could be more effectively discussed on the question of raising revenue for the year's services.",26
95,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I discussed it because honourable member for Y a r r a (M Scullin) devoted some time to it .,26
96,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"In reply to the honourable member for Yarra, I said that The bet- I would not follow him in such a general discussion either.",26
97,Mr SCTJLLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Such a discussion would be quite relevant to this bill .,26
98,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I point' out that whatever may be the merits or demerits of the taxation of bonus shares, the attitude adopted by honourable members opposite is that they are quite prepared to let this bill pass if given a definite assurance that in f u t u re bonus shares will be taxed. That would not be fair , because it is not right that Paul should have to pay because Peter has managed to avoid paying. The question of taxing bonus shares is one which should be settled on its merits, and not because of its connection with the subject-matter of this bill . This, in my opinion, is a proposal to deal out evonhanded We say justice in a simple and straightforwar d manner. I should like to point out that if the judgment of the High Court in the James case had been given ° in 1924, there would have been no occasion for the introduction of a measure such as this, because the whole matter would have been covered by the bill introduced in 1925, which enacted that after the passage of .three years it would be impossible for the Commissioner of Taxation to re-open assessments. As soon as it was possible for the judgment of the High Court to be thoroughly studied by the Crown Solicitor, which was at the beginning in mak- of 1925, and as soon as the Government made up its min d as to its policy, it made an announcement of its intention to introduce this bill . The fact that the policy of the Government was as stated, was an indication to the Commissioner of Taxation not to proceed with the re-collection of moneys which had been refunded, as he might otherwise have felt himself compelled to do.",26
99,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Coul d he have done so?,26
100,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"He regarded it as impracticable for the reasons I have given; which, whatever view the honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr Scullin) may take of them, are considered by the Comthe missioner of Taxation to be cogent rear . sons. I should like to emphasize what was said by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr ""Watt) on the subject of keeping a separate account for payer and a record of refunds made to him from various sources.",26
101,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,This was a special appropriation.,27
102,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"During the greater part of the period during which this series of acts have operated, from 1915 to 1921, between 700,000 and 800,000 taxpayers were sending in returns to the Taxation Department. If honourable members carefully consult the annual budget statements, they will find that sums varying from £500,000 to £1,200,000, to meet refunds of revenue, have been voted every year. Considerable alterations take place in the revenue anticipated from assessments because of new information supolied by taxpayers. Taxpayers are required to pay the amounts at which .they are assessed within a certain time, and adjustments are only made subsequently. These adjustments were made in the ordinary way. There was no special appropriation for the purpose. On the statement made in this House regarding the policy to be pursued, taxpayers concerned had to make their applications for refund within six months. Those applications were dealt with in the same way as all other applications for refunds. It would involve a tremendous amount of clerical work, and the examination of hundreds of thousands of assessments, to discover the total amount involved. It is clearly impossible to supply the information in this connection which some honourable members desire. We have arrived at a stage when practically the whole of the assessments cannot be re-opened. There are only certain assessments, and these are very few, remaining to be dealt with. The proper course to pursue is to pass this measure so that the exact position of the Government and the taxpayers shall be understood.",27
103,Mr FENTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Maribyrnong) T3.54] I intend to vote against this clause, and probably against a number of other clauses of the bill. I understand that most of the people holding bonus shares are in receipt of incomes up to £5,000 per annum.",27

105,Mr FENTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,There ' are very few each taxin receipt of small incomes. Mr Watt.'-How does the honourable member know?,27
106,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,They would not be liable to this taxation unless their rate was over the company rate.,27
107,Mr FENTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I want to say in reply to the contention of the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt), that one might go through lists of the shareholders of various companies, and I guarantee that amongst them will be found quite a number of people who hold shares in several gilt edged propositions like the Broken Hill Company, big joint stock companies, pastoral companies, and banks. Their aggregate income from their shares in various companies amounts to a very considerable sum. They cannot be regarded as poor people at all. A comparatively poor man may be advised by a stock broker that, instead, of putting £200 or £300 into the Savings Bank for a return of 4 per cent., he should invest it in a joint stock concern. Such persons may be the small shareholders to whom the right honourable member for Balaclava refers, but if shareholders' lists for a number of big companies are examined, I guarantee that the same names will be found in many of them.",27
108,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The shareholders in receipt of small incomes will not be affected by the bill.,27
109,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Why not?,27
110,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Because the only persons liable to this taxation are those whose rate on personal income exceeds that of the company rate.,27
111,Mr FENTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I have not gone into the intricacies of the subject as the honourable members for Balaclava and Yarra have' done, but it appears to me that in this bill it is proposed to permit a number of very well-to-do people in this community to get off very lightly.",27
112,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"If that is correct, it is the justices of the High Court who are responsible.",27
113,Mr FENTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,No ; because they put the matter right in their decision in the .James case. The honourable member for Balaclava is thinking of the High Court decision in the Webb case. This is a bill perhaps £50 per to validate action contrary to the High Court decision most recently given.,27
114,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,It is to validate the action of the Government in making these refunds.,28
115,Mr FENTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I remind the right:, honourable member that the decision of the Hig h Court in the Webb case was confined to only one aspect of the matter. In the James case the same justices decided that all bonus shares are taxable.",28
116,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,No ' m a n in this House can follow the variations in those decisions.,28
117,Mr FENTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I think we are fairly safe in arriving at the conclusion that in the Webb case only one aspect of the matter was dealt with . In that case it was decided that the bonus shares were to be regarded as capital of a reconstructed company. In the James case the representative of the Crown, as well as of the appellant, asked the court for a general decision. . That decision was given, and it was that bonus shares are taxable.",28
118,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Reconstructio n may mean capital extended or added to.,28
119,Mr FENTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The court did not desire that capital should be taxed,' and quite right too. Upon the reconstruction of a company bonus shares were regarded as capital, and it was decided in the Webb case that they were not taxable. But I repeat that in the James case the High Court gave a general decision t h at bonus shares are taxable.",28
120,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,It is impossible to reconcile the two judgments ,28
121,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The court regarded the bonus shares in the Webb case as capital.,28
122,Mr FENTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The Treasurer has said that taxpayers were required to make application for refunds within a certain time.,28
123,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,That is so.,28
124,Mr FENTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I suppose that means that those who did not make application within the stipulated time will not be enparticularly in respect of taxation. titled to a refund.,28

126,Mr FENTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Fro m what I know of the matter, and particularly from the formation supplied by the honourable mentary member for Yarra, this bill has nothing at all to do with the course which is be pursued in the f u t u r e.",28
127,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"No , but it is in f e r e an announcement of a definite policy by the Government not to touch profits rate for companies. again.",28
128,Mr FENTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I believe that it is. Under this validating bill a number of wealthy taxpayers escape considerable taxation on money that is the most easily earned in the community. I agree with the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) that the companies take risks in their investments and do a certain amount of good in the community, but I contend that the country has been very good to them. Taxation should rest equitably upon every section of the community. I am against class legislation, and shall therefore oppose the bill.",28
129,Mr COLEMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Reid) [ 4 . 2 ] - I was not present when the bill was discussed, but having carefully studied and examined the various speeches made on the subject, I have formed the conclusion that carelessness was undoubtedly exhibited by the Government when in 1922 it introduced the original measure based upon the Webb case. As a member of the Opposition, I do not feel justified in accepting any responsibility for validating an act of carelessness on the part of the Government, whether this Government or its predfccessors.",28
130,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,All governments are careless.,28
131,Mr COLEMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,In this case the carelessness was of a particularly gross character. The Government should exercise the nicest possible degree of care in the administration and interpretation of taxation laws. * There should be a permanent standing committee of this Parliament to consider all taxation measures.,28
132,Mr FENTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Does the honourable member favour the adoption of the American system of committees?,28
133,Mr COLEMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"To a large extent, The responsibility would then be shared by their all parties. At present the Treasurer exercises a tremendous power in administering the taxation laws, and in . the public interest that responsibility should inbe partially shouldered by a parliastanding committee. It is regrettable that our method of taxation should to be so involved and complex. We have two parallel systems of taxation, one the n t i a l ^ graduated system of taxation for income andland assessment, and the other a fiat",28
134,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"We cannot help that. We have only two choices in income taxation-simpl e and rough, or delicate and complicated.",29
135,Mr COLEMAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That is so. would be wrong for the Opposition to accept any responsibility for this measure. I feel sure that honourable members generally agree that a standing committee should be appointed to consider all taxation measures. Most honourable members are not well informed on the complexities of taxation, and I think with the honourable member for Balaclava that we can all afford to pay a tribute to'the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin)' for the trouble that he took in preparing his second-reading speech on the bill.",29
136,Mr RODGERS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Wannon) [4.6] - T propose to assist the Government to make good its promise, because any other action would have a negative effect. The deed is done, and the bill is to rectify it. The principle involved in this matter is strictly not in test. If it were, I should have a good deal to say, and my vote would be cast against the principle unless it applied equitably to all taxpayers. For instance, what rights have companies over private individuals that they should be earmarked for remission of taxation on portion of their earnings, eithe. placed in reserve or issued in the form of bonus shares? Take the primary producer. He knows that in a country like Australia lean years occur periodically. He builds up reserves of fodder to carry him through droughts. He does not take those reserves into account in his earnings, but he has to pay income tax on them. If the principle of taxation were now at stake, I should vote for its all round application, and for the insertion in our taxation legislation of a proviso thatevery taxpayer shall have the privilege of setting aside a certain portion of income and calling it reserve or capital. This would place all taxpayers on the same footing. Discrimination in favour of those who form themselves into companies to avoid taxation should not be encouraged. The privilege should apply all round.",29
137,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,That principle is recognized to the extent of 15 per in the case of pastoralists and ordinary traders.,29
138,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"It is 15 per cent, in the case of private traders, and 33 per cent, in the case of companies.",29
139,Mr RODGERS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"There is in this bill It a discrimination that should not be found in equitable legislation. The Government should be assisted to carry out its promise, and to validate something that has already been done, whether rightly or wrongly. I reserve my right, when the general principle of taxation is discussed, to deal anew with the subject of bonus shares.",29
140,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Yarra) [4.9] - I am tempted to say a few words in reply to the general discussion on the bill. I appreciate the informative speech made by the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt). I agree with a large number of his statements, especially regarding the large number of persons who hold a few shares in companies. I shall accept his invitation to examine any. company registers that he may put before me, because I am always ready to gather information; but I would inform him that I have examined scores of company registers, and although there are a large number of small shareholders on those registers, yet I find that many persons hold small parcels of shares in a large number of companies.",29

The right honourable member for Balaclava supports this measure on its merits respecting exemption of bonus shares from taxation. The Treasurer chided him for raising that matter, and said that it had nothing to do with the bill. The honourable member for Balaclava truly reminded him that I had dealt with that subject at some length. I remind the committee that it has a lot to do with this bill, because we have to consider, not only its legality, but its equity. Is not equity the main thing? I should not hesitate one moment to support the validation of an illegality if I were satisfied that it was equitable; but, in this case, it is not. The exemption of bonus shares is most inequitable. Their taxation is embodied in the legislation of this country, and this bill constitutes one of the worse forms of discrimination that has ever been exercised in regard to taxation. cent, The exemption from taxation of bonus shares ""is - not only inequitable, but also illegal. Surely we have strong grounds for opposing the bill.",29

146,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I have received no information that would bear out the honourable member's contention. asked for information from the Government. We allowed the bill to pass its second-reading stage to give the Government an opportunity to obtain further in formation, but it has answered all our queries by simply saying that it cannot be obtained. This is not the first time that such a thing has happened. Some years ago I asked for information respecting amounts of money due on the leaseholds of this country. The Treasurer informed me that the information could not be obtained. I set about to obtain that information myself, and my efforts at that time led to the appointment of a royal commission. Notwithstanding the boast of the Treasurer about the finding of the commission, the facts that were placed before it bore out every statement that I made in this chamber. All the information that was refused me in this chamber was subsequently produced and printed in documents. I have a complete set of those documents, which may be perused by honourable members. When I am now told the same old stereotyped stoTy, I refuse to accept it . As a member of. the Opposition, I cannot share the responsibility of passing this validating measure. It does not validate the decision of the court, as was suggested. It simply proposes to validate the action of the Government, which the last decision of the court declared was illegal. It is true that that action was taken because of the interpretation of the previous decision of the court, but it was a gross misinterpretation of that decision. A layman, after examining the High Court judgment, would not conclude that the decision in the Webb case was that bonus shares were not taxable. The honourable member for Balaclava says that the Government's action in introducing the bill is merely a rough way of doing justice, and is therefore equitable. He said that these shares had already been taxed, and that refunds had been made to remove the inequitable double taxation. statement does not convey to - this committee the exact position. Under the original law there was a flat rate of 2s. 8d., and subsequently 2s. 5d. in the £ 1 on all companies' accumulated profits. department When those profits were distributed there was a rebate of the amount of the tax. Let me give a simple illustration. so. Consider the case of a man who paid taxation at the rate of 4s. in the £1 on an income derived from salary and diviW«» have dends. The £400 received as dividends was added to his other income, and he had to pay in respect of it the difference between the 2s. 8d. which the company had already paid and the individual rate of 4s. That was the only taxation imposed on bonus shares, and it was not in any sense double taxation. The present company rate is Is. in the £ 1 , and when dividends or profits are again taxed in the hands of the shareholders, less a rebate of the amount paid by the company, the shareholders are not doubly taxed. When the flat rate was 2s. 8d., the only people who had to pay taxation in respect of bonus shares were those whose individual rate of tax exceeded the company rate. Therefore the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) was quite right in saying that the refunds were confined to. people who enjoyed large in comes. The talk about the small shareholders in a company is irrelevant, because the moneys, refunded by the Government were received only by persons whose average incomes exceed £4,000 per annum. They are the only persons affected by this bill. That fact does not make this legislation right or wrong, but it emphasizes my contention that the people who will be benefited by it are few in number; they are what the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr . Watt ) termed "" the f at men."" That .fact adds strength to my contention that this proposal is not equitable. There are thousands of small shareholders in companies whose income, if received from some other source, would not be taxable, and they are inequitably taxed under the present flat rate. When the rate was 2s. 8d. in the £ 1 , those recipients of dividends on bonus shares whose individual rate of tax exceeded 2s. 8d. in the £1 were allowed a rebate; those whose in dividual rate was less than 2s. 8d. received no allowance. To-day companies That pay a flat rate of Is. in the £ 1 on all profits, and a widow whose only income is £50 from a small parcel of shares her by her husband, has to pay income tax amounting to £2 10s. . That is most inequitable. The royal commission on taxation, composed mainly of men prominent in the financial and commercial world, did splendid work, and made a simple and just recommendation, namely, that a flat rate should be levied on undistributed profits; the distributed profits should be taxed in the hands of the shareholders; the tax on reserves should be struck at what would have been the average rate of tax if the profits, had been distributed, say 2s. 5d. or 2s. 6d.; when the reserves were distributed, they should be added to the income of the recipient shareholder, and taxed at the individual rate, the company rate previously paid being rebated to the company. The existing law was passed in the small hours of the morning, and this committee has been afforded no information regarding the effect of the tax. The Commonwealth is being cheated by clever people, who are able to dodge taxation by the formation of companies. The right honourable member for Balaclava said that companies should be encouraged to put more of their profits into reserve. I agree with, the right honourable member. Instead of businesses being impoverished to pay dividends, more of the profits should be set aside to provide a f u n d which would be an insurance against hard times. I have mentioned instances-and the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) could add many more-of mining companies concentrating on the rich lodes in order to pay high dividends, and not setting aside any reserve for the development of the lowergrade ore. A similar policy is followed in other industries. I agree that companies should be encouraged to make reserves ; but should not the same encouragement be given to the private trader ? The honourable member for ""Wannon (Mr . Rodgers) rightly asked why our legislation should distinguish between a private concern and one controlled by a company. Tn one town there may be two large drapery establishments, one owned by John Brown, and the other by Thomas Smith and Company. Each makes a profit of £100,000. Both should be treated alike in regard to taxation. But the law allows John Brown to carry only 15 per cent, of his profits to reserves, whilst left to Thomas Smith and Company may put 33 per cent, into reserve, and pay only company rate of tax thereon. Is that equitable ? The truth is that many small proprietary businesses are being floated into companies for the purpose of avoiding taxation. Theroyal commission suggested that reserves should be taxed at a flat rate, and the company should get a ref u n d when the profits were distributed and taxed at their destination. Another suggestion is that the company should be treated in exactly the same way as the individual, and that may be an easier way out of the difficulty. But there is no suggestion of double taxation. The commissioner merely follows the dividends or bonus shares into the hands of the shareholders, adds them to his income, assesses hi m at the individual rate, less the flat rate already paid by the company. Every dividend issued by any company is taxed as part of the shareholder's income when he receives it ; yet it has come from profits which have already paid the company rate. Nevertheless, there is no double taxation. The only inequitable feature of the present companies tax is that the rebate is enjoyed only by those whose individual rate of tax exceeds the company rate. It should be rebated to all shareholders, and that can be done only by the rebate going to the company. I dp not believe in taxing the profits of a company. I believe in taxing the income of the individuals who many receive the dividends. Taxing at the 1 source is neither sound nor equitable. An income tax should be a tax on income at its destination. A shareholder enjoying an income of £500 should be taxed on £500, neither more nor less. The exemption of bonus shares will allow an inequitable state of affairs to continue. It will encourage the evasion of taxation amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds per annum. Day after day companies are formed for no other purpose than to evade taxation. They call themselves investment companies or holding companies. The honourable member for Balaclava criticized that section of the act which requires a company to distribute two-thirds of its profits, or in def a u l t provides for an assessment based on the assumption that two-thirds has been distributed. That provision was designed to discourage the evasion of taxation, but it actually discourages the carrying of profits to reserves. If the taxation were made equitable, companies would be encouraged to build up their reserve funds. The right honourable member for Balaclava interprets this bill as a declaration, by inference, that bonus shares should not be taxed. If that is so, every honourable member who is opposed to granting such exemption should vote against the bill.",30
147,Mr MAXWELL,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Votin g for the bill does not commit one to the exemption of bonus shares.,32
148,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I do not think it does, but the right honourable member for Balaclava said that that was the only justification for the measure that he could I do not think that it is. Honourable members can vote for the bill if they are satisfied that there is no remedy other than that which the Government proposes; but they must bear in mind that, in so doing, they will be lending their support to an illegality. I should support the Government rf I were satisfied that no other course was open to it. There is special provision in our legislation to meet cases of hardship, so that we need not concern ourselves with that aspect of the matter. I refuse to believe that it is impossible to re-collect this money, and I decline to share in the responsibility of validating the action which was taken by the Government.",32
149,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Cowper-Trea surer) [4.31] - The speechwhich the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) has just, delivered laid bare the fallacy and the misapprehension that underlie the whole of the opposition to the bill. It has been repeatedly said that the measure applied only to those whoso incomes exceeded £4,000 a year; but, as that contention was not seriously argued, I assumed that honourable members believed that it had not a substantial basis. The honourable member for Yarra has just argued that only those who were assessed . at a rate above the company rate received a refund in accordance with the promise that was made by the Hughes Government in 1922. That is quite erroneous. .Every taxpayer who participated in the distribution of bonus shares received a refund, whether the tax was small or large. I ask the committee to visualize a supposititious case. Let us assume that when the statutory exemption was £200, a taxpayer with an income of £198 in one year received from some source bonus shares whose face value was £500. That taxpayer would be taxed on the basis of an income of £698.",32
150,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Would there be no rebate?,32
151,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,There would be a rebate of the amount paid on the 500 shares; but the other income would still be within the taxable range.,32
152,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,-Would not the rebate wipe out the whole of the tax?,32
153,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"No . If it were decided to compile a list of those who discover. received refunds, it would be necessary to analyse every return which was made between 1915 and 1922.  The rebate of Is. in the £1 would wipe out the tax in a case such as he has mentioned.",32
154,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Of course it would. I point out, also, that at that time the rate would be 2s. 5d., or 2s. 8d. The ordinary rate on an income of £698 would be about 6d. in the £1. The whole of the company rate on the £500 would be refunded, and it would not be necessary to pay any tax at all.",32
155,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I have not worked out the exact details; but when the shares and other income together exceeded the general exemption, the other income was always taxable at the rate applicable to the combined income. The shares are added to the income at their face value to ascertain the graduated scale. Refunds were necessary when the shareholder's individual rate on his combined income from the shares and other sources exceeded the company rate, and also to the extent that the shareholder had paid tax or additional tax on his other income by reason of the aggregation of that income with the shares. I do not . believe that any honourable member desires that all assessments covering a period of six years should be examined. That is the reason for the Government's holding that it is impracticable to deal with the matter in the manner suggested. The real basis of its objection, however, is that three years ago the Commonwealth Parliament acquiesced in the action which the Government, on the definite statement of the Treasurer, proposed to take. The policy was changed in the present taxation legislation, so that what was done in the past should he done in the future . As taxpayers have for three surer) [ 4 . 4 6 ] years been under that very definite i m pression, we should validate the action which was then taken. It would be just to compel these persons to make an accounting of that money and return to the Treasury. This is not the proper time to argue the merits or the demerits of the taxation of bonus shares. I think that I have shown conclusively that, uncurrent less the whole of the assessments were examined, it would not be possible to compile an accurate return. I therefore ask the committee to agree to the clause. Question-That the clause be agreed to-put . The committee divided. Ayes .. .. ..39 Noes .. .. ..20 Majority Atkinson, L. Bell, G. J. Mackay, G.

156,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Cowper-Trea - I wish to explain the - circumstances that have led to the in clusion of this clause in the bill. The unGovernment and the Commissioner were so sure of their position when the claim it was drawn up in the James case that they decided to re-assess James's taxation and include in the amount the tax on bonus shares from both accumulated and profits, so that an authoritative test of the question might be made. James was told that, in view of the Government having stated, in Parliament, that a tax would not be imposed upon bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits, the tax would not be collected on his shares which issued out of accumulated profits, irrespective of what the decision of the court might be. We did not desire the case to be upset on a 19 mere technicality, and, on the other hand,' AYES. we wished to have a definite declaration Lister, J. H. from the court that all bonus shares were taxable.",33
157,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Y a r r a ) [4.48] - When the motion for the second reading of the bill was before us, I said that the Government could have had a test case stated in 1922 to determine the legal position; but the Treasurer interjected that that would have been improper. I replied that it was always possible to make an arrangement with a taxpayer to have a question tested' in the court; and the Treasurer said that that would be immoral. But that is precisely what was done in the James case. The Government asked James to agree to have added to his original assessment the NOES. amount of tax on the bonus shares which he had received from accumulated profits, but on which he had not been assessed, and James agreed with the proposal, on being given a promise that whether the Government won or lost the case, no tax would be collected from him on his bonus shares from accumulated profits.",33
158,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,That is not so; James was not asked to agree to our alterPAIRS. ing his assessment; he was merely told that we had altered it . .,33
159,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"If my statement is wrong, the Treasurer is to blame, for he has refused to give us informatio n which we should have had. B ut my remarks are based upon a letter by James's taxation expert, published in the daily press, which stated that James was assessed for taxation on bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits, and appealed against the assessment on the logical ground that as bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits were not taxable, those distributed from current profits should not be. Before the case came on for hearing, the letter went on, James was asked to agree to have added to his assessment the amount of tax on his shares from current profits, and he agreed to the request on the Government giving hima promise that, even if it won the day, his shares would not be taxed. Counsel for the Commissioner for Taxation, Mr Owen Dixon, advised that a complete assessment of taxation on all James's bonus shares should be submitted in the claims to the Court. If the Government could make an arrangement with James, in 1925, to have a test case stated on this point, it could have done so in 1922; and had it done so, then we should not be required now to validate an illegality three years old. Before the present Attorney General (Mr Latham) was a member of the Government he argued, when a measure was before this chamber with the object of validating the appointment of taxation appeal boards, the appointment of which the High Court said was in valid, that it was entirely wrong Government to ask Parliament to go behind a judgment of the court; but that is precisely what the Government of which he is a member is now asking us' to do.",33
160,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Cowper-Trea - ment surer) [4.53] - The honourable member's after remarks on several of the points at issue are not quite correct. In the first place, Sir Edward Mitchell was counsel for the Commissioner of Taxation in the James case, and not Mr Owen Dixon. In the second place, the reason for including James's full assessment in the claim was I to avoid the possibility of the proceedorder ings being upset on a mere technicality. James was told that no matter what the decision of the court might be in regard we are undoubtedly to taxing bonus shares distributed out accumulated profits on which company ment Bill . tax had been paid prior to 1922, he would not be asked to pay tax on those shares. No arrangement was made with him on the matter; he was merely told what the Government intended to do.",34
161,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Then what is an arrangement ?,34
162,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"There was a specific statement, but no arrangement made. The honourable member said in the third place that, because the Government had the question of taxing bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits tested in the court in the James case, it could have had it determined in 1922, by arrangement with a taxpayer. The honourable member seems to forget that no question as to the right of the Commissioner to tax these shares was raised prior to the James case.",34

Owen Dixon was counsel for the Commissioner in the James case, but I was speaking fro m memory. My error in that connection does not prove that the remainder of my remarks was inaccurate. An arrangement was made with James that, even if the court decided that he must pay tax on shares distributed from accumulated profits-and the Government believed that he should do so, or it would not have included them in the claim-h e would not be requested to pay it .

That is something which I urged very when this bill was previously The board will have to deal with the question of repayments under this measure. I stated beand now repeat, that the Government should not insist on the repayment In support of that statement. I propose to quote from the original act, under which the advances the were made, and I ask honourable members to note the points I make. Section 10 of act there the act of 1924 provides that(1) The grower shall repay the advance office with interest at the rate of 6 per centum per annum. (2) The repayment of the advance and the payment of interest thereon shall be a charge deon the proceeds of the sale of the dried fruits produced by the growers in the years 1925form not 1926 or 1927, but out of the proceeds of a particular crop-that for 1925. The section continuesfrom after the costs of production and marketing (not exceeding such amount as the Minister determines) of those dried fruits have been provided for. proFirst of all the advance was upon the 1925 crop, and no other. It was to be repay repaid only after the costs of production and and .marketing, as determined by the on or beMinister, had been received by the The growers did not receive sufficient to provide for the costs of proin duction and marketing. The Government admits that; but instead of wiping off the advances on the ground that the growers - did not receive the costs of production and marketing, it now insists that the adthe vances shall be repaid out of the 1926 have and 1927 crops. That is fundamentally It is a violation of the provisions he will of the original act. Mr J. FRANCIS - Is the member speaking on behalf of the growers? Do they want to repudiate their obligation to pay these advances?",35
169,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,They do not want the Government .to repudiate its obligations under the act.,36

174,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"That may be so, the growers made application for the vances because of the conditions under which they were to be made. Very strict conditions were laid down, as honourable members will see from section -9 of the act of 1924. It provides thatAn advance shall not be paid to a grower unless he makes an application in the prescribed form furnishing the prescribed information, and undertakes(a) to expend the advance entirely on material and labour (including the maintenance of the grower and his family) in connection with cultural operations on the orchard of the grower; (b) to repay the advance, with interest, in accordance with the. provisions of this act; '(c) to deliver the'dried fruits produced by him in the year One thousand nine hundred and twenty-five to a packing organization or to . an export merchant approved by the Minister; honourable (d) to permit any person, firm, or company (authorized in writing by the Minister) to supervise the cultural operations on his orchard, and to examine all books and documents in connection therewith; end (e) to comply with such other conditions as the Ministers determine.

179,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"That is so. It seems to me that before proceeding to demand repayment of the advances, the but Government should make inquiries to disadcover whether the growers had received the costs of production and marketing.

The Government has the numbers, and I am powerless in this matter. It assures me that the proposed board will deal fair l y with the growers, and where they are clearly not in a position to repay advances made to them, there is a provision in this bill to enable the advances to be wiped off. Mr J . FRANCIS - The honourable member appears to desire that the growers should be relieved of repayment, whether they can meet the advances or not.",36
181,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"In the circumstances, I can do no more than accept the assurances of the Government. Everything will depend on the manner in which the proposed board will deal with the growers. If it deals with them in a callous or arbitrary way, this bill will be worthless. There are-many returned soldiers engaged in the dried-fruits in dustry, and if they have to meet repatriation advances by the State Government with interest thereon, and also the advances made under the Dried Fruits Advances Act of 1924, they will _ be placed in a very difficult position. I have no alternative but to accept the assurance of the Minister that the board will deal liberally with the men engaged in the dried f r u it s industry. No industry in this country has had worse treatment. If any honourable member doubts thatj let him talk with those engaged in the in dustry, and be will soon be convinced that what I am saying is correct.",37

That is a novel argument to prohibition. me. It was only after the Government had ascertained that the collection of moneys on the 1925 crop would place the growers in financial difficulties, that agreed to defer payments u n t i l the posal of the 1926 and 1927 crops. board will deal sympathetically with cases.

183,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"Wimmera) [5.21] When speaking on this matter on Friday I dealt with several points to which I shall now briefly refer to connect up my remarks. I spoke of the muchvaunted settled policy of Australia and asked for a definition of it . I asked if the adoption of the policy of protection would mean excessive protection or I referred to my election pledges, whijeh were against excessive duties. I showed that, despite the prediction of the previous Minister for it Trade and Customs, when introducing the dis1920 Tariff, that it would result in a The reduction of imports, there had actually all been a steady and continuous increase of imports, with a corresponding decrease in the export of both primary products and manufactures. It was hinted by interThe jection that I was choosing my figures to I suit my case, but I would remind honourable members that I was then dealing the effect of the tariff, not on local production or consumption, but on the export trade. I said emphatically that . the slight increase in primary production was due largely to the enormous sums of words money that had been spent under the repatriation scheme in the various States during the last four or five years. When progress was reported I was dealing with agricultural implements, and I propose now to touch further upon that subject. Last Friday week, when the honourable  moved the adjournment of the House to discuss agricultural implements, the M in ister in his reply lauded the report of the Tariff Board. He said that it was an excellent report, and th?.t we should giva the board credit for its industry and its aptitude in marshalling its facts. I say emphatically that the report of the Tariff Board on agricultural implements is biased, and is the most one-eyed report that has ever been presented by any board to this Parliament. These are strong statements, which I shall support by quoting the report itself. One point strongly stressed by the board was the debt that the primary producers owed to the Australian manufacturers and engineers. The report readsThe Australian-invented implements have made it possible to produce wheat in the Comthe stripping of sandy paddocks. monwealth at a lower cost than in any country in the world, and 30 per cent, than in the TJnited States of America. In another place it readsThe agricultural implement manufacturers have directly benefited the primary producer to a quite remarkable extent, through the invention and development of the types of implements needed for the conditions peculiar to Australia, and which have enabled farmers here to produce wheat at a cost is probably less than that in any other country in the world. The Australian implement makers have brought into use machines of estimable value to the farmer, and of pari ticular value in subduing the Mallee country and bringing it under cultivation. It is sufsary. ficient, therefore, to say here that the primary producer is the direct gainer through the existence of the industry, and it would not be unfair if the primary producer had to contritural bute something through the medium of the Customs tariff in order to maintain that dustry. I contend that instead of the manufacturers and engineers benefits upon the producers as indicated in the report, nearly all the and improvements in Australian tural implements have been due to genius, not of Australian engineers of the Australian farmers themselves. go further and say that many of the imI provements in Australian agricultural machinery-I refer particularly to stump tions of the community. jump machinery-have been adopted the Australian manufacturers and Mr Stewart. neers only after the most persistent agitation by the farmers. Changing the types of implements always involves expense, and many of the Australian manufacturers are conservative and will not adopt a change u n t i l they are convinced that it is beneficial and likely to be a success. To illustrate that contention, I instance the Robinson B i g E harvester, a three-wheel' machine. In the opinion of some farmers at Woomelang, the machine had a tendency in the stripping of sandy country to side-drag. This made it heavy to pull, threw a great deal of chaff and wheat on to the riddles, and spoiled the sample. Some of the farmers thought that the machine would do its work better if the front wheel were extended. In the midst of harvesting wet weather set in, and, suspending operations, they decided to experiment with one of the machines. Taking it into a blacksmith's shop they extended the front wheel 18 inches. The result was a remarkable improvement in The other experiment was reported to Robinson's cheaper agent, and the manufacturer was urged to make the alteration part of the standard equipment. Some years elapsed before the company adopted the proposal, and then it imposed an additional tax on the farmer by regarding this alteration as special equipment, for which the purthe chaser had to pay a higher price. Howwhich ever, so many applications came from farmers in the Mallee for the improved inmachine that the f i r m had to standardize t , although the wheels were' not extended so far as some farmers considered neces",37

185,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"As a practical inventions agriculturist, the honourable member agriculshould know what he is talking about. the No individual, whether engineer or but farmer, can claim credit for having perI fected the Australian stripper-harvester. t has evolved over a long period of years from the genius of men in different secSo far from by singing hymns of praise to the Australian engiengineers, the working farmers themselves are responsible for many of the inventions and the improvements of agricultural implements.",38
186,Mr FOSTER,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,Tb e manufacturers do not deny that.,39
187,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"As a practical agriculturist, the honourable member should know the position. Earlier in my speech I quoted a statement from the Tariff Board report that the Australian agricultural implement-makers brought into use machines of in estimable value to the farmer, particularly in subduing the mallee country, and that implements suitable for Australian conditions have been invented and developed by Australian manufacturers. The whole tenor of the report is to give to engineers and manufacturers all the credit, whereas some of it rightly belongs to the farmers.",39
188,Mr FOSTER,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,I agree with the honourable member; but the manufacturers have been quick to snap up the suggestions made by farmers.,39
189,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"We are told that it is of advantage to the primary producers to have in Australia an industry for the manufacture of agricultural implements. The advantage is not all on one side. Oue of the biggest advantages enjoyed by Australian manufacturers over their competitors, in Canada, for instance, is that, being on the spot, they are able_more quickly to make changes to meet Australian conditions. I am not opposed to the Australian manufacturers, nor would I , by any action in this Parliament, deliberately seek to make their position more difficult, or destroy their industry. Every implement on my Mallee far m is of Australian origin, and was bought for that reason. The question in regard to which we join issue with the high protectionists is not as to the advantage of the local manufacture of agricultural implements, but the conditions under which the factories have been established, and shall continue to operate. Consider the profits that are made by some of the manufacturers. The report of the Tariff Board includes one clear illustration of profiteering. In summarizing the history of T . Robinson and Company Proprietary Limited, the report saysT. Robinson and Company was originally founded in 1854, and became a limited company in 1889. As a limited company, up till 1905 it only paid two small dividends. In 1906, 1907, and 1910 it also paid small dividends. It began to turn the corner in 1910, when slightly better profits were made, but for the years .1913, 1914. and 1915 no dividends were paid. During those three years the business was seriously affected by the drought conditions which prevailed in largo areas of the agricultural districts. In 1916 the company paid a dividend of 24 per cent., and in 1917 one of 5 per cent. This was followed by five years of steady progress, in which each year a dividend of 10 per cent, was .paid. In 1923 have the dividend paid was lo per cent., and in 1924 20 per cent. In 1924 this company, in addition, distributed £60,000 in bonus shares, raising their capital issue from 40,000 to ilOO.OOO out of the reserves that had been accumulated over a period of seven years. During the seven years in which the company was paying dividends of 10 and 15 per cent., it was not disbursing all its profits. When, in 1924, it did endeavour to do so by increasing the dividend to 20 per cent., it had such an accumulation of reserves that it decided to distribute £60,000 in bonus shares. The Board's report continuesFirms such as this one that 'have succeeded in mass production should not be discouraged. They are entitled to good profits, and the community that encourages such is likely to progress. The Tariff Board has impressed upon this firm the necessity for further reductions in prices, and will, in future, keep in touch with them, and with all other such firms simi-' larly circumstanced, and press for the limit of price concession. Here is an apology by the Tariff Board for the makers of agricultural implementsThe Tariff Board is impressed with the necessity, when considering the case of firms engaged in the - agricultural implement industry, such as this one, and the question of profits earned by them, to have in mind the very large capital engaged in the undertaking as represented iby internal reserves and bank overdrafts, in addition to the amount of subscribed capital. Such firms perform the services of banking institutions by extending long credits on hire and purchase agreements, which are of stupendous importance to the primary producers, and, furthermore, are involved in heavy annual expenditure in the maintenance of expert staffs, who educate the primary producer in the use and care of modern agricultural implements. Further on, the board again stretched its sheltering wings over the Australian i m plement manufacturersIn concluding this report, the Tariff Board would mention that, for some considerable time now, the agricultural implement makers in Australia seem to have been made the chief target of attack by those who are critical of the Protectionist system, which has been adopted by the people of Australia. The Tariff Board considers, in view of its exhaustive investigation and report, this industry might be permitted to perform its useful functions to the community without being made the main objective of such attack.",39
190,Mr FOSTER,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"I read every word of that report, and the farmers' representative says that it is absolutely unanswerable.",40
191,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"I am answering it . Here is another instance of bias in this so-called unanswerable report, and it is so subtle that unless it were read carefully it would not be perceivedIn order that price reduction on implements may continue and be assured to the primary producer, the Tariff Board is of opinion that a reduction of duty would be decidedly inadvisable in the interests of both the primary and secondary producer of Australia. The inference is that it is necessary to maintain the duties, and for the primary producers to pay the cost of keeping the manufacturing industries in operation in order that price reduction may continue, and that those who oppose the duties do not wish such reduction to continue. The report proceedsThe Tariff Board is, on the other hand, disposed to recommend that when the ultimate price reduction has been reached under the present tariff, and it be still found that there is a considerable percentage of implements coming in from overseas, that consideration should be given to further tariff assistance, so as to assure this additional percentage to the local producer, on condition that further considerable price reductions are assured, and also with the hope of inducing overseas firms to establish works in the Commonwealth'. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) has stated that the representative of the primary producers upon the Tariff Board endorsed that report. I shall not mention the opinion that is held by many farmers outside this chamber regarding a representative who would sign such a report. The only effect of having such a representative on the board is to give a false appearance of justice to the report. Many arguments have been advanced to account for the difference between the prices of imported and locally-manufactured machines, but the question that the average farmer desires to have answered is-ho w can the Canadian manufacturer sell to the Canadian farmer a binder for £ 4 2 , whereas the Australian manufacturer, who pays lower rates of wages, charges the Australian farmer £ 6 8 .",40
192,Mr RODGERS,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,It is a new industry in Australia.,40
193,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"The whole of the debate has been concentrated upon the recommendations of the Tariff Board, which has been vested with exceedingly wide powers. Section 15 of the Tariff Board Act 1921, provides(1) The Minister shall refer to the board for inquiry and report the following matters:(a) the classification of goods under all tariff items which provide for classification under by-laws; - (6) the determination of the value of goods for duty under section 160 of the Customs Act 1901-1920; (c) any dispute arising out of the interpretation of any Customs tariff or excise tariff, or the classification of articles in any tariff in which an appeal is made to the Minister from the decision of the Comptroller - General; (d) the necessity for new, increased, or reduced duties, and the deferment of existing or proposed deferred duties; (e) the necessity for granting bounties for the encouragement of any primary or secondary industry in Australia; (f) the effect of existing bounties or of - bounties subsequently granted; (g) any proposal for the application of the British preferential tariff or the intermediate tariff, to any part of the British Dominions, or any foreign country, together with any requests received from Australian producers or exporters in relation to the export of their goods to any such part or country; (h) any complaint that a manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the protection afforded him by the tariff, and in particular in regard to his(i) charging unnecessarily high prices for his goods; or (ii) acting in restraint of trade to the detriment of the public; or (iii) acting in a manner which results in unnecessarily high prices being charged to the consumer for his goods; and shall not take any action in respect of any of those matters until he has received the report 'of the board. (2) The Minister may refer to the board for their inquiry and report the following matters:(a) the general effect of the working of the Customs tariff and the excise tariff, in relation to the primary and secondary industries of the Commonwealth; (6) the fiscal and industrial effects of the Customs laws of the Commonwealth; (c) the incidence between the rates of duty on raw materials and on finished or partly finished .products; and (d) any other matter in any way affecting the encouragement of primary or secondary industries in relation to .the tariff.",40
194,Mr RODGERS,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"It s power in relation to any of those matters is limited to in vestigation, report and recommendation.",41
195,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"The powers of the board are so wide, and its operations affect so vitally the whole of the industrial and - economic life of this country, that its composition should receive the careful consideration of honourable members. In dependence of outlook, and freedom from bias, are as necessary in its members as they are in the judiciary, but apparently they have been chosen, not because of their freedom fro m bias, but in order that they may represent certain sections of the community. That is indicated by the appointment of a fourth member as a direct representative of the primary producers.",41
196,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"The Country party imagined that the board represented certain interests, and it clamoured for a representative. Its request was acceded to, but still it is not satisfied.",41
197,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"In the light of subsequent events, I certainly am not satisfied. Many producers believe that' the board is merely a. party tool, which carries out the policy of the government of the day.",41
198,Mr RODGERS,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,That is a proper statement to make.,41
199,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"The chairman of the board is a departmental officer. My brief experience of departmental officers has convinced me that they are intensely loyal to the government of the day, no matter what the opinions or the policy of that government may be. When a change of government occurs it is, with them, a case of "" The king is dead. the k in g ! "" It has been t r u l y said that in all of us there is a good deal of human nature. That applies with considerable force to those very excellent servants of the departments to whose loyalty T have paid such a tribute. When a board is presided over by a departmental officer there is the tendency to make recommendations that will please the Minister. The Tariff Board appears to consider that it is its duty to interpret and enforce the settled policy of Australia.",41
200,Mr BRENXAN,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"There is, upon moral grounds, an argument in favour of that stand. The Minister for the time being represents the nation.",41
201,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,It should not be a function of the Tariff Board to interpret our tariff policy.,41
202,Mr SCULLIN,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,It suggests the best means for giving effect to that policy.,41
203,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"This Parliament should not delegate to any board the right to fix duties without its sanction and approval. Under the act the board may make a recommendation to the M in ister, and he may, without the authority of Parliament, impose duties upon specific items.",41
204,Mr RODGERS,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,Parliamen t has given the Minister certain discretionary power.,41
205,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"It is quite true that Parliament has given the Minister the power to take such action. I shall cite a specific instance. Parliament laid it down that wire netting should be i m ported free of d u t y ; but when certain English manufacturers were selling lines of wire netting at a price that the Tariff Board and the Minister considered was lower than the price of a similar article of Australian manufacture, a duty was imposed under the provisions of the Customs Tariff Industries Preservation Act.",41
206,Mr FOSTER,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,That was a dumping duty.,41
207,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"The honourable member may call it by whatever name he chooses, but the fact remains that the most i m- intention of Parliament was departed from, and a duty was imposed.",41
208,Mr ATKINSON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,The Minister merely carried out the law.,41
209,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"I do not say that the Minister acted outside the scope of his powers; but I say, quite clearly, that although Parliament decided that i m ported wire-netting should be duty free it has been subjected to a dumping duty. Long live Mr ATKINSON - There should have been a provision in the Industries Preservation Act that no dumping duty should be payable on any article that was duty free under the tariff.",41
210,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"I do not agree with that at, all.",41
211,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"It is not often that I agree with the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), but I do so in this case. It would not be fair to Australian manufacturers if their competitors oversea were allowed to dump their manufactures here under any conditions with the deliberate object of destroying a necessary Australian industry. Provision should be made to prevent practices of that hind in the wire-netting industry by an increase in the bounty. My point is that duty should be imposed only with the authority of Parliament. The Tariff Board should not be a departmental board. It should be entirely independent.",41
212,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,It is so now; two of its port them. members are quite independent.,42
213,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"The board would be far more effective if its powers-were limited to making inquiries into the necesconstituted ? sity for duties and the incidence of the existing tariff, and if it reported to liament instead of to the Minister. I would be advisable, in my opinion, to point a tariff committee composed of orable members of this House, and charge it with the duty of considering the reports of the Tariff Board and recommending the amount of duty to be imposed. The present procedure is wrong. Apart from my disagreement with the extremely probest that I can make. tectionist policy of the Tariff Board, I have a great admiration for . its enthe thusiasm. I consider that it has done a practicable. tremendous amount of good hard work, and I make no reflection whatever upon it.",42
214,Mr ROBGEKS,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,The honourable member made a serious reflection upon it earlier in Ms speech.,42
215,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,What did I say?,42

Even if the members of the board were supermen, they would still incur adverse criticism. In my opinion, it would immeasurably help the board and add to the value of its findings if it were relieved of the responsibility of recommending definite tariff duties. If its reports were submitted to a tariff such as I have suggested, the body, committee could make recommendations",42
225,Mr RODGERS,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,Parliamen t imposes the and authorizes every alteration of,42
226,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"I challenge that statement, and quote wire netting as an sayarticle which is being dealt with by the altogether diffrom the manner in which It is well known that one of the main objects in appointing the Tariff Board was to make the tariff as flexible as possible. As to of the wisdom of attempting to make a tariff flexible, I quote from Making the T a r if f in the U n it e d States, by T . W . Page, w h o is the president of the TJnited States T a r if f Commission. saysFlexibility would be an undesirable feature of the tariff in any event. It is true that when any tariff goes into operation, experience shows that some of the duties in it have been wrongly calculated for carrying out the policy intended. It is also true that, as time passes, conditions in industry and commerce undergo changes which throw other duties out of adjustment with the intent of the law. necessity of correcting such maladjustments explains in part the frequent recurrence of tariff revisions in recent American history. But it sometimes happens that the change of conditions is not so widespread as to justify a general revision, and yet that it seriously affects some particular branches of industry. In that event it might well be desirable to modify the duties on the products of the' industries affected. Such instances, however, are not so frequent that Congress cannot deal with them as they arise. When the tariff is framed, substantial allowance should be, and in fact is, made for the ordinary, the seasonal, and other recurrent vicissitudes of industry and commerce. It is necessary to do this for the reason that stability of rates is far more essential to the public welfare than is the maintenance of an exact adjustment of duties to tariff policy. When the operation of the law clearly discloses that, owing to exceptional and unexpected developments,' some of the rates are gravely injurious, there is no valid reason why - Congress snould not give them individual consideration. Such a however, is quite different from what is implied by the term "" flexible tariff."" Undoubtedly there is something alluring in the motion of a benignly flexible tariff. It is as plausible as the maxim : Be good and you will be happy. Unfortunately, it rests on a mistaken supposition, namely, that it is possible to alter duties punctually and smoothly in such a manner as to offset with substantial preciseness changes in economic conditions, and thus to maintain equilibrium between importation and domestic production. But even if this supposition were correct, which it is not, a flexible tariff would still be an expedient of harmful possibilities. For it should :be remembered that the tariff, whatever the purposes of it may be, is in fact a tax assessed on the import branch of international trade. And it is an essential quality of a just and unoppressive tax that it should the certain in order that suitable provision may be made for its payment without destructive consequences. Tliere can be no safety in business plans when the payments which the Government w i ll exact from business arc unknown. This is especially true of an indirect tax, such as the tariff is, where ultimate payment is expected to be postponed, and all the intricacies and uncertainties of shifting are encountered. Under a system of flexible .rates the paralyzing sense of insecurity that attends a general revision would be made continuous. It is hard to conceive of any more damaging effect of a tariff on conservative business than would result from a substantial and irregular fluctuation of duties. It would instil into the import  this in turn would undermine the security of all domestic producers with whose products imported goods compete. Flexible duties, therefore, instead of promoting stability, would add another to the many uncertainties to which commerce and industry are exposed. I shall make one other q u o t at i o n from t h is w o r k in answer to the statement The made d u r in g the debate that the t a r if f of the U n it e d States of A m e r i c a has been made flexible because the President, upon the recommendation of the T a r if f Commission', has power to make alterations in it.",42
227,Mr COLEMAN,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,Does he ever exercise that power?,43
228,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"He has exercised it . in a very f e w instances, as the following q u o t at i o n will show : Modification of the tariff by proclamation of the President has been negligible. In June, 1924, the Tariff Commission sent to the Senate a report on the progress of its work. The time lacked by three months of completing the twoyear period for which the committee on finance had first proposed that the "" flexible "" provision of the tariff should remain in force.' At that date, the President had ordered no change of duty, except on wheat and wheat products, barium dioxide, and sodium nitrite. The commission, meanwhile, had received requests for procedure, investigation from 172 industries. Thirtyseven investigations had been instituted; but of these eight had been suspended, only three had 'been completed and their results laid before the President, and the rest were in various stages of progress. To regard the present tariff, therefore, as "" flexible,"" one must view it from a geological stand-point. A statement was made by the honourable member for P e r t h (Mr M a n n ) , w h i c h was r e f e r r e d to later by the honourable member for Boothby (Mr DuncanH u g h e s ) , to the effect that n o m a n can be a moderate protectionist. A c c o r d in g to the honourable member for P e r t h , every m a n m u s t be a whole-hogger; he m u s t be either an out-and-out f r e e t r a d e r or a prohibitionist. I d o not accept that view. I am not a f r e e t r a d e r . If a proposal were s u b m it t e d to t h is House to wipe o u t all Customs duties I should fight and vote against it . I believe in moderat i o n in all t h in g s . I believe that the i m position of Customs duties is permissible and desirable as a source of revenue. Dutie s are desirable and necessary also for the f o s t e r in g of new industries, but I q u a l if y t h is statement by saying that I do not in c l u d e t in p o t industries for the manufacture of dolls' eyes, mouse traps, artificial flowers, or many other finicking little businesses that could be mentioned.",43
229,Mr THOMPSON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,The honourable member would not protect such industries?,44
230,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"I am not to be induced to commit myself in respect of specific industries. I am dealing with general principles, and I say, speaking generally, that the benefits, conferred by protection on the secondary industries of Australia are very often far outweighed by the burdens it imposes on our primary industries. Mr E . RILEY - The honourable member believes in duties on dried fruits.",44
231,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"The duties on dried fruits were imposed before (federation, and have never been altered. Mr E. RILEY - Is it right that they should be imposed?",44
232,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"The dried fruit s in dustry has for a quarter of a century had the benefit of the protection afforded by those duties. My objection is to the continual increase of duties on specific items. Before I agree to further in creases I want to know where they are going to stop. If Mr H . V . MCKay having had for 25 years the protection of a duty of, - say, £ 1 0 on reapers and binders, and having had the opportunity to adjust his business accordingly, did not come to this House asking for more and more protection, I should be prepared to continue to give him the advantage of the protection he had previously enjoyed. The difficulty is that industries that have been protected are continually clamouring for higher protection. I believe that excessive protection is harmful. When we take such a huge sum as £37,000,000 per annum out of the pockets of 6,000,000 of people, that must have a material in fluence on the cost of living, and of production.",44
233,Mr WEST,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"It is because our protective duties are not sufficiently high that a revenue of £37,000,000 is received through the Customs.",44
234,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"I note the honourable member's interjection, and let me say that when proposing, in 1920, the imposition of what were described as very excessive duties the then Minister for Trade and Customs expressed the opinion that the effect of their imposition would be to reduce the revenue derived from Customs taxation. The effect has been to increase it . Now, the successor of the then Minister for Trade and Customs comes along with the old story, the old dope from the same old bottle, and asks us to believe him when he says thatincreases in duties will result in the reduction of Customs revenue, although all the predictions of his predecessor in that regard have been falsified by experience. I do not admit that in a ll cases the home market is the best market, but assuming that it is, it has to be remembered that, the taxation of the implements and tools of trade used by the primary producer in production for export is unjust and in equitable. Whatever may be the opinion of members of the Labour party with regard to the building up of industries in this country, I ask them whether they consider it equitable to compel the primary producers of Australia to pay Customs taxation on their implements and tools of trade used, not for production for home consumption, but for production which 1 must be sold in the markets of the world. That is what the Australian primary producers object to. There might be some justification in asking them to pay the Australian price for their implements and tools of trade used in production for local consumption; but to compel them to pay through the Customs duties levied on i m plements and tools of trade used to grow produce which must be sold in the markets of the world, is wrong, unjust, and indefensible. ' The real remedy does not lie in acceding to continual applications to this House for higher and still higher duties. The M in ister referred to Australian secondary industries as suffering from growing pains. That was a very f r a n k ' and significant admission, for which I thank the honourable gentleman. He made it clear that the idea that it is necessary to impose a duty to enable local industries to be established, and when they have commenced mass production, as the American makers of agricultural machinery have done, the duties may be,removed, must be abandoned because he quite frankly admitted that after an industry is established it is necessary to continue to feed it with fiscal dope in order to keep it going, and to relieve it of growing pains.",44
235,Mr FOSTER,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"""Was that said by the present Minister for Trade and Customs ?",45
236,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,Yes ; the honourable gentleman made quite a number of very useful admissions. Mr E . RILEY - I am afraid that the Country party is suffering from growing pains just now!,45
237,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"I am glad that in terjection was made, because it enables me to say that some representatives of the primary producers in this corner, whilst protesting against the tariff burdens that are piled upon the primary producers, feel that, as they are being crucified by this policy, they are compelled in self-defence to hop in with the rest and get a cut out of the tariff. do not agree with those who think in that way. If we get the Australian price for butter, wheat, and the other primary products of Australia based, not on export, but on import parity, and continue increasing the protective duties year after year, as is done for the benefit of the secondary industries, the result must be that the cost in Australia will be considerably increased. Wages will necessarily have to be increased to meet it . production wil l be increased, and the last position of the country will be worse than the first. The attitude adopted by some honourable members opposite surprises me. Do they not realise that the object of nearly every increase in the t a r if f - I admit there are some exceptions-is to enable local manufacturers to increase their prices.",45

239,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,It has in many cases led to reductions in prices.,45
240,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"I carefully qualified my statement by admitting that there are exceptions, but ' I repeat that in a great many cases the object of i m posing a duty is to enable the local manufacturer of the article to raise his price. If that is not the object, why impose the duty? I may be told that the manufacturer may temporarily raise his price, but that it will ultimately come down. That is mere prophecy, and I have said that the object of the imposition of a duty is to increase the price of the article upon which it is imposed.",45
241,Mr FENTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,When we started the manufacture of reapers and binders in Australia the price of those implements was reduced.,45
242,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"I have no wish to be one-eyed in this matter. I have said there are exceptions to what I regard as the rule. Higher duties result in higher wages, which increase the cost of production. Manufacturers and organized workers are fighting one another, and the poor devil who handles the pick and shovel is always a lap behind in the race. When prices go up the worker has to apply to the Arbitration Court to in crease his wages, and may have to wait a very long time before his application I can be heard. The workers are always a lap behind in the race. The real remedy is not the continual increasing of tariff duties or the granting of bounties, but a campaign throughout the country to secure national efficiency in workmen, primary producers, and manufacturers. It is to that our energies should be directed. The continual increasing of of livin g tariff duties is no remedy for our difficulties, and when the Minister replies to this debate it will be for him to tell us where all this is going to end. Costs of",45

244,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"Hunter) [ 8 . 0 ] - I should not have arisen to address myself again to the tariff during the general debate had it not been for the astounding statement made by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) that an agreement had been entered into between the Nationalist party and the Country party in Western Australia in order incorrect that they might present a united front in that State at the recent elections. He pointed out that but for that agreement, Senator Pearce, a member of the Cabinet, would not have been returned to Parliament. Many peculiar things take place in connection with election campaigns, but I veuture to say that, if one took the trouble to look up political history, it would be difficult to find a parallel case to this, in which a Minister of the Crown, who had agreed in Cabinet to certain tariff proposals, introduced in the for m of a schedule two or three months prior to the elections, had entered into a compact to do his utmost, if returned to Parliament, to reduce the duties imposed by that schedule. The action of the Minister for Home and Territories clearly proves that responsible government, as it existed in the past, does not exist today. This anomalous position has been brought about because of the endeavour to govern this country by two parties which do not see eye to eye on many questions, particularly the tariff. What was this agreement? It is only right that the position should be clearly put before honourable members. The honourable member for Wimmera, in this chamber last Friday, saidThe agreement between the National party and the Country party in Western Australia for the conduct of the last election has been quoted, but I shall quote it againThat as the present high tariff is inimical to the best interests of Western Australia, the full strength of the two ciations shall be devoted to securing a substantial reduction in the existing tariff. The object of that agreement was to .secure a substantial reduction in the existing tariff. No Minister of the Crown is justified in agreeing in Cabinet to a certain tariff schedule, and then for political purposes entering into an agreement to endeavour to reduce substantially the duties imposed under it.  net allowed him to do that.",45
245,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"The Government should at once investigate this matter. The present position is misleading to the public. The agreement continuesThat as a reduction can only be secured through our parliamentary representatives, neither party shall give its endorsement to any candidate not in agreement with this policy. That, subject to the above-mentioned conditions of policy being accepted as the basis of an appeal to the electors, the Primary Producers' Association is willing to co-operate with the TJnited party of Western Australia in running a joint team, consisting of two representatives of the TJnited party and one representative of the Country party, for the forthcoming Senate elections. The team so selected shall receive the endorsement and support of both associations, and no other candidate shall be nominated, endorsed, or supported by either association. The right honourable member for clava (Mr Watt) then interjected, "" That was an immoral compact""; and the honourable member for Wimmera repliedWhether it was moral or immoral, it was assented to by - both political parties. member of the Cabinet, the Minister for and Territories (Senator Pearce), accepted those conditions, nominated under them, and won his seat under them. He would not have been returned had he not accepted them. Many things in connection with political campaigns may be overlooked, but it is difficult to overlook an action of this kind on the part of a Minister of the Crown. It indicates that politics in this country are deteriorating. While this agreement was being entered into in .Western Australia, the Prime .Minister made the following statement:The Government recently found it necessary to submit proposals for an amendment of the tariff in respect of certain of our industries. These alterations were only submitted after the most exhaustive examination by the Tariff Board and the Government, and are based upon the principle of sane and reasonable protection to efficient Australian industries. asso- In other words, the Prime Minister told the public of Australia that the tariff which we are now discussing was in the interests of efficient Australian industries; that the Government had considered it, and had come to that decision. Every Minister is loyally bound to stand by a decision of the Cabinet, otherwise responsible government would not be possible. Yet, despite the Prime Minister's statement, Senator Pearce deliberately entered into an agreement with a section of the Country party in Western Australia. Evidently he had some qualms of conscience respecting his action, because, when opening his campaign at Perth he was reported as follows:He was not a high-tariffist, but he recognized that we could not have free trade. The Federal - Parliament was very strongly protectionist, and from every appearance would continue to be so. His influence had been used to moderate tariff proposals, and his position in this regard was the same as that of Ministers representing the Country party who were members of the Composite Ministry. When the tariff, after being considered by the Cabinet, was finally approved, he must accept that decision or resign. Yet, prior to* making that speech, he deliberately signed an agreement designed to break down the tariff.",46
246,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,Who said so?,46
247,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,The honourable Balamember for Wimmera (Mr Stewart).,46
248,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,I did not say so.,46
249,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"It is marvellous how honourable members quibble when One circumstances are against them. I reHome member that a somewhat similar position arose when the Country party, before the elections, made representations to their Leader respecting new States, and also the tariff as it affected agricultural implements. At that time honourable members quibbled, and they are still quibbling.",46
250,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,I did not - say Senator Pearce signed that agreemnt.,47
251,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,What matter? He accepted the conditions under the agreement.,47
252,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"That is so, but not say that he put his signature to the agreement. In any case, his word is as good as his signature.",47
253,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,Exactly .,47
254,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,Senato r Pearce's position was denned in his speech read by the honourable member.,47
255,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"The report of Senator Pearce's speech continuesIf he resigned on account of the protectionist nature of the tariff, no other Western Australian Nationalist or Country party member could take his place. That is how the Minister for Home and Territories denned his position.  about the agreement. The facts were published in all the newspapers before Parliament was dissolved.",47
256,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"The facts were published in Western Australia,, and I am entitled to place them before the general public. The Composite Government went to the country on a policy of protection, and as a result obtained the votes of the manufacturers and many of the men employed in factories. now endeavouring to show that an agreement was entered into in Western tralia whereby one Minister of the Crown promised to do his best to reduce the duties imposed by the tariff. There is escape from that position.",47
257,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,What would be the position of the honourable member if he were a member of Cabinet together with Senator Gardiner?,47
258,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"We should get on very well. Senator PeaTce continuedIf members from the State remained out the Cabinet, it would not affect the tariff iota. The probability was that, failing high tariff member from Western Australia, a high tarifnst from the east would take the position, and Western Australian representaFederal income tax. tives would still be in a minority in Houses on the tariff issue. That shows the motive that actuated Senator Pearce.",47
259,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"It is all right. ' Mr Charlton - If I were a member of a government that had decided on a certain policy, I should stand true to its decisions. If Senator Pearce had not done that, he would not have been that re-elected. A f t e r agreeing to a tariff schedule approved by the Cabinet of which does i the was a member, he pledged himself to do all that he could to reduce it . That was. a very serious thing for the Leader of the I did Government in another place to do. A majority of members in this House believes in protection. The Government also professes to believe in it . Yet one of its Ministers-and the one who will be in charge of the tariff when it reaches another place-ha s stated publicly that he will do his best to wipe out, or reduce, the tariff which the Government has in troduced. Recently, a bill providing for a grant of £450,000 to Western Australia was agreed to because of the disabilities which the tariff imposes on that State. That grant will be made from money collected ias Customs Teveinue. Western Australia cannot have it both ways. She cannot obtain a grant of £450,000 from the Commonwealth Treasury, and at the same time cut off the source from which that money is obtained. A double barrelled gun is being levelled at the Government. Not only do Western Australian members desire the tariff to be reduced, or wiped out, but they also want to get from.the Treasury a grant out of money received by virtue of the tariff to assist them to meet disabilities caused by I am the tariff.",47
260,Mr MANN,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,It is possible to get reAusvenue without protection.,47
261,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"I . wish that there no was no revenue from that source. I should like the tariff to be sufficiently high to enable Australia to be self-contained. If revenue is not obtained from Customs, it must be obtained from some other source. The next source is the income tax. But, for two or three years, the Treasurer has been endeavouring to get the Commonof wealth to vacate the field of income taxaone tion. In Sydney, yesterday, a big meeta ing of interested persons made representa1 tions to the Government to abolish the Should revenue both from Customs and from income taxation be no longer available, how would the Government obtain revenue ? We must not lose sight of the fact that Australia incurred a debt of .£400,000,000 in connection with the recent war. That money has to be repaid; from that there can be no escape. While that war debt remains it is useless for honourable members to complain that our income taxation is too high. If each person paid only that taxation which he thought necessary, how should we pay our debts?  debts if we manufacture all our requirements here?",47
262,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"If Australia were in a position to manufacture all her requirements, her population would be sufficient to enable a substantial reduction in taxation to be made. The establishment of factories gives employment to greater numbers of people. They constitute the home market for our primary products, and enable taxation to be reduced. The Government went to the country declaring that it was in favour of the tariff schedule- a protectionist tariff. Because of that policy it gained the support of numbers of people who previously were wavering. Before the recent election, numbers of men otherwise opposed to the Labour party told me that they were not satisfied with the attitude of the Composite Government on fiscal matters. But when the tariff schedule was introduced, they were satisfied.",48
263,Mr MAXWELL,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,Was it the schedule as that which we are now discussing?,48
264,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,Yes . Senator Pearce said that the present high tariff was inimical to the best interests of Western Australia. The tariff to which he referred is the tariff with which the committee is now dealing.,48
265,Mr MAXWELL,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"He referred to whole tariff. Mr ClfARLTON - That makes the matter worse. The tariff schedule was introduced by the Government of which Senator Pearoe was, and still is, a member. Yet, according to the honourable member for Pawkner (Mr Maxwell), Senator Pearce is now prepared to reduce the whole of that tariff schedule. Western Australian legislators are free traders when in Western Australia and protectionists when in the eastern States.",48
266,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,My objection was the Minister's claim that the election result was a victory for protection.,48
267,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"In view of this agreement, that was not the case. I did not know of the existence of the agreement until the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) referred to it last week.",48
268,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) read it.,48
269,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"The more light that is thrown upon this subject the more clearly is it revealed that there was a deliberate attempt on the part of Western Australian members to bring about a reduction, not only of the present schedule, but also of the whole tariff. I say nothing as to the attitude of the honourable members for Swan (Mr Gregory) and Perth (Mr. Mann); they have been consistent. But no Minister is justified in entering into an agreement for political purposes when that agreement is opposed to the policy of the Cabinet of which he is a member. I cannot imagine that Senator Pearce accepted this agreement without first consulting Cabinet. What is to be said of a Cabinet which, after having submitted a tariff schedule, based on the recommendations of the Tariff Board, permits one of its members to enter into an agreement to do all that he can to reduce that tariff ?",48
270,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,The people of Western same Australia accepted Senator Pearce on his public statements?,48
271,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"They accepted him on this agreement. Because it was thought wise to get rid of him, Senator DrakeBrockman was got out of the way before the agreement was entered into. As things were, Government supporters in Western Australia saAv little chance of rethe election. This arrangement was therefore entered into. It is no wonder that people speak contemptuously of parliamentary institutions. Men like Sir Henry Parkes and W. B. Dalley would not have stood for this kind of thing. If , during their regime, a member of the Cabinet agreed to something which was not in keeping with the settled policy of the government, he would have been called upon forthwith for an explanation. The position now is that the Country party claims Senator Pearce as a supporter of its fiscal policy. to Hitherto it has been contended that, in the Composite Government, the Nationalist party held a majority of portfolios. But with Senator Pearce supporting the Country party members of the Cabinetand he said that. Ministers belonging the Country party held the same views that he did- a different position has arisen. There is now the same number of Ministers on each side. kind What, will happen if Senator Pearce, in another place, uses his influence to interfere _ with the tariff ? Government can control the affairs of the Commonwealth in such circumstances. government. Until the Minister denies it - if he does deny it - I shall assume not only before entering into the agreement he consulted Cabinet, but that Cabinet sented to the action which he subsequently took. What will the manufacturers Australia say when they know that they have been tricked? The Prime. Minister went to the country declaring that his Government stood for protection, that it would do its best to pass this tariff schedule. But at the same time he perseeking mitted one of his colleagues-the Leader of the Government in the Senate-to go to Western Australia and to agree to what he could to reduce the tariff. What is responsible government coming to when such things are possible?  schedule does not show that influence.",48
272,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,We do not know what will happen. Many items which should be in the tariff schedule are not there. We do not know what influence local can be exerted by those five members of the Cabinet.,49
273,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,The schedule was prestroy sented before the compact was made.,49
274,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,That does not defor tract from what I have said.,49
275,Mr MANN,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,The statement of the orable member for Wimmera (Mr . Stewart) is not correct.,49
276,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"That really does not matter, because the same influences would have been present in the Cabinet. Senator Pearce stated distinctly that was working in conjunction with the Country party members of the Cabinet criticize in this matter. H is action demands the who attention of the Government and of Parfree liament. Whatever our political views, we all admire a party which, when in they office, shoulders its responsibilities and is [71] true to the best traditions of Parliament. The action of the Minister would not be to tolerated in the House of Commons, or, indeed, in many of our State Parliaments. Yet, in the Australian National Parliament we are asked to stand for this of thing in order that the Composite Government may remain in office. Rather than that the Composite GovernNo ment should continue, it would be better for the Nationalists themselves to for m a There would then be no division, and we should have responsible that government. We should not then have one section of the Cabinet standing for consomething, aind another section, while not approving of it , agreeing to it . of When one party controls the administration we shall get back to responsible government. The sooner that can be achieved the better it will be for the country. The state of affairs that has existed for months past is most unsatisfactory. In making this complaint I am no party advantage; I am actuated only by the desire to uphold the traditions of British parliamentary instido tutions. The signing of an agreement by a member in opposition to the policy of his Cabinet is wrong, and I would be recreant to my duty as a member of this the House if I did not draw public attention to it . It is clear that honourable members opposite have placed party advantage before political rectitude. The Government is not right in leading people to believe that it stands for the fostering of industries by means of tariff protection, when, apparently, half the members of the Cabinet are endeavouring to dethat policy. The disclosure of this agreement will at least have the effect of opening the eyes of those people who voted Ministerial candidates in the belief that the tariff schedule now before the comhonmittee indicated the accepted policy of the Government. I believe that three-fourths of the people of Australia are in favour of the protection of local industries. The Government played on the fiscal sentiments of the people in order to get returned to office, notwithstanding he that half the members were doing their utmost to destroy the tariff. I do not those honourable members are conscientious believers in trade, and appear in their true colours; it is to their credit that fight for their political - faith . But it is not in the interests of clean govern- anxiety to secure, at one time for ment that a Ministry which claims to have a protectionist policy should allow one of its members to enter into an agreement for the removal of tariff duties. I invite the Government to declare whether or not it had knowledge of this agreement.' If it had such knowledge, the Prime Minister had no right to make a policy speech in which he pledged his Cabinet and his party to a policy of fostering secondary industries by means of tariff duties. If the Government had no knowledge of the agreement, the Prime Minister should say so. If it acquiesced in Senator Pearce's action, it should be frank with the people, so that they may know that their votes were obtained by false pretences. At election time many things are done which would not be done at other times, but when the probity of the Cabinetis! undermined and certain members enter into an agreement for the purpose of nullifyin g the publicly declared policy of the Government, a serious wrong is done to the country. We cannot have stable government while this condition of affairs obtains. A return to one-party government will be in the interests of the Commonwealth, for we shall get away from the present system of intrigue and compromise, and the advocacy of sectional terests without regard to the welfare of the great majority .of the people. All sections of the House are prepared to help the primary producer to any reasonable extent, but the members of the Country party are always trying to wring some advantage out of other sections of the community. That state of affairs cannot endure. It is the duty of all honourable members to place the welfare of the country as a whole before the interests of a class or section. By the establishment of secondary industries a market will be provided for the primary industries, more employment will be created, and the country will be made capable of absorbing more population, thus reducing the taxation per head and helping to develop Australia into one of the finest countries on God's earth.",49

That is precisely the position of Senator Pearce.",51
289,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"Capricornia) [8.43] The Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Charlton) is deserving of the thanks of all fair-minded honourable members for having drawn - attention to the most i m moral contract made by Senator Pearce, the Leader of the Senate, in order to ensure his re-election. D u r in g the tion campaign the Government, by facing both ways on the fiscal issue, hoodwinked the people in Western Australia. and the electors in the eastern States. Ministers apparently considered that the end justified the means. The Treasurer said that there was nothing wrong in the compact to which Senator Pearce subscribed. Yet when the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) heard the terms of the agreement read by the honourable member for. Wimmera, he interjected that it was a' most immoral arrangement. He was expressing an impartial opinion. The Treasurer knows that the arrangement was immoral, corrupt, and politically dishonest, and that a party guilty of such conduct deserves to be swept out of public l if e . The Treasurer says that all this has been known for the last eight months, that so, it has appeared in the Western Australian newspapers, and that honourable members should have known of the agreement. But the Western Australian newspapers have a limited circulation in the eastern States, and I doubt whether the Treasurer himself ever reads a Western Australian newspaper. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), earlier in - the debate, also brought this matter before the committee. He said that so far as Western Australia was concerned the Country party and the Nationalist party, prior to the elections, came to the following agreement: . That, as the present high tariff is inimical to the best interests of Western Australia, the full strength of the two associations The honourable member was here referring to the Nationalist and Country party organizationsshall be devoted to securing a substantial reduction in the existing tariff. Mr Scullin asked' if that was a mandate, and the honourable member for Swan replied that it was an agreement entered into in Western Australia. Is it likely thab any honourable member would enter into an agreement without knowing all about its terms ? And is it suggested that Senator Pearce was not a party to it? The agreement continuesThat as a reduction can only be secured through our parliamentary representatives, neither party shall give its endorsement to any candidate not in agreement with this policy. That, subject to the above-mentioned conelec- ditions of policy being accepted as the basis of an appeal to the electors, the Primary Producers' Association is willing to co-operate with the TJnited party of Western Australia in running a joint team, consisting of two representatives of the United party and one representative of the Countryparty, for the forthcoming Senate elections. The team so selected shall receive the endorsement and support of both associations, and no other candidate shall be nominated, endorsed, or supported by either association. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr . Scullin) askedWas that the agreement accepted by the Government's representatives? To which the honourable member fop £wan replied-I am giving facts from which the honourable member can form his own deductions. We know from that statement of the unlikely position that Senator Pearce was a party to the agreement, and that the Governmade ment candidates in Western Australia - were out to deceive the people of that State in order to ensure their return a majority. If this is not political honesty and immorality, I do not know what is. Is it .any wonder that right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt ) declared it to be a immoral compact in view of the fact that the Government of which Senator Pearce was a member was committed to a protecbring tionist policy. It was quite in keeping with the action of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) in visiting Capricornia with a Country party candidate with the ject of deceiving the people concerning New States movement. He told people there that a considerable amount of interest was being taken in the New Australia and States movement in Melbourne, and that ducers who have to depend meetings of the Parliamentary New the home States Committee were held weekly.",51

Are honourable members aware i that the Treasurer himself is not a ber of that committee, and that the mittee meets about once in every six weeks or so ? I remind them also that only yesterday the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) took action to ensure Government business taking precedence over private members' business, which includes a notice of motion relating to the formageneral debate on the schedule. tion of new States. That action vented this chamber from discussing Stewart) the question. Is it .any that the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), in his book The Case for Labour, published many years ago, declared that coalition governments were immoral combinations to be of any benefit to the country ? It is evident, from the disclosures by the honourable member for W i mmera (Mr Stewart), and eloquently emphasized this evening by my leader (Mr . with Charlton), that the Government has dedisscended to unheard of depths of political immorality and dishonesty. The Leader the of the Government in another place associated as he was with Country most party members of the Cabinet, and Country party candidates went before the electors of Western Australia pledged to about a substantial reduction in the tariff. This, mark you, is the gentleman whom the Government has to rely upon to pilot the tariff through another place. obI should like to know what the 450,000 the workers employed in our secondary in the dustries think of this. I should like to know, also, what the manufacturers of those primary proupon market for the disposal of their surplus products think of it? I intend to confine my remarks to certain phases of the' tariff proposals and emwhere I stand in relation to the schedule. I believe in the granting of bonuses to assist primary and secondary industries in their initia l stages; I bei n \adejquate tariff protectifon for both primary and secondary industries; 1 believe, also, that we should, at the , earliest possible date, give effect to the party's new protection policy. CapThis will guarantee to the manufacturers adequate protection, and they in their turn will be obliged to observe Austrastandards in their factories and sell This will result in a substantial increase n our population, and provide a splendid memhome market for our primary producers. comA l l honourable members have received numerous communications from interested parties in regard to various items in the . schedule, particularly those items dealing - with cotton tweeds, cotton piece goods, and woollen piece goods. I do not propose to deal with those subjects in the The prehonorable member for Wimmera (Mr . stated, in the course of his rewonder marks, that the recent Farmers' Conference at Ballarat carried resolutions protesting against the present high tariff policy of the Government. That conference also passed, a resolution endorsing the policy of the Composite Ministry. If the farmers at the Ballarat conference had been sincere and consistent they would have supported the stand taken by the honourable member for Wimmera, and passed a motion of censure on those Country party members who sold their political principles for office. Evidently they were more anxious for the continuance of conservative government in Australia than that their principles should be given legislative effect, so they deserted the honourable member for W i mmera. It is apparent, from speeches made by Country party members during this debate, that they are ardent free traders, and are out of step with Australia's national policy of protection. If they had their way, they would flood this country with imported goods from, cheaplabour countries. ",52
292,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"I heard the honourable  that sentiment. The honourable member for Gippsland is what is called a ""shandyg a f f "" protectionist; that is to say, he wants protection for everything that the farmer produces and free trade in farm ing implements. He has also been referred to as a "" leaky-roof"" protectionist. So far as our secondary industries are concerned I fail to see any diffierence between the honourable member for Gippsland and the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) , who, at all events, was bold enough to say that if he had his way he would wipe out all tariff protection. The policy of Country party members, if adopted, would result in the destruction of all our big manufacturing industries and the unemployment of 500,000 people.  ber is talking sheer nonsense.",53
293,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,On the fiscal issue the honourable member for Gippsland speaks with two voices.,53
294,Mr COLEMAN,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,;-We remember motion for the adjournment of the House to discuss the duty on agricultural i m plements.,53
295,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"That astute move was taken on the eve of the Country party conference at Ballarat. The honourable member moved the adjournment of the House to protest against duties being i m posed on agricultural implements so that farmers could buy in the cheapest market, but he failed utterly to prove that the foreign market was the cheapest. It is evident that, on the fiscal issue, the honourable member for Gippsland is not as sincere as is the honourable member for Perth. One wishes to wipe out the duty altogether, and the other declares himself to be in favour of a moderate tariff, which will slowly strangle our secondary industries. Members of the Country party, if they had their way, would gradually strangle some of the primary industries in certain parts of Australia, especially the Queensland sugar industry, so that sugar could be imported from Java and other cheap labour countries.  anything of the kind.",53
296,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"But the honourable member for Forrest did, and he was Government whip u n t i l he was,passed out not long ago. It is .well known that the honourable member for Gippsland. and other members of the Country party are opposed to any effective protection being afforded to our secondary industries. ",53
297,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"The honourable member believes in what he calls >a. reasonable amount of protection, but he thinks that the duties in this schedule are too high. He tries to face two ways politically. I prefer a man like the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann), who is politically honest eonugh to say definitely where he stands. The Treasurer, I believe, is of the same opinion as the right honourable member for Balaclava concerning the Western Australian agreement, but he is. not courageous enough to say so. The honourable member for Gippslaud is not prepared to give adequate protection to our secondary industries, but on the other hand he is anxious that protection should be granted in respect of maize, millet, potatoes, hops, jams, dried fruits, his and onions. As a matter of fact he was a member of a deputation that waited upon the Minister for Trade and Customs  "" I want the duty on potatoes increased from £ 1 to £ 4 a ton."" Those present ac the deputation were Messrs. Rodgers, Bell, H u r r y , Cook, M . Carneron and Paterson, members of the House of Representatives. They desired to have the duty on potatoes increased by 300 per cent.; but they, objected to .45 per cent, protection on farming implements. They, therefore, speak with their tongue in their cheek when they say that the raising of the duties on items produced in the secondary , industries has the effect of increasing the cost of living to the workers. Will not the raising of the duty on potatoes increase the cost of living to men and women, not only in the cities, but also in the country districts ?",53
298,Mr LISTER,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,They were making that plea to the Minister whilst some of their friends were advocating a reduction in the duties on other items.,54
299,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"On e of their friends was most eloquently appealing for the reduction of the duties on items relating to secondary industries. That is arrant hypocrisy which will not carry any weight with the people. What are the views of the honourable member for Indi (Mr.. Cook) ? He delivered a speech on the tariff, in this chamber, on the 5th March last. He threw out his chest, and grew red in the face. The Age, on the following day, reported him as having saidAs a farmer, I do not want any more protection than a good road to my farm, a little duty on broom millet and meat. That is typical of the breadth of vision which is displayed by some (honourable members who sit in the corner opposite. They cannot take the broad Australian view. They stand on their back verandahs at their farms, look down their fields, and decide that protection on millet and meat, and a decent road, are all that they require. Yet the party to which they belong has a half-share in the Composite Cabinet! Some Nationalist honourable members from Western Australia advocate reasonable protection until they visit their State; when they assure, those who desire free trade, "" We will co-operate with Country party members to reduce the tariff."" In the eastern States they preach the doctrine of protection for our secondary industries. Honourable members opposite say that that is political honesty ! I should like to hear their definition of political dishonesty. I had to fight a good deal of misrepresentation in Queensland - during the recent election campaign. All the newspapers were opposed to the Labour candidates. The Country party candidate for Capricornia said that Federal Labour members would ruin the Queensland sugar industry if they had an opportunity to form a Government.",54
300,Mr STEWART,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,Is the honourable member now trying to give us a little of what he then received ?,54
301,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"I am endeavouring to show the inconsistency of certain Country party candidates, who took their lead from Dr Earle Page. I was told that certain honourable members on this side favoured'the wiping out of the tariff protection in relation to the sugar industry, and the introduction of black-grown sugar. Yet nothing was said of the free trade speeches in this chamber of the Country party. The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Hill ) , in a speech which he delivered on the 2nd A p r i l , 1924, according to Hansard, page 245, said I would remove the sugar embargo, and do away with Arbitration Courts and high tariffs.",54
302,Mr SCULLIN,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,He was a strong protectionist in regard to prunes.,54
303,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"He favoured the protection of prunes, potatoes, and m i llet and maize, because they were grown in his electorate; but he was not prepared jto adopt the Australian view, and admit that if the sugar industry were wiped out, the greatest bulwark of our White Australia policy would be destroyed. Without that industry, the north could not be developed. Despite the views that they have previously expressed,- certain honourable members opposite now claim to stand for a reasonable measure of protection for the secondary industries of Australia. ' That word "" ro'asonable"" is most ambiguous. If it means the lift in g of the embargo which protects the sugar industry, and the introduction of black-grown sugar, how can they say they truly represent the in terests of the primary producers? They may represent those who are engaged in primary production in a few square miles of Victoria, but they lack the vision which should be possessed by honourable members of a chamber of this character. It is difficult for me to understand why these alleged Country party members should hold such views, in view of the wonderful progress that has been made in Australia under protection during the last 20 years. A more rapid advance has been made during that period than in any other similar period in the previous history of Australia. Australian industries, primary and secondary, increased in value from £117,000,000 in 1903 to £392,000,000 in 1923-4; whilst our manufacturing industries .increased from £28,000,000 to £132,000,000. A perusal of the statistics discloses a substantial increase every year. For example:No. of factories . . 19,173 .. No. of hands employed 412,410 . . Value of the output Of factories . . £326,000,000 . . £34S,000,000 Surely those figures prove that our* protectionist policy has been a great success. The establishment of new industries should be encouraged in the interest of Australia's development. We should all welcome the establishment of such new industries as the.Ford Motor Works. The Australian tariff convinced Henry Ford that it was better to establish manufacturing plants in Australia than to pay the duty that was imposed upon the imported article.",54
304,Mr LISTER,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,Other s are likely to follow suit.,55
305,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"That is so. The Labour 2>arty's policy of protection is not onesided, nor is it confined to the back portion of some farm. It is a well-balanced Australian scheme. We, as a party, support effective protection for agricultural machinery and implements; but we also say that those implements and machinery should be sold at a reasonable price, and that in their manufacture the Australian standard of living should be observed in the factories. Our policy also embraces adequate protection for the primary industries. Mr E. EILEY - And for the consumers.",55
306,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"We wish to prevent the consumers from being robbed by the exploiters, the speculative agents, and the market-riggers, who fleece the producers and consumers, and support the Nationalist party. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) was very unfair in his criticism this afternoon of the agricultural implement industry. To answer his statement that the Canadian binder is cheaper than that manufactured in one has to consider the price which the Australian farmer had to pay for that binder prior to the 1921 tariff. It was then sold in Australia for £120. When the tariff was imposed the Australian manufacturer secured the trade. In order to recover the market the Canadian manufacturer reduced the price of his binder to £93. If , in spite of a substantially increased duty, he could make his business pay at that price, what sort of a profit was he making before the 1921 1922-3. 1923-4. tariff when he was charging £120 20,189 for' the same article. The honourable member for Gippsland, on the 429,990 26th February last, moved the adjournment of this House to discuss the duty on farming implements. I have never heard a weaker case than that which he put forward. It was just a political "" stunt"" to deceive the farmers who were about to attend a conference at Ballarat. The Minister for Trade and Customs effectively answered his arguments by stating that the agricultural "" implement industry in Australia gave employment directly to 5,000 men, and indirectly to between 3,000 and 4,000; that it turned out annually implements valued at £1,500,000; and that the cost of a 6-ft. binder in free trade New Zealand was £72, compared with £75 for the binder manufactured in Australia. Who would not be prepared to pay an additional £3 in order to support an Australian industry, especially as the farming implements manufactured in Australia - are equal to any in the world? I have heard practical farmers say that they are superior to the imported article. All this talk about the high duties that are paid by the farmers on farming implements is so much moonshine in the light of the facts. Last year £135,000 was collected by way of duty on agricultural implements. That works out at only one-third of Id. on every bushel of wheat produced, leaving out of consideration all other agricultural products. That is on one crop. Take barley and potatoes and the cost is still more infinitesimal. The fallacy of the arguments used by honourable members opposite is thus exposed. They surely do not seriously claim that there is any truth in their statements. They make them merely in order to please a few misguided individuals, whom they should educate on these fiscal questions. They have seAustralia, cured their seats in this chamber by misleading the people with false statements. What - are-we experiencing in Queensland today? Owing to the inadequacy of the local market there is an over-production of sugar to the extent of 180,000 tons per annum, which has to be sent abroad to compete with sugar grown in Java and F i j i where labour costs Is. per day. This surplus sugar has to be sold .at £9 10s. per ton as against the Australian price, based on the cost of production, of £ 2 7 per ton, so that our sugar-growers lose heavily on it. The Queensland sugar-growers are strongly opposed to the free trade policy of honourable members of the Country party. They do not desire to break down our tariff wall so that the products of cheap black-labour countries may compete unfairly with the products of Australia. The conditions here are incomparably better than those of most countries abroad.",55
307,Mr MAXWELL,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"""Why is it that Queensland sugar-growers produce more sugar than is needed for Australian consumption ?",56
308,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"For years the sugar growers in Queensland and northern New South Wales were unable to produce sufficient sugar to supply our local requirements, but the sympathetic treatment meted out to them by various Governments has enabled them, to overtake and exceed the local demand. The tariff protection has made sugar growing a payable proposition. It is only in the last two years that we have had a surplus production here. If another 500,000 people were employed in the secondary industries of Australia there would be sufficient people here to consume all the sugar that we could produce. The tropical north is not suited for general agricultural operations, and adequate protection must lie gaven even the sugar-growers to make it possible for them to carry on their work. Our great national fiscal policy has been good for primary producers, not only in Queensland, but throughout Australia.  member suggest that another 500,000 people would absorb the 40 per cent, surplus sugar at present being produced?",56
309,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"If another 500,000 people were directly employed in our secondary industries, it would lead indirectly to the employment of another 1,500,000, and an increase of 2,000,000 in our population, and that would be sufficient to absorb all our surplus sugar, because the quantity consumed per head of population is gradually increasing. The sugar-growers of Queensland are very anxious to see a big increase in Australia's population, provided that they can be given employment here.",56
310,Mr MAXWELL,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"The honourable member has not yet answered m y question. Why are we producing 200,000 tons more than is required for local consumption?",56
311,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"I have already pointed out that, owing to the adequate protection given to the industry, people have been encouraged to engage in it . As a matter of fact, many persons acquired land and began to clear, and t ill it before there was a surplus production. It must be remembered that it is impossible to clear scrub country and get a crop off it in twelve months. Many of the people now engaged in the sugar industry entered the into contracts for the purchase of their land two years before they got a crop off it. The sugar industry has developed in Queensland for the same reason that the number of factories has increased in Victoria, namely, that adequate protection has been provided to make development possible. Men of initiative and enterprise will always be found ready to engage in primary and secondary industries when they are assured that adequate protection, will be afforded them against the competition of low-wage black-labour countries abroad. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) quoted figures this afternoon with the object of showing that primary production had not expanded under our Protectionist policy; but he gave values instead of quantities. When he was asked by the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) to give quantities, as they would be more convincing, he side-stepped the question. I intend to quote figures, aud I shall give quantities and not values, to show how primary industry has developed in Australia under our Protectionist policy. In 1900-1, before we had a Commonwealth tariff, the total area under crop in Australia was 8,812,463 acres. In 1923-4, the area had increased to 16,531,186 acres. The production of wheat in creased from 45,974,992 bushels in 191920, to 164,544,701 bushels in 1924-5.",56
312,Mr HILL,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"The first year that the honourable member quoted was a drought year, and the next an abnormally prolific one. The year 1919-20 was one of the worse we have ever experienced.",56
313,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"Well , I will take 1921-2.",56
314,Mr HILL,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,That was an extraordinarily good year.,57
315,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"The wheat production in that year was 129,08S,806 bushels. The production of oats in 1919-20 was 12,556,111 bushels, and in 1923-24 it had increased to 17,303,325 bushels. A total of 6,764,005 bushels of maize was grown in 1919-20 and in 1923-24 the figures t had increased to 8,114,733 bushels. The figures for barley are as. follows:-1919 20, 4,287,927; 1922-23, 6,548,935.",57
316,Mr HILL,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"The honourable member ""is keeping to the drought year.'",57
317,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,It makes very difference which year I quote. figures show an increase. Will the Minister name an ordinary year t,57
318,Mr HILL,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,The year 1920-21 was a good year.,57
319,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"In that year 373,056 tons of potatoes were produced, and in 1923-24 the quantity had increased to 447,570 tons. The production of hay totalled 2,986,411 tons in 1919-20, and 4,051,934 tons in 1923-24. tity of sugar cane produced in 1919-20 was 172,973 tons, while in 1923-24 it was 286,004 tons. Wonderful progress has been made also in our vineyards. area under vine cultivation in 1919-20 was 73,326 acres, and in 1923-24 it had increased to 112,965 acres.' duction of wine increased from 7,649,404 gallons to 14,663,881 gallons in the same period. The production of raisins and currants has also increased remarkably. In 1920-21, 136,551 cwt. of currants were produced, and in 1923-24 the figures had grown to 304,294 cwt. We produced 168,177 cwt. of raisins in 1920-21. and 590,406 cwt. in 1923-24. The honourable member for Wimmera, (Mr Stewart) should have quoted all these figures, but he failed to do so. The dairying industry has also developed substantially. The quantity of butter produced in Australia in 1919 was 165,648,791 l b . , and in 1923 it was 226,665,853 lb.",57
320,Mr HILL,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,The honourable member is still using a drought year as the basis for his comparisons.,57
321,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"I have quoted various years, and they all show an increase. The cheese production in 1920 was 24,160,524 lb., and in 1923 it was 25,380,525 l b . In the face of these figures it is ridiculous for honourable members of the Country party to say that our great national policy of protection is suicidal. Our primary industries are developing on every hand. It must be apparent to even the dullest intellect, that the welfare of the farmers of Australia is closely bound up with the development of our secondary industries. The best market that the farmers can have is the local market. Every expansion of our secondary industries means employment at good wages for more people, and a development of the local market for the farmers' produce. The Queensland producers, at any rate, realise that the larger the market at their door, the better for them. One little customer in Australia is worth three or All the four on the other side of the world, because of the heavy transport charges involved in marketing our products abroad, and the competition there of low-wage countries. I cannot understand why honourable members opposite, particularly members of the Country party, should be continually railing against tariff protection and the secondary industries. The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page). went to the conThe quan, ference of farmers at Ballarat, and tried to face both ways. On Wednesday, the 10th March, he saidAt present the biggest exploiter of rural The industries was political labour. . . . The spread between the producer and the consumer would have to be reduced to enable primary The pro- producers to prosper. . . . The consumer was as much interested in the attempts of the producers to secure orderly and regular marketing and the fair apportionment of the charges for distribution as was the producer himself. Although the Treasurer undertook to introduce an improved system of marketing, he has done nothing in that direction. A f t e r four years of rule by the Composite Ministry, the primary producers now find themselves in as bad a position as that occupied by them when the Government came into power. In January last the Central Queensland District Council of Agriculture . convened a public meeting ""of dairymen and their wives, and the following subjects were set down for discussion: 1. The existing unstable state of the dairying industry. 2. The women and child labour problem. 3. The necessity of a Commonwealth orderly marketing system of dairy products as an equitable measure designed to secure a living wage to the producers for the joint effect of their labour and capital. 4. Ways and means of bringing a maximum pressure to bear upon the Commonwealth to invest its producers with a Commonwealth orderly marketing system for the following reasons:(<i) That the present unstability of the dairying industry is due to the ing unorthodox and inequitable policy of allowing a comparatively small proportion of our production that is sold overseas at prices regardless of the Australian standard of living and consequent cost of duction, to dictate the value of much greater quantity that is consumed in Australia, subsequently to its production under Australian ditions. (6) To defend and protect the home asso-ciations, interests, properties, and personal effects of our producers against the menace of an increasing production and depreciating prices which it is feared will early result from the Commonwealth Government's agricultural migration policy with its disastrous results during the Government's tolerance of the existing unorthodox and grossly inequitable marketing system referred to in (a) above. Evidently the dairymen of Central Queensland do not enjoy the orderly system of marketing that was promised by the Treasurer, although-h e tells us-hi s one object in entering public life was to provide it . ""While they are no better oft, the Treasurer has had four years of office at a very substantial salary. Another subject in which the people of my electorate are vitally interested is the cotton in dustry. I believe in the encouragement of both the primary and secondary branches of that industry, and there is great scope for expansion. According to figures supplied by the Minister for  that the value of raw cotton exported from Australia for the two years ended the 30th June, 1924, was approximately £500,000; while for the same period we imported manufactured cotton goods from other countries to the £33,000,000. I am pleased to notice that the Tariff Board, which has submitted a number of excellent reports upon articles manufactured in this country, makes a very wise comment regard; ing the manufacture of cotton goods. Referring to cotton yarn, it statesThe board investigated an application for payment of bounty at the rate of 6d. per lb. on cotton yarn spun in Australia. The application was based on the grounds that assistance is necessary to enable the applicants to establish on a sound basis the' industry of Mr Forde. spinning cotton yarn and of following with the related industry of weaving cotton piece goods, towels, &c. In the course of the investigation the board exist- visited the works of the applicant company where cotton yarn was being spun from the lint, and was subsequently being woven into piece goods and towels. The board was impressed with the undertaking, and with the prospective value of the industry in the pro- development of cotton-growing in Australia, the and also in the provision of a means for consuming large quantities of Papuan grown cotton. con- The expansion of the secondary branches of the industry is of the utmost importance to Australia. It has been proved that we can grow cotton superior to the best American middling cotton, and it has brought more favourable prices than any other imported cotton on the Liverpool market. It would be an ideal state of affairs if Australia could grow sufficient raw cotton to supply spinning and weaving mills capable of manufacturing here the whole of the cotton goods required in Australia. Apart from the increase there would be in the number of cotton-growers, it is estimated that the industry would then provide employment for a further 285,000 persons.",57
322,Mr MANN,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,Who made that estimate?,58
323,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"I understand that it was made in the Customs Department. Up to the present time, the primary and secondary branches of the industry have not had a fair chance to develop. The Queensland State Government gave the industry its first great impetus by offering guaranteed prices for raw cotton, as far back as 1919-20. The losses so far in curred by Queensland on that account are as follow: - £ s. d. 1920 crop .. .. .. 206 6 9 1921 crop .. .. ..' 5,317 10 6 1922 crop . . . . 23,016 12 3 1923 crop .. .. 40,389 15 10 - 1924 crop (estimated loss value of £80.000, 50 per cent, to be paid by State, and 50 per cent by Commonwealth) State's quota .. . . 40,000 0 0 Altogether, the loss to the State Government amounted to £108,930 5s. 4d.",58
324,Mr MANN,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,r-Does the honourable member wish that loss to continue?,58
325,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"I do not suggest that it should be continued indefinitely; but for a period of five or six years the Government would be satisfied in guaranteeing the price in order to establish the in dusfcry on a firm footing. In order to show the impetus that has been given to the industry by this method, let me quote the following figures as to the quantity of cotton produced in Queensland:Year. 1919-20 1.920-1 1921-2 1922-3 :.. ... ... 11,800,00 0 .1923-4 1924-5 The total annual value of the product is now £300,000. At the inception of the period for which the price has been guaranteed the basis laid down was 5^d per lb. for all cotton; but, owing to the setting up of grade standards, after the first two years this basis was destroyed, thus causing intense disappointment to the growers, which is evidenced in the decreased area being put under crop this year. the departure from the spirit of the guarantee is responsible for the decrease in the acreage being planted this year, I am of the opinion ""that the Federal Government should have reviewed the present guaranteed price with a view to resuscitating the industry. The losses on the guarantee are comparatively small when the services that the industry has rendered to the community are taken into account. The - depreciated overseas market should not affect the guaranteed prices during the defined period, because the growers have accepted the conditions outlined at the outset, and have laid themselves out to produce cotton on a large scale. In many instances they have in creased their liabilities by purchasing additional implements, and more especially have they responded to the appeal to grow cotton of a high quality. The prices now guaranteed by the Federal Government are inadequate, and it is felt that they are having a depreciating influence on the anticipated bounty, thus prejudicing the expansion of the industry in Australia. It will be remembered that the guaranteed prices fixed for the ' 1925-6 season were from 2$d. to 5d. per lb. I am glad to notice that the growers in Central Queensland are most active in their endeavour to secure an increase in the prices for the coming season. They have approached the State Premier (Mr . MCCormack). According to a report in the Rockhampton B u l l r i in of the 16th MarchAn increase of i d . per lb. in the guarantee for the present season's cotton crop on the part of the State Government, provided that the Commonwealth Government would similarly give an increase of id., was promised by the Minister for Agriculture, Mr Forgan Smith, to a deputation representing the Cotton Advisory Board today. Lb. The present guarantee is 5d. per lb., so that 57,065 if the Federal Government agrees to the pro:. 940,125 posal the guarantee will be increased to 6d. 3,876,67 9 The deputation comprised Messrs. L. B. MCGregor (Director of the Agricultural 15,137,77 4 ' Council), G. E. MCDonald, D. C. Pryce, and 18,188,051 B. J. Webster, members of the Cotton Advisory Board. Mr MCDonald said the conditions were seriously harassing the growers, who were getting a very light return. I hope that the Prime Minister- (Mr . Bruce) and his colleagues will accede to the request from the growers for an in crease of I d . per lb. in the guaranteed price. The Queensland Government has agreed to grant i d . per lb. towards this Since increase if the Federal Government will grant the other £d.' Surely, with the resources of the Commonwealth behind it , this Government will readily consent to the proposal, if it has the interests of the growers at heart. There has been a request put forward for a bounty of 2d. per lb. over a period of ten years to establish the cotton-growing industryi n Queensland on a sound basis. This request was made to the Federal Government before the last elections, and it said that it would refer it to the Tariff Board. I hope that the report of the board, when it is submitted, will recommend a favourable reply to the request. Unfortunately the cotton-growing industry in Queensland has not been as successful as was predicted.' This bias been due largely to dry seasons. The last three seasons were unfavorable. The drought of 1922 was followed by a season in which pests did a great deal of damage to the crop. I am advancing these circumstances as reasons in support of the request for a bounty of 2d. per l b . on raw cotton. Cotton, is as sensitive to seasonal vicissitudes as are many other agricultural products. In the United States of America the cotton crop fluctuates between a feast and a famine. In one year there is a great surplus, and in the next, perhaps, a great scarcity. That is why transactions in cotton rank with the biggest gambles on the stock exchanges in America. In 1914, the crop in America was 15,000,000 bales. In 1921, it was 7,953,641 bales. For the three years * ending 1923, the average American crop was less than 10,000,000 bales. In 1924, it expanded to 13,627,936 bales, and in 1925 it was 13,588,000 bales. I mention these facts to show what a great opportunity there is for Australia in the cotton industry, if a bounty of 2d. per lb. is paid by the Commonwealth. In a reasonably good season next year, the Queensland crop might easily reach 35,000,000 lb. of seed cotton. That would be merely a drop in the ocean of the world's market. Thirty-five million pound of cotton represents only 70,000 bales of 500 lb. each, and in one American State, Texas, last season there was a yield of over 4,000,000 bales. It will be a""long time before we can reach that, but we should first be able to supply our own spinning and weaving mills in Australia. The results from cotton-growing in Texas should be an example and an inspiration to the Australian cotton-grower. Cotton is grown and picked there chiefly by white labour, and under climatic conditions very similar to those of Queensland. There is in our favour the cheapness and virginal richness of our lands, and the absence of the dreaded boll weevil, which has been a frightful pest in America, and has caused a falling off of millions of bales in the American production of cotton. Let us hope that we shall have no experience of that pest in Australia. Europe draws three-fifths of all its requirements in cotton from the TJnited States of America, where high wages are paid. Australia has nothing to fear on the ground that the Australian standard of wages . cannot be paid in the industry here. The Americans have no fear of over production of cotton, and we need not fear over production here, because Great Britain is today very much concerned about the sources from which she will obtain her cotton in the future. America. today is not producing as much cotton as she did eleven years ago. Therein lies. Australia's chance. Last year England took 2,545,123 bales of American lint. Germany took 1,852,723 bales, and Japan took 701,575 bales. The cotton imported by Japan was worth £35,000,000, and was imported from the Gulf of Mexico. The importations of Japan are very significant for Australia, because they show market which would be open to us for our surplus production of cotMr Forde. ton. Japan requires raw cotton to the value of £35,000,000 a year, and Australia might very well aspire to capture that trade. That is one reason why I am pleading for the encouragement of the cotton-growing industry by the payment of a bounty of 2d. per lb. on raw cotton grown in Australia for a period of ten years. Mr MAA N:-Egyp t would be a comT petitor in the supply of raw cotton.",58
326,Mr FORDE,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"Yes , England spends every year £200,000,000 in the purchase of raw cotton, and of that amount she spends about £30,000,000 a year in Egypt. If in Australia we could get even £10,000,000 a year for our production of raw cotton, what a wonderful thing it would be for this country. The sugar industry is worth £10,000,000 a year, but the cotton industry in Queensland in ten years' time might be worth £15,000,000 a. year. That should be our aim. Although the prices of cotton lint have slumped, the passing of the severe depression in Europe will, I believe, tend to an increase in the pi'ices offered for cotton. The. normal world demand for the raw product is not being met by present-world - production. America, which previously supplied Europe with raw cotton, has now established her spinning industry to meet the wants of her ever-expanding population. Great Britain will have to look to the dominions to supply her with raw cotton in the future. In the TJnited States of America cotton is spun within sight of the fields on which it is grown. That is what I hope to see in central Queensland, which is the greatest cotton-growing district in Australia. There are some thousands of cotton-growers there, and I hope that, in time, in central Queensland, we shall have Australian cotton spun within sight of the fields on which it is grown. If honourable members opposite take the desired interest in this matter they will support the request for a Commonwealth bounty of 2d. per lb. over a period of ten years. Last year American mills absorbed 6,191,349 bales of raw cotton, which was less than 2,000,000 bales short of her production in 1921. These figures the show that America cannot be depended upon to continue to supply the requirements of Great Britain, or of Japan, especially in view of the destruction caused by the boll weevil in American crops. The big factor to make cotton a great success, as wool has been, in the development of Australia's resources, will be quality as the first principle of production. In Queensland we have gone a long way on the road towards improvement of the quality of the cotton produced. The very best kind of' cotton, the Durango cotton, is now being grown extensively. The Government planted experimental plots for the growth of cotton seed, and subsequently distributed the seed to Queensland growers, with the result that today practically 75 per cent, of the cotton grown in Queensl and is of the Durango type. One finds on going into the figures that in America, for one purpose or another, the people use 26 lb. of cotton per head of population per annum. Taking the Australian average at 20 lb. per head per annum of our popu la tion, our annual consumption of raw cotton would be 120,000,000 lb., which is seven times the quantity of raw cotton which Australia produces today. It is estimated that if we grew all our raw cotton and manufactured all our requirements of cotton goods we could absorb 280,000 additional people in Australia. That would create a greater market for our sugar, butter, wheat, maize and potatoes, and it would not be necessary for members of the Country party to look for an increase of 300 per cent, in the duty on potatoes.. ""We have to take into consideration the by-products of the cotton industry which are all obtained from the seed. In America the seed is now being full y utilized. Forty years ago it was considered to be absolutely worthless. In 1914, a record year for the production of cotton in America, 6,000^000 tons of cotton seed were treated, which produced 230,000,000 gallons of oil , 2,750,000 lb. nf meal and 200,000 tons of linters. These manufactured, nroducts were valued at £100,000,000. These figures show what a wonderful industry the cotton in dustry is. In the cotton industry in Queensland we have had some of the best cotton experts that could' be obtained from America. Unfortunately, several of them were not conversant with Queensland conditions, and their advice was not so valuable as that of some of the experienced farmers. The cotton industry no longer belongs to any one State, and cotton-growers put that to the Federal Government as one of the reasons why cotton-growing should be treated as a great national industry, and why the claim for payment of a bounty of 2d. per lb. upon the cotton produced in Australia is justified. . Cotton-growers are quite within their rights in asking for this bounty for a period of ten years, or for five years at least. I know that the Minister for Trade and Customs will consider the request sympathetically. The granting of the bounty would guarantee the growers against loss. They have already spent a great deal on machinery and equipment. They have now gone into the industry, and cannot retrace their steps. W it h proper encouragement, they should be in a position in a few years to supply the whole of Australia's re: quirements of raw cotton. An embargo should be imposed on the importation of raw cotton as soon as the cotton-growers of Australia can supply the requirements of cotton-spinning mills and weaving mills that will be established here in the next five years if effective tariff protection is given to both primary and secondary branches of the cotton industry. The Queensland primary producers' organization scheme at present provides an arrangement with individual farmers in each industry to keep records showing the cost of production. Up to the present we have no very reliable fibres to show what it costs to produce cotton. Under the scheme for the keeping of records, it will not be long before reliable fierures can be obtained. The cost of production should be on a fair and generous scale, the basis of which should be decided upon by the Queensland Council of Agriculture, and approved by the Director of Agriculture. The growers of cotton should have some say as to the basis on which it is decided. In my opinion, there is a great future for the cotton industry of Queensland if the errowers co-operatively control the cotton from the farm through the ginneries, and also look after the marketing of the product. W it h a view to the adoption of this course, the Queensland Government recently established the Queensland Cotton Pool Board, which has all the necessary powers to handle the cotton, purchase and sell it , and finance the crop. Now the cotton-growers are very wisely endeavouring to purchase plant and equipment from the British-Australian Cotton Growing Association at a fair valuation. They will pay for it over a term of years out of the returns from their crops, so that they may control the whole industry. It is a very wise move on the part of the growers to control their industry from the farm to the market. If the Government will afford the desired impetus to the cotton industry in Queensland, and if it will give a bounty on the manufacture of cotton yarn in. Australia, and thus encourage the secondary industry to work in conjunction with the primary industry, I believe that cotton-growing will become one of the greatest industries in Australia, and will do much to absorb the additional 2,000,000 people who are necessary in order that we may consume all our surplus primary produce, such as sugar, 40 per cent, of which is sold abroad at a loss to the growers of Queensland.",60
327,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"Swan) [10.1] - I do not know whether the passage of the Power Alcohol Bounty Bill had any effect on the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde), but I am afraid that if our economics were based on his utterances, the condition of Australia would be bad indeed. If we placed an import embargo on all the things that Australia could produce, it would not be long before embargoes would be imposed on Australian produce in other countries. ever, I did not rise to discuss the question raised by the honourable member for Capricornia, but reply to the charge made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) against a colleague of mine from Western Australia: The Leader of the Opposition showed great heat, and professed to be astounded at what he denounced as the politically immoral practices of Senator Pearce. I wondered what was behind his tirade, and after some consideration, I began to appreciate the reasons that actuated him. I am satisfied that he did not think there was anything improper in what Senator Pearce did; but he realized that, having regard to the action taken in Western Australia, to the result of the elections there, to the fact that the people all over Australia are beginning to realise that high tariffs are not good for this country, and to the good work done by the Town and County Union in pointing out the dire effects of the high protection policy, he must find some way of making an attack. In Western Australia, we have a National party, a Country party, and a Labour party. - Dr MALONEY - Is - there a National Union ?",62
328,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"I believe there is. The parties were anxious to overcome the difficulty that existed in the previous Senate election, when a large number of. candidates went to the poll. The National party in Western Australia has no association with the National party here. The Country party in Western Australia is a low-tariff party, and it has a different policy from that of the Country party in Victoria. I believe that the Country party in Victoria is beginning to realise the need for more moderate duties. The people of Western Australia feel that high tariffs make production in that State almost impossible. The long distances that separate them from manufacturing centres may have something to do with that opinion. Representatives of the Country party and the National party met together. They were alike desirous of going before the country united. That was not because they feared the advent How- of a Government such as that extolled by the honourable member, not because they wished to see controlling this Comto monwealth a Government like the Lang Government of New South Wales; but because they wanted a Government that would act sternly and strongly against certain disturbers of the peace. They also sought a common policy, in regard to the tariff, and they decided upon a policy of moderate protection. The candidates accepted by the Nationalists were Senator Pearce and Senator Lynch, and the Country party was given the possibility of one - member. Honourable members opposite have said that Senator Pearce signed an agreement. No request was made to him or to me, or to any other candidate, to sign* an agreement.",62
329,Mr MAHONY,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"They had the honourable member "" in the bag.""",63
330,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"The honourable member knows how true that statement is in regard to the tariff . When on the election platform, Senator Pearce stated his policy in regard to the tariff clearly and distinctly, and also enunciated the general policy of the Government. members opposite may be pledged body and soul to the platform prepared for them, but I am not pledged to any platform, and I presume that Senator Pearce is not; but we are expected to give general support .to the party's policy. He asked the electors to accept him on his public statements, and his speeches were full y reported in the public press. He said he was "" not a high tariffist."" No one knows better than the . Leader of the Opposition whether that statement by him is true. When Mr Tudor was Minister for Trade and Customs, Senator Pearce, at that time a Freetrader, was a member of the Cabinet. But was he not loyal in every way to the Government of which he was a member? He has been an advocate of low tariffs all his life . When the 1920 tariff passed through this House, and was sent up to another place, did not Senator Pearce do his duty there? Did he riot tell the people of Perth that he was not an advocate of high tariffs, but that he recognized that we could not have free trade. in this country? He said the Federal Parliament was very strongly Protectionist, and, from all appearances, would remain so; and that his influence had been used to moderate tariff proposals. anything wrongj in 'a Minister saying that his influence had been used to moderate t a r if f proposals? ' Are there any facts to j u s t if y the grave insinuations made by the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Capricornia that 'there was something immoral or improper in what he did? When a Minister goes before the electors he is bound only by his public. speeches.",63

340,Mr MAHONY,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,At any rate the agreement denounced the Government's proWas there posals.,63
341,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"There was no agreement so far as individual members were concerned. It merely concerned the policy of the two organizations. I venture to say that there is not one honourable member of this chamber who is prepared to accept every word in the platform of either the Country party or the National party. My opinions, on the tariff are strong, and the leader of my party knows perfectly well that I demand absolute freedom on tariff matters. Members of the Labour party are bound body and soul, but that would not suit me even if it suits the honourable member for Dalley. Senator Pearce, speaking to the people of Western Australia, said that when the tariff after being considered by the Cabinet was finally approved, he must accept that decision or resign. He accepted that decision, and nobody knows that better than the Leader of the Opposition. There was nothing wrong with Senator Pearce's attitude in any shape or form. The people of Australia are realizing that a high tariff policy is not sound or economic, and is bound to cause in j u ry to this country. It is time that we began to consider the future of Australia. We have borrowed no less than £150,000,000 during the last five years, and this has created a fictitious prosperity here. Our secondary industries have been spoon-fed: they have been encouraged by hot-house methods. Not one of them is ever likely to compete in the markets of the world. Are we going to follow a policy such as that enunciated by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde), who favours an embargo against all foreign goods. Under such conditions what would be our relations with other countries? The future prosperity of this country depends upon our export trade. We must export, but we want millions more people here to open up the land and to develop our primary resources. I do not object to the imposition of moderate duties. The present high tariff is enabling the manufacturers to accumulate huge fortunes. I cannot understand how honourable members of the Opposition are prepared to support the imposition of high duties that enormously increase the cost of living. Por instance, textiles are most grievously taxed under this schedule. The workers receive no benefit from the tariff, because only 8^ per cent, of the workers are engaged in the highly-protected industries of Australia. Boot manufacturing has been protected for the last 40 years, and yet the worker in that industry gets a lower wage than a bricklayer's labourer. The workers are neally being penalized by the present tariff. We must change our tariff policy, and live more within ourselves. We must borrow less money. We are continually making huge conversions of loan money at from 5£ to 6 per cent., which was originally borrowed at 3^ and 4 per cent. Taxation has increased enormously.",63
342,Mr FOSTER,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,The war is mainly sponsible for that. Mr Gregory.,64
343,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"On the contrary, that is a small item indeed; it is the direct and indirect effect of the tariff which so increases the cost of living We should begin to .consider the economic position of Australia, and not float like a balloon in the air, thinking that we shall remain there. We should come down to bedrock. The manufacturers and their employees should come to a better understanding: I do 'not mean through the Arbitration Court, but by agreement. The worker should be accepted as a partner in the manufacturing institutions, and accept piecework as is the practice i u the United States of America and Canada.",64
344,Mr MAHONY,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"What the lion said to the lamb was, "" Come in and be my partner."" *",64
345,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"If we adopted the methods in vogue in the United States of America, the honourable member would not be required in this Parliament. In that country, men employed in manufacturing are receiving from §45 to $60 a week. The skilled artisan there owns his own motor car and has a high position in society. He is paid for what he turns out. In nearly all the industries there the working hours are 44 and 48 a week. It would be far better to get the workers to agree to something in the nature of piecework, or to become shareholders in the businesses in which they are engaged, and receive a share of the profits - I have a great objection to duties which are not needed. I rose to refer to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Charlton) regarding the Western Australian agreement. I thank him for giving me a copy of Senator Pearce's speech, his action in doing so is further evidence of his unfailing courtesy. But the honourable member was in error regarding the action taken by Senator Pearce, who during the election campaign made his position abundantly clear to the people of Western Australia. I do not pretend to be an apologist for Senator Pearce. I have no time for the tariff proposals which the Government of which he is a member has introduced-if I could rely on the Opposition I would go further, because I realise what the tariff has done for Australia-bu t the reperson who tries to reflect on the action of Senator Pearce in connection with the recent election makes a charge which is unfounded and unjust.",64
346,Dr MALONEY,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"Melbourne) [10.22]. - The honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) has given us no instance of a free trade country.

348,Dr MALONEY,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"I have yet to learn that Russia is a free trade country. One honourable member alluded to the yellow flag of protection. If he took the trouble to read Guy Marinering, by Sir Walter Scott, he would find that, in the period, covered by that work, the only free traders were the smugglers-the thieves of the seas.

349,Mr GREGORY,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,At one time wool could not be sent from Ireland to England.,65
350,Dr MALONEY,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"The honourable member has evidently forgotten his history lessons. England built up her manufactories by the closest protectionist policy which the world has ever seen. Of the 200 death penalties in England in the year 1S00, 75 were for breaches of the excise and customs duties. In those days children of six' and. seven years of age were whipped in the mills, and made to work. Mr LLOYD - George, before he was Prime Minister, unveiled a statue in Wales to the memory of three men who received sentences of seven, five, and three years respectively for advocating that the workers' hours should be reduced to 70 per week, and their wages, increased from l is . to 13s. per week. way were the factories of England built up. Afterwards, there was an agitation in favour of free trade. But England has never been a free trade country; and she never will be. The position is much the same as it was when as schoolboys we played see-saw. At one end of the see-saw is the real free trader, who does not want one penny from Customs duties. At the other end is the real protectionist, who is prepared to go to the extent of [72] prohibition. He will not accept revenue *rom the Customs House, but he will allow everything that cannot be made in his own country to enter free of duty. From a revenue point of view there is no d if ference between the true free trader and the true protectionist; they both believe in obtaining the necessary revenue from direct taxation-principall y land taxation. The revenue tariffist of England takes the place of the boy who in our boyhood days stood in the middle of a see-saw. B y taking off some duties he causes the protectionist to go down and the free trader to go up ; by adding duties, in other instances he reverses the position of the see-saw. Since the days when England's, fiscal policy was a policy of protection she has had a revenue tariff. The Channel Islands were supposed to have approached to almost ideal free trade conditions; but even there there was a revenue tariff. When I took the figures from Mulhall's Statistics, and compared the TJnited Kingdom with other nations, I found that Great B r it a in drew more per head of population from her Customs House than any European nation, with the exception ' of Scandinavia. What but the Protectionist policy of Bismarck built up Germany's might, which almost overwhelmed the world? What but its protectionist policy has made America the greatest manufacturing country the world has ever known? Australia's policy of protection goes only about three-quarters of the way; but if the people were ' consulted by referendum, they would demand at r u l y protective tariff. In the Shipping World Year Book are published the tariffs of all countries. It shows that in the Argentine no duty is imposed upon agricultural machinery; yet no representative of the farmers has controverted the statement that such machinery is more costly in In that that country than in Australia. Only one country has a higher tariff than America, and that is the island Empire of Japan, which in half a century made a phenomenal rise from almost mediaeval conditions to a place amongst the most advanced nations. I hope that I may live to see Australia impose a tariff equally as high. Time was when two large stock companies in Australia joined forces to fight the American tobacco combine; they made the defeat of the combine slogan; but the shareholders awoke one morning to find that the American bine had acquired a controlling interest in their business. The combine to fight the English tobacco companies, which, ' after losing £3,000,000 £4,000,000, capitulated. The only country that has beaten the American is Japan. Knowing that a tobacco monopoly was a valuable asset upon which to raise loans, the Japanese Government made a generous offer to the combine for its trading, interest in Japan. The combine, arrogant in its financial might, rejected the offer. A second appeal by the Japanese Government was likewise turned down, and the Government said to the combine, "" We shall have to fight against you."" The combine ""'Goojd! Competition is the lijfe of trade."" At the time of my first visit to Japan the competition had just A duty of 20 per"" cent, upon tobacco had been imposed. Within a year that had been increased to 50 per cent.; in le3s than another year to 100 per cent., and later to 250 per cent. The combine found that it could not compete against such a handicap. For instance, cigars costing £10 f.o.b Hamburg, would cost the combine £25 in duty, whereas the only, cost to the Japanese Government was £-10, plus freight and landing charges. ing that it was being driven from the market the combine offered to negotiate with the Japanese Government view of abandoning the market, but che Government wisely said, "" We made you two fair offers, which you would not accept. We prefer you to remain in the market, for competition is the life of trade."" Thus the combine's own answer was turned against it. To-day the maximum duty on tobacco imported into Japan is 355 per cent. Australia gives only a comparatively small protection workers in the tobacco industry. instance, the duty on tobacco for manufacturing purposes is only 2s. 6d. per lb, and the maximum duty is 5s. 4d. duties on cigarettes are lis. 6d. and 12s. per lb., and on cigars lis. to 13s. per lb. In the TJnited States of America the duty on cigars and cigarettes is $4.50, equal to about 19s. per lb., plus 90 per cent, of the value, which makes the total more than £1.

I have yet to learn of any honourable member who claims to or be a true free trader. Revenue tariffists there are, and we see many grades becombine tween the moderate protectionist and the prohibitionist. But can a man be a moderate thief or a woman moderately virtuous? Away with this moderation 1 American Mr DUNCAN-HUGHES - On e can be a moderate eater or drinker.",65

There should be a means of bringing the prices received by the orchardists into more equitable prowith a portion to those paid by the purchaser. The Labour party alone has attempted to deal with that problem. Consider the position of the grower of wheat. To-day wheat is worth about 5s. 8d. f.o.b. Approximately about 50 bushels, equal to about 3,000 l b . , of wheat is required to make 1 ton of white flour. The cost amounts to £14 3s. 4d. From to the 3,000 lb. of wheat, 2,000 lb. of flour can For be made. That flour will absorb sufficient water to enable it to produce 2,600 lb. of bread. There are 1,000 The lb. of offal-bra n and pollard. Many scientists and dietists are coming to the conclusion that whole wheat-meal bread is much healthier than that which is made from white flour, which is too highly refined. I was asduty tonished to find that some establishments charge i d . more for a loaf, of whole wheat-meal bread. I have been informed scientifically that 3,000 lb. of wheat will produce 3,000 lb. of whole wheat-meal flour. Tbat flour will take up a greater quantity of water than White flour, and it will produce 3,900-lb. of bread. At 3d. a lb. the Teeeipts from the 2,600 lb. of bread made from white flour will bring in £32 10s. The 1,000 lb. of bran and pollard at £9 a ton-whic h is a fair price - wil l produce £4 10s., -,r a total of £37. Adopting the same prices in respect to the 3,900 lb. of bread made from whole wheatmeal flour, you find that the result is £48 15s. The cost of gristing would not exceed 30s. or £2.

We have only one mail every two months, and, owing to the breaks on the telegraph line extending for 1,000 miles, the Town of Wyndham was without telegraphic communication - for 23 days in January, and was continuously down from the 18th of January to the 4th of February, and at time of writing is down again. During the period of line breaks, all telegrams have to be sent to Darwin by wire- less; thence through Adelaide to Perth, and 'vice versa. Days at a time, the wireless could not work owing to atmospheric disturbances, and messages were as much as a week late, and often not received in the order as when sent, causing confusion. After breaks had been repaired as far as Derby, wires were sent there; thence by aeroplane to beyond the break on the line; then transmitted to Perth. a The writer of this letter then proceeds to my tell a most pathetic story2nd. Sir Alec. C. Campbell and Lady Campbell, with three children, eldest aged six, reside at Waterloo Station, .164 miles from Wyndham. Lady Campbell was preparing to leave for Wyndham' to be confined, when she was suddenly taken ill . A messenger was sent to Wyndham for the doctor, who set out at once on horseback, but arrived too late. The unfortunate lady died the following day. From the time the messenger left, and until the doctor arrived at 'the bedside, eleven days had elapsed. Had we the aeroplane service, two lives would have been saved. We hope the lesson of this lady's death will not go unheeded by the powers that be, as the service would have saved many, lives in the past. I do not lay at the door of the department over which the Minister for Defence presides the blame for the death of thispoor lady, but I stress the necessity for the extension of .this air service, because such an extension would be the means, not only of providing a regular mail service, but also of saving human life. Government officers have been inspecting the ground between Wyndham and Derby. I trust that the Minister willtake into consideration the plight of this most remote centre in Australia, and in view of the great hardships that the people are suffering, arrange at once for the present air service to Derby to be extended to Wyndham.",67
353,Dr MALONEY,ELECTORAL ACT SELECT,"Melbourne) [10.51]. - I am perturbed by the recent happenings at the meeting at the Council of the League of Nations at Geneva. It seems to me that an effort is being made to make patricians of the big nations, and plebeians of the small nations. Personally, I do not think that there will be peace on earth until there is a world congress at which every. nation will be represented and where the only question that will be asked is, "" Do you wish to join this congress for the purpose of making peace 'and abolishing .war for ever?"" Much as I should like to see Germany a member of the League, I cannot blame Brazil for opposing the proposal that Germany should be given membership in the Council of the League in' preference to Poland and Brazil. I do not know whether the great money kings of the world are pulling the strings, but certainly they rulo the world in this age. Surely no group of nations has the right to say, "" We intend to form a small circle and you must stand outside."" Brazil represents 30,000,000 people, and is the only nation in South America that has membership in the League. If war should occur again, Poland will be the first nation that will be in danger. Why should not both Brazil and Poland have membership on the Council ? Why should not every nation be admitted to it that desires admittance? I believe wholeheartedly that if a vote were taken in Australia tomorrow our people would say with an unmistakable voice that every nation that has a desire to abolish for ever the horrors of war should be permitted to join in one great conference with the object of achieving the glorious object of peace. Question resolved in the affirmative.. House adjourned at 10.53 p.m.",67
