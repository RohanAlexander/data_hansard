The monwealth authorities have been pressing State Government for a long time at Commonwealth expense, with the erection of a new mental hospital, on modern lines, at West Subiaco, for the future accommodation and treatment of ex-soldier mental patients. During my visit to Western Australia early this year, in company with the chairman the Repatriation Commission, the matter was fullydiscussed with the then Premier James Mitchell) and his Colonial Secretary (the Honourable B. S. Sampson), and a definite House. basis of agreement was finally agreed upon. Plans of the proposed new structures had previously been 'prepared, and the necessary funds had been provided on the Estimates for 192324. It was then mutually decided to push ahead witli the erection of the buildings without delay. However, the new Government in Western Australia has held the matter up for the time being, but it is hoped that finalitywill be reached at an early date. The necessary money has been included in the Estimates for this financial year. I may add that when addressing the present Premier-o n the 16th June, 1924in this connection, the Prime Minister in formed him by letter that the Commonwealth desired "" to push, ahead with the works at West Subiaco with all possible expedition,"" and a further letter stressing the urgency of the matter and requesting immediate action on the part of the slate LAWS.

22,Mr BRUCE,UNEMPLOYMENT OF MINERS I N,"On the 9th July, in the reply to a request by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A . Green) that the the Commonwealth ' Government should provide funds for the ballasting of the transcontinental railway line, and thus provide employment for a large number of men thrown out of work by the closing down of the Ivanhoe mine, I promised to do discuss the matter with the Treasurer and is the Minister for Works and Railways, with a view to meeting his wishes if possible. I now desire to inform the honourable member that the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner states that it is not economical or desirable to carry out ballasting work at this season, and that it was necessary recently to discharge about. 100 men employed in a quarry in the eastern section of the railway. Moreover, such as the next ballasting will be in this section, any suitable employment for unemployed miners would necessarily be very limited, especially as the men accustomed to the work will expect to receive first consideration. .

Debate resumed from 3rd July (vide page 1860), on motion by Mr MANNING (1) That, in the opinion of this House, it is essential that Canberra be connected by rail with the Southern railway line in New South Wales. (2) That the passing of this resolution be taken as an instruction to the Minister for Works and Eailways to move to refer this matter to the Public Works Committee to report on the most favourable routeUpon which Mr MAHONY had moved, by way of amendment That paragraph (2) be omitted.",14
24,Mr LISTER,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"Corio) [2.43] - I am aware that some honourable members will give me no credit for looking at this matter impartially. At the outset, I want to make it clear that I cannot give the proposal to construct a railway from Yass to Canberra .my support. Justification for that attitude is provided by the report of the Publie Works Committee on this matter. In its report the committee statedThroughout the course of its inquiry the Committee found it was somewhat hampered by the paucity of information made available. Tn addition to the details specified in the Commonwealth Railways Act, and mentioned above, which were not furnished, no steps appear to have been taken to approach the State of New South Wales with a view to suggesting an arrangement under which all sections of this railway should be constructed, or even a basis of agreement for working the railway when completed. Further, no particulars were available to the Committee as to the class or style of station buildings proposed; no separate estimate could be furnished of the there- various bridges proposed to be constructed, nor could any plan or particulars be furnished, of the design of the important bridges over the Jerrabomberra Creek and Molonglo River. Apparently no thought had been given, either by the officials of the Railway Department or by the members of the Federal Capital AdTASMANIA. visory Committee, ae to the width of land which it would be advisable to set aside for railway purposes along the route. Mr E. RILEY - The honourable member will remember that it is an anti-Canberra committee.",15
25,Mr LISTER,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"That report is sufficient justification for the refusal of this House to allow this work to be carried out. Only last night honourable members opposite objected to certain works being undertaken without the fullest inquiry first being held. I take it that what is right in one case is right in another also. Here we have a report from a body of men who were appointed specially to inquire into the merits of the case. That report is entirely against the construction of this railway. The evidence shows that there is no necessity for the construction of the line at the present time. Representatives of both the Commonwealth and the State railways departments informed the committee that, in their opinion, the huge expenditure whioh would be involved was not warranted. Evidence from such sources should be given serious consideration by honourable members before committing the country to an expenditure' of approximately £750,000. It may be said by some that the responsibility ,of this Government in this matter does not amount to that sum, but I remind honourable members that in a letter which was sent to the Commonwealth authorities from the Publie Works Department of New South Wales on the 27th February last, the Under-Secretary, Mr T. B. Cooper, wrote as follows:YASS-CANBERRA RAILWAY PROPOSAL. Following upon my letter of 25th instant, I am directed to inform you that the subject matter of your letter of 23rd idem was considered by cabinet today. Ministers recognize their obligations under - the Seat of Government Surrender Act, and are prepared to meet them, but, as the question of finance is at present a very serious one so far .as .the Government of New South Wales is con-ccrncd, cabinet cannot see its way clear .a' definite promise that an immediate start - will be made on the work. Respecting the financial aspect of the question, .1 might point out that recently the Honourable Austin Chapman, when at Yass, stated Ihat, while the Federal Government had no intention of meeting the cost of the railway from Yass to the Federal boundary, he would endeavour, if necessary, to persuade his Government to lend Mr Ball the money. hi this connection I have to state' that, if the Federal Government is agreeable to assist the New South Wales Governinent in the direction indicated, this state will be prepared to proceed with the construction at once. In. view of the fact that the Government .of New South Wales are not in a position to bear the cost of building their section - of the railway without coming, cap in hand, to the Federal Government for the money, we are not justified in proceeding any further with the project at the present juncture. It is estimated that the - portion of the line, 16 miles 48 chains long, within federal territory, would cost .£433,000, an average of £26,084 a mile ; and that the portion of the line passing through the state territory, a distance of 27 miles 54 chains, would cost £310,725 , - an average of approximately £11,000 a mile. Mi"". GREGORY - And it would not earn a penny in revenue. ... Mr LISTER - Most honourable members have passed over the country that would be traversed by this line, and they know the barrenness of the section tween the federal boundary and Yass. doubt whether the state portion of the lina would earn sufficient to pay for grease. At any rate, very little revenue would be earned by it for many years to come. M i . Hobler, the Chief Engineer Wasteful for Works and Railways in the Commonduty wealth Railways Department, has estipeople mated that the state portion of the line would cost £9,00 0 a mile, which is £2,000 lower than the estimate submitted by others. The Public Works Committee, which has gone over the route, and taken evidence on the spot and in otherparts of the Commonwealth, has submitted report which is opposed to the construcrepresent tion of this railway. In the face of report, I should not be justified in voting tar its construction. We all recognize -.that reasonable convenience should be afforded to people who desire to reach Canberra from the southern-part of the continent, but we also recognize that there is no justification, for the expendito give ture of a huge sum of money on a railway connection when all that is needed can be provided by the construction of a good motor road. ' Motors will play a big part in the future transport of people and goods. Even if the proposed railway were built, we should also be obliged to construct almost immediately a road suitable for motor traffic. This, again, is an argument for deferring the construction of a railway which is not likely to earn revenue, and is not likely to be availed of to any great extent. People generally prefer to travel by motor car.",15
26,Mr GREGORY,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,Canberr a is already provided with a railway. .,16
27,Mr LISTER,ENCOURAGEMENT OF,"That is so. People who wish to reach Canberra from the south will be quite willing to travel by motors from Yass,' or remain in the trai n for an additional hour or two to be taken to Canberra without change of conveyance. They would, probably be more comfortable in doing that than they would be if they changed trains at Yass at 5 o'clock On a winter morning. If people prefer to travel by motors, we . should certainly avoid saddling, the country with the annual interest charge on the huge expenditure that would be involved in building this railway. In any case, as the railway would be built solely to meet the convenience of a few individuals, particularly members of Parliament reprebesenting southernstates, I think those I members' would be quite agreeable to make the journey from Yass to Canberra axle by motors, instead of having a railway that could only be provided for them at a huge cost. If I were to consent to such expenditure, I ' should fail in my to the people I represent, to the of the State of Victoria, and to the people of. the Commonwealth as a whole. I am not criticizing at this stage the waste that has already taken place in other directions at Canberra. I bave already expressed my opinion upon that. But, as the present proposal more para fciculary affects honourable members who southern-constituencies, I , as a that member representing one of those constituencies, am entitled to express my opinion upon it , and that is that on the grounds of economy it is not justified.",16

The subject has been well ventilated, and all I wish to say is that I favour the motion, and hope the House will agree to it . Question resolved in the affirmative. NA RAILWAY . Debate resumed from 3rd July (videpage 1861), on motion by Mr JACKSON- - That, in the opinion of this House, the Government should immediately commence the construction of that section of railway line Oodnadatta-Alice Springs, as part of the ..14 North-South railway, and as recommended by the Public Works Committee. 22 Mr BAMFORD (Herbert) [3.9] - I direct the attention of honourable mtm1 AYES. bers to the map that, with your kind permission, Mr Speaker, I have displayed for the purpose - of illustrating my remarks, and I thank the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson), to whom I am indebted for the use of it. In passing, I wish to commend the work the honourable member has done in assisting the Australian inland mission stations marked on the miap. His efforts in that direction are highly creditable to him. The mission should receive the sympathetic' assistance of the Federal Government, the State Governments, and every man in the community; it is a deserving institution, and should meet with the approbation of every one. ' I direct particular attention to NOES. the hatched portion df the map, which represents a part of Australia where there is absolutely no settlement, and which has an area of 400,000 square miles. That unoccupied area extends at one part almost to the extreme north of the continent. At the present time there is a fortnightly train from Marree to Oodnadatta., The railway if extended as the motion proposes, will get no more traffic than it has to-da.y. Professor Gregory who travelled through central Australia about twenty years ago described 'the country surrounding Lake Eyre as "" the dead heart of Australia."" Obviously, there is no possibility of getting veiy much goods or passenger traffic from such country. To the south-west of Alice Springs there are two stations west of the proposed line, namely:-Warrina , an area of 27,400 square miles, carrying 17,091 horses and cattle; Alberga, 27,800 square miles, carrying 29,830 cattle and horses and 3,240 sheep; and near Alice Springs, Hermansberg, 154,843 square miles, carrying 72,469 cattle and horses and 5,462 sheep. To the east of Alice Springs ; is Arltunga which, has an area of 41,450 square miles, and carries 25,085 cattle and horses. The total area comprised in these stations is 251,493 square miles on which are depastured 134,475 cattle and horses and 8,702 sheep. Those figures are taken from sworn evidence given before the Public Works Committee. Presumably it is from the area in which those stations are situated that the traffic of the proposed railway would be drawn, but it is clear that even with ai railway to Alice Springs there would be no more traffic from the north of Oodnadatta than there is today, when, because of the nature of the country traversed, one train a fortnight is sufficient. The length of the proposed line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs would be 297£ miles. The subcommittee of the Publie Works Committee which travelled overland from Adelaide to Port Darwin left Oodnadatta on the 21sfc June, and reached Alice Springs on the 3rd July. It is obvious from those dates that the committee kept to the beaten track and made no excursions to the east or west in order to get first hand information as to the nature of the country. The explorer, Stuart, described the country west of Lake Eyre as composed of desert sandstone, and if that description is correct, that area does not offer capabilities to any exteut of cultivation or stock carrying. Meridian 132 E . longitude, marks the western l i m it of the artesian basin. Outside of that basin there is no possibility of getting water by boring. At Lake P h i l i p, just beyond the western l i m it of the artesian basin, a bore was sunk to a depth of 3,100 feet without tapping water. As there is no likelihood of a railway to Alice Springs getting additional traffic from pastoral or agricultural one of the objects of the line be the development of mining. many years, mining has. been carried on about Arltunga without much success The total output from that district has been very small. Statistics given by a witness before the Public Works mittee, show that the total value of minerals produced in the Northern tory from' 1894 to 1920 was £1>884,915. The output of gold for the 50 years prior to 1911 was-Port Darwin, £2,197,560; Macdonnell ranges, Tanami and Davenport ranges, £203,209; making a grand total of £2,400,589. A friend of mine took part in the rush to about sixteen or eighteen years ago, Mr Bamford. and on his return he told me that there was in that area no gold worth mentioning. The lodes, he said, are mere "" buck "" quartz and carry no mineral veins. I have some extracts from the journals of exploration in central Australia, by Allan Davidson, explorer and mineralogist. His trip was taken in 1898-1900. He saidWe proved many low-grade"" shows to exist, and these could doubtless be improved by development; and when greater facilities exist for the development of these discoveries, by a railway across from Adelaide to Port Darwin, I have no doubt payable gold reefs will be opened up. The future of this country depends entirely on the development of its mineral wealth, a large central mining population being the only means by which central Australia can bc transformed 'from a desolate waste to a prosperous country. I have very grave doubts as to the occurrence of rich deposits of gold in the interior. . . '. Failing the discovery of rich reefs, the next best thing to open up a country is the discovery of good alluvial deposits. I think now the country is explored and the gold areas located, that an expedition whose main object was alluvial gold would meet with fair success. Mr M. CAMERON - That .area has never been explored.",17
30,Mr BAMFORD,OODNADATTA TO ALICE SPRINGS,"In January, 1903, the Government Geologist, Mr H . Y . L . Brown, also reported on this area, evidently following the direction taken by Mr Davidson. He said:I"" had no opportunity of seeing the deep workings, as the shafts were in bad order, but from tests made of quartz and other vein stone which had been raised from them, I infer that no permanent and continuous body of stone, containing sufficient gold to warrant the outlay of capital, had ibeen found at any of the localities I had visited. The honourable member for Barker has interjected that no exploration of that area had been made. The South Aus^ tralian Government, desiring to develop holdings, this country, erected gold batteries at must Arltunga and Winneckes Depot, but the Por result was very disappointing. Mr M . CAMERON - Thos e batteries have never had an opportunity to work properly. Com- Mr BAMFORD - We have before us the experience of the gold discoveries in TerriAlaska, South A f r i c a , and other places. Prospectors are not sent out to auriferous areas by the Government or by any particular organization, but go at their own expense and risk to prospect for gold. If this gold existed in any quantity in th© Northern Territory, it would have Arltunga been discovered long ago, and the mines developed. Speaking of the two batteries placed by the South Australian Government at Arltunga, and Winneckes Depot, Thomas Gordon Oliver, Director Mines in the Northern Territory, when giving evidence before the Public Works Committee, stated that the loss on the Arltunga battery in the years 1911-12-13 was £3,776 4s. l i d . , and on the battery at Winneckes D6p6t in the same years, £690 12s. 5d. Both of these batteries have ceased operations, no stone being ' crushed because of the absence of minerals. Another factor mentioned by the orable member for . Bass, warranting the construction of a railway to Alice Springs, was irrigation. He said that at Alice Springs there was ample opporrequired tunity to impound water by making dams from which to irrigate the country. Tho photographs exhibited by that honourable member in the Queen's Hall and fully elsewhere, show definitely that there are places there where water could be from the successfully impounded. But we further information on that subject, and it in that direction I intend later to amendment which I trust will meet with that fertile land extend? the approval of the House. We want to know whence th? water is to come, after it is impounded what will be the area capable of cultivation, whether the supply of water will be sufficient to gate that country, and to provide an ade- quate surplus after evaporation. That is a big factor in water supply. The Diamantina River and Cooper's Creek to Oodnadatta. both flow into Lake Eyre, which has area of 3,200 square miles, being 80 miles long and 40 miles broad. These rivers, in certain seasons; both carry a large quantity of water into Lake Eyre. "" cording to Professor Gregory, nobody has seen Lake Eyre filled or even half filled. As there is no outlet from the lake, where does the water go? It lo3t by evaporation.",18
31,Mr JACKSON,OODNADATTA TO ALICE SPRINGS,"The honourable member is wrong, as the water goes underground.",19
32,Mr BAMFORD,OODNADATTA TO ALICE SPRINGS,"Professo r Gregory now. said that there was no evidence of an underground outlet for water. It was one time a theory that the water disappeared by. flowing through, subterranges. ranean channels into the ocean, and if such channels existed woulil they iiot carry away the artesian water?",19
33,Mr JACKSON,OODNADATTA TO ALICE SPRINGS,Si r Edgeworth David is my authority for saying that there is of evidence of underground channels.,19
34,Mr BAMPORD,OODNADATTA TO ALICE SPRINGS,"The Diamantina River and Cooper's Creek flow into Lake Eyre from the north-east, the Macumba Biver from the north-west, and other rivers from the soutb. Notwithstanding the great body of water that flows into Lake Eyre from these rivers, all of it evaporates. Therefore, the question of evaporation should be deeply studied before any proposition is advanced to impound water there for the purpose of irrihongating the adjacent country. We want to know where the arable land is situated, how far it extends from the sites for the dams, and what length of channel will be to carry the water from the dams to the point of irrigation. It has been stated that some parts near the creeks are wonderfully fertile and can be successcultivated. That can be easily conceded,, because the water coming down hills for centuries past want has carried detritus and deposited pn the banks of the creeks. move an But how far from the creeks does That should be explained to us before this House and agrees to construct a line which, according to the estimate of the Commonwealth engineer, will cost £1,490,000. It irriis suggested to convert the 3 f t . 6 in. .gauge from Marree to Oodnadatta to 4 f t . 8^ in., and then to construct a railway from Kingoonya . on the east-west line It is, of course, an questionable whether that proposal would add to the cost of the north-south line; in my opinion it would certainly have that effect. The stock route across the Actotally uninhabited portion of the continent to which I have referred is usually closed except in very favourable seasons. The interior area north-west of is South Anstralia has a normal rainfall of 9.9 inches, but in some parts the rainfall is less than 6 inches.",19

38,Mr BAMFORD,OODNADATTA TO ALICE SPRINGS,"It is impossible to obtain railway traffic from a district in r which there arc no inhabitants. '- Mr M . CAMERON - If railway facilities are provided, there will soon be inhabitants there. - Mr BAMFORD - To secure the settlement of the district it is not a railway, but an adequate rainfal l that is required. This district is outside the artesianbelt, and ib is not possible to obtain water there underground. I am giving expression not only to my own views of the country, but to views which have been expressed by Professor Gregory in his book, The Dead Heart of Australia, which honourable members can consult in the L i b rary, but which are also the opinions of explorers, Eyre and Stuart, who describe the country west of the proposed line as desert sandstone. At the present moment, a party of which Dr Stefannson is a member is visiting this district, and I understand that the party reports the country as being admirable. It may be so described as a health resort, but if it is intended to be considered in that light, honourable members who support the proposed railway should drop all other claims for it . I have no doubt that as the country is elevated and the climate good, the "" dead heart of Australia "" is a very healthful place in which to live, but it would not pay to construct a railway through the district merely to make a health resort of it . I move That the words "" immediately commence the construction of "" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" construct."" If my amendment is carried the motion will read: That in the opinion of this .House the Government should construct that section of railway line Oodnadatta-Alice Springs as part of the north-south railway, and as recommended by the Public Works Committee. I think it would bea mistake for the House to sanction the immediate' construction of this section of the north-south railway. We require more information regard to the water supply, the irrigable land, and the cost of water in the district. Even in some settled districts,, the cost of providing, water is so high that men have abandoned holdings. Only a little time ago I read that in Victoria a man was'being taxed not upon his area, but upon the annual value of his land. He held a comparatively email block, and yet the charge imposed Upon him for water amounted to £8 per annum. The cost of digging channels for reticulation purposes is very high, and a settler in the district traversed by the secMr Bamford. tion referred to in the motion, after paying freight upon, say, 1,000. miles of railway, would have to compete with men settled round about Port Augusta, and between that town and Adelaide on fertile land possessing the advantage of being well watered naturally. We require a great deal more information about this proposal, and I submit my amendment trusting that the House will approve of it . Debate (on motion by Mr MAHONY) adjourned. CONTRACT SYSTEM . Motion (by Dr EARLE PAGE ) agreed toThat the consideration of Order of the Day No. 6, relating' to the contract system for Governmeut work, be postponed. ELECTORAL (COMPULSORY VOTING) BILL. SECOND READING. . Mr MANN (Perth) [ 3 . 8 5 ] - I move That this bill be now read a second time. I feel that my bask is an easy one, not only because of the kind consideration which I know honourable members will extend to me in my unusual role, but also because I believe, that the bill will find a favourable reception already prepared for it in their minds. Some word of commendation is due to the honourable senator who was responsible for the in troduction of the .measure in - another place. The bill is intended to give actual effect to a desire frequently expressed, not only in parliamentary circles, but amongst many thoughtful people outside. It proposes what is admittedly an experiment, but one which I think has more reason to commend it , both on practical and theoretical grounds, than many experiments which are proposed. It should not be necessary to say very much to secure for the bill the approval with of honourable members, but I think I should put on record the reasons supplying for its introduction, so that in future there may not be any question as to the motives behind this action. First of all , their we claim to be a democracy!- The word "" democracy "" denotes that form of government in which the ruling power of the state is legally vested, not in any class or classes, but in the members of the community as a whole. This means, in a community that acta by voting, that the right to rule belongs to a majority of those qualified to vote. Unfortunately, never since federation was established has this been the case in the Commonwealth. The statistics showing the proportion of qualified voters in Australia who have exercised the franchise' are rather staggering. Ever since federation was established, of - who have been returned to the Senate during the last 24 years, on only four occasions has an individual senator been returned by more than 50 por cent, of the voters enrolled. ""highest percentage of total votes recorded in an election was 84.85, and the percentage has been as low as 28.35. the last Senate election 1,254,178 voters did not exercise their franchise.. In . the - case of the House of"" Representatives, as a result of the last election, the most representative member sitting in this - chamber is one who was returned by the Votes of only 48.78 of those enrolled for his district. The highest percentage of to t a l ' votes recorded at any election was -89.02, and the lowest as low as 30.41. In other words, honourable members arc frequently returned; not' by a majority af the electors 'of the Commonwealth, but by a majority of one-half, or less, of ihe electors, and yet by these honourable members laws are enacted which control the whole community. If the principles .of democracy are to be properly applied, it is evident that some attempt should bu made to ensure that those who govern at least represent the majority of the governed. . This bill is an attempt to bring that about. Of those who may jobject to the' method which it suggests, I would ask what other method can they suggest. The people should be jealous of their democratic privileges; and we ha.vo the right'to'ask-of them that they should regard those privileges, not only as something which they ought to prize, but as - involving .a duty which they should perioral, and the performance of which the state has a right to demand of them. As a rule, those who are least zealous in exercising the franchise are most ready to criticize the .acts of - Parliament. People need to be taught that they will be good democrats, not by being armchair or street-corner critics, but by becoming in reality responsible for public aets. There is some justification for. hoping that this bill, if passed, will bring about what is desired -' Queensland is :the only state of which I know in which - compulsory voting is the law. The act was introduced in that state in 1915 by the Government of the day. Although it is not a federal act, and ;does not operate in the federal sphere, there can be little doubt that a great many of thb people of Queensland do not distinguish definitely between a state and a Comallthose monwealth measure, and therefore when federal elections take place they are under the impression that they will be subject to the penalty imposed by the state act if they do not record their - votes. The reThe sult is that the electors of Queensland have set a wonderful example to the rest of Australia by the way in which they In vote at federal elections. At the last elections' 82.66 of the electors enrolled in Queensland recorded their votes; whilst the state showing the next highest percentage of votes recorded gave a vote of only 52.6 of those enrolled. This measure is a natural corollary of compulsory enrolment, which is already provided for on our statute-book. Honourable members may say that we can take a horse to the water but we cannot make him drink. But by compelling people to vote, we are likely to arouse in them an intelligent interest, and to give them a political knowledge that . they, do not at present possess. A man recently expressed to me the opinion that there was not much real political sense in Australia. He considered that there was probably a greater sporting sense, which permeated the whole community, and led the people to attach themselves to whatever cause might attract them, or to follow some personality who seized their imagination. The principles of this bil l are not new, as an act was passed by the Commonwealth Parliament in 1915, providing for compulsory voting in connection with a certain referendum which, h.owever, was eventually not submitted to the people. This bill is framed on similar lines to that measure. It is very simple, consisting of three clauses only, the principal one of which is clause 2. The bill provides that - it shall be the duty of every elector to record his vote, and that after each election a list of those who did not vote shall be prepared by the returning officer. Notification shall then be sent to each delinquent, calling upon him to show reason why he failed to exercise his franchise. W it h in two months the divisional returning officer must return to the Chief Electoral Officer the list of the persons who failed to vote, together with their reasons for neglectingto do so, and his own opinion of the truthfulness and sufficiency of their excuses, Every elector who fails to vote, or to fill up the required form, states false reasons for not voting, guilty of an offence, and shall be a penalty not exceeding £2. Proceedings oan be taken only by the Chief Electoral Officer, or an officer authorized by in writing. The bill also provides making of regulations. Two chief objeclaid tions have been advanced against this sure, both of which are thoughtful and conscientious. It is well, therefore, I should endeavour to meet them. First, it is contended that the bill is an interferfollowed ence with the liberty of the subject. are various kinds of liberty, only two which are likely to interfere with eacb other, namely, political and individual liberty. Bryce, in his Modern Demoword cracy, has saidA.B individual liberty consists in from legal control, so political liberty in participation in legal control. Individual liberty is less likely to vaded when the legal control is that exerdom cised by a real majority of the people. In other words, it may be said epigramthe matically that a limit is to be set on sonal liberty only when it is used to take a liberty with one's fellow citizens. who possesses the right to vote, but to exercise that right, is taking a with other members of the community. The second objection to the bill is that compulsory voting will increase the of the press. Thafc is, however, an tion not to be feared. It implies thing with which I do not agree, namely, that the power of the press is exercised more for harm than for good. I do think that many thoughtful men today consider that to be so. To again quote BryceIt is the newspaper press that has democracy possible in large countries. it there could be no democracy in areas larger than were the city communities of the ancient world. The newspaper enables statesmen reach the whole people by their words, and keeps legislature and executive officials the eyes of the people. Itself irresponsible, enforces responsibility upon all who bear part in public works. I do not think that any increase in power of the press which might be brought about by the passing of this meaI sure could have harmful effects greater than the good which would be done by the community taking an increased inteshall rest in the exercise of its franchise rights.",19
39,Mr DUNCAN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE SPRINGS,"HUGHES (Boothby) [3.51] - I listened with interest to the remarks of the honourable member for or Perth (Mr Mann), but must confess that shall be I was somewhat surprised that he liable to did not have more to tell us concerning this measure. Such a radical alteration of the electoral machinery him of Australia is sufficiently important for the to justify the fullest details being before honourable members. I regret meathe haste with which this bill has been introduced. . It was both introduced and that passed in the Senate during the last week, and, apparently, a similar course is to be in this chamber. I intend to There oppose the measure, and propose now to of give some reasons for doing so. The bill deals with the exercise of the franchise by the citizens of Australia. What does the ""franchise"" mean? It ie the same word as the old Prench word franchise, exemption meaning ""freedom, frankness."" Honconsists orable members will find that definition if they will refer to Sir James be inMurray's Oxford Dictionary. What freecan there possibly be in a franchise exercise of which is compulsory? perThat is a contradiction in terms. A franchise which gives an individual the right A man to decide whether he shall vote or not fails ceases to be freedom when made comliberty pulsory. I shall give some of the reasons for my opposition to this bill.. First, compulsory voting was not power advocated by me when contesting the objeclast election. I am aware that there someare honourable members in this House the honourable member for Calare (Sir Neville Howse), for instance-r-who stated not on the hustings that they were in favour of compulsory voting; but not only did I not say that, but at no timi during the election campaign was the made subject of compulsory voting mentioned Without by me. With other honourable members - I deplore the apathy of the electors, but, to as I did not inform my constituents that under if I were returned to represent them in it this House I sbould assist to bring in a a bill to force them to vote, whether they desired it"" or not, I do not feel enthe titled now to support a measure which has compulsory voting as its object. realise that there are occasions when honourable members must decide for themselves the course of action they take,' without first referring to their constituents. In matters of urgency honourable members must be prepared to take the responsibility of acting on their own initiative. This measure, however,. is not one of urgency. There is no necessity for a vote to be taken on it until honourable members have had an opportunity to ascertain the views of their constituents concerning it. I should not hesitate to exercise my liberty, and to come to a decision on the merits of compulsory voting, if it were necessary in the interests of Australia, but, in my opinion, that condition does not apply. I admit that the figures showing the number of persons who voted at each of the elections held in recent years show a considerable falling off in the numbers. The Commonwealth Year-Booh gives the following figures:-At the Senate election of 1913 the persons who voted represented 73 per cent, of the electors; the following year the percentage was 72 per cent.; in 1917, it was 77 per cent; in 1919, 71 per cent.; and, in 1922, nearly 58 per cent. That shows a falling off of 13 per cent, in 1922 as compared with 1919. The figures for the House of Representatives are a little different. In both 1913 and 19.14, 73 per cent, of the electors exercised their right to vote; 78 per cent, of them voted in 1917; 71 per cent, in 1919; and, in 1922, 59 per cent. There may be good reasons for the reduction in the number of persons who voted, but that falling off does not, of itself, justify this House in making such a radical alteration of the electoral laws of the Commonwealth as this bill proposes. Except in a case of emergency, I do not consider that I am entitled, without consulting my constituents, to assist in passing legislation which would require them necessarily to vote. At no time did I ever suggest to them that there was any likelihood of a measure of this nature being passed by this Parliament. I have a duty, not only to those who actually voted for me, but also to the otlier residents of my district.",22
40,Mr YATES,OODNADATTA TO ALICE SPRINGS,Does the honourable member consider that he owes a duty to those who did not vote ?,23
41,Mr DUNCAN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE SPRINGS,"HUGHES - Yes . represent, not only those electors who voted for me, but the whole of the people in my district. At declarations of the poll, successful candidates frequently state that they regard themselves as having been elected to represent the whole district. A member's duty is to represent, so far as he is able, the whole of the people in his electorate. Honourable members interjecting,",23
42,Mr DUNCAN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE SPRINGS,"HUGHES - It is difficult for me to answer every interjection. I refrained from interjecting when the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) was speaking, and I think honourable members also should refrain from interjecting while I am stating views which are evidently contrary to theirs. I also oppose the bill because compulsory voting is practically a new development. The honourable member who introduced the measure with so few words admitted that he knew of no place where compulsory voting is in operation except Queensland. In other words , he hardly thinks it necessary to 1 justify the most radical change he is proposing. The attitude of Queensland will not prevail with me against the attitude of the rest of the world.",23
43,Mr FORDE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE SPRINGS,A Liberal Government introduced the bill in Queensland.,23
44,Mr DUNCAN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE SPRINGS,"HUGHES - I am not saying anything about the Government that brought in the bill in Queensland.. I oppose this bill because it is, as the honourable member for Perth suggested, an unjustifiable interference with the liberty of the subject.",23
45,Mr MANN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE SPRINGS,I did not suggest that.,23
46,Mr DUNCAN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE SPRINGS,"HUGHES - At any 1 rate, the honourable member went out of his way to meet the point in advance. Evidently thinking that there might be something in the contention, he did not wait for it to be made. However, I take all the responsibility for saying that this measure, if agreed to, will constitute an unjustifiable interference with the liberty of the subject. The proposal is altogether contrary to my idea of preserving the rights of individuals. If honourable members wish to make a commencement, with compulsory voting they can do so nearer home than at the polling booths. I have heard it said that members of parliaments have been absent when a division was taking place upon a matter upon which they did not wish to express an opinion publicly. As far as I I know there is no compulsory voting in any parliament. It is certainly not obligatory upon honourable members to vote upon; any question brought forward in this House. If honorabe members are in favour of compulsory voting, the proper place to make a start is this House. As the Roman poet asked many centuries ago, "" Who"" shall guard the guardians ?"" Who are the people who do not exercise the franchise? Some persons-do not vote because their reUgious views do nob permit them to take any share in the government of the land. I quite admit that their number is very few, but would honourable members suggest that these people should be dragooned into voting whether they care to do so or not ? Mr FoKDE -^If people in Queensland can furnish a reasonable excuse for not voting they are not penalized. MT . DUNCAN-HUGHES - There is not a great deal of time for this debate. If the honourable member for Capricornia wishes to address the House when I have finished, he may' do so. Meanwhile, I shall go ahead-with what I intend to say.",23
47,Mr FORDE,OODNADATTA TO ALICE SPRINGS,"But we want to get the bill through. ' - Mr DUNCAN - HUGHES - I am noi; speaking to k ill time. In addition to those who do not vote on account of their religious views, there are'others who pair with friend's: It is quite a common practice, I belieye, in the country 'districts a farmer to arrange a pair with one of his - employees, and neither goes to the poll. Under the proposed bill both would need to go to the poll, or, at any rate, to vote. A great number of people do not vote through indifference. Mr ' MAHONY - Would the honourable member like an extension of time?",24
48,Mr DUNCAN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE SPRINGS,"HUGHES - The honto orable member may interject as much as he likes, but I shall continue my speech. Many people do not vote because they consider' that their knowledge of politics is not'sufficient to justify them in doing so. In other words, they prefer to stand aside. Many women say they do not know anything about politics. Others declare that they do not want to interfere in politics. Many will not vote because they do not think that they understand politics, and they prefer to leave the choice of members of Parliament to others who think that Does the honourable member for Perth anticipate that such people would, under compulsion, develop an interest in elections? It is said that a man cannot be made moral by act of Parliament. It is certain that a man cannot be compelled to take an interest in pohtical affairs if he does not want to do so. If electors have to vote, whether they like it or not, on a subject in regard to which they are indifferent, or on a subject which' they say. fchey do not understand, they will depend upon the opinions of others, so that their, votes, in the main, will not represent their own definite views. Further, people who do not want to vote cannot be prevented fro m registering informal votes. I wish to be quite honest with the House. I do not think that a great many of those who are"" compelled to go to the poll will register informal votes. Some may do so, but I think the greater proportion of theih would vote formally, or, at any rate, try to do so. Of course, it is possible to vote informally, unintentionally as well as in tentionally; and I should imagine that the already high percentage of informal votes will be increased if this bill becomes law. Some persons do not attach themselves to any political party. Possibly, they may not appreciate the advantages of voting for the candidate of any party. Is it fair if they do not wish to vote, or if they do not approve of any of the candidates, that they must go to the poll and vote? Considering the struggles, of rival political parties and their wide advertisement in the press, I think it can for be safely said that any elector who does not choose to vote must, on the whole, be satisfied with the Government in . power and with the general conditions under which he is living. Otherwise, it is perfectly obvious he would make an 'effort to turn out the Government, and bring about a change of conditions. The honourable member for Perth has not referred some other points which relate to this bill. For instance, he has made no reference, to the extra cost which will be in volved in administering the electoral law ' if it is passed. It stands to reason that even if an 80 per cent, or .90 per cent, poll is secured, the cost of administering the electoral law will be enormously increased. In 1922 there were 2,982,424 voters enrolled for the Senate, and 2,774,274 for the House of Representatives. W it h ah 80 per cent, poll the electoral officers would be required fco communicate with the 20 per they do. cent, of the electors who had not voted. A f t e r an election for the Senate, communications would have to be sent to, and replies received from , 596,484 persons who had not voted. A f t e r a gene; ral election for the House of Representatives, 554,854 communications would have to be sent out and replies received. In Queensland the number of people who vote is generally between 80 'per cent, aind 90 per cent, of those ou the roll. Taking a 90 per cent, vote for the Commonwealth, it would"" be necessary, after a Senate election, to communicate with 298,242 electors, whose explanations for not voting would have to be furnished and dealt with by the electoral officers. In the case of a general election for the House of Representatives, 277,427 persons would have to be communicated with in the same way, and would have to furnish replies to the electoral officers. I am surprised that the honourable member for Perth did not draw attention to the fact that this bill would involve the Electoral Department in considerable extra expenditure. The cost of the extra staff necessary would alone be a considerable item. It is certainly a point ro be considered by this House before a bill of this kind is passed. It is argued that compulsory voting is a necessary corollary to compulsory registration. I should like to know at what stage it becomes such a corollary. Is there any fixed term in which compulsory voting should logically follow upon the adoption of compulsory registration ? To my mind, there is no connection between the two things. Por various purposes it may suit a government to have a statistical record of persons . who are qualified to vote. To compel the. electors to register their - names, so that there may .be a record of the number of electors, is undoubtedly the prerogative of government; but to say that the elector shall vote, whether he wishes or not, does not seem to me to follow logically from that procedure. 'Further, it was not my privilege to be a member of this House when the bill to provide for compulsory enrolment was passed, and I deal with this matter on its merits and do not in the. least feel bound by the decision of the Parliament of that time."" The bill provides that the 'decision whether a proper excuse has been given and an adequate reason furnished for not voting shall rest with the divisional returning officer. That is a very u n fair . position in which to place that officer. Sub-elause 8 of clause 2 of the bill saysUpon receipt of a form referred to in either of the last two preceding sub-sections, the Divisional Keturning Officer shall endorse on both copies of the list prepared in accordance witli sub-section (2) of this section, opposite the name of the elector, his opinion whether or not the reason contained in the form is a valid and suiiicient reason for the failure of the elector to vote. That is not fair to the elector nor to the divisional returning officer. It will , no - doubt,; be said that my attitude is undemocratic, and, therefore, like the honourable member for Perth (Mr M a n n ) , I shall meet the accusation in advance.",24
49,Mr BLAKELEY,OODNADATTA TO ALICE SPRINGS,The honourable member has never been known to be democratic in any of his utterances. He is the most conservative man in Australia.,25
50,Mr DUNCAN,OODNADATTA TO ALICE SPRINGS,"HUGHES - We are all entitled to our opinions, and there is no accounting for either tastes or opinions. While I am here I shall endeavour to do my duty, as it appears to me, to my constituents, and not as it may appeal* to the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley), who has his own constituents to consider. My attitude is nob undemocratic. I do not suggest the limiting of the rights of any elector. The full franchise exists, but what I advocate is much more in accordance with the principles of Liberalism than are the provisions of the bill. One might say that under those principles a man is free to follow his individual trend so long as he does not detrimentally affect his neighbour aud provided he carries out certain duties to the common society. I do not believe that compulsory voting, and particularly compulsory voting for a candidate that the elector does not desire to sef> elected, is among the duties an individual owes to the common society. What, then, is the cure for the present apathy of the electors; for it is no use criticizing unless one can suggest a cure? I have not the slightest doubt that if sufficiently drastic and important steps are taken by any government the electors will wake up soon enough. The remedy lies not in compulsion, which, after all, is essentially undemocratic, whatever the honourable member for Darling may say to the contrary. My attitude is truly democratic, while those who wish to force their views upon the un| fortunate, elector are undemocratic. The .factor that will undoubtedly cause the electors to realise more full y , not on,ly their privileges,, but also their duties, is the ' gradual spread of education. In education our hope lies. The youth of this nation ought certainly to be made to understand more .of their rights, as w.ell as more of their responsibilities and duties to the nation. Another thing that would increase the number of voters would be for this Parliament to increase in stature and favour with the people. Even honourable members who disagree with the views I have expressed today will at least admit that I have not spoken with any intention or desire, or even with the effect, of wasting time, but for the purpose of expressing views that I honestly hold. I hold those views so strongly that 1 intend to oppose the motion for the second reading of the bill.",25
51,Mr JACKSON,OODNADATTA TO ALICE SPRINGS,"Bass) [4.22] - This is not a bill thatshould be passed hurriedly, and I take this opportunity, in the few minutes at my disposal, to express my views about it. It is necessary, of course, that we should have compulsory enrolment, but I do not admit that compulsory voting is its natural corollary. We have heard a lot about the alleged success of compulsory voting in Queensland, but the honourable member for Boothby (Mr. Duncan-Hughes) has shown that the percentage of electors who vote in many of the states is as high as 73 and 76, and that the average in Queensland since the introduction of compulsory voting has been 82 per cent. At one election, under this system, 79 per cent, of the electors voted. I have yet to be convinced that there is any advantage in compelling people to vote. If the bill is administered as certain honourable members desire, it will involve the issue of half a million summonses whenever we have an election, apart from the cost of postage and the work involved in the postal department. Instead of passing this hurried legislation, I suggest that members should take time to think a little more calmly over it. Compulsory voting was introduced in New Zealand, and, after it had been tried, the old system was reverted to. I am sorry that I have not the full details of that attempt to enforce compulsory voting, but the bill was sprung on me this afternoon, and I had no knowledge of it until I saw it on the notice paper. Had I known of it yesterday, I would have had an opportunity to look up the particulars. In the circumstances, and until I have an opportunity to obtain full information, I shall oppose the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. NA CONSTITUTION. PROVISION FOR NEW STATES.",26
52,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH,"New England) [4.27] - I move That, in the opinion of this House, the Government should, at the earliest opportunity, introduce a bill providing for a referendum of the electors of Australia at the next general election upon a proposal to amend Chapter VI. (New States) of the Commonwealth Constitution, so as to empower the Federal Parliament to create new states within the existing states, with or without the consent of the State Parliaments; sucb power only to be used on the petition of a fixed number of electors in any area, and only after .the State Parliament has failed to take action. I realise that the motion is somewhat comprehensive, and at first blush it is likely to be viewed with a considerable amount of alarm, .if not actual hostility, by those honourable members who, perhaps to their regret, have not given very much attention of late to the ever-pressing question"" of the amendment of the Commonwealth Constitution. But I venture to say that before many years have passed this will be a burning question from one end of Australia to the other. Just as federation, twenty-five years ago, tore Australia, metaphorically speaking, from end to end, so this question, which is really the consummation of federation, will, before long-perhap s in a year or two-be the dominant political issue. I wish to draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that this question of amending the Constitution in the direction indicated in the motion has not previously come before the House in this specific form, although there have been many occasions-on e can hardly number them now-whe n the House has considered amendments of the Constitution. Sometimes the result has been a referendum of the people, and it is significant that although four attempts have been made, to secure the approval of the people to amendments of the Constitution, only one such attempt has been successful, and it is surprising that, in that instance, Parliament 'has not thought fit to exercise the power given to it ; I refer to the amendment of the Constitution to provide for taking over the debts of the states. About fourteen or fifteen years ago a very comprehensive series of amendments setting out certain industrial and commercial powers that it was desired should be under the control of the Commonwealth Parliament, was placed before the electors by the then Labour government. The result of that appeal was a great shock to those ardent patriots who believed that the proposal to confer greater powers upon the Federal Parliament had only to be presented to the people to be adopted by an overwhelming majority. A little later a similar series of questions was put before the electors, and though they had had in the intervening period an opportunity to further consider thoso momentous issues, they once again turned down the proposals to enlarge the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament. Those two appeals showed that it was difficult to secure an amendment of the Constitution unless the people really wanted it, and although it was widely stated at the time that the proposals were rejected mainly because of the people'3 ignorance of them, I believe that the real reason for the refusal to sanction the amendments, although the electors supported the party which placed them before the country, was that they did not see any necessity, for the enlargement of the federal power at the expense of the states. The referendums proved that the federal ideal is deep-rooted in the hearts of the people, and effectually disposed of the contention of a large number of publie men that the majority of Australians desire some unification of it. The unsuccessful appeals for an increase of federal powers show that the people desire to adhere to the federal compact in its essence, and largely in its letter, and will not consent to a variation of the Constitution unless some stronger reason can be shown than hitherto has been placed before them. That brings me to the consideration of whether it is advisable to ask the people once more to amend the Constitution. If we think the time opportune for another reference to the electors we must consider whether we have a reasonable chance of success. It would be useless to adopt . a proposal for a referendum if we were likely to repeat the failures of the past. In asking the House to agree to this motion, I feel confident that, as a result of the war, which completely changed the current of political thought and broadened the outlook of ithe . whole nation, a proposal now to give the Federal Parliament greater power m order to ensure the more rapid development of Australia would receive a very sympathetic hearing, and be agreed to by a large majority of the electors. After the discussion which this motion is bound to evoke, the majority of honourable ' members will, I believe, realise that the time has come for seriously tackling this problem. Early in 1920, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Sir Austin Chapman) submitted a motion providing for the holding of a convention to consider an amendment of section 51 of the Constitution for the purpose of further enlarging Commonwealth powers. The only result of that motion was a very interesting debate. In 1921, the National Government, led by Mr Hughes, introduced a bill to provide for the .holding of an elective convention to consider the amendment of chapter VI . of the Constitution with a view to the creation of new states, and a comprehensive overhaul of the Constitution, for the purpose of so enlarging the functions of the Commonwealth as to avoid, duplication of the efforts of state and Commonwealth, to give the Federal Parliament control of trade and commerce and all industrial affairs, and generally to make the Commonwealth authority supreme in all national concerns. The reception of the bill was so hostile that the Government did not persevere with it, and I think it was eventually thrown under the table. The discussion proved conclusively that there was not in this House a majority of members favor : able to the holding of an elective convention. Members of the Labour party, who previously had been responsible for submitting constitutional amendments by referendums to the people with a view to an enlargement of Commonwealth powers, held the view that a convention was Unnecessary, inasmuch as this Parliament was really a convention of representatives of the people, and had authority to propose amendments of the Constitution, and place them before the electors. It was made clear by the hostility to that bill that it was hopeless to expect the House in its then frame of mind to adopt a proposal for the holding of an elective convention. Since that time, .proposals, for alterations of the Constituti on have remained more or less in abeyance, except that in the interval there has grown up throughout the Common-, wealth a very large and organized body of public opinion in favour of an amendment of chapter VI . of the Constitution, - and, incidentally, of enlarging the general powers of the Commonwealth. It is significant that when _ the previous referendums were decided upon by this House, there was no organized body of public opinion, outside the Labour party, which was really favourable to an amendment of thei Constitution. Therefore, the fact that today there is such an organized body of public opinion which knows what it wants, and is steadily in creasing its strength, is an indication that the. time has arrived when this House should again approach the question of amending the Constitution for the purpose of increasing the powers of this Parliament, in order to bring about a more rapid development throughout Australia. The first definite move in this Parliament was made by me, as the honorary general secretary of. the new states movement. In July .last I had the privilege of leading a deputation, representing the Count r y and National parties-unfortunately, "" the members of the Labour party did not care to; join with us- which asked the Prime Minister to bring before the House - a definite proposal to amend chapter - VI. of the Constitution.",26
53,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH,The Labour party had its own proposals.,28
54,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH,"I am aware, of that. The Prime Minister, in reply to representations made by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham), the honourable member for Forrest (Mr . Prowse), myself, and others, said- - He gave them an assurance that the Government realized that it had to investigate the matter very closely indeed, with a view to coining to some determination as to whether action was to be taken. The time when they would' have to come to the point of giving expression to their opinions would be next year. It would almost certainly be next year when the question of constitutional alterations would be considered by the Federal Parliament if the present Government was still in office. When that time came ""their suggestions would receive the very fullest consideration. The Government has not taken any steps to translate that fairly, definite promise into action. I do not blame the Government, because, with the large amount of work it has in hand, it can hardly be expected to initiate a big movement like this unless it has been given a definite lead by this House. Therefore, as a representative of the new states movement outside Parliament, I consider it my duty to bring before honourable members without further delay the real importance of our movement, and to make a definite request that this House shall give an instruction to the Government to in troduce a .bill for the holding of a referendum. If the bill is agreed to, the various political parties may be lef t to place the issue fairly and squarely, before the people. I do not propose to enter into a long controversial debate at this stage, but I desire to give to the House some reason why this Parliament should now consider the creation of new states. Hitherto, the matter has been dealt with only tentatively in this House, and the principal result of the debate initiated by the honourable member for Eden Monaro in 1920 was to bring to light the written proposals of the"" Labour party for unification. That was a definite step forward. Ifc enabled us to study the views of the Labour party. As newstaters, representing a very definite movement which is in many respects strongly : antagonistic to some of the essential features of unification, ' we nevertheless have the greatest respect for the opinions of the-Labour party, and we hope that before the matter is allowed to become a definite issue between us, some efforts will be made to reconcile' our divergent opinions. We believe that the Labour party, in proposing unification, is honestly desirous of advancing the welfare of Australia. But the industrial element in that party, which was largely responsible for placing the unification plank in its platform, was not - aware of the really vital issues at stake in r u r a l . Australia. We believe that if the rural men in the Labour parfcy had had a bigger say in framing its proposals, the unification plank would have been considerably modified. For that reason, and in the hope t t men in the Labour party who n a know what the problems of Australia's broad spaces are will use their influence to secure a modification of the unification plank, we new-staters make an offer to the Labour party which we hope later will be translated into action. We hope that they will meet our executive, which is a fairly large and influential body, and discuss with it the whole question, so that we may go to the country on the issue as one body, and not as two warring' factions, which would probably defeat each other. It is a big thing to ask this Parliament to sanction the holding of .a referendum at the next federal election. The great war bas been over for five years, but no effort has been-made by the states or the Commonwealth to bring about the new era of development, progress, and decentralization which we. all flattered ourselves would be the outcome of the world upheaval, and some compensation for the enormous expenditure Australia has had tq make. We are all waiting, like Micawber, for something to turn. up, but it will not turn up unless we take the initiative. On behalf of the new states movement of Australia, I invite honourable members of this House to give earnest consideration to .our platform and literature, to study, as well, the unification proposals of the Labour party, and to take such action as they think best in the interests of Australia.  them unification proposals?",28
55,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH,I do so because they are the definite unification proposals of the Labour pafty. Mr .PARKER MOLONEY - That is so.,29
56,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH,"As some of the state legislatures are actually carrying resolutions inviting this Parliament Co take action in the creation of new states, it is .our duty to give immediate heed to their requests. Sir George Puller, Premier of New South Wales, during ""his campaign at the last state elections, was reported as follows:Sir George Fuller, speaking at Wollongong, said the new state movement was a striking expression of discontent with the state of affairs created hy the overgrowth of the city and the strangling influence which centralizes too much in the Capital, thereby arresting the proper velopment of the country. There are good grounds for discontent, and some remedy is called for which will give scope to the of country districts for extensive powers of self-government and self-development. Without going to the extent of saying that "" new states,"" as proposed, are the remedy, I am in favour of recasting the' machinery of .government in Australia, with a view to agreeing upon proposals that will effect the purposesaimed at. The area of Australia is larger than that of the. United States of America,, where ithcre are 48 states and two territoriesI t is certain that the continent of Australia w i ll not continue for all time with only six states. Alterations must come, and furtlier divisiori he made. The matter is one for federal: as well as for state action, and I shalt be willing to expedite and assist in an early aud adequate consideration of the question. That is a definite offer from a man wbo has since become Premier of the principal state of the Commonwealth. Subsequently, in the New South Wales Parliament, Lieutenant-Colonel Bruxner moved a resolution, which was amended by Captain Chaffey, to read as follows:That the - large area of the state of New South Whiles makes it desirable that the creation of a separate state in northern New South Wales .should be taken into early consideration! by a Federal convention summoned for the purpose, and to. consider the boundaries of thestates and distribution of legislative powers between the states and Commonwealth. That this resolution be conveyed to --tihe Federal Government and Governments of the states with a yiew to securing their concurrence. The amendment was agreed to on the voices. The resolution was conveyed 'to> the Eederal Government, and last year A letter, waa received from the Prime Minister-(Mr Bruce) drawing attention ""to the provisions of the Federal Constitution, and inviting the Government of New not South Wales, to indicate what areas it desired to have formed into new states. As a result of that letter, the New South Wales Parliament appointed a royal commission, which is now making investigations throughout New South Wales. In that state there are three definite subdivision proposals, one for northern New South Wales, embracing an area of 110,000 square miles, with a population of 359,000, which is greater than that ,of Western - Australia; another for ,the Biverina, an area of about 80,000 square miles, with a population of 150,000 people; and the other a small area in the Monaro district, of 25,000 square de- miles, with a population of between 30,000 and 40,000. That royal commisdesire sion is collecting evidence, but up to the present has visited only northern New South Wales, where the movement is best organized. The proportion of witnesses in favour of new states has been ten to one. What the proportion will he when the comniission takes evidence in the Riverina and Monaro, I cannot say. It is questionable what will-be the outcome of the investigations of the commission. If that body recommends that New South Wales be divided into three separate states, it will then remain for the New South Wales Parliament to decide what action it shall take. New South Wales has taken a definite step forward, as no legalized tribunal has ever before been appointed in Australia to investigate the question of new states. Prior to federation, the subdivision of Queensland, with its immense area of 670,000 square miles, into three self-governing states was one of the most burning questions before the people. I i i fact, one of the speakers at the Federal Convention said, with rather an air of contempt, that, in his opinion, the Queensland people wanted the subdivision of that state into three separate states more than they wanted federation. Prior to the Federal Convention, the Secretary of State for the Colonies had suggested that, in order to make it practicable for Queensland to be divided into three states, it should enter the federation. The idea was held at that time that federation would facilitate the subdivision of Queensland. Sir Samuel Griffith, in 1892, introduced a bill into the Queensland Parliament providing for the ^division of Queensland into three locally administered areas. powers were to be given to the provinces, and they in turn were to be controlled by a central parliament sitting in Brisbane. Each of the three divisions was to be in extent about 200,000 square miles. Although that scheme would not appeal to the people of Australia today, yet if it had been carried into effect prior to federation, Queensland would have .been a much better and more productive country than it is today.",29
57,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH,"That proposed subdivision was only for revenue allocation, and not for self-government.",30
58,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable meinber is mistaken. I shall be only too glad to let him see the authority for my statement. If the people of Western Australia had not been so crassly stupid as to refuse the offer of the British colonial authorities to divide that state into three separate states, Western Australia would have been in a much better position than it is today. Instead bf having half its population in the city of Perth, and the other half scattered over an area comprising one-third of this continent, Western Australia might have been divided into three fairly evenly balanced states' of considerably more value to the Commonwealth than the state is at present. If the pre-federal generation had made use of its opportunity to establish three states in Queensland and three in Western Australia, Australia would not be bearing a burden of two huge territories, which, in spite of their enormous possibilities and the local patriotism of their representatives in both the federal and state spheres, are not nearly - so advanced as they should be. The movement for the subdivision of Australia-, .a country 900 square miles larger than the United States of America, was foreseen by the late Sir Henry Parkes when he saidAs a matter of reason and logical forecast, it cannot be doubted that, if the union were inaugurated with double the number of the present colonies, the growth and prosperity of all would be more absolutely assured. It would add immeasurably to the national importance of the new Commonwealth, and would be of' immense advantage to Western Australia, South Australia, and Queensland themselves if four or five new colonies were cut out of their vast and unmanageable territories. Certain He went on to point, out that if the partners to the federal union were equal in wealth, population, resources, or territory, the chances of a stable national equilibrium and a successful political union would be immeasurably increased. What Sir Henry Parkes foresaw in those days is being foreseen by the present generation. The political and economic consequence of the late war is the root motive of the discontent existing today in rural New South Wales. The new states movement is very difficult for the city people to understand. Unfortunately, in Australia we have the greatest centralization evil in the world. We are living to a large extent in a - fool's paradise, and do not know where we are d r if t in g. A large number of us do not seem to care, but that casual spirit cannot continue in a country occupied by 5,500,000 people, with a population density of 1.87 to the square mile. Australia is the most sparsely peopled civilized country in the world, and that fact is not often enough impressed upon our pleasure-loving people. If the taking of a referendum at the next elections w i ll convey to the people the nature of the issues with which they will be faced in the near future, then, even if turned down, the referendum will have more than justified itself. I shall quote figures to show the serious extent to which centralization has grown in this country. On the 31st December, 1921, the population of New South Wales was 2,127,271, Victoria 1,550,952, Queensland 770,016, South Australia 502,603, Western Australia 335,173, Tasmania 218,413, a total of population of 5,510,239. The density of population was 1.87 per square mile. In the city of Sydney and suburbs the population was 926,400, and the percentage to the total population of the state 43.55; Melbourne, population 795,100, percentage 51.27; Brisbane, populatiou 217,714, percentage 28.27; Adelaide, population 260,542, percentage 51.27; Perth, population 155,572, percentage 46.42; and Hobart, population 53,803, percentage 24.63. The total population of the six capital cities was 2,409,151, or 43.77 per cent, of the total population of the Commonwealth. Half o i the population of Australia is in its capital cities. That is a condition of affairs not to be found anywhere else in the world. It is said that this tendency of the rural population to d r if t to the cities is universal, but Australia is the only country in the world which exhibits a spectacle so unique. Its big capital cities are monopolizing all the trade and wealth of the country, and steadily attracting the rural population to them. If we look at the position in other countries, we shall better realise the plight that Australia is in . In New Zealand the percentage of the population in the capital city is 8.82. The percentage of the population of Denmark in Copenhagen is 25.25 ; in England the percentage of the population in London, not including greater London, is Census Sydney Melbourne and and Year. Suburbs.

So. the figures run u n t i l we find that in Rome the percentage of the population to that of It a l y is only 1.64. The highest percentage of population in a capital city in Europe is 30.3 per cent, in Vienna. We can realise what centralization is in Australia when we remember that the figures given for other countries represent the percentages of population in the capital cities of countries in which the capital is only one of many large cities. ' Th,e urban population of Australia, and by that is meant the capital city and country town population, is today 61.99 per cent, of the total population of the country. In New South Wales the urban population is 67.81 of the total population of the state, and in Victoria it is 62.29 of the total population of the state. The figures of the urban population are steadily increasing, and there is not the slightest doubt that the increase will place us in a very difficult position before very long. Australians do not give much consideration to the question of where we are d r if t in g. We have already the greatest centralization of population in the world. I made it my business to secure from the Commonwealth Statistician some figures based upon the present trend of population and development in Australia. I should like to place them before honourable members, because they show clearly that unless something is done we shall in this country, before long, meet with an economic disaster, if not a worse. One of the questions which I asked the Commonwealth Statistician was: If the rate of increase of population during the past 50 years continues for the next 50 years, what will the population of the capital cities of Australia be in 1931, 1941, 1951, 1961, and 1971? Brisbane Adelaide Perth Hobart and and. and and Six Suburbs. Capitals. Suburbs. Suburbs.

The table also shows that in 1971, if the present rate of centralization continues, 64 persons out of every 100 in Australia will be living in the six capital cities. The position in regard to primary production is sufficiently alarming. .1 Census New Viotoria. Year. Soutli Wales. 1870 1891 10.33 -8.98 1901 9.92 11.13 1921 8.37 9.06 The figures show a steady decline in .the population engaged in our primary industries from 1-901 to 1921, and that is still going on.

The question I put to the Statistician was: What was the percentage .of population engaged in primary production, exclusive of - mining, in each of the six existing states in 1870, 1891, 1-901, and 1921? The following table was supplied in answer to this question:Queensland. South Western Tasmania. Six Australia. Australia - States. Not availa ble 14.32 10.65 15.02 13.35 : 10.59 13.47 11.82 8.55 13.01 11.04 13:14 10.28 - 12.00 12.38 9.78 percentage - engaged in primary production in each of .the six existing states in 1931, 1941, 1951, 1961, 1971? In answer to that question the following table was supplied:Queensland. South Western _ Tasmania. : Six Australia. Australia.

The figures supplied in answer to my question show that in New South Wales the public debt in 1901 was £67,000,000, and, assuming debt and population continue to increase as during the last 50 years, in 1951 it will be £850,000,000. In Victoria the public debt was £50,000,000 in 1901, and in 1951 i * will be £341,000,000. In Queensland the figure for 1901 was £38,000,000, and in 1951 it will be £514,000,000. In South Australia the figures given are: for 1901, £26,000,000; for 1951,, £313,000,000. In Western Australia the figures are: 1901, £12,000,000; for 1951, £371,000,000. For Tasmania the figures are: 1901, £8,000,000; for 1951, £92,000,000. In reply to another question regarding the direct taxation per head, I have been in formed by the Commonwealth Statistician that in New South Wales in 1901 it amounted to 16s. I d . , and if it continued at the present rate would amount in 1971' to £ 9 9 2s. For Victoria the figures given are: 1901, 12s. 4d. per head; 1971, £60 16s. For Queensland the figures are: 1901, 10s. l i d . per head;'1971, £613 16s. per head of the population. For South Australia the figures are: 1901, 14s. 8d. per head; 1971, £135. "" For Western Australia the figures given are: 1901, 17s. l i d . ; 1971, £32 l s. For Tasmania the figures are: 1901, 13s.; 1971, £88 6s. Of course, the figures regarding debt and taxation per head are not likely to be realized, because long before that stage was reached most of the population would have dropped dead from heart failure, or there would have been a tion, and political existence in these states would be impossible. not think that the figures I have obtained have been presented before, but they show conclusively that the present tendency to centralization in the big capital cities, if not-severely checked, will result before another 50 years in Australia being faced with a more serious economic crisis than has confronted any country in the world. I quote the figures in order to get them on record as indicating clearly to those who wish to study the matter that as we are driftin g at present there is little hope that we can <Io very much to check the centralization that is going on in Australia. We are livin g in the hope that things will change for the better. Yet, on the figures which are available, we are forced to the conclusion that unless some definite attempt is made, not only by the federal legislature, but also by the legislatures of the states , the time, must arrive when the task will be beyond our powers, and it will take a revolution to do what we, as a Parliament, have signally failed, to do.. My object in bringing this issue forward is to sound a note of warning. There is a tendency on the part of honourable members to treat casually matters which, do not vitally affect the immediate political issues. In their hearts they know that the problem is getting beyond us, but they bave that Australian optimism which leads them to think that some day ani n spired leader will arise, who will show us the way to escape, or that the people themselves will do what the politicians have failed to do. This subject, however, is essentially one for the politicians of Australia, who are the leaders of the people. It is unfortunate that many of them, soon after entering the legislative halls, cease to take any great interest in those issues which led to their election. One of the issues responsible for my presence in this House was that of decentralization. As honorary general secretary of the new states movement, I consider it to be my duty to place this matter before the Parliament of the Commonwealth ; and I am hopeful that, as a result of my remarks, important political developments will follow. I can assure honourable member that the new staters, revolu- both inside and outside of Parliament, will not let this matter rest. It I do is a big issue, upon which it is very difficult to get public attention focussed. It is difficult even to obtain the attention of politicians to it . Legislators largely reflect public opinion. If there is no popular excitement, they do not themselves feel excited. All the big issues of the past were raised by a few men. Federation itself, which revolutionized the political life of Australia, was the result of the persistent efforts of a few men, who had first to contend against public apathy, then against public hostility, and, later, against direct political antagonism, which very nearly brought about the defeat of their-objective. The same thing is likely to occur in this connection. Notwithstanding the' contention of the members of-the Labour party, wbo say that they bave a scheme which is a heaven-sent in spiration for the salvation of rura l Aus- tralia, my experience is that their actions do not accord with their theories. If they consider it to be their duty to save Australia from the tremendous economic disaster that is slowly, but surely, overtaking it,, they are not true to their trust in acting as they do; and they show themselves to be but unreliable leaders of the people.  the Labour party? The Government which the honourable member supports has a majority in this chamber, and he should appeal in that quarter.",30
59,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH,"The Labour party says that it has a scheme which will revolutionize Australia. If that is so, why do members of the party make no attempt to bring it before the people of Australia ? The new staters are prepared to examine the merits of the Labour party's proposal. Similarly, we expect them to examine our proposals on their merits. Our proposals have received more attention from the people than have those of the Labour party, and although we may not be on the right track, we feel confident that in comparison with the much vaunted unification scheme of the Labour party, our proposals are more worthy of the consideration of the people of Australia. I desire to bring before honourable members opposite the results which has attended a trial of unification in South Africa , and I ask them to seriously consider whether, in view of the experience there, they are wise in persisting with their proposal in Australia. I shall, therefore, quote from the Round Table magazine for September, 1923, where, under the heading Provincial Experiment,"" the - following appears:The Britisli Commonwealth, having members in every one of the five continents, each facing its own problems in its own peculiar circumstances, each feeling more and more its responsibility for its own destiny, yet all alike animated by the spirit of free government, and all conscious of a unity of outlook which is even more deeply felt than widely talked about, affords unique opportunities for carrying out political and social experiments. But tliere is one experiment that will probably not t« repeated in any part of the Commonwealth, and that is the experiment in vincial government which has been made in South Africa since union. An adverse con-chision must be drawn from the experience of thirteen years, even though it must be admitted that the experiment was not made under those conditions of free choice and mastery of the operative forces which are present in the case of a really The South Africa Act of 1009 therefore embodied a unitary constitution. It contained many federal features, but those who drew it up left no room for doubt that the Union Parliament and Executive'were to be supreme - over the provincial authorities. Some delegation of powers by the central Government was' necessary if union was to - be effected and to prove workable when achieved. But the provincial system actually adopted was admittedly blame an experiment and was not intended to be permanent. "" It was hoped,"" wrote Sir Edgar Walton, "" that by eventually splitting up the provinces into smaller areas we should arrive at some general system as the model adopted by the Cape,"" that is, Divisional Councils. Union, then, was, as it were, snatched and held by a community which, for two generations past, had looked for nothing more than a loose federation. It was held at the price of the provincial experiment. The experiment has failed politically and financially, and, though the two aspects are intimately related, they can be discussed separately. The political failure can be summed up in a sentence. The system has given us all the evils of party government with none of its advantages. The Provincial Councils are elected for three years and expire by effluxion of time. The constituencies are, except in the two smaller provinces, the same as those for the Union lower House; hence the party organization which manages the one also manages the other, and the same general aims and ideas are operative in both cases. Membership of a Provincial Council is more and more regarded as an apprenticeship for the wider sphere of Parliament. Moreover, the fact that senators are elected at a joint sitting of Provincial Councillors and Members of Parliament for the Province tends to .strengthen the identity of party interests in the two bodies. The Councils' powers of legislation and taxation are strictly limited. Of the duties entrusted to their care "" education other than higher"" is far and away the most important. Were "" The that taken away, the work remaining would not be sufficient to warrant their continued existence. None the less, the Councils have, from the first, conducted their business on parliamentary lines, though party cleavages have been more marked amid the diversities of the Cape and the Transvaal than in the comparative homogeneity of Natal and the Freo State. The procedure of legislation is much the same as in Parliament, and there is the usual apparatus of caucus, party whips, speeches and manoeuvres. The main difference is that the Executive does not retire after au adverse vote, but usually patches up an arrangement by private negotiation, often, indeed, invoking the aid of the Union Governpro- ment, which, to do it justice, does not willingly intervene in the parochial squabbles of the provinces. . But just as we have the forms and vices of party government with none of its advantages, so we have some of the forms and some of the vices of local government with few, if any of its advantages. Por the provincial system does not supply real scientific test. local government. The financial weaknesses of the present system are discussed below, but here it may be noted that, on the political side, the central feature of parliamentary government is lacking, namely, the responsibility of the executive for meeting the expenses of government by taxes levied through the legislature. Throughout their history, provincial administrations have derived more of their funds from the Union exchequer than from their own provincial resources. Eecent years of depression have proved that the ultimate liquidator of provincial deficits is not the provincial taxpayer as such, but the Union Government. The financial failure of the system has been amply demonstrated by the Beport of the Commission. The Commission was appointed in September, 1922, as the result of a breakdown in provincial finance which had occurred earlier in the year. Parliament discussed the situation and agreed to a temporary loan of £200,000 each to the Transvaal and the Cape, leaving it to the projected Commission to inquire fully into the nnancial requirements and resources of the provinces, with a view to necessary re-adjustments. Whatever may be the fate of the main recommendations of the report, and whatever may be the prospects of its adoption as a whole, Parliament will be compelled next session to take action on at least two of the vital financial issues which are raised:(a) It must lay down a revised basis for the payment of Union subsidies. (6) It must define much more precisely the sources of taxation which may bo utilized by Provincial Councils. The Commission itself proposes to allow them as taxes in regard to which they may use their own taxing powers:-Liquo r licences; dog, fish and game licences; motor and wheel taxes; entertainments tax; taxes on racing; immovable property tax; education fees for otlier than compulsory education, and hospital fees. The main immediate results up to date of the appearance of a report which is, in many respects, a model State document, thorough, lucid, and logical, are:1. That political institutions which are so constructed as to leave financial responsibility in a medium of uncertainty and cross-purposes cannot possibly last, but may work infinite mischief before they finally collapse. 2. That local government is impossible when a locality (a real ""locality"") is not prepared to assume a large enough share of the iinancial burden to guarantee stability and a steady check upon extravagance. The growing centralization of South African State finance is a danger which is not by any means appreciated as it should be. Demoralization of a very serious kind is possible unless a scheme of local governinent is devised upon a stable basis in local finance. Already the signs of such demoralization are beginning to appear. I have quoted from the Bound Table show to those who desire to introduce unification into Australia, the effects that system in South Africa . Before members opposite commit themselves to failure. a scheme about which they appear to know very little, they should take the trouble to look into it carefully. They may then be prepared to adopt a better scheme in Australia. I remind honourable members of what the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) said some years ago concerning the Australian Labour party's policy of unification. The policy may contain features which appeal to some honourable members, but I do not consider that it is likely to be adopted by the people of Australia. First, unification creates a big centralized political system, and does not give the provinces that real self-government which is a requirement of rural Australia.",34
60,Mr MAHONY,COMMONWEALTH,It does give power to the local authorities.,35
61,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH,"I hope that if the honourable member addresses the House on this subject, he will endeavour to make that point clear. At present, the country people of Australia, who are interested in the new states movement, do not understand that it is so. They think that if the scheme is adopted, it will create a glorified legislature in Melbourne or in Canberra, that the central legislature will have control of all the main details of provincial life, and that the provincial councils will merely be glorified shire councils, with the privilege of controlling local administration but not local development.",35
62,Mr MAHONY,COMMONWEALTH,Why does not the honourable member quote some of the articles I wrote for the New Stale Magazine?,35
63,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH,"I shall oblige the honourable member by quoting portion of an article written by him for the Nev) Slate Magazine. It appeared in the October, 1921, number, and is as follows It is impossible for us to alter our Constitution, but Soutli Africa, profiting by the errors made by America and' Australia, was able to avoid the disabilities under which we suffer.

As I refused was saying, it is unfortunate that the an attempt should be made to critioize lionorable members of the Labour party for not doing their part to bring about the subdivision of Australia. It is the d u t y of the Government to formulate the necessary legislation, and not to leave it to a private member to move a motion on private members' day, whioh will lead the House nowhere. The honourable member for New England has no right to say that the House would not agree to a federal convention, because his Government have not put the matter to the test. Although he says that past proposals to alter the Constitution have been turned down by the people at various referendums, he wants to submit his proposed reform to a referendum of the people. If he really thinks the people would vote against amendments, why not induce the Government to bring down a bill of a comprehensive character?

81,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH,"The Ministry is very busy, for there have been long negotiations.",38

85,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH,"I am glad of your protection, Mr Speaker",38
86,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH,The honourable member himself introduced the irrelevant matter.,38
87,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH,"I was dealing with the statement of the honourable member for New England that the Ministry had no time, and I wanted to show that it had time to pass legislation to refund £1,300,000 to the big pastoral companies, and to introduce a number of other measures designed expressly to bolster up wealthy commercial interests. I would like to point out, too, that the National party, if it were true to the platform recently promulgated by the National Federation conference, would require any prodding to make it - come forward with such a sure as I desire. The party, recognizing that the subdivision of Australia was popular, placed it as a plank in its platform. Surely it would not be difficult for one with the energy and persistency of the Treasurer to induce the Government to submit a bill . I have dealt with that phase of the subject because the honourable member for New England, wrongly, I think, criticized members on this side of the House. As soon as we have an opportunity to form a Government;and that w i ll be before very long- a definite scheme will be placed before Parliament. The Labour party 'may come into power even before the next Federal election, if the Federal Country party acts similarly to the Victorian Country party. I shall not touch on that aspect of the question, seeing that you, Mr Speaker, have been mentioned as a possible successor of one of the Ministers, furthe r than to say that, if the alleged representatives of the Country party here had the same fighting spirit as the members of the Victoria n Country party, they would insist upon the introduction of measures for the amendment of the Constitution. They could make a definite request to the Government, and obtain what they want. The statement that honourable members on this side have not been true to their trust could be applied with, more justice to honourable members opposite. Australia is too large to be subdivided into only six states. The Constitution should be remodelled to provide for a greater number of self-governing states. Unlimited powers should be given to the Commonwealth Parliament, with a devolution of adequate local-governing powers to subordinate legislatures. An effort has been made by the honourable member for New England to convey the impression that the Labour party favours one parliament for the whole of Australia.",38
88,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH,"Hear , hear!",38
89,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) believes in one parliament for Australia, and some other members of the National party support that view. I believe that the Townsville branch of the National Federation included the proposal in its platform.",38
90,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTH,Yes .,38
91,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH,"I am glad to have not the honourable member's admission. On that subject the platform of the mea- Federal Parliamentary Labour party answers the statement that members on this side stand for one parliament for the whole of Australia. It would be a good thing if the state parliaments, as they are constituted today, were abolished, and a larger number of simple provincial governments, or state governments, whatever they might be called, shorn of the expense of the paraa phernalia of governors and upper houses, and with adequate powers for all local developmental purposes. It is a subject for argument what powers should be given to the local governing authorities. The Labour party's platform reads as follows:1. Complete Australian self-government Britisli oommunity. No Imperial federation. Administration on advice of Australian isters only, su'bject to the control of monwealtli Parliament.

97,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH,"I am prepared to hear argument on that. That would have to be decided. When one is about to build house one does not decide before commencing every detail of the furnishings for every corner of the house. The foundation of the scheme for remodelling the Commonwealth Constitution can be laid, and the details left for settlement later. We should not split our forces on details at this stage. If we attempt now to as a determine all the details we shall get Minnowhere, because it is impossible to the Comsecure unanimity, and those opposed to except new states will use every excuse to The Government further should make a move, and the future Government will certainly do so, I know prothat the control of the railways is a very People in some censucli tres say that the trunk lines should be or controlled by the Commonwealth, and the Mr Theodore was told in Queensland, when a deputation to be from central Queensland asked him to new introduce a bill into the State Parliament, that the Federal Labour party stood for unification. That was just behis trip to England. Mr Theodore's statement on the subject was reported in the Brisbane .Daily M a i l of the 12th the July, 1922. He interpreted the Labour partes platform very well when he saidReconstruction is one of the objectives of the Federal Labour party. It involves loss centhan unification. Under reconstructhere would be a greater number of state or provincial governments than now. Each - of of these would be concerned with purely local such as land settlement, police, local authorities, health, education, ithe administration of justice, and otlier matters of the It stands to reason that with a greater number of such governments than at present there Would be less centralization.

Since he came back from England, may, he has said that the Commonwealth electorsandof thestate, Constitution requires amending, and increase, that it should be. remodelled give greater powers to the Commonwealth Parliament. I think we are all agreed operation on that, so why should we quarrel at this alteration of stage about the limits of the state constiaffected. tutions? No matter what party we support, we must recognize that the concention tration of governing, financial, and industhe trial power in one corner of a state or the area of an empire-as in Queensland, Western Australia, and New South Wales affected. - especiall y in a country where governThe ment has an exceptional influence upon progress, it must mean financial barrentroduce ness and stagnation. The broad general principle of self-government for northern and central Queensland or northern New South Wales, by means of provincial state parliaments having adequate powers for all local developmental purposes, must meet with the approval of all honourable Parliament, members. The ""establishment of new This states is essential to Australian advancement ment and power, and possibly to the daries maintenance of our race, aud our national ment life, because it is necessary to deCommonwealth velop this countiy and make it ready to maintain in happiness millions more men and women. Public men, irrespective of the party, recognize that need, though they may differ as to the methods to be subject adopted. It is indisputable that the prethe sent system of governing Australia wealtli is grotesquely elaborate, grossly exParliament travagant, and very inefficient. There is constant overlapping of state and not federal activities, and quarrels tween the two authorities as to their respective powers. The best policy would be to deal with this problem as big national question by submitting this parliament proposals fqr - the modelling of the Constitution. The matter should not be dealt with pieceWales meal; we must take a broad Australian 1922, s a i d view. There is a diversity of opinion as 124Professor to whether the states have now power to statesstood alter their own boundariesj and as to whether the initial move to give self government to an area lite northern New South Wales should be made by the State Parliament or the Federal Parliament. The two relevant sections of the Constitution read123. The Parliament of the Commonwealth witli the consent of thei Parliament of aapproval of the majority of the the state voting upon the question, diminish, or otherwise alter thelimits to of the state, upon such terms and conditions as may bc agreed on, and may, with the like consent, make provision respecting the effect and of any increase, or diminution, or territory in relation toany state 124. A new state may be formed by separaof territory from a state, but only with consent of the Parliament thereof, and a new state may be formed by the union of two more states or parts of states, but only with the consent of the Parliaments of the states Premier of Queensland when asked, prior to Ms first trip to England, to in a measure into the State Parliament to subdivide Queensland into three states, submitted the matter to the Solicitor-General of Queensland,, and received or from him the following opinion:Sections 121 and 123 of the Cormnonwealtli Constitution provide that the Commonwealth with the consent of the State Parlintment, shall have power to create new states. would enable the Commonwealth Parliato create a new state within the bounof an existing state. The State Parliahas no power to create new states or to subdivide its territory for that purpose'. The Parliament must initiate the necessary legal action in the matter - This would be done by passing a bill establishing new state by defining its boundaries ands its constitution. The bill would provide that the establishment of the new state would be to the terms and conditions imposed by Commonwealth Parliament, including the extent of its representation, in the Gommon Parliament, and to the consent of the of the State. Accordingto Quick and Garran, the creation of a new state is required to be approved by a majority of electors at a poll. Tliey say that section 123 bedoes not affect section 124. It is interesting to note that the opinion a given by the Queensland Solicitor-Geneto ral is borne out by Professor Harrison reMoore. Lieutenant-Colonel Bruxner, in a speech delivered in the New South Parliament on the. 22nd August, Harrison Moore said that section by itself. By this provision,, new. may be formed out of existing states by the division of a state, by the union of states, or by the separation of parts of states and their union. Apparently the authority which forms sucli new states is the Commonwealth Parliament, but the consent of the Parliament of the state or states affected is required. The more probable view is that action under this section does not require the approval of the electors under, section 123. Lieutenant-Colonel Bruxnea: is one of the leaders of the new states movement in New South Wales, and has, no doubt, made a full study of the constitutional aspect. He went on to sayThe actual formation of the state is a Commonwealth matter. The power of .saying whether the states shall be formed or not is a state matter. The Commonwealth may wish to make 50 new states, but without the consent of the Parliament of the state or states concerned, it cannot move. Those opinions indicate that the initiative rests with the Commonwealth Parliament. The acquiescence of the states concerned is a subsequent stage. Therefore, Mr Theodore held that it was not necessary for the State Parliament to pass a bill u n t i l the initiative had been taken by this Parliament, and he declared that if the Commonwealth Parliament could be induced to pass the necessary legislation, he would see that the matter was considered without delay by the Queensland Parliament. Accordingly, representations were made to the Commonwealth Government, but, despite the fact that the Treasurer and Deputy Leader of that Government is the leader of the new states movement, nothing has been done. The states say that the matter is one for the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth refers it back to the states. game goes on. Finally, there is a reference to a royal commission, some members of which draw, in fees, about 30 guineas a day.",40
101,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH,Did the Queensland people indicate to the Commonwealth Government the boundaries that they proposed ?,41
102,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH,"It is difficult to lay down arbitrary boundaries, but the subdivision of Queensland would be simplified by the fact that, in 1879, the state was divided into three districts for financial purposes. Their boundaries would suffice tentatively. It would be easy to make that portion of Queensland lying north of Mackay one state, between Mackay and Bundaberg another state, and the portion south of Bundaberg a thir d state. However, sub-divisional details could be decided later.",41
103,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH,-iBu t were the suggested boundaries mentioned to the Federal Government?,41
104,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH,"I understand that they were,. and that the matter was referred back to the State Government. There it has rested, but I hope that the Federal Parliament will take the initiative. Mt; FENTON - The determination of the boundaries of new states sbould not be affected by existing state boundaries. Community of interests must be considered. Mr i FORDE - That is so. Wallangarra, which is on the border of New South Wales and Queensland, might, for instance, be in the centre of a new province, and people on both sides of the Murray river might be included in one new state or province. The people in the sugar districts of Bundaberg and Childers might, because of community of interests, be included in one state. And so on.",41
105,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH,Do I understand the honourable member to say that the Federal Government refused to take action when requested so to do by the Queensland Government?,41
106,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH,"The matter was referred to the Federal Government, and I understand - that the Queensland Government was told that the matter was one for action by the State Parliament. On the eve of the last general election, the then Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) made a definite promise to introduce into this Parliament a bill for the holding of a constitutional convention. A bill for So the that purpose was presented to the House, but it was dropped. The right honourable gentleman is reported, on page 14260 of Hansard of the 9th December, 1921, as having saidThe present position is well known to honourable members. There is no prospect of the bill being passed into law. I desire further to announce that the Government, at the earliest possible moment next session, will bring down such proposed amendments of the Constitution as it thinks desirable . . . . The Government will exercise its own right to determine which, if any, of such amendments shall receive its support when they are submitted to the people. As Prime Minister and Leader of the National party, the honourable member went before the electors, and he was returned at the head of the strongest party in this House. Mainly through the action of the Leader of the Country party, the present Treasurer (Dr Earl* Page), the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) was deposed from the leadership of the Government, arid had no chance of carrying out his definite pledge. . Nevertheless, a responsibility rested upon the National party, and its new Leader (Mr Bruce) should have carried out the undertaking of his predecessor to submit to the Houso definite proposals for the amendment of the Constitution, and he should have been aided by his Treasurer, the Leader of the Country party; but the Government has not attempted to do what the preceding Prime Minister promised to do. Surely the five Country party members could have forced the Government to act up to the election pledges. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) is an eminent barrister and KC, and he holds the view that a convention for the amendment of the Constitution would have only recommendatory powers, and its'decisions would not bind this Parliament. From the Government we have heard no expression of opinion, and no explanation has been offered as to why action in respect of this matter has been delayed, or why some other proposal has not been submitted. The electors were promised by the Country party that definite steps would be taken to create new states, but nothing of the kind has been done. In my opinion, the Federal Parliament should grapple with this question immediately. Why should we hand our task over to any outside body ? Had I, like the Treasurer, suddenly found myself in the position of Acting Prime Minister, I would have called to my aid such men as the Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth (Sir Robert Garran), Professor Peden of Sydney University, and Professor Harrison Moore of the Melbourne University; I would have conveyed to them my ideas, and asked them to frame a bill for submission to Parliament so that honourable members .might have something definite upon which to express their opinions. We are paid a handsome yearly allowance, and it is not wise to hand over our jobs to numerous commissions and conventions such as have been appointed from time to time to do the work that is rightly the responsibility of this Parliament. The people of any area should be given the right to say whether or not they want local self government, and they should not be Mr Forde. tricked as they have been in the past by the refusal of the State and Federal Governments to take action. The new states movement is no novelty in Queensland; it was initiated in 1864, and Rockhampton, the centre of my present electorate, and also of the electorate I represented in the Queensland Parliament, was its birthplace. It started seven years after Queensland became a separate colony. The movement was pressed in 1867, 1872, 1876, 1877, 1879, 1886, 1890, 1893, and at intervals right up to the present time, but the efforts to obtain self-government for central Queensland were always thwarted. In 1890, when this question was definitely placed before the Secretary of State for the Colonies, through Sir Henry Wylie Norman, the Governor of Queensland made the following memorandum on a petition that was sent to the Secretary of State for the Colonies asking that self-government be given to central Queensland:I have not as yet been convinced that a majority of the people in central Queensland desire separation. Subsequently Sir Samuel Griffith, who was then Premier of Queensland, and had been opposed to the subdivision of the colony, was induced, as a result of his tour through central and northern Queensland, to introduce in the Queensland Parliament on the 23rd June, 1892, a bill to subdivide Queensland into three provinces. Mr A. H . Barlow moved an amendment to eliminate central Queensland, and this was carried. As a result, the bill was withdrawn. Another biU was introduced, entitled "" Constitution Bill No. 2,"" which provided for two provinces, southern and northern Queensland, each to be self-governed. That bill was carried in the Assembly by 32 votes to 8, but was defeated in the Legislative Council. Some time later-in 1893Mt. G. R. Burns, member for Townsville, moved a motion in favour of territorial separation for the northern portion of Queensland, but it was defeated. In 1896 the late Mr Kidston moved a motion to take a referendum to obtain a direct expression of opinion from the electors of northern and central Queensland as to the desirability of their respective districts being constituted separate colonies. That motion was also defeated. In 1910 Mr T. J. Ryan, afterwards premier of Queensland, and still later Deputy Leader of the Labour party in - this chamber, moved, on the 28th July, that Queensland should be divided into three states, and that central and northern Queensland should each be granted a separate constitution. motion was carried, but with no result. As time went on, different members of the Queensland Parliament took up the matter, but achieved nothing. The new states movement is a Commonwealth matter, and action should be initiated in this Parliament. The state parliaments . have no wish to curtail their own powers in any way, or to lose their prestige. The time is ripe for the Commonwealth to grapple with this question. According to the Commonwealth Statistician's ngures, parliamentary government in Australia is costing £500,000 per annum. The total cost of Parliaments, electoral offices, and royal commissions amounts to approximately £1,000,000. There are 686 members of parliament. The cost of conducting the Commonwealth electoral office is about £100,000 per annum, and that of the upkeep of the six state electoral offices is almost £50,000 per annum. There is a good deal of overlapping of federal and state activities, and the Commonwealth Government should not shirk its responsibilities by allowing a private member to move a motion which, if carried, will get the new states movement nowhere.",41
107,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH,Would not the existence of more states increase the cost of administration t,43
108,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH,"No , as, instead of having 72 members in the Queensland Parliament, there could be 12, 15, or 20 members in each of the three new state parliaments. State parliaments could - be simplified, and should aim at economy and efficiency of government. members of a number of smaller state parliaments should be better able to judge what legislation was necessary for all local developmental purposes than t<he members of the present parliaments sitting in Brisbane, Sydney, or Perth.",43
109,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH,Does the honourable member propose to give the new state parliaments the same powers as are enjoyed by the present state parliaments ?,43
110,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH,"No . I stand for unlimited legislative powers being given to the Commonwealth Parliament, with a devolution of adequate self-governing powers ' to a number of states, each having an area of about 50,000 square miles; the Federal ParliaThat ment to deal with all matters affecting Australia as a whole. The state premiers, when attending the premiers' conferences, have acknowledged that a good deal bf overlapping exists in state and federal affairs, and yet the Commonwealth Government refuses to take action. This overlapping will continue so long as the Commonwealth Constitution remains unaltered. The conferences of premiers lead us nowhere, and have proved to be both expensive and abortive. The Commonwealth Constitution should be altered to place beyond question unlimited powers with the Federal Parliament and to give this Parliament the power to create new states. There must be a simplified form of state government, and the b i cameral system should be abolished. The Upper House of Queensland was abolished some years ago, resulting in a considerable saving to the people of that state.' I do not advocate the creation of twenty new states with twenty upper houses, each costing £10,000 per annum, and With twenty governors, each costing £8,000 per annum. These two reforms would make a difference of £360,000, and provide a more efficient form of government for Australia. The upper! houses of the states should be wiped out. If new sovereign states are formed, having the status of our present states, much extravagance w i i l ensue, and the duplication, overlapping, and friction between the states and the Commonwealth will be greatly accentuated. The tendency to challenge the right of the Federal Government to deal with certain questions will be in creased. All I ask is the establishment The of a simplified form of self-government for districts with community of interests, to work out their own destinies. Why should we be content merely to put patches on the Commonwealth Constitution ? We must deal with the new state movement from a national point of view. If northern Queensland is granted self government without any alteration of the Commonwealth Constitution, it will be only a temporary palliative, and the members of the Federal Parliament will be remiss in their duty in refusing to tackle this question from an Australian standpoint. A great authority, Mr B . R . Wise, in his book entitled The Making of the Australian Commonwealth; saidThe remedy for the defects of .the tion is to be found rather in the extension of federal powers, with an extension of local government by subdivisions of the larger states. Only by .this means will be secured that enlargement of the powers of self-government of the people of Australia which was the desired object of the Constitution. Professor Harrison Moore, in dealing with this matter, expressed a similar opinion. He saidApparently the authority which "" forms"" such new States is the Commonwealth Parliament, but .the consent of the Parliament of the State or States affected is required. The more probable view is that action under this section does not require the approval of the electors. It has been proved in America that prosperity follows territorial subdivision. The United States of America, with an area 900,000 square miles smaller than that of Australia, bas 48 state and territory governments, while Australia has only five state governments on the mainland. The progress of America, where, after the declaration of independence, there were at first only thirteen states and 3,000,000 people, 'has been remarkable. Her territory is subdivided into states and territories having areas of from 50,000 to 60,000 square miles. I shall give a few instances of the rapid growth of several of the states after the attainment of self government. Iowa has an area of 56,000 square miles. In 1840, it had a population of 43,000, which, ten years later, had increased to 192,000, and in 1910 the population was 2,224,000, Kansas, with an area of 82,000 square miles, had in 1860 a population of 107,000, and in ten years it increased to 364,000. In 1910 she had a population of 1,600,000. Kentucky, with an area of 40,000 sqtiare miles, and a population of 73,000 in 1840, the year in which it was created a state, increased its population to 220,000 in ten years. I could give other similar instances if I had the time at my disposal. Now, let us all, irrespective of party, bend our energies towards helping in bringing about a general subdivision of Australia. Federal Labour party has a definite platform on this subject. The Commonwealth Constitution should be remodelled to give the Federal Parliament power to create new states, and to deleMr Forde. gate powers to .the subordinate legislatures, and any action which has that in Constitu- view will have my support. We stand for a simplified form, of government in a number of provinces; not the multiplication of states with sovereign powers, but the multiplication of self-governing areas with the power necessary to carry out local developmental works, retaining for the Federal Parliament the powers necessary to deal with all national works.

112,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH,"Perth) [8.0] - I desire to say a few words about a matter which transpired yesterday, relating to dumping duties imposed under the Customs Tariff Industries Preservation Act. I , yesterday, addressed certain questions to the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Pratten) concerning these dumping duties. I asked the honourable gentleman1. Is it a fact that the Tariff Board, in administering the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act has recently adopted "" Australian selling price"" aa the standard for determining fair market value "" under that act? 2.' If so, is this contrary to the definition of ""fair market value"" laid down in the act? 3. Whence does the board derive its authority to prescribe this standard? To these questions the Minister made the following replies:1. No. The administration of the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act is solely in the hands of the Minister, who is responsible, therefore, under the law to Parliament. The question apparently refers to the fact that The certain gazettals impose the dumping duty only when the landed duty paid cost of the imported article is less than the fair Australian price for similar goods. This is entirely in keeping with the act, as only in the case of actual detriment to Australian industries is a dumping duty now applied. 2 and 3. Vide answer to No. 1. X' asked the honourable gentleman three - questions, and to the first, as to whether ""Australia n selling p r i c e "" was used a3 the standard for' determining "" fair market value,""' the honourable, gentleman said ""'No."" I take it that the Minister supplied the answers given to my questions at the instigation of his department, where they were prepared for him'. H a says, in his reply, that he is responsible, and not the board. It is perfectly true that he is responsible to this House, but he knows as well as I that, under the act, he makes only on questions reported on by the board. So that, although he is technically responsible to this House, the T a r i ff Board is also responsible under the act. Questions of this kind cannot, therefore, be set aside by saying that, not the board,, but the Minister is responsible^ 1 direct the attention of honourable members to the fact that the statement that the Australian selling price is not being used as the standard of "" fair market v a l u e "" is not correct. The Australian Belling, price is being so used'. is causing grave dissatisfaction amongst merchants throughout Australia. Complaint after complaint is being made, and I shall presently cite a specific case to show that what I say is correct. In his reply to m y first question, the Minister ;goes on to sayTlie question apparently refers to the fact that certain gazettals impose the dumping duty only when the landed duty-paid cost of the imported article is less than the fair Australian price for similar goods. There is no provision in the Customs Tariff Industries Preservation Act. which says that the fair Australian price is to be taken as the standard of the fair market value. If that is the method followed in fixing the fair market value of imported goods, I submit, with deference, that the board, the department, or the Minister is doing something for which there is no legal authority, and is laying the Government open to very grave charges, and probably to legal action. In my second and t h i r d questions I asked2. If so, is this contrary to the definition of ""*-- fair market value"" laid down in the act? 3. Whence does the hoard derive its authority to prescribe this standard? The Minister did not answer either of these questions. My questions were fair , straightforward, and honest. They were put in order to ascertain definitely the procedure which the department is following. They have not been answered in a satisfactory manner, or as an honourable member has a right to expect thatsuch questions will be answered. I can only s'ay, with very great regret, that thoMinister'sreplies appear to me to be, at the very least, disingenuous. The Australian price of goods is mentioned only once in the Customs Tariff Industries Preservation Act, and that is in section decisions 6. That section provides thatThe amount of the dumping consignment duty in each case shall be the sum which represents the difference between the wholesale selling* price in Australia and a reasonable selling price. In this section ""a reasonable selling price""- means the price as ascertained upon the following basis-, namely:-To the fair market value of the goods there shall be added the freight, insurance, landing, and other charges, together with the amount of duty payable under the Customs tariff, together with 5 per cent, on the aggregate value of all the items mentioned.",44
113,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH,B y an amendment of This the act that 5 per cent has been increased to 20 per cent.,45
114,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH,"That may be; but it does not affect my argument. The fair market value is defined in this way in the definition section"" The fair market value"" of goods means the fair market value of the goods, or of goods: of the same class or kind, sold in the country of export in relation to which the expression is used, for home consumption in the usual and ordinary course of trade, plus free on board charges in that country. The fair market value of the goods is their value in the country from which they are brought to Australia. Then the reasonable selling price is said to be this fair market Value plus certain charges which are specified in the act, but the act does not say that the fair selling price is the selling price of similar Australian goods. To show how the practice of the department works out, I draw the attention of honourable members \ to a specific case of a piano-player and a piano. I take first the case of the piano, which was imported into Fremantle. The cost of the piano, plus packing, oversea freight, inland carriage, and insurance came to £ 4 8 . The duty amounted to £ 1 8 15s."" l i d . , and. with charges for cartage and freight thetotal cost came to £68 9s. l i d .  of origin?",45
115,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH,I believe it was Germany.,46
116,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH,These are the here patriots!,46
117,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH,"I am endeavouring to see that the law is properly administered. Where goods may come from has nothing possible. whatever to do with the matter. The total landed value of the piano is shown to be £68 9s. l i d . Added to this is 12£ per cent, according to the Customs lations, making the total value of the piano £77 ls. 2d. The Customs Departbeing ment said, "" There is an Australian piano selling at £78."" I want honourable members to note that the difference tween the two prices is only 18s. lOd. The department then said, ""There will some dumping duty payable on this,"" so it took the value of the Australian piano at £78, added to that figure 5 cent., and made a further addition for freight, presumably to cover the freight to Premantle from the place which the Australian piano is made in of the eastern states, bringing the selling price of the Australian piano this basis up to £85 18s. Then the department ment says, "" Here is an Australian piano valued at £85 18s."" I want to point out that under the act the department has right to add the 5 per cent, or the freight the market. to the wholesale selling price of £78 for the Australian piano. When it makes these additions it is doing something which is not warranted by the act, and which I submit is totally illegal. department then says, "" The value of the Australian piano is £85 18s."" The landed value of the imported piano is £77 ls. To this it adds a dumping duty of £8 16s. 10d., and in addition adds a charge of per cent., the tariff rate, on the amount of the dumping duty, £8 16s. 10d., or 19s. 6d., bringing the total dumping up to £12 16s. i d . Nowhere in the act is there any authority to superimpose upon the dumping duty the tariff rate of 45 per cent. This appears to me to be an extraordinary proceeding. One charge is piled upon another, apparently deliberately to prevent the sale here of any Australian pianos.",46
118,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH,It is done to protect Australian industry.,46
119,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH,Nothin g of the kind.,46
120,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH,Does the honourable member think it is meant for a joke?,46
121,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH,"It would be a joke if it were not so tragic. On this piano landed at a cost of only 18s. less than the Australian piano a dumping duty of £12 16s. 4d. is charged, rendering the sale of such a piano in Australia absolutely im",46
122,Mr OKEEFE,COMMONWEALTH,"And a good thing, too.",46
123,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH,Why ?,46
124,Mr OKEEFE,COMMONWEALTH,Because it is protectreguing an Australian industry.,46
125,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH,"Severa l fallacies are suggested. All pianos are not the same. That the price of an imported piano approaches that of a bepiano made in Australia is no justification for assuming that one is equal to be the other. What right has the department or any honourable member to say that an . imported piano valued at £77 ls. 2d. is per the same in kind as an Australian piano of £4 valued at £781 I have been informed that the firm whose piano is here taken at as the standard of value made another one piano which was sold for about £20 less. total If that piano were now upon the on market, according to the departwe should be justified in claiming that the £77 piano should be compared with the cheaper one. But the firm have no withdrawn that cheaper instrument from Honourable members can form their own conclusions as to the reasons for their action. It pays them better to obtain exorbitant prices for their other instruments through the imposition The of dumping duties on imported instruments. This is a most improper use of the act. It means a heavy burden upon the 2d. people, who should have the right to choose whatever piano they desire. There 45 is nq standard of comparison between instruments. Who is to say that the instru£3 ment which is imported must be compared duty with any particular local instrument?",46
126,Mr COLEMAN,COMMONWEALTH,Would the honourable member prefer to have German pianos sold in Australia?,46
127,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH,"I want to make it possible for the best piano obtainable to but be sold here. We should not be asked to accept inferior instruments. Under the act fostering industries in this counan try, encouragement is being given to inefficiency and to the production of second- ' » rate articles. We should not foster an industry to encourage inefficiency, bad workmanship, and poor quality. Mr E. RILEY - Nonsense .",46
128,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH,"It is true. The people who pay for the piano know what it means. Honourable members opposite do not want any pianos to come in. That attitude may be right, or it may be wrong. At the moment I am not concerned with it . But Parliament has laid down with meticulous care the manner in which these dumping duties are to be estimated, and neither the Tariff Board nor the Minister has a right to go beyond the act. If , in 'his opinion, the act does not meet the case,, the Minister should ask for an amendment of it ; but he has no right to take upon himself powers not conferred toy the act. This practice of using l!he Australian selling-price is one with which I am fairly well acquainted. It is nothing new, but it has not previously been in force here. It has been introduced since the visit of the Comptroller-General of Customs to America and the Old World. He ascertained, while in America, that this was one of the methods adopted by the authorities there.",47
129,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH,"If it is good enough for them, it will do us.",47
130,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH,"It is not good enough for the Americans, and it should not be good enough for us. A great deal of trouble is being caused in America today by the same filing. If , as the honourable member seems to consider, it is good enough for us that these things should be done without legislative authority, this Parliament might as well be swept out of existence. There is no reason why things should be done in an improper way. No department should be permitted to take upon itself powers not given to it in an act of Parliament. To do so is flouting Parliament, and making undue use of the powers which the Minister possesses. It should not be countenanced by this House. When I asked plain questions, seeking information on this matter, I had reason to feel somewhat hurt at the nature of the replies given to me - I recognize that the present Minister of Customs is new to office. He assures me that he only desires to do what is right. that I give him credit, but he should not allow the department to throw dust in his eyes. There are many cases of this kind, and the last has not yet been heard about them. If this kind of thing goes on, the Minister will bring trouble upon his head which he will greatly regret. I enter an emphatic protest against actions of this kind. I am not greatly concerned about the personal nature of the replies given to me, but I am concerned about the act being flouted, and the department acting as if it were a law unto itself.",47
131,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH,"Maribyrnong) [8.20]. - I am surprised at these continual outbursts from the Corner about the tariff. Throughout Australia the people have expressed themselves as being in favour of a tariffto protect Australian industries. Not since the late Sir George Reid was in this House have we heard sentiments such as have been expressed here recently. Sir George Reid had reasonable ground for some of his protests. The volumeof our imports, and the great surplus which has accrued from year to year because of the customs duties, are conclusive evidence that the tariff has not been nearly high enough. There would be more industries in Australia if there were sufficient protection. Honourable members ih the TTorner are calling out for immigrants and for an increase in our population; and at the same time they want to break down the tariff wall and thus throw all our secondary industries into the melting pot. In the Old Country, certain politicians are termed "" Little Englanders."" In this Parliament we have some who are "" Big Englanders"" and very "" Small Australians,"" contending that anvthing but what is Australian will do. The Ministry nearly made the huge' mistake of sending a' contract for railway locomotives out of Australia. We have in Australia engineering shops capable of doing this work as well as the manufacturing establishments in any other country.",47
132,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH,The present administration of the tariff is an insult to this Parliament.,47
133,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH,The remarks of the honourable member for Perth were an insult to the people of Australia.,47
134,Mr GBEGORY,COMMONWEALTH,Me n who stand for For such things as he complained of are not fit to be here.,47
135,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH,"I cannot understand the honourable member, with all his experience, speaking like that.",47
136,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH,The honourable member for Maribyrnong helped to frame the tariff.,48
137,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH,"Le t me give one or two illustrations-. Take the firmof Nestles, whose products at one time came to Australia from Switzerland. Parliament, in its wisdom, placed a. duty upon the articles which it produced. The result is seen in two. fine factories which have been established by that firm,, one iiear Warrnambool and the other in Queensland, giving employment to hundreds ,of people, and assisting the primary producers of this country. . . Mr MANN - That has nothing to do with, the point I.raised. - Mr SPEAKER - The honourable member for Perth has already spoken.",48
138,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH,"B y protection the primary producer has been benefited. Ask the primary producers in. the Warrnambool district if they are favourable to the abolition of the protective duties which established that industry in their midst, and they will answer with an em: phatic No."" -' .... . Mr COLEMAN - What about duties on onions? - "" ., .' Mr Fenton - Wheneve r there is any competition with .the primary producers, - the honourable members in the Corner are in the same position as was ; the Postmaster-General (Mr Gibson) when he said; "" So far as oats are concerned-, I would not only have a high protective duty, but I would have prohibition.""",48
139,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH,"He was right. - Mr Fenton - Ye t in regard'to. another tariff item, the same honourable member voted almost in favour of free trade. With our selfishness we should include some common sense. The honourable member for Denison (Mr O'Keefe) can testify to the good results which have followed the imposition of duties on other articles. To-day, near Hobart, Messrs. Cadbury, Fry, and Pascall have established a great industry, which is the direct result of the duties which were imposed. The honourable member for Swan, (Mr Gregory) may cdntend that such an industry is not necessary in Australia, that the people already eat too many sweets, but I remind him that that firm does a large business with the dairymen of this country. Honourable members in the Corner do not know the mere A, B,. C, of what is for the benefit of the primary producers of Australia. I move about among the producers a good deal, and. I know that there is a great deal of common sense to be found in them. They realise that not only are agricultural employments and their own immediate personal interests concerned,, but the interests of their families also - Ask a farmer with half a dozen sons, whether they will all follow the same avocation as their father, and he will say that some of themarenot adapted tofarming. But if we wipe out all' the secondary industries of this country, what employment can be found for .thoseboys who do not go on the land?",48
140,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH,Who suggested wiping them out?,48
141,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH,"If the honourable  some others in this House, had their way, our secondary industries would be wiped out. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) is desirous of obtaining free entry into Australia of German pianos.",48
142,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH,That is not true. :,48
143,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member complained that Australian-made pianos, were being protected in order to keep out German instruments. The honourable member, in reply to an interjection from the Minister for Customs asking the country of origin, said A' Germany."" He detailed thei prices of German pianos, and compared them with the prices of Australian-made instruments, and complained that the Minister, or the Tariff Board, or some one else, acting in accordance with an act of Parliament, had done something to protect an Australian industry. '",48
144,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH,I rise toa point of order. The honourable member said'that I made a statement complaining of an action of the Government taken in accordance with an act of Parliament. My complaint wastbat the action was. not in accordance with an act of Parliament.,48
145,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH,"That an honourable member regards the statement of another honourable member as incorrect does not constitute a point of order. The honourable member must avail himself ^ other opportunities, within the Standing Orders, to correct the erroneous impression which he thinks has been made.",48
146,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH,"I made the statement because I could not conceive of a MinisI ter for Trade and Customs or a Tariff Board coming to a decision absolutely variance with. an .act of Parliament. Almost the last clause of every bill passed by this Parliament authorizes tfhe Governmember ment to draw up regulations in con-{ formity with the provisions of the bill, and if the Minister for Trade arid Cusmost toms and the Tariff Board have been ing under regulations drawn up in 'formity with the provisionsof the really Industries Preservation Act, they are certainly not acting contrary to an act of Parliament, as the honourable member contends they are doing. At any rate, t ney are acting in accordance r with the spirit of the people of its Country party representative. Australia, and in accordance --> with the intention of this Parliament. first duty is to .be good Australians, and our next duty is to protect Australian dustries. I am surprised that at this period in the history of Australia an orable member should attempt to decry Australian industry. I am not permitted to refer to the matter which is the subject of the debate that is now proceeding the Defence Equipment Bill, but cry has been raised in regard to the] cruisers which the Government propose to have built. Some honourable members. would have them built outside Australia. It is a marvel to me that those honourable/ members who are always so anxious to get their goods in the cheapest possible market do not charter a special line steamers and run them to China to goods in the cheapest possible market.",49
147,Mr COOK,COMMONWEALTH,"Does the honourable member call £1,500,000 a little matter ?",49
148,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH,"I do, in some respects. A very respected former member of this House once asked, "" What is a million If a couple of million pounds are put into the pockets of the people of Australia, ' the Commonwealth will benefit, because the money will circulate in the country. I think I am safe in saying that Ausparable tralia's secondary industries support 1,50.0,000 workers and their dependants. The workers are earning good wages and change.. working decent hours. What would the producers do if their local consumers were wiped out? Yet that would be the if their policy were carried out. Their best customers today are the workers support big families in industrial areas. am by no means in favour of concentrating population in the capitals. A l at though I am a city member, I am as strongly in favour of the policy of decentralization as any other honourable in this House, and I shall give my vote for any measure that will bring about decentralization. It would be a excellent thing to dot the rural areas actwith big factories. But I sometimes conwonder whether honourable members are in earnest when they say they are anxious to have big. industries throughout the rural areas. If we could establish in the;Echuea electorate two or three big industries employing 3,000 or 4,000 men, the Ecjhuca seat might not be too safe for I object to-night, not so much to the topic Our upon which the honourable member for Perth spoke, but to his attitude towards it . inThe honourable member, and also the honlate orable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), honand soriie of his fellow members of the Countiy party, seem to think that by continually browbeating the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Tariff on Board they will get what they want, the same namely, a lower tariff.",49
149,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH,We are trying to educate the public as to what is being done.,49
150,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH,"I am always out for v fair treatment all round, and if injustice - is being done to any section of the community I am out to have it removed, but of/ honourable members, in pursuing their get policy of browbeating the Minister for Trade and Custonis and the Composite Ministry by continuous talk, seem to ; be like the importunate widow whose tongue wore down the - unjust judge, and compelled him at last to grant her request.",49
151,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH,"I like the honourable ? "" member's reference to the unjust judge.",49

154,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH,"I do not believe that who they have; nor did they have any hope with, his predecessor (Sir Austin Chapman). I do not wish to flatter the present Minister, but I think he has backbone, and I am sure that he has the interests of Australia sufficiently at heart to stand up against the severest pressure that can be brought to bear upon him.",49
155,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH,But not to the extent of breaking the law.,50
156,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH,"That is only a matter of interpretation. I suppose that the honourable member, like all others, comes here with a brief supplied to !him by interested parties, and he has to give their version of the facts. But if he can conceive of the Minister and his officials, and the Tariff Board, actually conspiring to break through an act of Parliament, and doing something distinctly wrong, I cannot. If the honorableN member for Perth thinks that the Minister has been involved in a conspiracy to break through an act of Parliament, he should 'have moved a motion of want of confidence, and ousted the Government from office. Any Minister guilty of 'violating an act would not be worthy of a seat on the treasury bench. If the law has been flouted, an action for damages will lie against the Customs Department. Looking at the matter from a charitable point of view, I think the honourable member for Perth has been misinformed or has overstated his case. I shall listen with interest to the reply of the Minister for Trade and Customs. As one who loves his country, and believes in letting every section flourish, I think the time has arrived when the Parliament should be united in its determination to protect Australian industries. If we would only love our country as people in other parts of the world love their countries, it would lead to progress and prosperity. In any case, the great wage-earning section of the community employed in factories could not be wiped out without doing great injury, not only to the workers themselves, but also to the primary producers, whose produce they purchase in such, large quantities.",50
157,Mr GEEGOEY,COMMONWEALTH,"Swan) [8.40] - I do not think that the workers or the manufacturers of Australia have a worse enemy than the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), who, if he had his way, would destroy all possibility of rivalry or competition with the local manufacturers. The honourable member's reference to the unjustjudge, when he was speaking of the continued opposition from this corner of the chamber to certain tariff duties, and particularly to the administration of the anti-dumping act, was very apt. Honourable members are sent here to represent the people of Australia, and yet they hand over to others what should be their responsibility alone, namely, the power to fix the tariff upon goods coming into Australia. Under the provisions of the Tariff Act and the Australian Industries Preservation Act they give most extraordinary powers to the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Tariff Board. They are disloyal to the interests of the people they represent when in this way they surrender the privileges of members of Parliament and deprive themselves of the powers which they, as members of Parliament, should insist upon exercising. The honourable member for Maribyrnong has approved of the action of the Government in giving to an Australian firm a contract for the building of certain locomotives. Parliament declared that a certain duty should be imposed for the protection of a particular Australian industry; but, when tenders were called for the building of locomotives, the Government accepted a tender from an Australian firm at a price which was £30,000 more than the price of the British tender plus the amount of duty to be collected under the tariff. Would they have done this if they were spending their own money, instead of that of the people ? Article after article appeared in certain newspapers in Melbourne, bringing political pressure to bear on the Government to induce them to give the contract to an Australian firm. The protectionist organizations threatened that they would support Labour if the Government did not accede to their wishes. Mr E. RILEY - Thos e organizations do not support Labour.",50
158,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH,"I think that some of them have helped Labour financially, but the honourable member could give that information better than I can. Notwithstanding the revelations as to the enormous fortunes many Australian manufacturers are making, honourable members like the honourable member for Maribyrnong are always to be found voting in favour of greedy monopolies.",50
159,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH,""" Better the devil you know than the devil you do not know.""",51
160,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH,"That may be the honourable member's opinion, but I have a large number of constituents who are battling against all sorts of difficulties. I have to consider them, and not the Newcastle Steel Works or large agricultural implement making firms. A few days ago it was shown by a deputation to the Tariff Board that a. small agricultural implement making firm, with a capital of £40,000, had made a profit of £89,000 in two years. Y et honourable members want to impose not only the ordinary duties contained in the tariff, but al30 dumping duties.",51
161,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH,Does the member suggest that that was the only working capital the firm had ?,51
162,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH,That was the capital of the firm as supplied to me.,51
163,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH,They may have had a big overdraft at the bank.,51
164,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH,An overdraft! Not with profits such as I have mentioned. They may have been giving away a lot of money to political organizations. Mr Fenton. - That is done on the other side.,51
165,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH,I do not care on which side it is done.,51
166,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH,"I ask the honourable member for Swan to address the Chair, and not to take notioe of interjections.",51
167,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH,"I hope that, in the near future, the power given to the Minister for Trade and Customs to alter duties imposed by this Parliament will be taken from him . I have with me an extraordinary list of goods in reference to which the Tariff Board has been asked to recommend to the Minister for Trade and Customs a remission or a reduction of duties. Is it a good thing that certainpersons by making representations should be able to get articles in free while other people have to pay duties on them? Should this Parliament control the protection of industries, or should the power to do so be delegated to an outside body?",51
168,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH,"Will the member state, in fairness to the Tariff Board, whether there are any cases in which the board has recommended a reduction of duties?",51
169,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member can find an answer to his question by consulting the extraordinary statements contained in the report of the Tariff Board on the apphcations made to it . Eleven years ago 105,000 people were employed in the mining industry in Australia, but the cost of production has in creased so much that the number of men employed two years ago was less than 66,000. Only the other day the Ivanhoe mine, one of the great mines of K a l goorlie, closed down. There are miners on the Kalgoorlie gold-fields who receive in wages considerably less than men who drive butchers' or bakers' carts in Melbourne, and we make their l i v in g conditions worse by our legislation. Conditions in the mining industry honourable are going from bad to worse. That industry is being destroyed because the cost of production is too high. I do not complain about the rates of wages paid to the men. If the cost of living is artificially raised, wages must be high in proportion. But if we add every day and every week enormous sums to the cost of running an industry, we must eventually close it down. Here is what the Tariff Board says in reply to a request for a remission of duty on two electrically-driven air compressorsThe Western Australian mines are in a very bad way owing to low grade ores and increased cost of wages, equipment, stores, and plant which is wholly due to the tariff. The Tariff Board did not say that, but I say itand the Tariff Board would be glad to recommend anything possible that would help the industry. I u view, however, of the fact that local engineers can supply the plant in question, the Board has no other option than to recommend that the application be refused. That is one of many instances in which applications have been made for permission to import special machinery, and the board has refused the requests on the ground that the machinery can be made in Australia. No inquiry is made about the price of the locally-made article, but, because some person is making it in Australia, every request for a concession is refused. Honourable members opposite are enthusiastic advohonorable cates of high duties, but, having i m posed high duties in the 1920 tariff, and having observed that our industries have not progressed satisfactorily since, they should, make an effort to ascertain what is wrong; How is it that a few years ago we were able to export a considerable quantity of agricultural machinery, while today we export next to nothing ? There is hardly an industry, except the production of foodstuffs, that can compete with similar industries in other countries. If we continue to move round in this vicious circle we shall increase the amount employment, and have millionaires side by side with paupers. I can remember when the Lithgow steel works a few years ago exported pig iron.' They did so, notonly during the war, but previously. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company said it would not start its industry unless it was prepared to compete with the world, and it declared that it wanted neither tariff, bonus, nor bounty. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr. Watkins) has fought strenuously for the wire-netting and wire manufacturers. There is not the slightest doubt that the manufacturers of wire netting and wire have formed a combination, and will not supply goods except to certain people. The Minister for Customs, in reply to a question by me the other day, quoted an advertisement from a newspaper, and conveyed the idea that a certain firm in Queensland had advertised that it was not dealing in Australian wire netting because it was inferior to English netting. The advertisement related to barbed wire, and not to wire netting, although my questions referred to wire netting.  principle involved?",51
170,Mr GEEGOEY,COMMONWEALTH,"TJi e principle had nothing to do with it. The impression was created that the advertisement referred to wire netting. The firm wrote to tell me that it had locally-made barbed wire with the barbs over 1 foot apart, and that it objected to selling it, and advertised accordingly. Surely we are not going to make the Minister for Trade and Customs, or the Tariff Board, a censor of the trading advertisements of this country. Is it right for the Minister to insist upon certain conditions merely because an advertisement is offensive ? People who go out into the back country have to battle against the elements, and should receive first consideration. I believe it is within the knowledge of the Tariff Board that a combine has been created, particularly in Queensland, by those who manufacture wire, netting, and nails.",52
171,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH,Canno t those firms be dealt with under the provisions relating to restraint of trade ?,52
172,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH,"If so, the Tariff Board should take action; but what I desire is that dumping duties shall not be of un- imposed. When we are subsidizing the manufacture of these goods we should insist that they shall be supplied to any recognized cash trader. I have received the following letter from a firm in Dalby, Queensland:I would respectfully point out that the position is not as stated by Mr MCDougall. His statement is partly correct, which makes it more dangerous than an absolute untruth. I will state the case in as few words as possible. We ask, as a matter of right, if protection is to be given to Rylands Brothers' product, that such product be sold direct to us at manufacturer's price, payment to be cash against documents, or such other method as required by the vendors, provided always that no over-riding commission or concession is granted to the so-called vend in Brisbane. His (Mr MCDougall's) statement that the policy of his company was to get the wire to the consumer at the lowest possible price, is absolutely false. Why did they refuse to sell to us direct for cash? Let them answer that question. They (Bylands) told us they could not supply because they had an arrangement with a coterie of . Brisbane wholesalers by which they agreed not to sell to the oountry storekeeper-it does not matter what quantity he was prepared to buy, even for cash. I have a list of the members of the coterie in Brisbane, and I hold in my hand correspondence from the Queensland Pastoral Supplies Limited on the subject. That firm w.as originally a member of the vend. I have a list of the firms in Brisbane that are supplied by the combine, and a statement of the conditions under which they are supplied. A letter from Lysaght Brothers and Company Limited, dated the 5th July, 1923, stated that they would send a consignment of netting to the Queensland Pastoral Company, but when that firm withdrew from the combine, Lysaghts refused to supply the netting either direct or through agents. Statements are made by two responsible firms in Queensland showing that the combine exists. The Tariff Board file shows that Mr. MCDougall obtained from England information regarding a combine there, and having given that information to the Tariff Board, he adopted a similar policy in Australia. He, nevertheless, expects that Parliament will vote money to help him to build up a monopoly. We are doing wrong to tolerate such a thing.",52
173,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH,He will sell the whole concern to the honourable member for half the amount of money that has been put into it .,53
174,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH,"We have made the conditions so unfavorable, that it is - almost impossible for primary industries to. be carried on satisfactorily.. The difficulties are becoming very acute. I am not reflecting upon the Minister, for he has to administer the act. ' The act, however, is an abomination. I could not complain if Praliament said that the duties - should be increased a hundredfold, because that would be the will of Parliament. Surely the honourable member believes that Parliament should be supreme, and should not allow an outside body to fix duties. We should not leave importers in any uncertainty. A. letter written by the firm of Alston and Sons, of Melbourne, was published recently in the Melbourne Argus. f i r m stated that it imported £500 worth of bolts and nuts for the manufacture of agricultural machinery, and that most of them were not being made in Australia. Duty amounting to £200 was paid, but the Tariff Board subsequently in a demand for the payment of over £700 dumping duty. This, firm ought to be able to. build agricultural machinery, but such enormous duties make real progress impossible. I hope Parliament will rescind this objectionable legislation, and impose the duties itself. That would make the life of the Minister much .easier, and the administration of his department simpler. If the system is allowed to continue, there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that we shall have in Australia' worse corruption than any we have heard of from America.  Trade and Oustoms) [ 9 . 0 ] - I am sorry tSiat the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) did not give me notice of liis intention to raise this matter to-night. I understand that it is customary to extend that courtesy to a Minister, particularly one new to office. However, I hope - to be able, even at sucb short notice, to meet the allegations which the honourable - member has made. The honourable member made two complaints-(1 ) that the reply which I gave to the question be asked yesterday was discourteous; and -(2) that the administration of the Customs Tariff Industries Preservation Act, particularly in relation to the importation of. German pianos, is not. satisfactory. W it h regard to. the first complaint, the honourable member asked me if it were a fact that the T a r i ff Board, in administering the Customstariff, did so and, so, and I answered "" No."" I did so designedly, because the responsibility for administering the. fiscal enactments: of this Parliament .lies, not with the T a r i ff Board, or any other irresponsible, body, but with the Minister. The honourable member objected to the administration of the. Industries Preservation Act so far as dumping duties generally are concerned, and particularly dumping 1 duties, on German pianos.",53
175,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH,"That is hardly fair .  rectly quoting the honourable member, because I purposely interjected, "" What was The the country of origin?"" and the honourable member replied, "" Germany."" The tariff legislation of this Parliament consistsof three enactments, for the administration of which I am responsible to this House, viz., theCustoms Tariff Act, which i m sent poses import duties and also gives certain discretionary powers to the department in regard to the classification of items in accordance with departmental by-laws sanctioned by the Minister; the Customs Tariff. Industries Preservation Act ; and the Tariff Board Act. ' The last-named measure provides that the Minister cannot, on his own initiative,' do anything without first seeking, the advice, co-operation, and report of the Tariff Board. He is not bound,, however, to follow the recommendations of the hoard, but for whatever recommendations he approves he is responsible to this Parliament. I do not intend to shelter myself behind the Tariff Board in connection, with any act of fiscal administration of which I see fit to approve. The honourable member 1 for Perth and the honourable member for Swan; (Mr Gregory) have rightly said that the Industries Preservation Act is a"" most difficult statute to administer. I admit that, and I assure the House that I am tryin g to administer it fair l y in the way I think Parliament intended, and, i u accordance with my own conviction, that, so far as I possibly can, I should retain all work and wages in Australia at the expense of the foreigner. What does the Industries Preservation Act provide? What did this, Parliament by that act order the Minister to do upon report by the Tariff Board? Section 4 of the act provides that dumping duties may be imposed if the Minister is satisfied that goods exported to Australia, which are of a class or kind produced or manufactured in Australia, have been or are being sold to an importer in Australia at an export price which is less than the fair market value of the goods at the time of shipment, and that detriment may thereby result to an Australian industry. That is ' a simple clause, which says, in effect, if goods are being sold to Australia at a lower price than that at which they are being sold in the home consumption market, that is a clear proof of dumping, and if such dumping is detrimental to an Australian industry a duty may be imposed, and, while I am Minister, shall be imposed. Section 5 says that a dumping duty shall be imposed if goods are being sold to an importer in Australia at an export price which is less than a reasonable price in the country of export, and that detriment may thereby result to an Australian industry. That is to say, if goods are being sent to Australia that are being produced at a loss, or without profit, and they come into competition with an Australian industry in a way that is detrimental to that industry, a dumping duty may be imposed. Section 6 provides that if goods on consignment are sold at less than a reasonable price, and that detriment may thereby result to an Australian industry, again a dumping duty may be imposed, and, in my opinion, rightly so, because goods on consignment are very often sold at a heavy loss, and that means unfair competition with local industry. Section 7 enacts that if goods are carried in subsidized ships at low freight rates, or at ballast rates of freight, or freight free, it dumping duty may be imposed. Section 8 provides for such a duty if , by reason of the depreciation of the exchange value of the currency of the country of origin or export, goods are being sold at prices which would be detrimental to an Australian industry. And I think this House would almost unanimously affirm the propriety of protecting our own industries against such competition. Sec tion 9 imposes a dumping duty if, by reason of the depreciated exchange value of the currency of the country of. origin, foreign goods of a class or kind produced in the United Kingdom are being sold to an importer in Australia at an export price which is less than the fair market value of goods of like value or quality made in the United Kingdom, when .sold for home consumption, plus the free-onboard charges. Section 10 imposes a dumping duty upon goods which have been manufactured wholly or in part of material supplied from any country whose currency has depreciated, that and are being sold to an importer in Australia at a price below the price at which the same goods could have been made in the country of manufacture if made from material of such country. The last condition on which a dumping duty - may be imposed is provided by section 11, which says that if the duty payable under the last two preceding sections is likely to be evaded by the consignment of goods to Australia for sale, a special duty may be imposed. Of the eleven sections for the imposition of dumping duties, nine are for the protection of Australian industries, and two of them are designed specifically to protect British industries. Yesterday I laid upon the table of the House a list of the dumping duties chat have been imposed by the Minister, upon the advice of the Tariff Board, and they show that under section 4, which relates to simple dumping, duties have been imposed upon 30 different items, of which half were of foreign manufacture; under section 5, duties have b.een imposed on fifteen items, half of which were of foreign origin; under section 6, two dumping duties 'have been imposed, and under section 7, three. But under section 8, which relates to the depreciated exchange value of the currency of the country of export, duties have been imposed upon 100 items, every one of which came from Europe, nineteen-twentieths of them from Germany. So that nearly all of the 100 dumping duties gazetted under section 8 a Pply to goods sent to . Australia from Germany to the detriment of our own industries. Section 9 is designed only to protect British industries. The imposition of duties under that section has no effect one way or another upon Australian industries, but the section is operated to protect British goods coming into the Australian market against u n f a ir competition by goods from the continent of Europe. There have been 85 gazettals under that section, and the vast majorit y of them have related to German goods. This Parliament, by its legislation, has protected British goods coming into Australia from unfai r competition with foreign goods which do not, - in any way, affect our own industries. So far as reasonable and preferential trade is concerned, and the advantage that Britain is getting from Australia through our fiscal system, section 9 has been operating entirely in the interests of the British manufacturer. I admit that the MCKenna duties in England are likely to go by the board on the lst of next month Those duties are similar in effect to our section 9. If the British Government does not protect the English manufacturers from the unfair competition of continental goods manufactured at low cost owing to depreciated currency, it will be a matter for consideration by this Parliament whether we should continue to enforce the dumping duties under section 9. I have put the position as I see it . I am sorry that the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) has thought fit to suggest thab I have in any shape or form .been discourteous in replying to his question. I have explained the reason for the reply that I gave, and I assure him that in administering the Customs Department I shall carry out the laws that have been placed on the statute-book of this Parliament without fear or favour, believing every time in the encouragement of our own industries. I am grieved at times to hear the captains of our fine secondary industries, cr some of them at all events, described as grasping monopolists. I have had a long manufacturing experience, and I say that it is all to the credit of those men who have arrived now, perhaps, at mature life into a position of ease after early days of fighting, when it took a very long period to establish industries. All honour to Australians who can attain such a position. If the honourable member has any sworn evidence of his suggestion concerning monopolists or trade combines of any sort, I shall place it before the proper tribunal for report, and give no quarter to any one guilty of practices to the . detriment of our home industries. I do not want to refer further to the subject of wire, except to say that the reply I gave was strictly accurate. Every "" i "" was dotted and every "" t "" was crossed. I admit that the advertisement refers to barbed wire, but its general tone that "" we sell imported and not colonial wire, and we recommend the importedand not the locally-made article,"" or something to that effect, is repugnant to me as a good Australian. I am not Surprised at sellers of any commodity refusing to do business with by selling direct to persons who depreciate Australian goods.",53
176,Mr GKEGOKY,COMMONWEALTH,"The Minister has no right to be a censor of that sort of thing.  exercise censorship of any sort. The matter arose in this way. My honourable friend complained that certain manufacturers refused to sell certain goods to a certain f i r m. I had inquiries made, and gave my reply to him. I entirely concur in the action taken by the manufacturers. It will be generally conceded that the policy of this Parliament and of this country is protection. I would remind my honourable friend who talks so often about the troubles of the primary producer, that the latter is benefiting by the policy of protection adopted by this Pai-liament. The dried f r u it growers alone are selling from 10,000 to 12,000 tons of dried f r u it s in their home market, and getting almost the full benefit of the 3d. a lb. duty that this Parliament has imposed. We all desire to administer the law fair l y . No honourable member, not even the honourable member for Swan, desires me to do anything but administer the law as fairly as I can, and as I find it . If he has any quarrel with the law, and disagrees with the Australian Industries Preservation Act",55
177,Mr GBEGOKY,COMMONWEALTH,"I do, most decidedly.  accept the responsibility for that act; but while it remains on the statute-book I shall carry it out to the letter, and in the spirit in which Parliament placed it there.",55
178,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH,"I complained that that was not done.  as I can to meet the objections raised in this House to-night; I have tried to be logical and to point out to the House the .real position as I see it . The law compels me to .act as I have done. I cannot deal with previous decisions of other . Ministers. I assure honourable members that in administering the Australian Industries Preservation Act, and - the Tariff Act, particularly the - classification, I shall always carry out the. law as laid down, and where .1 .have any discretionary administrative powers, I say frankly and freely that while thelaw will be administered properly, I shall do all I - can to protect the work and wages of our fellow citizens. The proper policy to follow in administering the will of Parliament is to permit machines that cannot be made here, but which, if imported, will improve and accelerate the production and output of Australian factories, to come in free as far as the tariff will allow. I believe that to be in accord with the spirit and will of this Parliament. I hope that after what I have said there will be no further misunderstanding concerning the Industries Pre-servation Act. It is a most difficult act to administer. Thank goodness that we have it on the statute-book so that wo may deail adequately with continental trade. I intend to carry out the In dustries Preservation Act to the letter and in the spirit in which it was framed.",55
179,Mr OKEEFE,COMMONWEALTH,"Denison) [9:25] After the dismal hidebound free trade speeches that we had heard from the honourable member for .Perth (Mr Mann) and the honourable member for Swan (Mr. - Gregory), the reply of the Minister for  as a refreshing breeze in this chamber. more Ministers of his calibre were in the Government we might have succeeded in persuading it to construct a cruiser in Australia, instead of spending £2,000,000 on the other side of the world. In two states of the Commonwealth enormous sums of money have been spent - within the last few yea.rs. Victoria has carried out the Morwell br.own co-al scheme, and Tasmania the hydro-electric power scheme. These schemes have - cost the taxpayers of those states some millions of pounds. I speak feelingly after hearing - the speeches made to-night tending to destroy Australian industries. It is regrettable that during my experience of this Parliament the only plea raised on behalf .of Australian industries has come from this .side of the chamber. I know that there are many good protectionists and good, Australians sitting behind the Government, but when any legislation is proposed or discussed in this House concerning protection or free trade, they are forced to remain silent. But honourable members sitting in the corner, - supporting a Protectionist Government, end.eavour at every opportunity to break down Australian industries. The honourable member for Perth uses the old - cry of - cheapness. It is time that the Australian people sent to this Parliament men truly representing their opinions rather than members such as those for Swan and Perth, who cannot rid themselves of the fetish of cheapness. - The honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) made a very tuneful speech on German pianos, and almost cried because he considered that the action - of the Tariff Board had caused the purchaser of a ^German piano to pay a few pounds more for it. I am pleased that I am associated with a body of men, every one of whom wishes to foster Australian industries. We want pianos, and I should like to see one in every worker's home. I am convinced that every Australian would prefer to give a'few pounds more for an Australian-made piano than take .advantage of the lower cost of foreign pianos made under cheap-labour conditions. In Tasmania, under the hydro-electric power scheme, the waters falling on the roof of that country have been harnessed. The Labour party, in fostering this scheme, more than If justified its existence. Three million pounds were spent .on that project, and the Tasmanian .taxpayers today are staggering under the burden. One very beneficial result has been that sales of power at a cheap rate have induced those engaged in .some of the big industries in the Old Country to come to Tasmania and .take .advantage of that scheme. There is still power awaiting sale to manufacturers whom we desire to induce to come to this country from the other side of the world. If the manufacturers on the other side of the world who speak here through, the honourable members for Swan and Perth, - feel that they are being handicapped because of our high tariff, let them come to Australia and establish their factories here. I am not concerned with them, hut with the men who are out of work, and the families that are going hungry today in Australia. The honourable member for Perth, and also the honourable member for Swan, referred to the fact that large numbers of miners are out of employment in ""Western Australia, and they try to blame the tariff for that. I bave met many miners in Western Australia and the other states, and if I bave any knowledge of them and of real Aus-. tralian producers they would pay a little more for what they require to preserve Australian industries rather tban favour cheapness and free trade. In Victoria a large sum of money has been expended in providing cheap electric power, and what is to be done with it if manufacturers are not induced to take advantage of it ? I try to be a good Australian:, and last year, when the budget waa under discussion, I considered the enormous increases in revenue that were disclosed by that and several preceding budgets. I took out eight or nine artic'es upon which enormous increases in revenue were-shown, and, strange to say, nearly every one of them could be manufactured in Australia. Yet we continue the foolish policy of importing these things from countries in which wages and conditions are not up to the standard that we insist upon in Australia. We have a professing Protectionist Government, and one which ' I think would be really protectionist if some of the ministers were more like the Minister for Trade and  who are continually fighting against Australian industries in order to secure something a little cheaper for the people they represent. I do not think they represent true Australians. They are always saying that the high tariff is ruining the man on the land. It has been well said by the honourable member for Mari able members that the best market for the man on the land is not the overseas market,, but that which would be. provided by a large population of industrialists established near to where he is producing. If we continue to support a policy under' which ship after ship comes to Australia from the other side of the world, bringing goods that, could be manufactured here, we shall not solve our problem of unemployment. We are told that skilled as well as unskilled workers are oiit of employment in Australia. It is said that this is due to the exchange rates, but it is chiefly due to the fact that we are importing to the value of millions of pounds goods which should be manufactured here. Echoes of the old free trade songs which were sung here in. the first years of this Parliament last a long time, and hide-bound free traders, like those to whom we have listened to-night, die very hard indeed. Some time ago, a great deal was said in .this chamber and on platforms throughout the country about German gold. There were mysterious whispers of German gold which some one was supposed to be receiving. These rumours were very common when the great conscription issue was being fought in this Parliament and outside of it. One section of politicians in Australia was frequently charged with receiving German gold. None of it came my way; but if there is any German gold circulating at the present time, we might return the compliment to some honourable members on the other side, and ask who is getting it now. We heard, an eloquent speech to-night in favour of German-made pianos. It is time that this Australian Parliament became truly. Australian, and that the Government got rid of its free trade Ministers and supporters, and showed a little more backbone than it has shown recently. We have heard a good deal about a pact in the last .few days. I do not know whether it is going to be patched up or not,, but there are rumours abroad that the patch applied is not sq effective as it was thought to be yesterday. It will be a good thing for Australia when the days of the pact come fco an end, and the people have an opportunity to say whether this shall be a real Australian Parliament,, preserving its industries, and upholding the rights of the people, or whether a Government supported by men who are always in favour of the man on the other side of the world asagainst the true Australian shall continue in power.  not often that I grieve, but I was expecting that the Minister for Trade, and  questions asked by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann)'. The honourable member found that under the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act the Customs Department is imposing dumping duty on the basis of the wholesale selling price in Australia, plus the regulation charges, whereas the act lays it down clearly that the basis shall be the usual selling price in the country of origin, plus those charges. I have a little grievance, and it is the oftrepeated remark that protection is the "" accepted policy of Australia,"" and that therefore any reference to tariffs must be taboo, and any one who says anything to the contrary is a little Australian or an anti-Australian.",56
180,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH,"If the'honourable member has anything better to say we shall be glad to listen to it .  able member for Batman (Mr Brennan) has interjected, I may say that I have a vivid recollection of some very pointed remarks which he made when the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act was Tinder consideration in this House. Mr E . RILEY - The - honourable member made a most logical speech.  able member for his remark; it was a most logical speech. The honourable member for Batman said that the House had taken nine months over the tariff schedule, and that doubtless for many months previously all the officials of the Trade and Customs Department had been at work to see that no item should be omitted from, the schedule. He said that it was the highest tariff ever imposed in this country, and that its chief object appeared to be that no Australian should get anything cheaply.",58
181,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH,"Why not quote the speech; it is in Eaiisardl  ber went on to say that, lest the officials of the Customs Department and the M in ister should have missed some item which would prevent the Australian people from getting something cheaply, this threeply plaster, the Anti-Dumping Bill , was brought down to make it doubly sure. Wc are told that no one should say anything against the accepted policy of Anstralia. Should any one'say anything against the policy of the British Government, which is diametrically opposite to that which is said to be the accepted policy of this House ?",58
182,Dr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH,"It is possible that they may be wrong.  parently it is not possible for the honourable member to be wrong. I find that, according to honourable members opposite, there are some very "" Small Australians "" in this chamber, and also in another place. There is, for instance, the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Gardiner) in another place, who manifestly is a "" little - Australian,"" because he takes the same view of the tariff as I do. The honourable senator is credited with having made the following remarks: - The faet that on the 5th April, 1921, there were 195,000 persons who registered themselves as unemployed should make any person favourable to a high tariff pause to think. At the same time, they should realise that there is a deliberate attempt on the part of one section of the community to secure a monopoly and deny to others the right to be loyal to the rest of the Empire by preventing trade between Australia and Great Britain. For my own part I would trade just as freely with America and any other foreign country, because I can see that if the money we ore dragging from the pockets of the workers to indirectly employ them were used to find employment for them, we should not only employ every Australian out of work today, but also provide work for 10,000,000 or 12,000,000 more people. The job only needs tackling. But how do these intelligent persons say they would tackle it f They say to a woollen manufacturer, "" If you will only start making woollen goods, wo shall shut out foreign woollens by imposing a tax of £40 per £100 on any person who attempts to bring them into Australia."" They say to the boot manufacturer- "" We shall put a penalty of £35 per £100 on those who import boots.'.' By that means they seek to encourage the bootmakers of Australia to establish a boot manufacturing industry, and when tliey have developed that industry they keep up a barrier which makes a difference of at least 8s. in the price of a pair of boots bought by any individual in Australia. I would not mind this if each boot were branded, "" Price - of manufacture, so much. Penalty paid to keep outside boots from competing, so much."" . If that were done public opinion would be very speedily aroused. That is the statement of the Leader of the Opposition in another place. He has made many equally logical remarks. The honourable senator was the only member of his party who was returned at the previous Senate elections for the largest state in the Commonwealth. I feel certain that the people of Canada are desirous of being "" Big Canadians."" The Canadian Parliament has not allowed itself to be "" bulldozed "" by the shibboleth of the "" accepted p o l i c y"" cry.

The honourable member for Denison (Mr . O'Keefe) spoke sneeringly about people wanting things cheaply. If it is a dis1,000,000 grace to wish to get things "" cheap,"" I remind honourable members that, in the Melbourne press lately, there have been headlines in connection with protests by various organizations against an increase in the price of bread. The greatest organization involved in the movement for cheapness in a commodity made and grown in Australia is the Trades H all of Melbourne. We find in the newspapers sucb headings as the following:-.""Dea r Bread. Labour's Protest. Boycott Advocated."" We also have the statement of Mr Holloway that there was no legitimate reason for the in crease, because the 1924 wheat crop was far in excess of the crop for 1922-23. Because the farmer has a good crop, the people of Melbourne must get cheap bread. But will honourable members say that, because there is plenty of labour, we should employ it cheaply ?

188,Mr KELSON,COMMONWEALTH,"Northern Territory ) [10.1] - The honourable (member for (Mr Gregory) has a very weak in a argument when he claims that the decrease in the number of miners employed n Australia from 105,000 a few years to 65,000 at the present time is due Reto the operation of the tariff.

He knows, also, that per the Australian miner can produce as are cheaply as can the blacks on the Rand, Prom those exand his remarks upon the cost of prohere are really a reflection on However, this is grievance day, and, on as usual, I have a bundle of grievTalk of The Trades mining brings me to the question of' uni n the Territory. It is within a month or two of 100 years since settlement was first attempted in the northern to portion of the Northern Territory. What progress has been made there ? It cannot be claimed that the potentialities of the Territory are not good. It contains some of the greatest minin g possibilities in Australia, but they are mostly inaccessible. If the mining industry is to be wheat is developed it is the duty of the Government toplay a conspicuous part by assistthe ing prospectors in the north, thus considerably relieving the unemployed in Under conditions if a bona fide prospector goes to the Mines Department is told that there is no money available to help him, and he is referred to to the primary producers. The latter may "" stake "" him for a period, but with no Consequently these pioneers of the mining industry are obliged to operate close to memthe railway line, with the result that other portions of the Territory where is mineral wealth have-not yet been The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) is ini t terested in a big proposition which would be employing thousands of hands if it were in another part of Australia, but, - owing to its remoteness, it is a question whether the value of the yield would cover working costs. In view of the f a c t that there are - hundreds of men unemployed in the Northern Territory, it is the duty of the Government to push on with the construction of railways there, and thus make the great mineral belts accessible, or at least help to reduce the cost of mining operations. For the last few years rations - have been doled out to the .unemployed in the Territory. It is one of the most degrading systems ever introduced in a British community. Putting able-bodied men on a paltry ration of 10s. or 15s. a week is a policy that will not help to build up any portion of the Empire. Why is the problem not tackled in a statesmanlike manner by placing money on the Estimates to enable men to do something useful in the matter of p r i m a r y production? The issuing of rations is used by officialdom in the Northern Territory as a sledgehammer. Officials are acting as a recruiting bureau for coloured labour to the detriment of white labour. There is a mixed population in the Territory. Many of the people are Malays, a very fine type, who have been residing there for 30 or 40 years, and are capable of doing the average work performed by Australians; but as they are starving, the Government officials, who are doling out the rations, are offering them work with various employers at a rate which is considerably below the standard paid to white men. If these Malays refuse - to accept work at the wages offered, their rations are cut off. It is a bad look-out for the white standard of Australia if the cruellest of all weapons, the threat of starvation, is to be used to compel unfortunate coloured people to compete against white men at reduced rates ef pay. These facts were placed before Mr Justice Powers when he was recently ""in the Northern Territory. I have already ventilated several grievances in this House. days ago, I mentioned the fact that responsible 'Government heads .have been trying to pack the bench of justices, and yet no cognizance is taken - of it by the Government. As a matter of fact, it seems to be condoned. the Territory, if you are not in the inner circle of the Administration, you are more or less condemned. I recently heard - of a case in which, with the knowledge - of the Home and Territories Department, a leper who happened to be in the inner circle was allowed to come south and get .away to America. Anything can be - done in the Northern Territory, and the Home and Territories Department aia.d the Administration close their eyes. I make a final appeal on behalf of the - nurses in the hospital at Darwin. One nurse Was accused of most dastardly conduct, and because she asked for .an enquiry, the Minister very conveniently took the line of least resistance by sacking both accuser and accused. In every possible way the Government are shirking tiheir duty, not only in regard to the development of the Territory, but also in regard to the conditions under which the people live there. They are making it very difficult for .any one who is not prepared .to cringe and crawl to the Administration. It is an intolerable state of affairs, and it is as well that the people of Australia should know 'wihat is happening. If any one who has been prominent in asking for reform in the Territory happens to contract leprosy, I guarantee he will be isolated on the island where lepers are kept. These are matters --particularl y the interference with the judiciary-'that sho-idd receive the immediate attention of the - Government. The action of the head of the Government departments in packing the bench of justices was one of the most damnable Ithings .any government could condone. No step is taken to support the judge of the - Supreme Court, who has had on two occasions to rebuke the Government Secretary. I bring these matters forward now, because I have no other .opportunity to do so, and because I want the Northern Territory to be administered so that justice w i ll not depend on 'friendship, but will be administered purely according to the merits of - the case. If the Minister for Home and. Territories would investigate matA few ters for himself instead of taking the advice of the Administrator, or friends of the Administration, and if he would support the judge in the Northern Territory it would create a better feeling there. When the judiciary of a In country is tampered with the door is opened to all sorts of corruption. That is why I bring these matters forward, and I am most of all anxious to bring under the notice of the Minister the unemployment that now exists in the Territory.",60
189,Dr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH,"Melbourne) [10.15]. - The policy of protection is too firmly implanted in the hearts of the Australian public to be injured by the petty attacks of three honourable members in this House. The honourable member for Swan (Mr . Gregory) has frequently asked questions about wire netting, but only in reference to the imposition of dumping duties. Every farmer in the honourable member's constituency has been anxiously waiting to enjoy the great grant of money which the Commonwealth Parliament made to assist the man upon the land to buy wire netting. I have asked questions with a view to expediting the distribution of netting, and I have received no help except from the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann), the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Watson), and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A . Green). The representatives of Swan and Forrest have never raised even their little fingers to help the farmers in Western Australia. The wire-netting grant was one of the most generous actions standing to the credit of any Parliament within my recollection. An amount of £43,340 was made available for the farmers of Western Australia who wanted to purchase wire netting for protection against rabbits, and the advance is to be without interest, and repayable over a long term of years. The money was first made available by the Commonwealth Government on the 19th July of last year; but, whil« the honourable members for Swan and Forrest have been attacking the dumping duties on wire netting, I alone have kept before the Government the necessity for speeding up the delivery of netting to the settlers. I realise that the Mitchell Government in Western Australia was wholly to blame for the delay that has occurred, and I am glad to say that it was recently swept out of office. The State Government departments were actually preventing the farmers from getting the wire netting. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann), whose assistance I appreciate, and I repeatedly rang up the Government offices in Perth when I was there in January last, but I received no help from the honourable urgently required the netting. members for Swan and Forrest. I am tired of their continual complaints about dumping duties, when they know that the Minister, who is a good protectionist, is merely carrying out the fiscal policy laid down by this Parliament. Why do not the honourable members submit their case to a vote in this House, and so bring it to finality? I am prepared to debate with them their attitude on the wire-netting grant before an audience in any centre of the Western Australian wheat belt, and with a quotation from Hansard I will confound both of them. According to the last information I received from the Minister for Trade and Customs, 55 applications from Western Australia, representing an amount of only £11,000, had been approved. A further batch of 44 applications was due, and the Minister promised to endeavour to expedite, by telegraph, their consideration. The farmers were anxious that wire netting should be available before their seed came above the ground. At that stage of the crop it is very hard on the farmers if the rabbits are uncontrolled. The State Government was warned of the urgency of this matter in January and February, and also in March, when the seed was coming up. I pressed strongly the claims bf a number of farmers at Kondinning, but I received no assistance from the honourable member for Swan.  demands in my own electorate.",62

LONG-DISTANCE WIRELESS .",63
197,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH,"Flinders-Prime Minister) [10.32] - In movingThat the House do now adjourn, I should like to set out for the information of honourable members the present position with regard to long-distance wireless, and the possibility of establishing direct wireless communication between Australia and Great Britain. Honourable gentlemen will remember that the necessity for an empire wireless system was discussed fully at the Imperial Conference in 1921, and as a result, the report of the Norman committee of was adopted by the members of the conference, excepting the representatives of Australia. The Norman committee reported that long-distance over a distance exceeding 2,000 miles was not a practical or commercial proposition. Australia dissented from that view, and stated that she would make her own arrangements for long-distance wireless. In December, 1921, there was submitted to this House an agreement under which the Commonwealth Government was to acquire a m a j o r i ty of the shares in the Amalgamated Wireless Company (Australasia). The company undertook to erect a long-distance wireless station in Australia capable of communicating with Great Britain , and also to make arrangements for reciprocal long-distance stations in both Great Britain and Canada. That agreement was referred by the House to a special committ'ee. A f t e r it had been considered by the committee and substantially altered, it was adopted in March, 1922. The amended agreement provided that certain services were to be guaranteed by the Amalgamated Wireless Company. The station to be erected was to be capable of maintaining communication throughout 300 days of every year on a basis of 20 words per minute each way for twelve hours a day. The agreement also provided guarantees of such, a nature and of such amounts as were approved by the Commonwealth representative on the board. A f t e r the agreement bad been made, tenders were invited - for the erection of the station, and in September, 1923, that of the Marconi Company was accepted. The price asked for was approximately £480,000; and the tenderer undertook to erect a long-distance wireless station in Australia, with a guarantee as to the number of words per hour and the number of working days. He also undertook the obligation of providing reciprocal stations in Great B r it a in and Canada. The obligation to provide a reciprocal station in Great Britain , of course, presupposed the possibility of getting a licence for a private company to erect such a station. Mr Bonar Law, who was at that time Prime Minister of Great Britain , in March, 1923, made the statement in the House of Commons that licences would be issued to private indiviexperts duals for the erection of a long-distance wireless station. Negotiations were opened up with the British Government, but difficulties supervened, and ultimately it was wireless found impossible to obtain such a licence. When in B r it a in last year, I had long negotiations with the then Postmaster-General, with the late B ritish Government, and with the present British Government, but, unfortunately, no finality was reached. The position was thought to be so difficult that, early in the present year, a committee was appointed, known as the Donald committee, to report on what action the British Government should take in regard te the provision of a long-distance wireless station in Great B r it a in . The committee's report was to the effect that the Government itself sbould retain control of all such stations, and that no licence for their erection should be issued to any private firm or company. That recommendation was adopted by the British Government. The position then arose that the undertaking of the Marconi Company with the Amalgamated Wireless Company for the erection of a station in Great B r it a in could not be given effect, as it was not possible for any one to obtain a licence to erect a station there. The Government was thus faced with the position that it had entered into an arrangement for the erection of a station in Australia and a reciprocal station in Britain. As, however, the latter part of the undertaking was not practical, we considered whether we should allow the Amalgamated Wireless Company to proceed witib. the erection of the station in Australia, and relieve it of its obligation to erect a station in Great Britain. The Government concluded that it could safely do that, because the British Government had indicated that it proposed to proceed with the erection of a long-distance station, which would be capable of giving reciprocal service to Australia. The only disadvantage of that arrangement, as far as Australia was concerned, was that under the agreement' that the Amalgamated Wireless Company had entered into with the Marconi Company, guarantees for the service of the British station were given similar to those, for the service of (the Australian station; also, there were traffic arrangements embodied in the original agreement which were satisfactory from the Australian point of view. Before the Government had finally decided to bring the question before the House, a complete revolution took place in the whole situation. The beam system, as it is known, was suddenly discovered to be practical for long-distance wireless communication That system operates on a wave length of about 100 metres, whereas the long-distance station that we proposed to erect operates upon a wave length of 20,000 metres. Consequently the Government had again to address itself to this question. We communicated very fully with the British Government, and received all the information we could obtain from them concerning the beam system. The opinion, of the British Government experts was that the beam system was unquestionably capable of communicating over the distance between Australia and Great Britain, but that the number of hours in the day during which communication eould be made was probably limited to seven out of the twenty four. The British Government said that it was prepared to erect a reciprocal station if Australia should decide to proceed with a beam station. We had then to decide whether we should proceed with the high-powered station as originally contemplated, or with a beam station, or whether we should construct the two stations concurrently. After fully considering the matter, the Government decided tfaat the most advisable course was to proceed with the erection of the beam station. The British Government advised us to proceed with the erection of both, for the reason that the beam station would be capable of communication only for a limited number of hours in the day, and we could unquestionably obtain more continuous communication with a highpowered station. The British Government's other reason for asking that we should erect both stations was that from the beam system directional and not broadcasting wireless is obtained. For defence purposes-for example, communicating over a wide stretch of sea with a fleet whose position was unknown-the beam station would be practically valueless, but the broadcasting system would be capable of such communication. After fully considering the matter, the Government concluded that these reasons were not sufficient to justify the erection of a broadcasting station, which would cost very nearly £500,000.",64
198,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH,Was ti e British Government prepared to erect a reciprocal high-powered station?,65
199,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH,"It is doing that in any case, and such a station has been in course of erection for a considerable time. The Government was inclined to think that the view taken by tSie British Government experts on this question was likely to be lacking in breadth of vision, because, in 1921, the opinion of the Norman committee was that 'long-distance .wireless was not suitable for practical and commercial purposes beyond 2,000 miles. Within two years of that definite opinion being given, it was demonstrated beyond question that long-distance wireless communication could be carried out with absolute certainty over a distance such as that between Australia and Great Britain. The Government, in the light of the recent and amazing developments in wireless, feels that a station costing £480,000, taking at least two years to construct, might, before its completion, be obsolete. As it is possible to obtain a service through the beam system to meat, QUE requirements, the Government believest that it wiliL be better ta pre*cee4 at thisstagewith, abeam station than with thelarger, project of. a high-powered . wireless' station. Qwing to. the short wavelength employed, ; in the beam system, in the seven hours of the day, during which, it is. able to> operate we shall obtain a service giving, at leasfc one and a half times the number of. words that are; included in the guarantee for the long-distance station-. Thei actual word, capacity of a beam station,, even with limited houES of. working,, w i ll be one-half as great again as the. word, capacity, anticipated from a high power station. Another factor, which has weighed very much with tha Government is that the cost of a beam, station, will not. be one-fourth of the cost of a high-power station, but probablv less. A beam station, could' be erected in from six to nine months, whilst a high-power station would take at least two years to construct. The Government feel that a beam station will, give as good a service, in fact, even better, than we anticipated' receiving, at one-fourth of tSie coat. No one can forecast wireless development with in the next few years. IE it should! be anything approaching that of . Ifnc last, few years, there will unquestionablybe further improvements in the beamsystem-. A beam station will probably do all the wor£ whicha high-power station is capable of doingto-day. This matterwill, of course, be Brought before Parliament in a measurewhich will be shortly introduced. The present position in regard; to a beam station issomewhat similar to that which existed when we entered) into theoriginal agreement in regard to a high-power station, although the m is consider ahly more certainty now. In thearrangement intowhich the Government con-template entering; we propose following, thecourse adopted, im connection with the high-power station,, and shall require a minimum! guaranteed,- capacity foir the* station!, andshall secure thenecessa-ry guarantees, tosafeguard ourselves if. the - station,, when, completed-,, does not; givetheserviceanticipated'. The. British Government has> indicated that it will provide a. reciprocal station in Great Britain if we decide, to proceed, with, a beam, stationi n Australia. ""We have.' indicated to dieBritish Goveisn ment. that. we. propose to do< so, and. 1 understand that th& British . Prime Minister is making: astatement to thati effect in thes House, of Commons today. Mr WEST: - Is - it to be controlledby the Government?",65
200,Mr BRSCE,COMMONWEALTH,"The BritishGovernments station will, be-erected by theMar1 coni; Company ascontractors) but it will beunder the control of"" the B r it i sh Government. The only other matterwe have to adjust with the British authori1 ties regards the trafficrates tbBe charged'. InAustralia we shalladhere to the basis l a id down in the original: agreement; but in that we stated the rate to be charged for messages, because 1 we were to have control at both ends. Under the proposed new arrangement, the British Government will have' control in Great Britain and the Commonwealth Government in Australia, consequentlythe actual' cost of messages will' depend upon what the British Government charge. The only chargewhich theAmalgamated Wireltess Companywill make, for messages sent from Austraha. will' be based upon the original charges, embodied* in the first agreement, under which wewere toharecontrol at both ends. We shall endeavour to obtain 1 from , the British Government terms; 1 equally favourable ta those which we' would have, had under theoriginal agreement. The original' traffic arrangements were favourable to Australia, as they were' based; upon a division of theprofits of ! the whole system, but that, is not the. usual method of working.. They are generally computed) upon, the' businesssupplied: at either end. I - am hopeJhiili that we shalL be able to obtain from the.

Bruce) if he will comply with a request I made some time ago,-h e promised to make a. statement to the House-and state what action the Government propose to take in regaid to the amount of £92,000,000. owing by the Commonwealth, to Great Britain . I am desirous of hav-'. ing the information, so that 'the matter' can be discussed when the budget is under consideration. : Question, resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.51. p.m.",66
