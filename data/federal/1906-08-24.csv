1,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"for Mr Reid ) asked the Minister representing the Minister of DefenceHave the Government, in their selection of an officer for the chief position in the Military Forces, been nssisted by any expert military advice ?",13
2,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The answer to the r i g h t honourable member's question is as f o l lows:In the opinion of the Government, the officer elected to fill the position of Inspector-General of the Commonwealth Military Forces possesses the necessary military qualifications and experience. In making the selection, the Government have been assisted by the recorded opinions of oflicers of high military rank in the British Army. NA",13

4,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is Official business will require my presence in Sydney early next week, and I shall then take the opportunity of consulting His Honor the Chief Justice and the President of the Arbitration Court .on the matter. ELECTOR AL ROLLS.",13
5,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"the M in ister of Home A f fair s, upon notice In view of the fact that the franchise is practically identical in New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia, and Queensland with that of the Commonwealth, is there not any possibility of utilizing the one roll for both State - and Commonwealth purposes, and thereby save the Commonwealth thousands of pounds annually ?",13
6,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as f o l l o w s : The Conference of Commonwealth and State Electoral Officers, which met in Melbourne in April last, reported that the constitution of a joint roll generally for both Commonwealth and State purposes is both practicable and desirable in the interests of administration and economy, but, owing to the very large number of fine distinctions which would be necessary therein, under existing conditions, it would be more profitable to defer the preparation of such a roll until the several Governments have determined how far they may deem it expedient, by 1006. means of amending legislation, to obviate the necessity for these distinctions. The necessity for joint action, as between the at 10.30 Commonwealth and the States in connection with electoral matters, is being kept constantly in view. The Commonwealth, in its amended legislation, has provided for the use of the joint roll when desired, and it now remains for the State Governments to take similar action. CLERKS : GENERAL POST OFFICE , SYDNEY.",13
7,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"On the 15th August, the honourable and learned member for West Sydney asked the f o l l o w ing questions, to w h i c h an interim reply was f u r n is h e d : 1. What was the number of clerks in the General Post Office, Sydney, prior to the inauguration of the Commonwealth? 2. What is the present number? 3. How many clerical positions have been abolished since the transfer of this Department to the Commonwealth? 4. How many positions are there on the clerical staff <at present unfilled? 5. In view of the large increase in the clerical work in the General Post Office, Sydney, COURT. since Federation, does he consider that this reduction was justifiable? 6. Considering the amount of overtime which the clerks are compelled to work at the office mentioned, will he take immediate steps to f ill existing vacancies, and to augment the clerical staff, so that this overworking may cease. The answers are as f o l l o w : 1. 104, excluding 48 clerks employed in the Government Savings Bank and not taken over by the Commonwealth. 2. 228, including 40 officers who were clerks prior to classification, but who now hold general division designations, and still possess clerical status. 3. 23; 15 on the recommendation of the Deputy Postmaster-General; 3 marked as unnecessary in the classification; 2 unfilled prior to classification and omitted therefrom; 3 consequent on transfers to general office prior to Commissioner's appointment. 4. Nine. 5. It will be seen from reply to question 3 that, in the majority of cases, the positions were abolished on the recommendation' of the Deputy PostmasteT-General. who considered it unnecessary to fill same, and in other cases at the instance of the Public Service Commissioner, after an inspection and examination by his inspector, into the work of the General Post Office, Sydney. 6. The Public Service Commissioner has recently intimated that so soon as the approved proposals for the amalgamation of certain branches in the General Post Office, Sydney, now in course of arrangement, are given effect to, some of the present positions will become unnecessary, ancl there will be a superfluity of officers. Under these circumstances if is not deemed necessary to augment the clerical staff. EXCISE TARIFF BILL. SECOND READING . Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) proposed - That the Bill be now read a second time.",13
8,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Wentworth) [10.36] - It is to be .regretted that the Minister of Trade and Customs, whose Department this measure concerns, is not here to ta.ke charge of it.",14
9,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"The Minister will be here presently. The Bill is a purely formal one,",14
10,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"I do not wish to oppose it, but I am sorry that the Minister is not here to take charge of it. It might very well be postponed until he arrives.  so desirous of the company of the Minister of Trade and Customs, why does he not travel about with him? No doubt the Minister would be glad to have him.",14
11,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Bland) [10.37] - The Tariff Commission, I understand, recommended an allowance for under-proof in the case of spirits imported in bulk. That recommendation might well be taken into consideration when the Spirits Bill is being dealt with.",14
12,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Hear . hear. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and reported without amendment; report adopted. Standing Orders suspended, and Bill read a third time. BOUNTIES BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 3rd August, vide page 2367): Clause 2There shall be payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated accordingly, the sum of Fifty thousand pounds per annum during the period of ten years commencing on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and six, for the payment of bounties on the production of the goods specified in the Schedule. 8 Upon which Sir WILLIAM LYNE had moved, by way of amendment That the word "" Fifty "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" Five hundred,"" and that the words ""per annum"" be left out.",14
13,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Lang) [10.41] - I have again to enter my protest against the absence of the Minister of Trade and Customs. Whenever this session there has been business before us in regard to which he should have been here to direct our deliberations, he has been away, and we have had to rely upon other Ministers, who cannot be supposed to be as conversant with the details affecting proposed legislation as should the Ministerial head of the particular. Department which it chiefly concerns. Immediately after business ' relating to the Customs Department has been submitted to us this session by the Minister, he has on several occasions run away and flouted the House.",14
14,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,The honourable member must not refer to the conduct of the Minister in regard to other Bills.,14
15,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"I am merely making incidental reference in order to show that his absences are not accidental, but are his constant practice. They are so frequent as to call for remark, having become almost chronic. We are entitled to the benefit of his information in regard to this measure. For my own part, I see no reason why .£500,000 should be appropriated for the payment of bounties on the production of cocoa, coffee, chicory, cotton, fibres, fish, milk, oils, rice, rubber, kapok, and such other miscellaneous goods as may be prescribed ",14
16,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,No bounty is proposed for the encouragement of the poultry industry.,14
17,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"That is not the only industry which is left out. Why should invidious distinctions be made between one class of produce and another? To my mind, the Bill is merely an electioneering dodge, and is tantamount to, and intended as, a bribe to secure votes for the Government from the agricultural interests in certain districts. There is no urgency for a measure of this kind. What excuse is advanced for proposing a bountv for the production of chicory, for example? The fact that this measure has been sprung upon the House upon the eve of a general election justifies the impression that it has been introduced for electioneering purposes. We are asked to vote a large sum of money- a cool half a million - in the face of the prediction of the Treasurer that next year our revenue will probably be reduced. In view of the increasing obligations which are being assumed by the Commonwealth, and of the large amount of revenue which it is proposed to sacrifice under the Treasurer's proposal for penny postage alone, it seems madness to practically throw away £500,000 in the manner proposed. It has not been shown that we should derive any advantage from the proposed expenditure. In any case, the principle underlying the measure is unsound. I have always held that it is improper to tax the whole community for the benefit of a few individuals. It may be admitted that when it is considered desirable to courage private enterprise by extending State aid, it is better to do so by means of bonuses than by imposing protective duties, because when bonuses are granted the public know exactly how much they are paying, whereas when protective duties are imposed they can form no conception of the extent to which they are being fleeced. Moreover, bonuses are generally granted 'for a limited period, although experience shows us that almost invariably a demand is made for the extension of the period, and often for an increase of the bonus. It is always pleaded, after an industry has been stimulated by means of a bonus, that it would not be fair to permit it to col-4 lapse. This plea generally excites a large amount of sympathy, especially amongst those who beiieve that the community can be made rich by taking money out of one pocket, and putting it into the other. The result is that very often the Legislature finds itself compelled to continue ad infinitum bonuses which it was originally intended to grant for only a limited, period ;  orable member's second reading speech is going on ad infinitum.",14
18,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,The honourable member will also have an opportunity to speak if he so desires. I judge that I am expressing his views as well as my own.  honourable member is saying all that I want to say.,15
19,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Then there will be no necessity for the honourable member to speak. I am pleased to know that at least one honourable member on the Government benches shares my views upon this question. In order to arrive at something approaching finality, in regard to the payment of bonuses, it has been the practice, at the end of the period originally fixed, to yield to the inevitable demand for a continuance of the bonus beyond the period originally fixed, and to adopt a, sliding scale for a further fixed term. But before the expiration of the renewed term, a demand is invariably made for the imposition of protective duties. After large sums of money have been paid directly out of the pockets of the taxpayers in order to'establish an industry, first of all, upon the supposition that it would prove advantageous to the whole community, and, secondly, in the belief that at the end of en- the bonus period it would be able to get along without assistance, it is found that, owing, perhaps, to the fact that it is not natural to the country, and perhaps to other causes, it must die unless further assistance is granted. When an application is made for the imposition of protective duties, those who approved of the bonus in the belief that nothing more was to be asked for are looked upon as inconsistent if they allow the industry to perish for want of a little further assistance. And thus, before granting bonuses, the greatest care should be exercised. I hold that, under certain circumstances, bonuses are justifiable. For example, it might be shown that if certain works were established, the interests of the community as a whole would be promoted. It might be justifiable to grant a bonus in order to secure the establishment of an industry that would assist us in connection with our defences, or serve some other great and important national purpose, and which it would be more beneficjal to establish by private enterprise, assisted by a bounty, than as a direct Government industrial concern. None of the industries referred to in the schedule can, however, he regarded as coming within that category. The money now proposed to be spent upon bonuses might be more justifiably devoted to promoting technical education, and the establishment of agricultural colleges, and, perhaps, a Commonwealth Department of Agriculture, to work in conjunction with the States Departments. The honourable member for Echuca delivered a very able address to the House, in which he expressed and elaborated similar views. If the practice of granting public money to assist private enterprise is justifiable at all, it should be distributed in such a way that the cbmmunity, as a whole, ancl not a particular section, should reap the benefit of it . The entire community would certainly benefit by any advance which was made in the dissemination of scientific knowledge relating to rural industries, which are the backbone of the country. There would be infinitely less objection to the .expenditure of public money in that direction than there is to its disbursement under the method proposed by the Government. Reference has been made to the fact that the right honourable member for East Sydney has approved of this system of bounties. But I would remind the Committee that he spoke merely for himself, and the fact that he may approve of the granting of bonuses does not necessarily commit his supporters to the proposal now before the Committee. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr. MAUGER ) - I would remind the honourable member that the proposal before the Chair is to strike out the word "" fifty,"" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""five hundred."" That proposal does not involve the consideration of the whole question of the payment of bounties. The honourable member must not make a second reading speech.",15
20,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"The question, as I understood it to be stated by the Chairman, was "" that the clause be agreed ""to."" The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN No. The question before the Chair is whether the words ""fiv e hundred"" shall be substituted for the word "" fifty.""",16
21,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"I am dealing with the principle which is involved, irrespective of whether the amount proposed to be expended is large or small. In conclusion, I repeat that this money could be much more justifiably spent in the direction I have indicated. But, in any case, I do not propose to entrust the Minister of Trade and Customs, or the present Government, with the disbursement of an immense sum of money just on the eve of a general election, much less to give them a blank cheque, as is now proposed.  understand that the proposition before the Committee is one to increase the total amount of the bounties payable under this clause from £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 to ,£500,000? The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN Yes. t"" ]9  proposal ?",16
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"The Minister of Trade and Customs.  bodied in the Bill is for the payment of ,£50,000 a year for a period of ten years.. ' Mr EWING - The Minister of Trade and Customs has moved to set aside ,£500,000 for the payment of bounties during that period.",16
23,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"We cannot risk the finances in that way.  growing practice for a Minister to throw a Bill upon the table, and to leave honourable members to worry it in the absence of proper information.",16
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"That has been the practice for two years. Is the honourable member only just, waking up to it?",16
25,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"I knew a Ministry which did it ten years, ago. ,  been very much in evidence during the current session, and, although I do not hold the Opposition entirely responsible for it, I do not regard them as absolutely blameless. It is well known that whilst their leader and his principal henchman are galivanting about the country there is a great temptation to the Government to look after their own interests. The practice, however, is a very reprehensible one. When this Bill was introduced it was known that many honourable members entertained strong objection to it, because they feared that the bounties would not benefit those whom the measure was intended to assist. Whilst the Minister of Trade and Customs was making his second-reading speech he was met with a shower of interjections in that connection. He then intimated that some provision would be made to overcome the difficulty. To-day we have the announcement-withou t any explanation whatever - that it is proposed to increase the amount 1 of the bounties to £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",16
26,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,The gross amount is not to be increased.,16
27,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Oh , no ",16
28,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,I presume that there will be consequential amendments introduced by the Government.,16
29,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Oh , yes. The position will Le made perfectly clear.  absolutely clear. I am aware that the honourable member for Echuca has given notice of an .amendment with a view to regulating the payment of these bounties.",16
30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,I call attention to the absence of a quorum. It seems to me that the argument of the honourable member for Grey ought to be heard by his colleagues. [Quorum formed.]  ducted by the Butter Commission in Victoria conclusively proved that only a very small percentage of the butter bonus actually found its wav into the pockets of the primary producers. Under this B we have .no guarantee that that section of the community will receive a single penny of the bounties - The Minister led the House to believe that in Committee he would make provision for protecting the interests of the primary producer.,17
31,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"That will be done.  yet. Take the olive oil industry. I understand that the price paid for i cwt. of olives is 6s. But it does not follow that every grower of olives manufactures his own oil. The cost of picking i cwt. of olives is 2s. 6d., but the oil which can be extracted from them-abou t 2 gallons - is worth 16s. Unless some radical alteration be made in the Bill the manufacturer of the oil will get every penny of the bounty. I prefer the bounty system to the imposition of Customsduties, since under it we are able to ascertain exactly what we are paying to encourage any industry, and may limit the period during which the payments shall be made; but we ought to be careful that the primary producer shall secure that proportion of the benefit to which he is entitled. I do not think that under this Bill the man who .grows coffee beans, will receive any part of the bounty to be given for the production of coffee, nor do I know whether the grower of cotton will receive any proportion of the cotton bounty.",17
32,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"The honourable member for Echuca has given notice of an amendment to meet that objection, and we might perhaps put it into an acceptable form.  ferred to that amendment. Mv complaint is that no member of the Ministry has vet explained how many of the objections raised during the second-reading debate are to be met. I trust, however, that the Minister - now in charge of the Bill will explain the intentions, of the Government. I am satisfied that the desire of the Committee is that the bounties shall go to the primary producers.",17
33,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Any proposal in that direction will be favourably received.  repetition of the experience of Victoria in regard to the butter bounty. Our desire is that the primary producers shall at all events derive some of the advantages of the bounty system. The Minister of Trade and Customs said that they would be benefited by receiving an increased price, for ill their products, but we know that that was not the experience of the farmers of Victoria under the butter bonus system. I do not think it is the intention of the Committee'that the primary producers shall be at the mercy of the buyers of their products. We shall, however, have another opportunity to deal with that phase of the question when the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Echuca is submitted.",17
34,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Echuca) [11.18] - Some valuable points have been raised by the honourable member for Grey, but I think that they may be more appropriately discussed when another clause is under consideration. I would draw attention to the scanty information put before honourable members in regard to this important measure. Under it, we propose the first step taken by this Parliament for the direct assistance of agriculture. It is an important step, involving a large expenditure, and we should be careful how we proceed. In introducing the measure the Minister of Trade and Customs seemed to be in a state of mental confusion. He was unable to give specific answers to various questions that were put to him ; but said that everything would be put right by-and-by. Before passing the Bill , however, we ought to know by what Department it will be administered, and whether those controlling it will be, from the outset, in touch with the growers and producers. Is that to be the position, or is the authority to be exercised only when the product is supplied in its manufactured state, and the bountv is being claimed? We wish to know who are to be the inspectors, and whether there is to be an attempt to educate the farmers, whom we seek to encourage to .grow these new products. We should take care that the primary producer is fairly treated, and that he shall receive his fair proportion of these bounties. Bill is simply a skeleton measure-th l)ody of it, so to speak, will be provided by regulations. Before we agree large expenditure, we should have some indication of what those regulations are likely to be. I have not risen with any desire to oppose the Bill. Although I should like to see it amended in several respects, the Minister. I am in accord with the principle that encouragement should be given to the raismember ing of new products; but think that we should have full information as to the way in which this encouragement is to be given. Is the Commonwealth to act alone, or iri conjunction with the States? Are the farthe mers to be educated in the cultivation of these new products, or is a go-as-youcutive please policy to be pursued ? I sympahave thize with the Minister now in charge the Bill, since he has, doubtless, been called upon at short notice to take it but I am sure that the Committee and the country will be very grateful for formation he may give as to the intentions of the Government regarding the points I have named.",17
35,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,North and Sydney) [11.22] - The honourable member for Grey made the extraordinary charge that the Opposition was responsible for the absence of the Minister of Trade and Customs.,18
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,I certainly think that one honourable member of the Opposiconsideration. tion is.,18
37,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"He also time alluded to the absence of individual memsure bers of the Opposition. Might I point out that an honourable member, who is not in office, is responsible only to his constituare ents for his absence from the Chamber, tended that there should be no annus 1 but that the position with regard to a Minlimitation ister is different ? A Minister is one the Executive of Parliament; his appointmade ment has been approved by Parliament, the and he is responsible to it for the proper discharge of the duties of his office. That bein'g so, I hold that a Minister flouts Parliament when, owing not to accident misfortune, or to causes for which he cantion of the Bill. not be held responsible, he absents himself from the House, not once or but many times whilst Bills relating to his Department are under consideration.",18
38,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Why not have a special debate on that question, instead of referderation, ring to it dav after day ? [119]- 2",18
39,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,Is the honourable member The for Biand defending the absence of the e Minister of Trade and Customs?,18
40,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,No ; I suppose that he to this is able to defend himself.,18
41,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"I am replying to the accusation of an honourable member of the Labour Party that the Opposition are responsible for the absence of Mr. JOSEPH CopK - And an honourable of the Labour Party being absent, as usual, did not hear that accusation.",18
42,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"That is not correct. I have been here nearly every day this session, worse luck, having regard to some of speeches to which I have had to listen.",18
43,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"The Exeis responsible to Parliament, and we a right to expect Ministers to be in of attendance-excep t when their absence is unavoidable-whe n Bills relating to their up; Department are under consideration, so that we may have that information which any incan be given only by them.  Labour Partv were acting as the leader of the Opposition is doing-tourin g the States going into various electorates - woul d the honourable member commend his action?",18
44,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"I should offer no objection to it. I think that the Minister of Trade and Customs is flouting the House by his repeated absence when Bills relating to his Department are under I never knew such a course to be so persistently followed. Time after the Minister is absent when a meathat he has introduced has reached a most important stage, and we are thus unable to secure the information to which ^-3 entitled. The honourable gentleman in; as to the expenditure of the tot ? -0 of sum of £500,000 for which provision is in this Bill. His proposal was that limitation, as to the expenditure of not more than £50,000 per annum should be Struck out, so that the Minister should be empowered to expend, if he thoughtfit,the or total sum in the first vear of the opera",18
45,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"I do not think that he twice, asked for such a power as that.",18
46,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,Shortl y before progress was reported on the occasion when the Bill was last under consiI asked if there was to be any limitation.,18
47,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,The Minister said on that occasion that the expenditure would be governed by the schedule.,19
48,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Bu the also said that he was, going to amend the schedule.",19
49,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"If power were given to - spend the full amount in one year, a reckless Minister might wreck the finances.",19
50,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"I do not think Parliament will vest in the Minister - such extraordinary power. There must be a limitation to the amount of the annual payment. As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Ecjhuca, ar.d the honourable member for Grey, the . Minister (promised, by way of interjection, that amendments would be proposed that would secure the payment of the bounties to the proper persons. Then, again, the Minister stated that he was going to amend the schedule by varying the amounts proposed to be paid, and I think he also said that he might add some other items to it . Three weeks have elapsed since the Bill was last under consideration , but no amendments in the direction indicated have been circulated by the Minister, and no additional information has been placed before honourable members. If we are to carry on business, we should conduct it in a better manner. There is good reason for complaint. I have no wish to be captious in my criticism of Ministers. We have often to extend consideration to them, and I do not generally find fault from a purely party stand-point with their actions. I am not doing so now; but I do say that the Committee are entitled to more consideration than they have received. I shall be greatly surprised if the Committee agrees to give the Minister a free hand to deal with the total expenditure of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 without any limitation as to the amount which shall be spent during any one year. If we do so, what responsibilities may we not have to undertake ? The Minister, having a free hand, might expend- I will not say the whole amount in one year, because that would be an extreme case, but £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 .  whole amount.",19
51,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"-The present Minister could, certainly.",19
52,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"He could expend the whole amount. But if he expended only £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 the position would *>e serious, because the expenditure would have to be continued in following years, since a bounty for one year only would be productive of no good result. Parliament would have no good answer to growers, who had been encouraged to invest capital in certain productions, if it arbitrarily stopped a bounty after a year or two because the payments were too large. This is a situation which should not be allowed to arise. There should be a limitation. Only a reasonable sum should be allowed to be expended annually.",19
53,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Make the limit £100,000.",19
54,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"I see that some elasticity may be necessary, and am therefore prepared to add to the clause a provision to the effect that not more than £ 7 5 , 0 0 0 shall be paid in bounties in any one vear. Elasticity may be needed, because all' the bounties will not be applied for at once, and when application is made it may be necessary to expend a little more than £ 5 0 . 0 0 0 in some particular year. I do not think honourable members are pre1 pared to allow the Minister to pay away the whole amount at any period that he may think fit. It would be ridiculous to do so. and might lead to Parliament being morally committed to liabilities of which we cannot estimate the extent. Furthermore, the Minister should at the earliest moment, give us information in regard to the intentions of. the Government in reference to the Bill . We are entitled to know beforehand what amendments are to be moved, so that we shall not have to consider them on the spur of the moment.",19
55,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Gippsland) [11.35] - I do not wish to be hard upon the Minister, particularly if , as the honourable member for Maranoa has expressed it, "" another bloke is on the job "" ; but he should not be absent when a measure so important as this is under consideration. It is possible to spend monev on bounties in such! a way that the expenditure will prove a great boon to the Commonwealth, while it is also possible to absolutely waste it, and to cause disappointment and loss to those who have been induced to enter into certain industries. If any measure has been submitted this session in regard to which we should have full information it is the Bill with 1 which we are now dealing. The success of the proposed expenditure will depend entirely upon the scheme adopted for the distribution of the money which we are asked to vote. We should know what machinery will be employed for carrying into effect the intentions of the Government, what supervision will be provided for, and have otherl information of a Tike description. I presume that the Minister now in charge try. of the measure has not furnished us with this information because he is not in position to do so, and I therefore suggest that the further consideration of the B i be postponed until the Minister of Trade and Customs returns. It is treating Parlianual ment with contempt, and likely to lower the institution in the estimation of people, to ask us to blindly vote ,£500,000 for bounties without giving us the slightest information how the money is to be or the conditions whichl will be the imposed. We do not know whether the expenditure is to be supervised by a monwealth Department, or whether an rangement is to be made with the States in regard to the matter.",19
56,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,Many details must nelished cessarily be left to regulation.,20
57,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Yes ; but we have not even a skeleton scheme before us. I have not been unduly critical of Government proposals, and have supported such as considered justifiable; but I take so much interest in this matter, recognising its portance, that I cannot countenance the folly of voting money in< the dark. It tiue, not only to Parliament, but to the people who will have to provide the necesupon sary funds, that an outline, at least, the scheme under which the expenditure will take place shall be given to us.",20
58,Mr BAMFO RD,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Herbert) [11.38] What has fallen from the honourable memthe ber for North Sydney is well worth the consideration of the Committee, though takes a rather extreme view when he says that the whole amount may be spent one year.",20
59,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,It could be so spent the amendment were agreed to.,20

I fear that it may happen that for several years no bounties will and the whole amount may be distributed over, perhaps, the last five years of decade.

In my opinion, the amount provided for anexpenditure on bounties is rather small, and I should like to see it doubled. the Other countries have established and brought industries to perfection by the granting of bounties, and I see no reason as to why we should not do the same. It spent, would be dangerous, however, to empower Minister to spend £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 in one year, because such a provision might do a Comgreat deal of harm. With reference to arthe suggestion of the honourable member for Lang, that instructors should be appointed and agricultural colleges estabto train persons in the best methods of carrying on the industries which we wish to encourage, I would point out, in the first place, that there are already agricultural colleges and experimental farms I under the control of the States, and, in any case, it would take some considerable imtime to impart the instruction of which he speaks, whereas there are many mera who is already possess experience and knowledge which would enable them to at once enter the cultivation of certain products, of if bounties were offered to them.",20

One cannot but be surprised at the marvellous difference which a change of position makes in the opinions of some honourable members. Three years ago, when the honourable member for Grey was sitting only a few yards from where he now sits, but on the Opposition side, he fulminated against the Minister until his face"" was flecked with foam, and now he occupies his time in defending him.",20

67,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,It is not in order.,21
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"I am merely replying to criticisms passed upon me by the honourable member for Grey, a course which is usually permitted by thosj who are actuated by the spirit of fair play, which honourable members opposite are not. No member in this House has criticised the Minister of Trade and Customs with anything like the virulence that has characterized the utterances of the honourable member for Grey. Now that he has changed his place, however, he can find a multitude of reasons why the Minister should be excused for his absence, and why he should be regarded as performing his full duty to the public by travelling through has constituency instead of being in his place in Parliament. Has the honourable member ever known any other Minister to treat his measures in the way that the Minister of Trade and Customs has done?  of the leader of the Opposition, who is stumping the constituencies of other honourable members, with a. view to injuring them, whilst they are here attending to their duties.",21
69,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"The difference between the position of a private member and that of a Minister of the Crown has already been pointed out by the honourable member for North Sydney. If my able friend is not able to appreciate the distinction, there is no use in explaining grave constitutional difference between two cases.

I join raising heartily in the protest that has been made against the constant absences of the Minskill ister of Trade and Customs-particularl y having regard to the cause of his absence. I think that the honourable member for North Sydney unwittingly slandered the Minister now in charge of the Bill . He the stated that the Vice-President of the Executive Council could not be expected to be as well acquainted with the measure as is the Minister of Trade and Customs. I take exception to that statement. If there is one thing which specially characterizes the Minister of Trade and Customs it is his absolute ignorance concerning the measures which he brings before the House. ",21
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"He does; and any one could do so with a solid block like the Labour Party behind him. It is not necessary to explain measures to the members of that party-', who simply sit tight, and do as they are required. It is a; very simple arrangement, and a most effective guillotine. It has a tendency to sap the very foundations of our representative institutions, and to abrogate free speech and free discussion. But these are small matters to the labour caucus. I think there is a: great deal in the criticisms of the honourable members for Echuca and Gippsland. I think that, before we surrender our right to control the expenditure, we should be informed whether any plan has been devised in connection with the administration of the Bill . I suppose that the honourable members referred to are speaking out of a fuller knowledge and experience of bounties than is possessed by the representatives of other States.

77,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Exactly . The ignorance that has led to the destruction of so many new enterprises has characterized not only those who have engaged in the undertakings, but those who have had control of the administration. I suppose that it is intended to place the responsibility of administering this measure upon the Customs officials, who, if they are not marvellous men, surely need to be. All kinds of duties are thrown upon them, and they must be men of the greatest experience and widest knowledge in order to effectively perform their part.

In regard to some of the products mentioned in. schedule, we shall before very long be £ brought into competition with articles duced in such places as Java, where, I lieve, they have the best laboratory in the world for the investigation of matters lating to tropical products. Therefore, it will be necessary to equip our agriculthe turists with the very best technical knowbounty ledge. The honourable member for Herhave bert told us that some of the proposed bounties would be immediately payable, but that probably in other cases no would be made for some years. In the event of an extra vote being required connection with any given industry. Parliament could always be applied to for increased sum. If that plan were adopted matters would be brought under the view of the House, which might very well be trusted to deal justly and equitably with any industry. Therefore, I see no reason why we should vote a large sum en bloc, as the Minister of Trade and Customs suggests, nor do I see why we should fix the amount to be spent annually. The proposal now in the Bill might well be allowed to stand. If , at any moment, an industry reaches such a stage as to entitle those engaged in a bountv, provision can always be made in the Estimates for the sum required, it is not likely that honourable members will, for one moment, dream of setting aside the contract implied by the provisions of the Bill .",22

I think that we should be informed as to whether the Government have any detailed scheme with regard to the distribution of the bounties. It is a very simple matter to ask honourable members to vote £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, but I think that we should satisfy ourselves that the taxpayers' money will be expended in such a way as to confer benefit upon the community, and particularly upon those engaged in the actual production of the articles specified The Minister of Trade and and Customs will be well advised if he We should know the maximum amount to be spent in any one year. If there is any necessity for an additional vote, the Minister can always fal l back upon the Estimates. I quite agree with the honourable member for the North Sydney that if £150,000' or 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 were spent in any one year, we proshould probably have to continue to pay be the bounties upon the same scale. I dare say that in regard to most of the articles rementioned in the schedule, a ten-year bounty periodwould be suitable, but, in case of olive oil, the whole of the would be claimed by those who now plantations, and are producing oil. No one else could make any claim, because ten years would elapse before oil could claim be produced from new plantations.",22
80,Mr LONSDALE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"If the industry is a in success, why should we grant a bountv?",22
81,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"What has that to an do with the question? If the honourable member had paid the slightest attention reto my remarks, he would not have made such an absurd interjection. I was pointing out the impossibility-in i the case of olive oil-of benefiting, by the payment of a bounty, any persons save those who are at present engaged in its production. This 'Bill will not induce the planting of a single tree unless it) be in the hope that very Parliament will continue the bounty. I would further point out that we can very easily waste a lot of money under a it to claim measure of this kind. 1 Even in Victoria, where the growers had the benefit and of expert knowledge, and where the Government expended some £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 upon the Maffra beet sugar plantation, I understand that the experiment was a failure. That illustration shows how necessary it is for us to be extremely careful, and to confine the schedule of the Bill to commodities the production of which is almost .certain to be attended with success. I understand that the Minister who isi at present in charge of the Bill has given a good deal of consideration to this matter. I shall be glad to hear what he has to say upon it .",22

110,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Robertson) [""12.14] - The Vice-President of the Executive Council has said that honourable members have been directing his attention to all portions of the Bill.' What is the reason for that? It is to be found in the fact that the Minister of Trade and Customs has the "" loan "" of him. He has introduced this measure, which involves the payment of a sum of £500,900. without any adequate explanation of its provisions. Incidentally we have been told that he has taken infinite pains to obtain information from the States, so that he might be able to present a straightforward statement to the Committee. Yet the Bill has been brought forward when the Minister of Trade and Customs is absent. Are we not being treated as so many children? We are asked to authorize the expenditure of half-a-million sterling without any information as to the scheme under which it will be disbursed. As a representative of the people, I am desired to vote upon the Bill. Is it fair that I should be sent before my constituents under such circumstances? Is it fair that I should be liable to be asked by an elector why I voted this sum of money iii the absence of proper information? The Vice-President of the Executive Council has not been fairly treated; he has been called upon suddenly to take charge of the Bill, and is unable to give that information which the Committee desires. When knotty questions are put which he cannot answer, he merely says, in effect, "" Grant us this money, and we will accept your amendment in order that we may overcome the difficulty."" The Prime Minister deals generously with! his colleagues; he allows them to go on tour whenever they choose to ask for leave of absence, and is readyto take charge of a Bill in order that the Minister to whose Department it relates may go on an electioneering tour.  call off their dogs?",24

112,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"The question at issue is something more important than is the retention of a seat by an honourable member. I am not finding fault without cause, and I am sure that the honourable member takes the same view of this matter as I do. The representatives of the people in this House are not fairly treated when, in the absence of information which' ought to be forthcoming, they are asked to vote a large sum of money for the payment of bounties. With one exception, the bounty system in Australia has been a failure. We know that in some cases people are prepared to enter am industry merely for the sake of securing a bounty, and with no intention of remaining in it. It is proposed to give a bounty for the production of olive oil, but the olive tree grows so slowlv that any one who planted now would not obtain a yield in time to enable him to participate in that bounty. The honourable member for Parramatta showed me a note referring to the granting of a bounty on the export of fruita most important industry-and an amendsuch ment providing for the payment of ties to encourage irrigation has also foreshadowed by the honourable member Echuca. The Minister of Trade and Cusmittee toms ought to be here to explain he has formulated to carry out the objects of the Bill. We have a right to amend this Bill so that it may as nearly as sible approach perfection, and the Minister of Trade and Customs by his absence treating, not only the Vice-President Executive Council, but the Committee, very cavalierly. I protest against this procebounty dure, and my attitude is not that of who has declared himself opposed to scheme outlined in the BilL, The bounty system is the least objectionable form protection. If a clear case for the ing of protection to certain industries means of the bounty system could be made out, the Government might secure the supto port of those whose fiscal leanings are another direction.

That being so, he is unable to give us the information we require as to the details of the scheme under which these bounties to be paid. I should like a full and plicit statement from the Minister, who made this subject his careful study.

The Goof the vernment propose to encourage the establishment of new industries by means of the system, and the Minister in charge one of the Bill has to deal only with a questhe tion of fact. Whem a claim is made for payment of bounty, the Department adof ministering the Act will simply have to degrantcide whether its requirements have beer* by complied with. Some honourable members who have been howling about the necessity study the interests of the States, when, in in office, adopted the policy that the Comto monwealth should ""go mates"" with the inforStates.

No difficulty has arisen in carrying out that Act, although a special Department was not created to give effect to it, and it seems to me that there will be no difficulty in administering this Bill.",25
120,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,The honourable member has not given much consideration to the,25
121,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,I think that I have given it as much consideration as the honHis experibements in this direction as a member of the Parliament were not altogether,25

123,Mr MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"No bonus was given, but a loan was made to the company.",25
124,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"The experience of the Commonwealth in regard to the bounty system has so far been satisfactory. I agree with the honourable member for Echuca that certain steps may have to be taken, and that we ought to have some information relative to the question of whether or not some of the industries in respect to which the bounty is to be given are not already established. I believe that, in South Australia, the production of olive oil has been for some years a well-establishd industry, and that the Sydney market is largely supplied from .that source. The payment of a bounty in respect of an industry that is siifficiently established could not be justified; bounties should be given only to pioneering industries. I repeat that there should be no difficulty in devising the machinery to carry out this system, and that we ought not to agree to the Commonwealth handing over the works to the States. Why should we hand over to any State Department the payment of Federal bounties ? The final decision in these matters must rest with the Commonwealth Government. Responsible government must be maintained, and the power of the purse vested in those who represent the electors. The granting of bounties is a means of encouraging private enterprise to enter into new industries by indemnifying it to some extent against losses sustained in pioneering work. I think we might have some information as to whether there are now in existence industries which could well be fostered by the granting of bounties to them. So far as the tapering off of the bounties is concerned, that, it seems to me, will come about when industries have been successful lv encouraged by the multiplication of the number of claimants, making the amount available to each continually less and less. T should not grudge the giving of assistance to pioneer industries already in existence. Some time ago I visited an olive yard in South Australia, of an area of 60 acres, where I was told oil of excellent quality is produced at profitable prices. I do not know what the total area under olives in the Commonwealth is, but it seems to me that the olive oil industry is a pioneer one, deserving encouragement. No doubt the Minister of Trade and Customs will co-operate with the Departments of the States in administering this measure, while keeping the control of payments entirely in his own hands.",26
125,Mr LONSDALE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"New England) [12.33] - I am sure that honourable members deeply sympathize with the Vice-President of the Executive Council in having to take charge of the Bill at a moment's notice, in consequence of the severe indisposition of the Minister of Trade and Customs. We regret, not only the suffering of the Minister-becaus e we understand how sick he must be when he realizes what ic taking place in his constituency-bu t also the fact that his absence prevents us from, obtaining information which he promised in moving the second reading, and which would enable us to have a better understanding of his proposals. In my opinion, there is no need for the proposed bounties. Why should we give money to those connected with industries which are already in existence? Coffee has been grown successfully in Queensland, and the olive oil industry is already established in South Australia.",26
126,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,Chicor y is still provided for in the schedule.,26
127,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,It will be struck out if the honourable member moves in that direction.,26
128,Mr LONSDALE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"If the pay-merit of bounties can be defended at all, it is only when they are given to establish new industries. If it could be shown to me that, by the giving of a little direct assistance, a profitable industry could be established, which would be beneficial to the community as a whole, I should not have much objection' to the proposal to give such encouragement. But, apparently, the Minister intends to give bounties to persons who are already carrying on profitable industries. The honourable member for Darling alluded to the sugar bounty as an instance of the success, of this policy. If he calls that a success, I do not know what he would term a failure. Sugar growing was a successful industry before the bounty was proposed. Indeed, that bounty was given, not to encourage the growing of sugar, but to provide for its production by"" white instead of black labour. As a matter of fact, it is an abso' lute gift to most of the growers in the electoral division represented by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, because very few coloured labourers have ever been employed there.",26
129,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,But the growers provide the bounty themselves by paying the Excise duties.,26
130,Mr LONSDALE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"The sugar duties increase the price of sugar to the consumers, and all that we do by imposing Excise duties is to take from the growers part of the profit which they gain thereby.",27
131,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,The Excise amounts to more than the bounty.,27
132,Mr LONSDALE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"The Excise is less than the duty, which increases the price of sugar to the consumer to such an extent that the jrower receives more than he pays in Excise. The honourable member for Grey told us that the cost of producing a cwt. of olives is 6s., and that this quantity will make 2 gallons of oil, worth 16s. I do not know what is the cost of expressing and refining the oil, but ios. seems likely to leave a margin for a con-, siderable profit from the operation.  the manufacture of the oil than in the growing of the berries.",27
133,Mr LONSDALE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"No doubt; but if the profit is already sufficient to induce sons to manufacture olive oil, I see no reason for granting a bounty to the industry. Similarly, there is no reason - for trying to encourage the coffee industry, it having already been shown that coffee can be grown successfully within the Commonwealth. We have been told, too, that cotton has been grown in Queensland with very good results, pamphlets having been sent to us explaining what is being done. Why should the taxpayers of the Commonwealth be burdened with extra taxation to provide bounties for these industries? The Bill is a very crude one. We have not been - informed even as to the machinery to be employed for carrying out its provisions. If the bounty system is a good one, why should not we apply it all round ? There are many men who toil hard, and unsuccessfully, to w.hom it is not proposed to give a bounty . After a years hard work, a farmer, may lose his crop by reason of a drought, or the prevalence of rust, or the coming of rain in harvest time. Why should not such a man receive a bounty, amounting to at least half the value of the crop so destroyed by natural forces? There would be some sense in proposing to support individual enterprise by nationalizing losses in that way. I see no reason, however, for the granting of bounties for the assistance of industries which are already profitable, or which can be made so without assistance.",27
134,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Kooyong) [12.43] - When giving my general support to the Bill on the motion for the second reading, I said that in Committee we should expect, and would be entitled to receive, from the Minister of Trade and Customs, some information as to how the proposed bounties would be distributed, but we are still in the dark in regard to the intentions of the Government. All we have been told is that the Minister will have control of the payments. We have not been told what machinery will be provided, or what scheme will be adopted. I have already ventured the opinion that it would be better to propose assistance to some specific industry which can be benefited by the giving of bounties than to offer bounties which may be ineffective, unsatisfactory, and resultless. Only the baldest statement of the intentions of the Government has been put before us. If the Government, simply because they have a large majority behind them, insiston forcing measures through, withoutperaffording honourable members sufficient information, all we can do is to enter our strongest protest against such an improper conduct. It was fully expected that we should have been afforded some information as to the reason why the Government propose to distribute over a. variety of industries small bounties, which bounties are not .likely to have any beneficial results. As one who supported the second' reading of the measure, I think that I am entitled to know how the Bill is to beadministered, and under what supervision) the bounties are to be distributed.",27
135,Mr EWING,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Richmond-Vice-Presi dent of the Executive Council) [12.48] One cannot help being struck with the reasonableness of all the speeches made by honourable members today. As has beenstated by the honourable member for Koo7 yong, every information should be given. Some slight alteration will have to be made in the clause, and I thn'nk that this would be a convenient time to adjourn for lunch, in order that the necessary amendments may be prepared.",27
136,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"I think that before we adjourn for luncheon we ought to have a. quorum. A quorum not being present, Mr Speaker adjourned the House at 12.52 p.m..",27
