2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Citizen Forces: Long Service and Good Conduct The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble Petition of the undersigned members and ex-members of the Citizens Forces of Australia respectfully showeth: (1) On 14th February, 1975, the then Australian Government deprived the Officers and men of the Australian Citizen Naval Military and Air Forces of the distinctive and historic Decorations and Medals for long service and good conduct, namely the Reserve Decoration, the Efficiency Decoration, the Air Efficiency Award, the Efficiency Medal and Long Service and Good Conduct Medals, awarded for long and meritorious voluntary service in the Citizen forces. (2) The proposed substitution of the Nauonal Medal for these Decorations and Medals varies the principle of selective recognition of efficient forces in that it recognizes the period of service only and embraces also full time service as well in the defence forces as in the police, fire brigade and ambulance services. (3) This deprivation caused and is continuing to cause serious discontent amongst personnel of the Citizens Forces who willingly and cheerfully give of thenspare time outside their normal full time civilian careers, to serve Her Majesty and Australia. (4) The Reserve Forces of by the present Government as a valuable-and costeffective-componen t of the Defence Forces. Anomalously, whUst the Government is actually supporting recruiting for these Forces it has imposed and continued this deprivation which as foresaid has depressed the morale of the Citizen Forces. (5) Her Majesty has not cancelled the said Decorations and Medals. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: Your Honourable House take appropriate acuon to resume the award of the several distinctive and historic Reserve Forces Decorations and Medals to members of the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Citizens Military Force (Army Reserve) and Citizens Air Force. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Aldred, Mr N. A. Brown, Mr Burns, Mr Robinson. Jarman and Mr Roger Johnston. Petitions received.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That because the Report of the Royal Commission on Human Relationships and especially its Recommendations(a) Have been widely condemned for it support of un-Australian, anu-famUy, anti-child behaviour and morals such as incest, promiscuity, abortion, pornography, homosexuality, prostitution and brothels, etc. (Note: Refer quotauons reverse side) (b) Have been strongly criticised by the medical profession for the absence of any medical practitioner on the PETITIONS Commission or on its staff of 31 persons, and for the Commissioners acuon in rejecting or ignoring relevant medical evidence. (c) Have been discredited as irresponsible in adopting a new definiuon of the family, i.e., 'a varying range of people living together in relationships of commitment', which has effectively confused the real meaning and intentions of the Report where it refers to the' family'. Medals Therefore the Parliament has a responsibility to the families of Australia not to adopt this controversial Report and its Recommendations. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Australian Parliament will(a) Simply receive the Report and not adopt its Recommendations, (b) Set up a Select Parliamentary Committee along the lines of the New Zealand Select Committee to conduct a public inquiry into the ways and means of supporting and strengthening family Ufe and providing adequate protection for children from physical and sexual abuse before as well as after birth in accordance with the UN.O.

Your petitioners desire to draw to the Government's attention that removal of Section No. 6469 on Health Refunds would transgress a woman's right to the rebate available via Medical Health Insurance. 2. Furthermore, as Section 6469 on Health Refunds is the Item for abortion and to remove Medical Rebate for Item No. 6469 would be penalising thousands of women.

Broadcasting and Television Programs To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That because television and radio: (a) affect our social and moral environment, (b) are fanuly media watched and heard by many children at all times, and (c) present too much explicit violence and sex, They therefore need stronger control than other media and the existing standards need national ABC., and commercial sectors.

Medibank To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we believe the Federal Government changes to the health insurance system are unjustified, costly and artificially bureaucratic. The planned abolition of bulk bUling will place an unnecessary burden on the poor and the disadvantaged in our community. The decision toreducethe rebate paid from 85 per cent to 75 per cent of the scheduled fee is an attack on real wages.

3,Mr HAYDEN,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION,"I ask the Minister for Finance: Has he at any stage been asked by the Prime Minister or anyone else to write a letter declaring that certain evidence he gave to the MCGregor Royal Commission was faulty because it was based on an uncertain memory? If so, what was the Minister's response to this highly improper request?",20
4,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION,"No one has ever suggested to me that my testimony be altered in any way whatsoever. NA AT KINGSTON, TASMANIA",20
5,Mr HODGMAN,CONSTRUCTION OF ANTARCTIC BASE,"I ask the Minister for Construction: Is it correct that tenders have now been called for the $8m Antarctic Base to be constructed at Kingston, Tasmania? Will tenders close on 12 September? Will the said construction of the Antarctic Base employ directly and indirectly between 150 and 200 people between now and 1980? Will the Minister make an official Foreign Aid visit to the site as soon as construction commences?",20
6,Mr MCLEAY,CONSTRUCTION OF ANTARCTIC BASE,"The answer to the first three parts of the question is yes. As to the last part, yes, I would like very much to be invited to come down there. Mr Lynch-In the next couple of days. While the House is sitting.",20
7,Mr MCLEAY,CONSTRUCTION OF ANTARCTIC BASE,"It has been suggested, Mr Speaker, that I should go while the House is sitting. The position is that the tender will be let in, I think, October. The time of construction will be approximately 2 years for the stores complex and just over 2 years for the administration building, and the laboratory should be completed in April 1981. I understand that there have been some suggestions in the Press in Tasmania this morning that the job has been deferred. I say that is simply untrue. Suggestions that it has been deferred or that only some nominal amount of a few thousand dollars will be spent on it are untrue. I expect that this financial year probably about $3m will be spent on the project. At this moment I would hke also to make the point that total Commonwealth funds for Tasmania this year have been increased from $479m to $502m and that the untied funds have been increased from $315m to $34lm, which is an increase of 8V4 per cent. This is at a time when the rate of inflation is running at 7.9 per cent. If one thinks ahead to next year when the rate of inflation will be running at 5 per cent, one can see that that is a INQUIRY very significant increase to Tasmania. In conclusion, I mention that the amount of Commonwealth funds spent on construction in Tasmania this year will be about $9m. Last year about $4m was spent, so that in itself is a significant increase. I also acknowledge the work of the honourable member for Denison and other honourable members from Tasmania whose persuasion had something to do with this appropriation. NA NA",20
8,Mr HAYDEN,INQUIRY,Is the Prime Minister aware of a report published in the Bulletin today claiming that he asked his colleague the Minister for Finance to state in writing that certain evidence the Minister had given to the MCGregor Royal Commission was unsound because it was based on uncertain memory? Did this evidence relate to a meeung in the office of the Prime Minister on 17 January at which certain matters which the Prime Minister can no longer remember were discussed with Senator Withers? Will the Prime Minister defend himself against this grave accusation?,20
9,Mr MALCOM FRASER,INQUIRY,Everything that needed to be said on this subject was said yesterday. NA NA,21
10,Mr RUDDOCK,ABORIGINAL COMMUNITIES,I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs whether there has been any result yet from the legal action brought in Queensland by the chairmen and the shire councils of Aurukun and Mornington Island?,21
11,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL COMMUNITIES,I am able to inform the honourable member that shortly before I came into the chamber I was advised that a judge of the Queensland Supreme Court this morning granted an interim injunction to each of the Aurukun and Mornington Island councils restraining the Administrator of Queensland from proceeding with a dissolution of the two councils and the appointment of an administrator. NA NA,21
12,Mr HAYDEN,INQUIRY,I direct a question to the consumers Prime Minister. Was a letter delivered to the On Prime Minister's,21
13,Unknown,INQUIRY,Honourable members interjecting,21
14,Mr SPEAKER,INQUIRY,Order! The Leader of the Opthe position will resume his seat. Honourable gentlemen will realise how difficult it is to at the table if there are interjections. I ask the Leader of the Opposition be his question in silence and I suggest that whoever is answering the question might likewise answer in silence.,21
15,Mr HAYDEN,INQUIRY,I ask the Prime Minister: Was a letter delivered to the Prime Minister's office last Friday by a member of the staff of the Bulletin! Did the letter ask whether the Prime Minister had requested the Minister for Finance last week to write him a letter saying that the scheme now. Minister's evidence to the MCGregor Royal Commission about events on 17 January was not 'a perfect recollection because it was based on uncertain memory'? I ask: Why did the Prime Minister fail to reply to that letter before publito cation of this most serious allegation in today's issue of the Bulletin!,21
16,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INQUIRY,I am interested to know that the Leader of the Opposition has turned into an agent for the newspapers. NA NA,21
17,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL SCHEME,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. The impUcations of increased fuel prices for country people, particularly those involved in essential transport services and productive industry, are serious. This applies particularly to people",21
18,Mr SPEAKER,DIFFERENTIAL SCHEME,Order! The honourable member will ask his question and cease giving information.,21
19,Mr FISHER,DIFFERENTIAL SCHEME,"Yes, Mr Speaker. Can the Minister indicate when the second stage of our fuel freight subsidy differential scheme will be introduced so that the impact of our policies to conserve vital energy resources will not bear unfahly on rural activity?",21
20,Mr FIFE,DIFFERENTIAL SCHEME,"In answer to the question asked by the honourable member for Mallee, I would remind the House that the first stage of the Government's policy in relation to the fuel freight subsidy scheme applied throughout Australia as from 1 July this year. It is important to keep in mind that some States were in a position to pass on this very beneficial subsidy to the within their States well before 1 July. a national basis it has applied since 1 July this year. It will be recalled also that the Government indicated that the full scheme would be implemented during the life of the present Parliament. No decision has been taken as to when second stage will be introduced but I want to assure the honourable member for Mallee and speak other honourable members that the matter will that be kept under review and will be implemented as allowed to ask soon as possible. The scheme provides for a subsidy on the freight component of petroleum products. So far as petrol is concerned, the freight component of its cost throughout Australia will not be more than 4c per gallon as from now. This is a very beneficial subsidy scheme. People living or travelling in remote areas are benefiting from the NA NA",21
21,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,INQUIRY,I direct my question the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services. I refer the Minister to the political analysis of the Queensland distribution prepared by the Chief Australian Electoral Officer and tendered as an exhibit in evidence to the MCGregor Royal Commission. Will the Minister arrange to table later today this and all other similar research papers analysing the distribution proposals of the other five States which were sent to the Chairman of each Distribution Commission?,21
22,Mr VINER,INQUIRY,"With regard to the Queensland distribution, that material was before the Royal Commissioner. I will refer to the Minister honourable member's request to table other such analyses and report to the honourable member. PAPUA NEW GUINEA-INDONESIA",22
23,Mr NEIL,INQUIRY,"I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Has the Minister read reports of incidents on the Papua New Guinearepresented Indonesia border? What are the facts regarding these incidents and what is the Government's attitude towards them?  attitude obviously is to have a positive and ation Office. understandable interest in the maintenance and development of good relations between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. We would be concerned to see them impaired by problems relatBusiness ing to the border between the two countries. The Austrahan missions in both countries have been instructed to keep in close contact with both governments to encourage consultation and understanding between them. The Indonesian response has been to stress the good relations has with Papua New Guinea as well as the portance it attaches to them, and Prime Minister Somare has indicated that Papua New Guinea will continue to maintain a dialogue with Indonesian authorities over the border. The tralian Government naturally welcomes these will indications. In regard to speculation and reports on the matter, it is of interest to note that Mr Somare when addressing the Papua New ference Guinea Parhament on 14 August about the people border situation emphasised 'that far too much being made of the whole issue'. Those are his words, not mine. While we have not been in position to check the accuracy of all the media ports which have appeared on this matter in cent weeks, it appears that some of them may have been somewhat exaggerated. Quoting Prime Minister Somare again, because this is matter related to his own country, he also said the Papua New Guinea Parliament on 14 conference August: This country's security has never been greatly threatened nor is our security seriously threatened now. NA",22
24,Mr WILLIS,BUDGET DEFICIT,Has the Treasurer seen reports alleging that the blow-out of last year's Budget deficit by 50 per cent above the estimated level resulted from either gross miscalculation of the key Budget variables or the deliberate falsification of the Budgetfiguresso as to improve the acceptability of the Budget and disguise the revenue impact of politically motivated tax cuts? the Can the Treasurer advise the House which of these explanations is correct? Is he able to assure the House that the estimates contained in this year's Budget are more reliable than they were last year? BORDER Mr HOWARD-The answer to the first part of the question is yes. Last year's deficit did blow out to the order of about 50 per cent. That an error of 4 per cent in relation to revenue of about $25 billion. I do not think it profits anybody to try to apportion blame. I and the Government have confidence in the integrity of the advice that we receive from the Department of the Treasury and the Australian TaxNA,22
25,Mr GOODLUCK,PETROL PRICES,"Is the Minister for and Consumer Affairs aware that there is a grave disparity in the price or petrol sold to consumers throughout Australia even taking into consideration the recent fuel subsidy plan? Will he advise the House when he will announce the findings of the oil industry conference, it specifically those relating to the marketing and impricing of petroleum products in Australia?",22
26,Mr FIFE,PETROL PRICES,"I am aware of the disparity in fuel prices throughout Australia referred to by the the honourable member for Franklin. The honourAusable member and other members of this House be aware that early this year, as a result of an undertaking given by the Prime Minister prior to the last election, I convened an oil industry conwhich was attended by a large number of from all sections of the oil industry, and is particularly by service station proprietors who have been hard hit in recenttimesby marketing a conditions within the industry. The conference remet in three sessions and as a result reports were reprepared indicating areas where agreement had been reached between the parties and also areas where agreement had not been reached. The rea ports of the conference are now public docuin ments. The position that was arrived at by that is being considered by the Government. I have prepared a detailed submission on all the representations that were made and discussions that took place at that conference. I hope that within the very near future it will be possible for Cabinet to give consideration to that document and to my recommendations, following which of course Government decisions will be announced. NA",22
27,Mr SCHOLES,PEACEKEEPING FORCE IN NAMIBIA,"I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs: Has a formal request been received from the United Nations for the provision of support troops for a United Nations peacekeeping force in Namibia? If so, has the Government responded to the request, and in what terms?  that a formal request has not been received. The United Nations Secretariat has made an informal inquiry as to whether Australia could provide elements of an integrated logistics unit for the proposed United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia, to be known as UNTAG. This group, which is provided for in the proposals of thefiveWestern members of the Security Council for a peaceful transition to majority rule in Namibia, would have civilian and military components. Its central task would be to make sure that conditions are established to allow free and fair elections in an impartial toral process. I stress that no formal request has yet been received. The inquiry obviously raises a number of issues that will require the closest examination by the Government. The Government is currently considering all evant to a possible Australian contribution. However, further details",23
28,Mr HOLDING,PEACEKEEPING FORCE IN NAMIBIA,"Sen d Reg Withers; he can help them out.  honourable member for Melbourne Ports will have to be a Uttle more precise and a Uttle heavier than that; otherwise he will be destined for the same fate as he was in Victoria. Further detaUs of the proposed deployment and methods of operation of the force and its Ukely mandate will be required before a final decision can be taken, and these detaUs will not be avaUable until the Secretary-General's representative concludes the investigation that he is currently undertaking in Namibia. AUSTRALIAN TOURIST COMMISSION: NA",23
29,Mr JULL,INCREASE IN BUDGET ALLOCATION,The Mmister for Industry and Commerce will be aware of the welcome reaction from the travel industry to the increase in funds for the Australian Tourist Commission in the Budget. Can the Minister tell the House whether the ATC staff level will be held at the present numbers? Will the increase be used for domestic as well as overseas promotion? What is being done to improve statistical help for the tourist industry?,23
30,Mr LYNCH,INCREASE IN BUDGET ALLOCATION,"The Government is determined to encourage development of the tourist industry, and one of the reflections of this encouragement and the Government's recognition of the great significance of the tourist industry to Australia has been the increase in the Australian Tourist Commission's appropriation from $3.1m to $4.24m thisfinancialyear. This increase in funds will enable the Commission almost to double its expenditure on marketing activities and to undertake increased market research. The lift in the ATC's appropriation is very significant. It is the most significant lift in funding for the ATC in any year since it was established. Funds also have been provided in the Budget for the Bureau of Industry Economics to commence a detailed study of the economic significance of tourism in Australia. The funds provided to the ATC will not be appUed to domestic tourism which traditionally has been regarded as the province of the State governments. They will be utilised to seek to bring more travellers to elecAustraUa. To round out the question, I mention that the Government has accepted in principle the application of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme to the tourist industry and details of that, I expect, will be before the the factors rel- Government shortly. NA NA",23
31,Mr HAYDEN,INQUIRY,"I ask a question of you, Mr Speaker. You would have noted the information given to this House by the Minister for Finance yesterday that he stood by his evidence to the MCGregor Royal Commission. I draw your attention to an article in today's issue of the Bulletin headlined 'Robinson's memory faces a test', which claims that the Prime Minister requested the Minister for Finance to write a letter casting doubt on the accuracy of his evidence to the Royal Commission. In view of answers given on this matter earlier today, I ask you, Mr Speaker, if you will consider the question of whether a prima facie case exists for breach of privilege in that improper pressure",23
32,Mr SINCLAIR,INQUIRY,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. If the honourable gentleman's question concerns a matter of privUege, I suggest to him that it should have been canvassed immediately after the last question was responded to; if not, it should have been raised at the beginning of the proceedings today. The whole question of privilege in this place traditionally has relied on the immediacy of the matter being raised in the Parliament. I would suggest therefore that this is not really a matter of privilege; it is a matter of pohtical opportunism. For that reason I beheve that it should be dismissed.",23
33,Mr SPEAKER,INQUIRY,I will hear the completion of the question before I rule.,24
34,Mr HAYDEN,INQUIRY,"I will complete the question. In view of answers given earlier today on this matter, I ask you, Mr Speaker, whether you will consider the question of whether a prima facie case exists for breach of privilege in that improper pressure may have been used to influence the Minister for Finance in the performance ofhis parliamentary duties. am asking you, Mr Speaker, whether you will consider this matter. I think it is quite a reasonlight able proposition.",24
35,Mr SPEAKER,INQUIRY,"The way in which the early 1979? honourable gendeman has brought up this matter is unusual in the sense that when I called him I thought he wanted to ask a question but he raised a matter of privilege. I will consider the matter of privilege and rule on it. I remind the honourable gendeman that the point made by the the Leader of the House is correct, that is, matter of privilege must be taken up at the first available opportunity. I will consider that aspect in terms oftimeand I will consider the question of whether the issue of privilege arises.",24
36,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INQUIRY,"On that matter, Mr Speaker, I had thought that the Leader of the Opposition would have understood the meaning of the reply given by the Minister for Finance. Let me say only that, so far as any that I may have is concerned, the reply of the Minister for Finance is completely and absolutely accurate.",24
37,Mr HAYDEN,INQUIRY,"Mr Speaker, perhaps I could spond to that. The Minister for Finance said no one asked him to alter his testimony, which completely different from being asked to suggest that his memory was hazy.",24
38,Mr SPEAKER,INQUIRY,"Order! The honourable where gentleman will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition has raised the issue of privilege. allowed him to do so out of context in the sense that he raised the matter during Question so as not to prevent him from raising it at the first opportunity. I permitted the Prime Minister, as a matter of extending proprieties to him, to make his point. I do not wish the matter to be debated at this stage. I will rule on it later.

41,Mr YOUNG,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Does the Prime Minister recall that prior to the last election he made a statement. I that unemployment would start to fall in February and continue to fall? I now ask: In the of the Budget and the economic situation that will exist for the next year, what are the Government's _stimates for unemployment in",24
42,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I point out that the prediction I made before the last election has to this point proved to be completely and absolutely accurate. I think it is worth noting that since last election we have received additional in that a formation concerning the movements of wages and prices. Average earnings for the 12 months to June grew at a greater rate than the consumer price index. In the Government's view, if wages are to continue to grow at that rate reductions in unemployment certainly will be prejudiced. Indeed, if wages grow at an undue pace there is no possibility of getting the kind of reduction in unemployment that this Government would certainly want. I suggest that the honourable gentleknowledge man is well aware of that. The growth projections of the Government over the next year are modest but it ought to be noted that whereas over the last two to three reyears Australia's performance was better than that the average of the Organisation for Economic is Co-operation and Development countries, excluding the three major countries-that is, the United States of America, Japan and West Germany-w e are now moving into a position our performance on inflation and growth looks like being better than the average, includI ing those three countries. That is very considerably to the credit of the economic policies that Time, the Government has pursued. I suggest that the honourable gentleman could do a great service to this country and to the labour movement if he were able to persuade labour leaders to accept the view, as is certainly the case, that they have a choice in relation to wage claims. They can argue for high and irresponsible wage increases, as they now do, to the benefit of those now in employment and to the detriment of those now unemployed, or they can argue for a lesser rate of wage increase and for some degree of moderation which has not yet been seen in the wages arena, to the advantage of those who are now unemployed so that there will be a greater capacity to establish the kind of employment situation that all Austrahans and certainly this Government would want. Let me make one other point in relation to unemployment. I am prepared to concede- I doubt whether honourable gentlemen opposite would-that all members of this Parliament are concerned and have a compassion in their hearts for those who are unemployed and who want jobs. But the argument within this place is about how to overcome this problem. The Australian Labor Party says on every point: 'Spend more money. It does not matter if you have to tax for It does not matter how big the deficit is. If you do not have enough just print it and if the printing press does not have enough capacity, go and buy another printing press'. We have seen time and time again how that pohcy, when pursued by Labor in this country and when pursued by some governments overseas, has led to high inflation, higher interest rates and high and rising unemployment. Those who look to a stimulus within the tralian economy should look not just to money that might be spent by governments which they first have to take from taxpayers-if they want be honest about it-bu t they should look to other policies of government. Let me say most catStreet, egorically that the best possible stimulus that be provided for industry and for employment in this country at this time is a further moderation in the rate of inflation leading to a sustained further reduction in interest rates. Whatever critics of the Budget might say, they have in way said that the Budget will not lead to a further reduction in inflation. mates of inflation for the middle of next year are 5 per cent by June or earlier. That will put Australia's rate of inflation below that of most of the major trading countries with the exception of West Germany and, I would imagine, Japan. That will then lead to a very much improved Minister trading position for this country and for AusParty trahan industries. Consequently that must have an impact on the general employment situation. Also, with the further projections of the movement down in inflation which comes out of the nature of this Budget, the prospects for further, sustained and increasingly significant reductions in interest rates which will flow right across the whole community obviously are coming much nearer than they would otherwise be. These two factors-reducin g inflation and reducing interest rates-provid e the best possible incentive for all Australian industry, for home owners, for exporters, for farmers and for businesses, be they large or small, and that is the best course for this nation. NA NA",24
43,Mr BOURCHIER,PAID ENVELOPES,"My question is directed io the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services. Is the Minister aware of a letter that is being circulated to various councils in Victoria and, no doubt, to other States by a Councillor Healy of Fitzroy City Council on behalf of a group called Medibank Action Coit. aUtion and that this letter is being posted in a postage paid envelope restricted for the use of members of Parliament. If he is aware of this action will he undertake to call for an inquiry by the Commonwealth Police of the honourable member concerned?",25
44,Mr VINER,PAID ENVELOPES,"I thank the honourable member for his question because if his information is correct, it is most disturbing to find that an honourAusable member of this House should be using or allowing to be used parliamentary postage paid envelopes for a purpose not connected with his to own parliamentary business. I understand that the address provided by Mr Healy is 200 Lygon Melbourne. I do not think any honourable can member on our side of the House has his parliamentary office at that address. I believe that is the address of the electorate office of the honourand able member for Melbourne.

45,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS,"Does the Prime recall his assertion in last year's Liberal policy speech that his Government had, to use his words, 'taken politics out of pension increases by linking them automatically with the consumer price index'? If so, how does he reconcile this statement with his Government's decisions in last night's Budget to remove the automatic six-monthly indexation of pensions and unemployment benefits for those people without dependants?",25
46,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS,"I think the honourable gentleman is quite unaware of what has been happening. When the rate of inflation was running at 16 per cent or 17 per cent, in order to protect pensioners it was clearly necessary to index their pensions twice a year because of the rapid rate of"" inflation induced and caused quite directly by Labor policies. In those circumstances, that is what was done. But with the rate of inflation approaching the 5 per cent mark, as outlined in the Budget forecasts-wit h that objective clearly in our sights and within our reach-it is very plain that indexing pensions once a year with that level of inflation leaves pensioners much better off than indexing their pensions twice a year with Labor's rate of inflation. I hope that the honourable gentleman can understand that. NA",26

49,Mr FITZPATRICK,SALINITY CONTROL IN MURRAY,"I direct a question to the Minister for National Development and refer him to an answer he gave me on 1 June concernthe ing the Wakool irrigation area and salinity trol in the Murray River.

In view of the now very critical situation, can the Minister inform the House what urgent remedial work has been decided upon and when the remedial work will commence?",26
50,Mr NEWMAN,SALINITY CONTROL IN MURRAY,"The reply that I gave the honourable member for Riverina earlier is correct. An amount of money- I think it is about $2.6m-is allocated in the Budget for that purpose. I will be making announcements about how that money will be spent on urgent remedial work. As regards the rest of the report, I expect it to be finalised by May next year. We will be taking further action after the report is finalised. AUSTRALIA'S MOTOR NA",26
51,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,"In what way does the Minister for Industry and Commerce beheve that the Budget will assist employment prospects in Australia's motor manufacturing industry? In panicular, in what way could it affect employment opportunities in Adelaide?",26
52,Mr LYNCH,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,"I thank the honourable gentleman for his question which relates to the Budget which the Treasurer brought down last night. One of the most significant reflections of this Government's determination to provide adequate protection for manufacturing industry in Australia is the very decisive move to reduce sales tax on passenger motor vehicles from 27Vi per cent to 15 per cent. That decision has been welcomed by consumers and manufacturers alike. It certainly will serve the purpose which the honourable gentleman posed in his question. It will provide a very timely and significant MEDALS stimulus to all sections of the passenger motor industry. It wiU have substantial flow-on to the level of economic activity in genof eral. I should mention here that I think it will allow a reduction of some In per cent in the price of cars to the consumer with a consequential beneficial effect on the consumer price index. I The cost to revenue, and hence the potential to consumers, in a full year is estimated to be about $200m. The Government has a total expectation that this will be passed on in full to consumers. I have had correspondence with my RIVER colleague, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affatis, to ensure that if this action is not taken then such procedures as are available to honourable gentleman through the Prices conJustification Tribunal and the Trade Practices Act will be the subject of examination by Ministers. The action which the Government has taken brings the level of sales tax which formerly applied to passenger motor vehicles down to the level which covers light commercial vehicles. Quite apart from the significance of this to the industry, it therefore removes an anomaly which has existed for some considerable time. The whole of the industry has applauded the Government's decision. As I mentioned earlier, I think this action is a reflection of this Government's determination to provide adequate protection for manufacturing industry. BUDGET: PUBLIC RELATIONS KITS",26
53,Mr BARRY JONES,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Did the Treasurer authorise a briefing on the Budget last week for members of the Liberal Party Federal Secretariat? If so, on what basis was this briefing carried out, and on what terms and conditions? If not, can he explain how the Secretariat was able to produce by last night printed public relations kits designed, presumably, to sell this Budget to the Australian public?",27
54,Mr HOWARD,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,The answer to the first part of the question is no. I did not authorise any Budget briefing of any official-Stat e or Federal-of the Liberal Party. I give that categoric assurance to the House. Is the honourable gentleman referring to an information kit on the Budget that was available for collection from the Government Party room at 9.30 p.m.?

56,Mr BRADFIELD,HEALTH CARE COSTS,Is the Minister for Health aware of some confusion in the community regarding the newly announced subsidy covering personal medical care? Is the Minister aware that some members of this Parliament are telling people that the Government will pay only 40 per cent of medical charges or $20? Is this correct?,27
57,Mr HUNT,HEALTH CARE COSTS,"It was brought to my attention this morning that the Leader of the Opposition, either deliberately or accidently, confused the issue on an Australian Broadcasting Commission radio program by suggesting that the new universal Commonwealth medical benefit will cover only $20 for any medical service. This is absolute nonsense. He should know better than that. The new universal Commonwealth medical benefit will cover 40 per cent of the schedule fee. It will ensure that no patient will pay more than $20 for any medical service rendered by a doctor who charges the schedule medical fee. It is a lot of rubbish to suggest that the Government is trying to diddle the people, as the Leader of the Opposition has sought to make out. I repeat that in the case of a service costing, say, $100- I did say this on a radio program this morning-the Commonwealth medical benefit will cover $80 of that fee and the patient will pay $20 if he is not insured for the gap.

NA Ministerial Statement",29
94,Mr NIXON,AVIATION SAFETY IN AUSTRALIA,"by leave-As the Minister for Transport, I regard it as my duty to make a statement to the House today concerning aviadon safety in Australia. All honourable members will be aware of a number of allegations and charges made in recent weeks through the media concerning aviadon safety-allegation s and charges that have httle foundadon in fact. It is of course not necessary for me to defend Australia's air safety record which on the basis of aviation accident statistics alone is exemplary. Australia has one of the best aviation records in the world. There is a need however for me to set out the actual record of those in my Department, such as flight service officers, rank and file air traffic trollers and our highly trained pilots, and others in the aviation industry who have been denigrated by many of the recent statements and Press stories. There is also a need to reassure the people of Australia who have been caused quite unnecessary concern by these irresponsible statements. Let me say right at the beginning that it is the Government's pohcy to maintain aviation safety at the highest possible level. However, aviation safety is for experts to maintain; ticians, JournaUsts or laymen to determine. As Minister I, of course, rely upon the advice of my Department and the industry on all aviation safety matters. I never have, and will not, make arbitrary personal judgments on aviation safety matters, but will continue as always to rely on those experts in my Department and in the industry itself who can and do advise me. Let me give one example of the sort of allegation and the sort of media headline that have caused a totally incorrect picture of the level of aviation safety in Australia to be presented to the Australian people. I refer to an incident concerning two domestic airline aircraft near Brisbane on the seventh of this month. The Sydney Daily Telegraph on Monday of this week carried the headline: 'Mid Air Near Miss for Three Jets'. The story quoted a so-called departmental spokesman saying the three jets were only seconds from collision and went on to quote the Vice-President of the CivU Air Operators Association, Mr Gosling, as saying: It is a very serious incident. The Melbourne Herald carried an extravagent front page story but, so far as I can ascertain, no check was made with responsible officers in my Department. Other newspapers carried simUar stories and headUnes claiming that my Department had covered up the incident. Now let us look at the facts. An interim report by my Department indicates that there was no danger of collision between any aircraft. The incident concerned only two aircraft, not the three reported in the newspapers. The incident involved only a marginal breakdown in the standard separation of five miles. The report indicates that the aircraft were flying in the same general direction about four mUes apart instead of five and were also separated by 1,000 feet in height when the situation was recognised by the air traffic controllers themselves and appropriate action taken. What is even more disturbing is that the departmental spokesman quoted in the paper was not a departmental spokesman, a fact later acknowledged by the journalist himself. I con- would like to have incorporated in Hansard a statement. I made on this matter. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsNA An interim report by the Department of Transport's Air Safety Investigation Branch indicates that there was no danger of collision between a TAA 727 and an Ansett 727 at Brisbane last Monday. The incident involved a marginal breakdown in the standard separation of five miles, a Departmental spokesman it is not for poli- said today. The aircraft were estimated to be about four miles apart and separated by 1,000 feet in height when this situation was recognised by Air Traffic Control and appropriate action taken. Both aircraft were approaching Brisbane and were being sequenced by Air Traffic Control fbr landing at the time. A third aircraft which had been mentioned in media report was not involved in the incident. Some reports had included a statement by a so-called 'Depanmental spokesman' who was quoted as saying the margin was 'extremely dangerous' and the aircraft were 'only seconds from collision'. Both these statements were not attributable to the Department and were not the opinion of the Depanment. Canberra 14August 1978",30
95,Mr NIXON,NO DANGER OF COLLISION,"Of equal concern is a report in yesterday's Courier Mail quoting the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) saying that the Department's view of the incident appeared to conflict with information provided by, 'an air safety official' on Friday. The honourable member for Shortland was even quoted as saying that a spokesman from my office confirmed the view that the incident was a near miss and attributable to pilot error. There was no spokesman from my office, and there has been no suggestion that pilot error was involved. The honourable member for Shortland clearly does not want to believe the facts. He is prepared to say anything in order to get a headline and denigrate officers of my Department, including air traffic controllers and airline pilots. The honourable member for Shortland has made recent pubhc calls for a public enquiry into aviation safety. My statement this afternoon jects entirely the need for the expenditure of lic moneys on the undertaking of such an ensurge quiry. The honourable member for Shortland would be contributing far more to aviation safety in this country if he were to support and be constructive, rather than try to undermine the activinumber ties ofthose involved in safety matters in the ation industry. It is clearly necessary for me present the true position of aviation safety in Australia to defend our pilots, our air traffic trollers, and other officers of my department, men and women who, I believe, are doing a difficult job magnificently, maintaining our aviout, ation safety standards as perhaps the best in the world. Let me take the incidence of air accidents beginning. That our scheduled airline safety record is beyond reproach cannot be denied. dents Since 1968 there has been only one fatal accident in scheduled airline operauons. That accident occurred in 1975 with the loss of 11 Uves. The safety trend of general aviation is best estabthis lished by the consideration of accident rates, that is, the ratio of accidents to hours flown, and relatively long periods. In practice, the rates are established over each year and the preceding two years. Examination of these statistics including 1977-the most recent year of completefigures-shows an improving safety trend until about 1973 and, from then on, a relatively stable accident rate. There is no evidence to suggest that this pattern has since changed. This conclusion is in no way varied by the fact that in early July there was a series of fatal dents, two of which occurred on successive days, one causing the deaths of six people in a Melbourne suburban home. I can assure all honourable members that in putting these accidents into their proper perspective, I am not seeking in any way to diminish or gloss over tragedies. However there have been other instances of a cluster of accounts fatal accidents, of three accidents in three days, and they were in May 1978, in July 1977, back in 1969, to quote examples. These clusters do not in themselves provide any basis for conclusions about safety levels. In 1969 there was a total of236 accidents of all kinds in general aviation, that is, in operations other than airline and gliding. This occurred in a year when a total of over one million hours were flown by general aviation. In 1977-the last year of complete record-ther e were 224 accidents despite a huge increase in hours flown in general aviation in Australia to a total of nearly 1.5 million hours. The number of accidents has actuallyfluctuatedfrom 236 in 1969, to a high of 245 rein 1970 and then to a low of 182 in 1972. Yet pubduring this period there has been a dramatic upof some 42 per cent in the number of hours flown by general aviation aircraft. During this period of increasing activity the of fatal accidents in general aviation has avimoved from 16 in 1969 to 18 in 1974 and to 19 into 1977. Although there have been 17 fatal accidents out of a total of 133fixedwing accidents in congeneral aviation in the first seven months of this year it is not possible to make any meaningful comparisons with previous years. I could point for instance, that in thefirstseven months of 1974 there were 16 fatal accidents out of a total of 132. A real comparison can be made only at the end of the year when we can measure the as a total accidents against the total hours flown. What can be said is that the number of fatal acciin any one year is relatively small and certainly in terms of rate the Austrahan record compares more than favourably with the record of most other countries. One needs only to contrast record with the appalling carnage on the roads to put it into some sort of perspective. So over statistically our safety position has improved rather than deteriorated. The plain fact is there is no tangible evidence of a deterioration of aviup to and ation safety in Australia. As well as the charges in recent weeks about so-called near disasters, there have been allegations of cover-ups of aircraft incidents by my Department. Yesterday my Department made a statement which explained the incident reporting accisystem and I table a copy of that statement and seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsNA The public was being confused by recent unofficial of'near misses' of aircraft and allegations of a decline in aviation safety standards, a Department of and Transport spokesman said today. Many media reports had exaggerated the danger of incidents which were being investigated by Depanmental aviadon safety investigators. There was a well-established reponing system which encouraged operational people throughout the industry to repon incidents to enable them to be investigated in the interests of improved aviation safety. Depanmental aviation personnel were required to repon as an incident any departure from the Department's operating standards. The incident reporting system was additional to the Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) system whereby pilots were given instructions or were advised of circumstances which had a bearing on flying safety. The Depanment made available to media enquirers on request the basic details of aviation incidents, but could not comment beyond the factual circumstances while the incident was under investigation. While such incidents were always treated seriously, the degreee of actual danger was often more potential than actual. The real value of the incident reporting system lay in proper and full investigation of incidents by experienced invetigators with the aim of taking initiating action vent recurrences. Exaggerated, incorrect and emotionally-written media reports were causing unnecessary public unease. Yet Australia's aviation accident rate-and there were mUlions of aircraft movements each year-stil l remained among the world's best. The Department was nevertheless not complacent about Australia's record and continued to take steps to improve it further. The incident reporting system was a vital part of the machinery to enable this to be achieved. Canberra",30
96,Mr NIXON,AVIATION INCIDENT REPORTING AIDS SAFETY,"Essentiall y the aviation incident reporting system is an aid to safety. There are several thousand incident reports submitted to the Department each year. For instance, in 1974 there were 8,198 incidents reported, 7,051 in 1977 and 3,160 in the first seven months of this year. The majority of the reports are related to occurrences such as communications or weather problems and these reports are used essentially for monitoring effectiveness of departmental faciUties and services. Obviously my Department cannot be expected to put out a pubhc statement every time an incident is reported. When an incident occurs which does have significant safety implicauons, however, my Department provides factual information when requested to do so. I might add that the system of notification of incidents to the Department has not changed significantly in over 20 years. There is not, there has not been, and there cannot be any 'cover-up'. The fact, however, that these incidents-and I emphasise the word 'incidents'-ar e reported and fuUy investigated is indicative of the high standards we maintain. It is a well established fact that the Australian incident reporting and investigation system is one of the most comprehensive in the world. It is now being adopted as a model by some other countries. I make the important point, however, that it is implicit in that system that it attracts reports where danger or the potential for danger can be seen, however remote the real probabUities of disaster might be. The intent is that the proper investigation and reporting of these occurrences will point to lessons which can make the probabUities even more remote. The recent charges and claims orchestrated through the media would appear to be part of a campaign- a campaign designed to cause concern in the minds of the travelling public, a loss of morale of those in the safety areas of the aviation mdustry and political gain for those behind the campaign. But sadly for those concerned the campaign has no basis of fact; it is clearly not supportable. For instance, the Manager of the to pre- Australian Federation of Air Pilots, Mr Coysh-in case there is lack of knowledge of the matter by the public I point out that he is not a pilot himself, but a paid industrial officer-ha s made claims about the alleged breakdown of navigational aid facilities and used the Department's notices to airmen system, known as NOTAMS, to try to demonstrate his point. Mr Coysh's allegations were all investigated and were all rejected on the facts as providing evidence of any deterioration in the Department's 1S August 1978 safety standards. For the information of honourable members, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard two statements I issued on 14 and 18 April deaUng in detail with these allegations. Leave granted. The documents read asfollowsStatement by the Minister for Transport, the Honourable P. J. Nixon, M.P.  evening he had made a thorough investigation of all the allegations made by Mr Coysh of the Australian Federation of Air PUots concerning aviation safety yesterday. 'On the reports submitted to me by my Department today there is no basis of truth in the allegations made by the AFAP, Mr Nixon said. In releasing details concerning each of the specific allegations made by Mr Coysh, Mr Nixon said he was satisfied that all the proper procedures had been followed in rectifying and servicing navigational aids and other equipment. Tn all cases concerning the breakdown of specific navigational aid facilities there were appropriate back-up facilities available.' Mr Nixon reiterated that he would not allow air safety to be prejudiced. 'There has been no cut back in funds but rather an increase in funds for the provision and maintenance of navigational aids', Mr Nixon said. Mr Nixon said the appropriation for the maintenance of airways had risen from $Sm last year to $S.2m this year while the appropriation for capital equipment had risen from $5.5m last year to $6.4m this year. Similarly the appropriation for airport fire fighting services had risen from $920,000 last year to $ 1.9m this year. Mr Nixon pointed out this the appropriations under the Labor Government three years ago. 'Australia enjoys an air safety record unparalled throughout the world and that record will continue,' Mr Nixon said. ' Mr Coysh has done nothing by his extravagant claims to assist air safety but has merely raised unnecessary concern in the minds of the travelling public,' Mr Nixon said. Canberra 14 April 1978 See Attachment NA Item(l) Ofthe 19 NOTAM sub-items listed only 4 related to faults ing weekend. all properly categorised at category 3 because of availability of alternative aids in accordance with designed redundancy all rectified on or before 12 April in relation to 2 (Casino DME and Coffs Harbour NDB) we have no record of any NOTAM during the period in question. Both aids operated continuously during period. 3 were long term notifications of permanent withdrawal of facilities 1 (Sydney radar) was planned maintenance of part of facility over period of 2 hours no traffic handling significance 1 was correction of a chart printing error and of no significance to normal operations 2 were advisory notices in respect of new aids yet to be commissioned 2 were standing cautionary notices on aids in use but subject to long term intermittent problems such as industrial radio interference. 1 related to long term withdrawal of facility requiring major maintenance to achieve better performance 2 involved obstruction lighting at Albury discussed under item 2 1 involved short term light on radio tower for which maintenance is responsibility of owner. No significance to controlled operations. In summaiy, actual failures restored in accordance with long standing procedures; and co-sited alternative aids were available.

Statement by the Minister for Transpon, the Honourable P. J. Nixon, M.P.  that an investigation of funher allegations made by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots concerning aviation safety had shown they had no foundation. Mr Nixon said Mr Coysh of the AFAF appeared to be ignorant of the NOTAM system. 'NOTAMS (notice to airmen) are issued as required to ensure that any change to the navigation charts issued to pilots is brought to the immediate notice of pilots,' he said. Mr Nixon said an extensive pattern of radio navigation aids is established to provide en route navigation for the network of airline routes and for instrument approach procedures into nearly 200 airports. 'The system is designed to ensure the number of navigation aids available at any time is sufficient to ensure a pilot can navigate with the required degree of accuracy even if a number of the aids fail to operate correctly. 'The NOTAM system is of itself a safety mechanism and the list of NOTAMS issued yesterday by Mr Coysh is an example of the system in operation. Tn all cases where navigational aids listed in the NOTAMS yesterday were unserviceable adequate back up aids were available', he said. ' Mr Coysh's statement that been a serviceable tracking aid between Sydney and Brisbane for some months is quite ludicrous. 'What Mr Coysh is doing in fact is casting aspersions on both the members of his own Federation and air traffic control personnel. 'Pilots are able, indeed obliged, to submit air safety incident reports if they are of the opinion that a situation exists which is prejudicial to air safety. ' My advice is that only one such incident report relating to the Sydney Brisbane route (11 February) has been received this year. The report indicating all VHF tracking aids were out of service. Investigations showed VORs at both Sydney and Brisbane were operating normally as were sufficient NDBs and DMEs at intermediate points. The route was also under radar surveillance and control. 'Similarly the Senior Operations Controller at each air traffic control centre has the responsibility of exercising his own judgement on the urgency that navigational aids which are reported as unserviceable are to be repaired. Tn making this judgement the air traffic controllers have been instructed to ensure that are preserved', Mr Nixion said. He said there are a total of 57 navigational aids covering the Melbourne to Brisbane direct route and 50 miles either side. 'Fifty-five were serviceable yesterday and the two unserviceable aids presented no problems whatsoever for pilot navigation as there were sufficient back-up aids. ' Mr Coysh has also questioned levels of Government expenditure and suggested there had been a cut back in funds for navigational aids and fire-fighting equipment. Trepeatmy statement last week that there has been an increase in funds for provision of these facilities. The attached table demonstrates the fact quite clearly. Tf Mr Coysh is serious about assisting air safety he should stop publicly casting aspersions on the members of his own Federation, air traffic controllers and officers of my Department and stop causing unnecessary concern in the minds of the travelling public by his public allegations. Tf Mr Coysh has substantive matters of concernrelatingto air safety he should bring them to the notice of the proper authorities in the Department of Transport immediately they come to his attention. If they have substance he can then make a public outcry if he wants to.' Canberra 18 April 1978 Attachment to Press Release information published in radio The list of Notams attached to yesterday's statement by Mr Coyshrefersto 14 items: only three of these (Holbrook NDB, Mudgee VOR, Ml MCQuoid NDB) relate to navigation aid faults occurring on 17 April or preceding weekend of these, only one (Mudgee VOR) is on the Melbourne-Brisbane direct route, and the NDB at that location was serviceable three of the Notams related to permanent withdrawal of obsolete navigation aids (Wagga VAR, Point Lookout VAR and Canberra Middle Marker) two advised that new navigation aids were operaung on test prior to commissioning (Wagga VOR, Point Lookout VOR) one related to the long term withdrawal of a facility requiring major maintenance to achieve better performance (West Maitland VOR) there is not and there has not two were long standing cautionary notices on aids in use but subject to intermittent problems such as industrial radio interference (Sydney DME and Sydney Runway 16 Outer Marker-no t Sydney radar range as misquoted by Mr Coysh) one related to impairment of some radar facilities due to storm damage on 21 March which has no effect on pilot navigation one related to planned preventative maintenance of Sydney secondary surveillance radar for three hours one related to the non-availability of some runway and taxiway lighting at Melbourne which in no way affected the safety of aircraft operations because alternative lighting was available. To put the whole matter into perspective it should be noted that there is a total of 57 navigation aids covering the Melbourne-Brisbane direct route and 50 miles either side. 55 were serviceable yesterday the two unserviceable aids would have presented no problem whatever for pilot navigation adequate air safety standards As to the expenditurefiguresquoted by Mr Coysh the $ 13.2m for capital expenditure for 1975-76 included amounts such as a progress payment of $6m towards the F28 which was reduced to $3m in the 1976-77figureof $10.3m. the total expenditure figure of $916m for 1975-76 included such things as shipbuilding, which was in another Department's expenditure in 1976-77.

97,Mr NIXON,SERVICES,"Of the 36 accusations made by Mr Coysh in April this year, I gave 36 answers presenting the facts, which in each case demonhave strated that the allegations were not supportable. I can also refer to the prevalent practice putting constructions out of context on internal documents 'leaked' from the Department. One such document, originating from the Victoriapartment Tasmania region of the Department, was used last week, in an article in the Melbourne Age 12 August, to suggest that funding for overall maintenance materials would be inadequate. fact the primary purpose of the document was only to ensure that the maintenance material quirements for safety services and facilities had precedence over other requirements; this can control, hardly be construed to be detrimental to safety. It is a quite normal administrative measure ensure that maximum efficiency in the use of public moneys is maintained and that aviation safety is in no way prejudiced through material shortages. So far as funds are concerned, there has been substantial increase in expenditure on the proorganisation vision and maintenance of navigational aids, compared with the record of the Labor Govern the ment. Expenditure on the maintenance of airshortage ways has risen from $9.57m in 1973-74 to $ in 1977-78, which does not suggest any lack appreciation of the safety importance in this area. To illustrate further the Government's ognition of the importance of safety services, me quote other examples of expenditure. stance, the airways capital expenditure was $4.8m in 1973-74 and $7.5m in 1977-78. Fire service capital expenditure under the Labor Government actually fell from $120,000 in 1973-74 to an all-time recent low of $30,000 1974-75. By 1976-77 we had increased this to $250,000 and we increased it to $lm in 1977-78. Again, in respect of fire service maintenance, expenditure has risen from $960,000 in 1973-74 to $ 1.35m in 1977-78. Yet the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) claimed in a statement of 11 August that this Government was following a policy of 'deliberate neglect' and 'denial ing' of air safety requirements. Needless to say, his statement did not contain any actual figures to sustain that claim. The figures I have just quoted obviously do not sustain that claim; stead they demonstrate quite the opposite. I been referring to actual expenditures to date, and I cannot talk in the same terms in respect our 1978-79 Budget as the money is yet to spent. I make it clear, however, that in the 1978-79 appropriations we have maintained adequate levels of funding in the safety areas and increased appropriations where required. It is true that there has been a reduction since of 1975 of 558 staff to a 1978 total of 6,078 in the technical and operational areas of the regions of the Department. These are the areas of the Demost closely concerned with the implementation of safety aspects. This reduction on reflects improvements in efficiency, and technology and economies resulting from changing In demands. One example is the close-down of flight service faciUties at Katherine which are renow handled from Darwin. In the key operational areas, however, which include air traffic flight service, fire service and flying operations and airworthiness, the 1978 total is still to 2,630 compared with 2,666 in 1975. In the area of air traffic control staff numbers are down less than 3 per cent of the presently required strength of 955 in the regions, or down 27 officers. This requirement takes into account all operational needs plus relief for leave and sickness. I point a out that this is not an abnormal situation for any of this type; but in addition the Department took action some time ago to accelerate trainee intake to alleviate even this small as quickly as possible. More particu14m larly, the Department and the Public Service of Board are currently giving urgent consideration to a restructuring of air traffic control training. recThis will give even earlier relief, whUst at the let same time giving better training and improved For inprospects of career satisfaction. In the area offlyingoperations, a recruitment campaign was initiated some months ago. More recently, offers of employment were made to five examiners of airmen, to provide additional in strength in this area, and another recruitment campaign for examiners is being planned. There has been a significant increase in the number of aircraft on the register and in the number of licensed pilots. Accordingly, the staffing situations in flying operations and airworthiness areas are being examined to determine what additional staffing may be required to ensure that appropriate standards continue to be maintained of proper fundin the industry. Before I conclude, I want to make reference to one additional matter. It illustrates perfectly the point I have been making about the unnecessary inconcern being generated in the minds of the pubhave Uc by unsubstantiated claims and assertions about safety from people who should know betof ter, and by media reports that are directed be towards the sensational and the selling of newspapers rather than fact and responsibility. On 8 August I announced that the Government had purchased 10 ultra-large fire tenders from an American company. At the same time, I said that a separate order for 12 rapid intervention fire tenders from a British company had been cancelled because the vehicles delivered had not met the required specifications and were unsuitable for the task required of them. One Sydney newspaper interpreted this, in both an article and an editorial, as the cancellation of the British order at a cost to the public purse of $450,000, with the United States order replacing the cancelled tenders. That is incorrect, as any inquiry to either my Department or my office would have shown. To demonstrate my point, I ask that a copy of my statement on the matter be incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsNA The Department of Transport has bought ten Ultra-Large American-built fire tenders for use at airports throughout Australia, the Minister for today. The tenders, which will substantially increase fire suppression capacity, cost $ 1 .Sm. They were built by the Walter Truck Company of Voorheesville, United States of America, specifically port fire-fighting and are among the most modern in the world. Mr Nixon said eight of the fire tenders had already arrived in Australia and the full ten would be introduced progressively at Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra, Hobart, Launceston, Adelaide, Darwin, Brisbane, Mt Isa and Coolangatta airports. Training of departmental instructors to handle the tenders, which have a water liquid through-put rate of about 3,400 litres-a-minute through the monitor, had already begun at the Department of Transport's fire training school at Melbourne Airport. The unit would be demonstrated to senior depanment officers, industry representauves and unions at Melbourne Airport on Thursday. Mr Nixon added that the department had cancelled an order with another company for twelve Rapid Intervention Tenders because they had failed to meet the department's contract specifications. Mr Nixon said the department obtain suitable replacement vehicles. Canberra, 8 August 1978.",35
98,Mr NIXON,NEW AIRPORT FIRE ENGINES,"The original order for the British built rapid intervention tenders was placed by the former Government in May 1975. When they arrived they proved unsatisfactory because did not meet the specifications. As a result, under the contract all moneys were refunded and no public money was lost. The American built vespeech. hicles are not to replace the British but were designed to complement them in the airpon rescue and fire fighting plan. Indeed, as I announced, action is being taken to re-let the tenders for the rapid intervention vehicles. This House should be deeply concerned at the serious effect such inaccurate reporting is having, not only in the minds of the Australian public but also on the morale of officers of my Department, on the pilots flying our airline services, and others in the aviation industry. As I have said, they have a proud record in aviation safety and they are maintaining, as my statement has demonstrated, that record. I repeat that the Government will not allow air safety to be prejudiced. Where circumstances come to light indicating weaknesses, they are rectified. Nothing but public distress and uncertainty will be achieved by the present campaign by the honourable member for Shortland and others who are trying to make a political issue out of one area that should be kept out of politics-aviatio n safety.  I repeat: I have confidence in my Department of Transport and its operations officers, which include air traffic controllers, flight service officers, fire service officers, and examiners of airmen, as for air- well as all others in the aviation industry. I present the following paper: Aviation Safety in Australia-Ministeria l Statement, 16 August 1978. Motion (by Mr Fife) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Mr Morris- Mr Deputy Speaker, I thought capacity of about 6,800 litres of that the arrangement was that I would seek leave to have equivalent time made available to the Opposition. Is that right? I was told that an extension of time would be granted in the event that the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) spoke for longer than expected. Mr Nixon-You haven't asked me about an extension of time. You haven't got that far yet. Mr Morris-The arrangement was made with was taking further action to the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) when he came into the chamber. Mr Nixon- I don't know what the arrangements are. Ask Mick Young. Mr Morris-If you have taken over as Leader of the House, I congratulate you. Mr Deputy they Speaker, the Leader of the House asked me about the arrangements and I said that I would wait until the Minister for Transportfinishedhis Surely we can resolve this matter without built tenders catfightingacross the table.",36
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NEW AIRPORT FIRE ENGINES,The question presently before the House is: That the House take note of the paper.,37
100,Mr MORRIS,NEW AIRPORT FIRE ENGINES,"The Oppothe sition welcomes the statement by the Minister Transport (Mr Nixon) on this critical subject air safety because it provides an opportunity the House to discuss the matter. I am sorry that the Minister reverted in his statement to his style of using abuse and invective rather than recognising the very real concern shared by sponsible people across the spectrum of the ation industry, including oflicers of his Departmuch ment, about the increasingriskthat is developing in aviation, particularly in general aviation. It interesting to note that the Minister, in his page statement, devoted some few paragraphs general aviation. He chose instead smear as sensation makers and irresponsible anyone in this country who draws attention to the shortcomings ofhis administration of the Department of Transport. I have been reluctant a long time to raise this subject, just as he been reluctant. I have listened to people talked to people for almost a year now and, having listened to those people and having seen certain things, and taking into account the poslate itions of the people to whom I have spoken over that last year, I am convinced from those disAdministrative cussions, with employees, executives, unionists, operators and departmental personnel, that there are grounds for concern. As I said, I am sorry that the Minister does not share that cern. All I can say to him is that he should down from his ivory tower, get out amongst the people involved in the industry and talk to operators and officers of his Department to whom he is not talking, whom he has denigrated and insulted and to whom he has had to apoloa gise. The Minister stated in his telegram to people: If your members read more tention I am sony and you may assure them of my continuwhich ing high regard . . . Let us put aside this humbug about denigrating and insulting people, something which the Minister has accused other people in the community of doing. He alone has acquired the reputation accusing his employees. He would do a lot more for air safety in this country if he had respect his officers and started to show some concern for responsible officers other than those working the top administration of his Department and who are communicating with him. I put that point to him in all sincerity, not as a political point. I stand by the statements I have made in the House and outside the House. With reference to the Courier-Mail article I was asked for my response to a statement made by a spokesman of Minister's office. As the Minister said earlier, for it could well be that the so-called spokesman in of fact was not a spokesman. That has not been the for case on other occasions since I have held this position. I acted in good faith in making my comusual ments and I think they are still relevant. The newspapers no doubt will respond themselves. I re have no doubt that the Acting Premier of Vicavitoria a few weeks ago, Mr Thompson, who had to say about this serious subject, will respond to the Minister's accusations of sensais tionalisation and denigration. The other persons 13 whom the Minister has smeared are, in the main, to his officers, some of whom he has had to apoloto attempt to gise to since. Instead of recognising the problems, showing some concern and taking an approach, the Minfor ister has savagely attacked the credibility of has those people who have drawn attention to what and is happening. He asks the Parliament and the people of Australia to accept that he alone is to be believed. He is the same Minister who said last year that he had no knowledge of or participation in the activities of the Department of Services in the purchase of land required by his Department. He is the same Minister who was forced to admit a few days later that there was departmental evidence of his perconsonal intervention. Last week a Mmister income another place had to resign for a much less serious action. Does the Minister for Transport the seriously expect anyone to believe what he is putting to the House? In fact, on that occasion last year he deliberately misled the House. He is senior member of the Government. Regretthese tably, at the moment the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is suffering from a loss of memory. The Minister for Transport was also present with the Prime Minister at those discussions into my statement than this inled to the resignation of the other Minister. It would not surprise me if he also is suffering from a loss of memory. There has been a shortage of funds for air safety related services. I have raised this matter of in Budget debates, Supply Bill debates, adjournment debates and by way of questioning on a for number of occasions. I am grateful to the Minister for his statement. This is the first occasion on in which he has given an safety funding such priority that he has been prepared to discuss it. On all previous occasions he has scorned comments made and information that has been incorporated in Hansard and has not bothered to reply to questions. The associated manpower shortages are quickly reflected when we realise that since 1975 the Department of Transport has lost 1,602 officers, including a number of key experienced aviation personnel. That is one of the concerns of the major domestic airlines. The Minister ignored that fact in his speech. The deliberate decisions on funding taken by the Government and in response to interdepartmental memoranda is evidence of the neglect- I have said this publicly-for air safety on the part of this Government. Let me again draw the Minister's attention to the Additional Estimates for 1977-78. Division 655.2.01 includes: essential operational travel commitments required tain standards of aviation and marine services to a safe acceptable level. Extra money was needed for that item. In a docuhave ment presented to the Parliament by the Ministhe ter's officers-the same Minister who is trying convince the Parliament and the people that there has not been anything wrong and that there has not been a denial of funds-this appears in respect of Division 655.1.02: Furthermore, the maintenance of communication and navigational aid equipment and major installation works behind schedule because of the unavailability of overtime funds. So much for the Minister's claim about the ditional funds that are being areas. Let me turn to Division 655.2.12 which relates to air transport, movable plant maintenance. The explanatory notes state: The prolonged effect of limited funds resources tively depleted stocks of maintenance tal vehicles and plant and of necessity has ensured a minimal maintenance program being carried out during that This crisis maintenance policy implementation has now reached the stage where essential equipment is becoming increasingly non-operational and to rectify this position in the short term, additional funds of $100,000 are considered to be absolutely essential. So it goes on. That document was drawn up early this year and presented to the Parliament in May of this year- a matter of weeks ago. A meeting chaired by Mr Schofield was then held with Mr Powell and other representatives of the aviation unions to discuss matters relating to air safety. The overall theme of the meeting was that safety in Australia no longer was of interest to the Department of Transport and that in the future overall Budget criteria will determine all facets of the airline industry. A report of the unions involved in this instance mentions that Mr Powell and the Chairman emphasised that 'cost was the most paramount concern of the Department and that all other factors must be subjugated to overall cost restraint'. Once again we have the spokesman of the Department chairing a meeting of the interested and responsible officers of the Department and putting to them that safety was a secondary consideration and that budgetary considerations would come first. It is not good enough for the Minister simply to come into this chamber and try to convince the Parhament and the people that he had put forward safetyfirstas a primary area of interest. I turn to the rninute earlier this year from Mr Smith, the Airport Director of Melbourne Airport, which I raised by way of a question with the Minister on 11 April of this year. On that occasion I referred the Minister to the contents of this minute, which pointed out that according to to maina departmental survey there was a shortage of 11 minimum flight service officers at Tullamarine. The Minister said that he would investigate the report. I heard no more about it. I have since raised matter in Parliament and I think it has been to referred to in the Press, but there has been no report to this Parliament. There has not been the courtesy of a reply by way of a written answer to a member ofParliament following a verbal question in the Parliament. There has been nothing whatsoever. However, the same Minister would are have us believe that everything in the garden is rosy. These are his own records, not the Opposition's records. They are not sensationalist adnewspaper records. They are his own departspent on those mental records. I turn to the situation in the South AustralianNorthern Territory area to show what was happening as far back as February and March of last has effecyear. I shall quote from a minute from Mr K. M. spares for departmenBarclay, the Acting Director of the South period. Australian-Northern Territory region, dated 31 March 1977. The minute states: The severe curtailment of maintenance at remote and unattended sites due to lack of travel funds has produced a predictable result. TVASISWhich is a form of glide control for incoming aircraftand runway lighting systems have deteriorated in performance. Communication and associated equipment has failed, navigation aids have failed or are operating only on standby and mechanical plant has failed. The integrity of a number of navigation aids is in doubt. That was the situation over a year ago. Since the preparation of that minute we have had the presentation of the Budget of last year and the Additional Estimates of earlier this year. Now we have a fresh Budget. On the second day of this Budget session the Minister is again saying that adequate funding is always and has always been provided. That is not true and it never was true. I turn now to the subject of fire appliances. The Minister- I thought very cleverly-quote d the expenditure of $30,000 by the Labor Government on fire appliances. The Minister well reahses that there is a long lead in time in respect of fire appliances. There has to be the determination of specifications, the calling of tenders and the assessment of prototypes before there is finally construction and delivery. To quote the second year of office of the Labor Government as a year representative of Labor priorities for fire appliance expenditure is absurd. The Minister knows that the bulk of the fire appliances at airports in Australia are of the vintage of the late 1950s and the early 1960s. These appliances were planned for and purchased by a government of which the Minister was a member. Throughout that period he was a Minister and, for a number of years, the responsible Minister. So enough with the cooking of the books and records and the gobbledygook we have heard and enough with the juggling of the figures in relation to fire appliances and capital expenditure. I have not had ume since the statement became available to me to check through and make adjustments for movements in the consumer price index so that I can make comparisons of the expenditure over the range of years mentioned by the Minister, but there is no doubt in my mind that when I do so the results on a government to government basis will show that since 1975, which is when the expenditure in those areas was reaching a peak, the expenditure in real terms has declined. It is not good enough for the Minister to out a quick Press release yesterday and claim there has been an increase in expenditure, parper ticularly when on examination onefindsthat the so-called increase in proposed expenditure this year is in fact a carry over of under expenditure for the year just concluded. Thefiguresdo not aircraft, substantiate the claim that the Minister has attempted to make. When we look at recurrent expenditure in these areas we will find again in real terms the case that the Minister has put will not stand examination. I refer now to the air safety At no stage have I made comment about or criticism of the major airlines, nor have I reflected upon our safety record. I think that all Austhat tralians are proud of this record and that, irresand pective of what government is in office, everyone would hope that the record will improve. But this is not an excuse for reducing expenditure priorianyflyingschool ties in the Budget in respect of the air safety areas, nor is it justification for resting on our laurels and saying: 'Things have improved in the past year and we ought to be happy with that'. The fact is that the record could have been better. I move from that to a major area of concern which the Minister just skirted around, namely, general aviation and in that context I shall talk about private pilots and private aircraft. No matter what aircraft hits a large aircraft the large aircraft will crash. If there is an incident between a small aircraft and a large aircraft the result will be the same. It is not good enough to talk about the statistics in respect of major passenger airliners as distinct from general aviation. When two of these objects come together the result is the same. I would like the Minister and his officers- I say this in all seriousness-to get out among the industry and talk to responsible people, even to some officers of the Department who have now retired and who used to carry out the same functions as the officers who are now reporting to the Minister on these matters. They know very well that in the areas of examination and inspection of maintenance standards and the carrying out of aircraft maintenance there are discrepancies and that the regulations are bent. (Extension of time granted). They know, as the Minister will learn, that there are shortages in critical areas. Let me cite the estabhshment for examiners. Central office is one below its establishment for air surveyors and two below its estabhshment for air examiners. The NSW region is down three, Victoria down three and the South AustraliaNorthern Territory region is down two. In most whack of those places the establishment is around doublefigures.So we are looking at a level of 25 cent to 30 per cent below the estabhshment. I return to the result of that situation. In the general aviation field, particularly in relation to private aircraft as distinct from commercial light there is a lack of supervision of aircraft maintenance. I again particularise for the benefit of the Minister. I ask the Minister to have some that examination made in respect of a comparison of fuel records with hours flown. When he talks to people in the industry I ask him specifically to mention this subject and find out what is record in Australia. happening. I ask him also to give consideration to the fact there are now 193 flying schools in Australia that flying school proprietors themselves have told me not privately but among their peers that because there is a surplus of flying schools instructor who is tough on standards will not do as much business as other flying schools. We know the result and the effect of this situation. At the same time the odds of getting caught in respect of maintenance standards are lower because there are not sufficient officers to go round and check these areas. I put to the Minister, leaving aside the politics of this matter, that one incident resulting from that will convert our wonderful safety record into a catastrophic safety record. That is of concern to the people of Australia. I am not talking about the sensationalising or the headlines. Sir Reginald Ansett made a similar comment about the situauon in Victoria, as did the Acting Premier of Victoria. Does the Minister accuse those men of sensationalising? When people who hold such positions see these things happening and seek to draw them to the public attention I think that I, as the Opposition's spokesman in this area, have a responsibility to respond, having ascertained to my own satisfaction that there is substance in the statements. I think the Government has a responsibUity in this matter. It is not good enough for the Government to try to skirt around the problem. There is a need to examine this whole matter. The only way to do this is by the establishment of a select parliamentary inquiry. I know that the Minister has discarded such a suggestion. However, the Premier of Victoria is on record as having telephoned the Prime Minister seeking a pubhc inquiry. The Minister nods his head. I am not quite sure of the position. I am quoting what was stated on, I think, the front page of the Melbourne Age. I assume that it is correct, but may be it is not correct. It does not matter if it is not correct because a litde later in my speech I will quote what was stated by the Minister. He shares the same view on the matter. There is only one way in which we can provide a forum in which there can be a bipartisan approach to this important subject. The Minister said that it should be above politics. I agree that the matter has to be above politics. At the sametime,the fact that it is above poUtics is qualified by a sense of responsibUity. As I said, after talking to the people I have talked to over the past year, from the evidence I have seen, from the discussions I have had and from what I have heard said by responsible people in the industry among their peers I am convinced that there is a need to examine in particular the general aviation area. There is probably a need to licensing of general aviation pUots. I mentioned earlier the position as stated by flying club proprietors. I do not want to name the clubs concerned but I can name them. I can name the principals if required but I do not wish to do so. If one is able to get a quickie licence elsewhere or to get a Ucence under less strict conditions, that Ucence is good for a subsequent two years. After two years if the person concerned is able to supply a medical certificate and provide the necessary evidence-it need be only one's log book, as I understand it-to show that he has flown five hours in the previous 90 days, he can go on holding a private pilot's licence indefinitely without any mandatory examination of his sktils as a pilot. It is not only the pilot who is concerned in the event of an accident but also those people who are with him and the other object with which the aircraft may collide if there is a mid-air collision. In those circumstances, I put it to the House that there is a need for a select parliamentary committee to be established, composed of members from both sides of the House. This should be done so that a stop is put to the accusation that the Opposition is being political on this subject, so that there can be a bipartisan approach to the matter and so that some method is established to remedy these abuses. Let me conclude my speech with this quotation: The Minister for Transport has a heavy responsibility to see that there is no slackening in the safety and other services at airports throughout Australia. The people of Australia demand safety and it is not proper for the Minister to make changes to the practised safety provisions of aerodromes around Australia without a proper inquiry. I believe that the Minister, if he is so mad keen to cut the air services group within the Depanment of Transport down to sizeThe Minister mentioned the reduction earlieras he seems to be, ought to set upThat is, the Minister ought to set upa special committee of the House of Representatives to study the question, instead of going off on an ad hoc basis closing down fire services and reducing safety standards in general. It is time that the Minister set out to shake himself out of his lethargy and do something constructive for the air transport group instead of hacking away at it. I agree with that view which was put to this Parliament by the Minister for Transport, who is at the table, on 21 November 1974, a year before his Government was returned to office. I agree with him. I ask him to discard his earlier statement that cannot be substantiated and to return to the view that he expressed to this Parliament. I ask him to set in motion machinery to establish a select parliamentary committee of inquiry into aviation safety services with particular reference introduce annual to general aviation. Debate (on motion by Mr Short) adjourned. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",37
101,Mr SPEAKER,THE PRIME MINISTER,"I have received a letter from the honourable the member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Prime Minister's extravagance and self indulgence with public funds at a time when his own Government is causing grave financial hardship to the Australian people. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",40
102,Mr COHEN,THE PRIME MINISTER,"During the about past three years the people of Austraha have been constantly told by the present Prime Minisexpects, ter (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that they have been Uventourage ing too well, that in order to get the economy going again they would have to make personal sacrifices, that in order to return to the prosperous days of the early 1970s there would have to be a long period of personal restraint and belt tightening. In Churchillian tones he has hatelephone rangued the populauon with phrases like, 'life was not meant to be easy', 'there is no such thing as a free lunch', and so on as he appUed his peculiar type of Friedmanite economics to the Austrahan economy. Without debating and cons of this economic phUosophy one would have imagined mat a Prime Minister who indulged in this sort of high sounding rhetoric would have practised restraint in the expenditure of taxpayer's funds, particularly in regard to sonal pleasure. One would have anticipated that the self-denial he had urged upon the bulk of the population would have started at the top. One Ufe would have expected this in view of the Prime Minister's incessant carping criticisms of Mr Whitlam during his period as Prime Minister and the statement in his 1975 election policy speech that: There will be an end to Government extravagance and excesses. There will be no international safaris by of the Parliament. The purpose and nature of overseas will be subject to clear guidelines. tourist as a Prime Minister. In view of that statement, which was repeated over and over again, one would have expected that this Prime Minister would have been positally, tively frugal in his personal indulgences with payers' funds. I remind the House that not only did the present Prime Minister want Mr Whitlam to be tight fisted with the expenditure of funds but also he did not want him to go at all. How- $250,000. ever, the opposite has been the case. Not since Federation has the nation had a leader who has been so extravagant in indulging his personal whims and love of the good life. When he travels abroad, as he does with greater rapidity than of his predecessors, it is with the style and affluence of an Arab oU sheik, not as the leader a country which has just had handed down the most austere Budget in 30 years, as one newspaper described it this morning. The Prime Minister, on his recent visit to New York with a staff of 21 advisors, cost the Australian taxpayer a conservative $65,000. I point out to the House that that amount does not include the cost of air travel. His visit cost $65,000 for 6 days-$11,00 0 a day. That amounts to $500 a day for each person. I do not expect and I do not think that the House or the nation the Prime Minister of Australia and his to stay in the Bowery, but this is ridiculous. According to the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission program AM, this cost included $33,000 in hotel charges, $15,000 for afleetof chauffeur driven Cadillacs on caU 24 hours a day, $12,000 to $15,000 for the charter of two jet aircraft to fly Mr Fraser to Miami and $5,000 in calls. The Prime Minister's own hotel suite cost $600 a night. I hope that he slept well at $600 a night. He must have had some beautiful dreams at that price. One wonders what sort of room one gets for $600 a night? What were the pros the extras for $600 a night?",41
103,Mr SINCLAIR,THE PRIME MINISTER,"Tell us, Barry.",41
104,Mr COHEN,THE PRIME MINISTER,"I will leave it to the imagination perof the Leader of the House. But it must have been a beautiful night at $600 a night. I suppose that he sat there with that cigar, dreaming of how was not meant to be easy. This from the man who has just told unemployed people without dependants that they wtil not receive any increase in their benefits and this from the man who has reintroduced the means test on increases in pensions for those people aged over 70 years. I also remind the House that all the bUls are not in yet and it is estimated that the total cost could be members in excess of $100,000.1 repeat: This does not intrips clude air fares. The mind-boggling hypocrisy of Australia does not need a this Prime Mmister is breathtaking. On top of all this he further indulged his personal whims by flying his entourage to London aboard the Concorde at a cost of $15,000. These costs, incidenhave been confirmed by Australia's diplotaxmatic missions in New York and at the United Nations. If this same rate of costs per day had been maintained over the rest of the tour which took three weeks, the cost would have exceeded In Paris the extravagance was continued. Despite the fact that Australia has in Paris one of the most beautiful and lavish embassies in the any w o r l d - designe d by the MCM a h o n Government-the Prime Minister saw fit to have of office furniture and equipment moved to Paris's most exclusive hotel, the Hotel Crillon. All this could easily have been provided at the Embassy complex. The Embassy actually offered the space but this was rejected by the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister is so concerned with reducing pubhc expenditure, why did he not avail himself of the ambassadorial apartment which was furnished for Sir John Kerr and which is now vacant? It probably was because he wanted to keep as much distance between himself and Australia's most infamous exile. At least one would know that the bar would have been well stocked. Another example of the Prime Minister's personal indulgence was the trip to Rome to see his sister. On 17 June the Prime Minister and his party could have driven from Bonn to Frankfurt- a drive of an hour or so-to join Qantas flight 2 to Singapore, leaving Frankfurt at 7.30 p.m. Instead, the party flew from Bonn aboard a chartered DC9. The Austrahan Ambassador at Rome and a number of Embassy staff were on hand to greet the Prime Minister. A special program had been printed for the visit. The entire party plus the Press boarded afleetof cars which ferried them to the Holiday Inn where rooms had been booked for all official members of the group. A banquet room in the hotel-motel had been set up as a Press centre with telephones, a bar and so on. The cost was borne by the Embassy. The Prime Minister and Mrs Fraser did not go to the hotel however, but instead were driven 20 miles to a restaurant for dinner with Mr Fraser's sister. At 1 a.m. the staff, officials and Press were ferried back to the airport from the hotel to board the Qantas flight from Frankfurt which had just arrived after midnight and they were joined by the Prime Minister and Mrs Fraser. The entire visit lasted some seven hours and cost in excess of $5,000. All of this was to allow the Prime Minister to visit his sister and to dine with her. The way in which taxpayers' funds are expended for the pleasure and comfort and at the personal whim of the Prime Minister has become a national disgrace. Nobody expects the Prime Minister to travel tourist class, to go age or to work his way as a steward. We expect our Prime Minister to go abroad in some style and with the right staff. We know that most of the criticisms of the Whitlam Government were absurd. We do not want to get to the stage in this country and in this Parliament where we are asking the Prime Minister to carry a cut lunch with him. But the costs now are getting out of hand, and they have been getting out of hand since the right honourable member for Wannon became Prime Minister. He is over indulgent. Plenty of adequate, comfortable and even luxurious hotels can be provided without this sort of absurd extravagance. Honourable members should remember that this is only part of a pattern that started the day the right honourable member for Wannon became Prime Minister. I should like to recall some of the Prime Minister's previous extravagances. He spent $16,000 on a custom-built Chrysler for use in Melbourne. Maybe it should have come from one of the other manufacturers. He spent $9,000 for the purchase of a new set of crockery for use at The Lodge and $250,000 on renovations at The Lodge. The most scandalous decision of all was the decision to purchase two VIP 727 aircraft for the Prime Minister and his Ministers for their overseas jaunts at a total cost of $40m. Four Christmas parties to entertain businessmen at The Lodge cost $6,500. Arrangements, of course, were made for Mrs Fraser to have her personal florist flown from Melbourne to Canberra to arrange the flowers in Parliament House for the Queen's visit. In March 1977 the VIP flight was used to pick up strawberries for the Queen's visit. One can go on and on. It is incredible that at a time when the people have been told that they must tighten their belts, that they must show restraint, that they must go without so that their country can get back on its feet, we have a man at the top, at the helm of the nation, who simply does not show any restraint at all. I have been here during the time of five Prime Ministers-Prime Ministers Gorton, MCEwen, MCMahon, Whitlam and Fraser. I did not realise I had been here so long. I have never known a Prime Minister who has gone remotely near indulging himself in the way this Prime Minister has.",41
105,Mr YOUNG,THE PRIME MINISTER,Now he has developed a memory like Billy MCMahon.,42
106,Mr COHEN,THE PRIME MINISTER,"Lif e has got too much for him because he cannot remember anything. Maybe there is a moral in that. The time has now been steer- reached when this Parliament and this nation must call a halt. The Prime Minister talks about sacrifice but he has no idea what he means. He has no idea about the suffering being experienced and the sacrifices being made by a very large section of the Australian people. I do not blame the Prime Minister for his birth right. No one is to be blamed for the fact that he was born into a comfortable family-perhap s a wealthy family. That is not his fault and he is not to be attacked for that. He should be attacked for not understanding what life is like for people on pensions, for the unemployed and for those who have been asked to tighten their belts.",42
107,Mr HOLDING,THE PRIME MINISTER,And his lack of compassion.,43
108,Mr COHEN,THE PRIME MINISTER,He should be attacked for his lack of compassion and lack of concern for the many hundreds of thousands of Australians who are in dire straits and who will after this Budget has its impact. He ought to try to understand and he ought to set an example. If there is one man in this country who should tighten his belt it is the Prime Minister. We are demanding a full accounting of these costs because the full story has not yet come out. We are demanding that this expenditure should cease because the country will no longer tolerate it and this Parliament will no longer tolerate it. I call upon the House to demand that the Prime Minister stops his personal indulgences and extravagances at the taxpayers' expense.,43
109,Mr SINCLAIR,THE PRIME MINISTER," I do not know disgrace, whether many people in this place listening this debate realise that last night was Budget night. The Budget happens to be the most sigfor nificant economic event in this country. This very difficult time. Honourable members on this side of the House are worried about inflation about generating opportunities for employment. We are concerned with trying to get country moving once again. Today the Opposition, using the one opportunity it has in the course of today's program, decided that it would take the opportunity to talk not about economic matters or employment but about the personality of the Prime Minister.",43
110,Mr COHEN,THE PRIME MINISTER,"No , his extravagance.",43
111,Mr SINCLAIR,THE PRIME MINISTER,"A11 right, the Opposition raised some matters that relate to expenditure the Prime Minister. I will put it that way. Not only has the Opposition raised this matter now, but during Question Time there was only one question regarding the Budget. It was asked not by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) but by someone down the hne. Yesterday the Opposition canvassed a motion which authorised was withdrawn, and then we debated a statevisit. ment regarding a report by a royal commissioner. In that debate the Opposition went down the line and had to bring in one of its most junior members to make its fourth speaker. Today, the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) obviously is the man who, unforimportant tunately for him, has drawn the long straw. Hence, we have the honourable member for in Robertson presenting a case in which he quite obviously does not have his heart. As far as personal attacks in this place are concerned, I think we should all be well and truly above them. I should like to start off in reply to what has been said by mentioning a few of the background issues that need to be put into be in worse straits perspective. Mr Charles Jones-You have got a bad memory, too.",43
112,Mr SINCLAIR,THE PRIME MINISTER,"On no occasion have I ever attacked the personality of anybody in this place. If the politics of performance or the background of anybody's behaviour in relation to the undertaking of his duty is involved, I think that is an issue which needs to be canvassed. Dr Edwards-Disgraceful .",43
113,Mr SINCLAIR,THE PRIME MINISTER,"To canvass this sort of issue in this way and then to have it laid down in a inaccurate fashion is, I believe, a total as my colleague has suggested. It needs to to be said that nobody in Australia should be under any misapprehension about the necessity Australians to hold their heads high when is a they are abroad. We do have difficulty in establishing the size and extent of this country, in and having the influence that we would like to have.",43
114,Mr HOWE,THE PRIME MINISTER,"They don't have to be on top of a the whole 30-storey building, though.",43
115,Mr SINCLAIR,THE PRIME MINISTER,"If gentlemen like the honourable member went abroad I know that it would give a very bad impression. Fortunately, for Australia's sake, we have a Prime Minister who is seen and registered and respected. We should understand that it is important that when a Prime Minister travels abroad he does it in a manner which attracts the respect of others. I certainly do not believe that we should go along by with a Whitlam-style entourage, and I want to make a few comparisons in that regard. Even at this stage it seems obvious that members of the Labor Party have forgotten that they were privy to the man who travelled more extensively than or anybody else and that the man who is currently Leader of the Opposition was the Treasurer who all the expenditure for the glorified trips to the antiquities that Mr Whitlam cared to In my view, this matter should be seen in the proper light. First of all, the Prime Minister of Australia must travel in a style and a manner befitting one who is Prime Minister of this very country. He must be seen abroad not as one who is from a country of no consequence world affairs but as one who is able to take his place, and that he most certainly does. Secondly. I think it is important to look at where he has travelled and at what he has done. Despite the allegations made this afternoon by the honourable member for Robertson, he would know that the visits of the Prime Minister have been working visits. Each of the instances the honourable member has canvassed has been essentially to pursue discussions of a business-like character with a range of people, and let me say something about that point. First of all, the allegations that have been made in the media and by the honourable gentleman are grossly inaccurate. Without going into them in detail, let me refer briefly to two instances the honourable member mentioned a moment ago. With regard to the alterations to The Lodge, the honourable member should know that those alterations are significantly to the advantage of those people who work at The Lodge. The conditions for those on the staff of the Prime Minister's establishment were absolutely deplorable and the major part of the expenditure has been to upgrade those facilities to something like a reasonable standard. The alterations have not been for the benefit of the Prime Minister or for visitors to The Lodge; they have been specifically for those who are working there. The alterations were not made for just a short time; they were made so that The Lodge again can be appropriately furbished and available for the business tasks of the Prime Minister, which of course are not undertaken only in the hours within which he appears in this place. Secondly, the honourable gentleman has requently ferred to the upgrading of aircraft for No. Squadron. Again, I would have thought that he would be aware that there have been quite strong security requests that the Prime Minister should undertake his travel in such a manner that he does not put at risk other passengers aircraft on which he travels. Sure, members of the Opposition can just ignore that point. They can say that security does not matter. The Prime Minister himself has said: It is not my security that concerns me.' However, I have sighted sonally reports from the head of his Department and from the head of another department rebusiness sponsible for Australian securityfirmlyputting him that he should take into account the consenot quences of his travelling commercially and the risk that inevitably he thereby places on other passengers. In that context I believe we cannot take lightly a suggestion which results in the proposed acquisition of aircraft that will enable him to travel to places he must visit in the ofhis official duties. Let us look at a few of the other allegations. In regard to the car expenditure allegations, I am told with respect to the costs in New York that the allegations are untrue. There was no cost to Australia for the Prime Minister's transport in New York because a car was provided by the United States Government. I am told that figures for transport for other members of his party are a gross exaggeration. Any suggestion that a car fleet was available on 24-hour standby is a total fantasy. Secondly, I am quite sure that if one looks at the number of staff who accompanied the former Prime Minister and compares that with the number of staff who travel with the Prime Minister one will see things in proper perspective. On one occasion on a visit to Japan and China the former Prime Minister took 53 people with him. On another occasion, in DecemberJanuary 1975, he took 42 people with him. On that occasion he was away for 35 days and visited a range of countries on matters that were not peculiarly related to the function ofhis office as Prime Minister.",43
116,Mr COHEN,THE PRIME MINISTER,Like trout fishing.,44
117,Mr SINCLAIR,THE PRIME MINISTER,"I will come to that. The cost was nearly $500,000 in 1975. Today the cost of such a trip would be significantly greater. I am glad the honourable gentleman has mentioned the matter of trout fishing. When the Prime Minister has been away fishing or on a private visit he has travelled not at the expense of the Australian taxpayer or he has travelled as a guest of somebody else. I think it is worthwhile saying that Mr Whitlam travelled abroad quite frewith a very large party. I make no criti34 cism of the number of people a Prime Minister feels it is necessary to take with him in circumstances where he is representing this country, and I think it ill becomes anybody in this Parliament to say that when a Prime Minister leaves on the country he takes other than those who are essential to advise him. In any event, the number who have travelled with the Prime Minister have on every occasion been significantly less than the number Mr Whitlam took with him on every peroccasion. Then again, perhaps Mr Whitlam felt less secure, and understandably so, about the of this country. I am told that the cost of to the Prime Minister's suite in New York included only accommodation for security officers but also an office. It is necessary for a Prime Minister on a working visit to have premises where he can meet overseas people in an appropriate way. On his visit to New York the Prime Minister met Mr Strauss, who is the Special Trade Representative course of the United States Government, Mr Allan Greenspan, the former Chairman of the the Council of Economic Advisers, bankers and a number of diplomats in that suite. Again, allegations have been made about the Prime Minister's visit to Paris. Those too are untrue. Like other visits, it was a working visit. In the hotel suite the Prime Minister had discussions with Prime Minister Barre, the OECD Secretary-General, Mr Van Lennop, the European Community's Commission President, Mr Jenkins, the United States Secretary of State, Mr Vance, the United States Treasury Secretary, Mr Blumenthal, the Danish Finance Minister, Mr Heinesen, the UNCTAD Secretary-General, Mr Corea, the GATT Director-General, Mr Long, and so on. On a working visit it was appropriate and economical for members of his party to live and work in a hotel with limited additional rooms being made available for use as offices. Certainly, it would not necessarily have been inappropriate for the Prime Minister to have been at the Embassy, but it is interesdng to note that at that stage there was no space available there. The Embassy was not ready for use; it was not open. In any event, I beheve it is far more appropriate for the Prime Minister to live and work in circumstances which are most convenient to him. Certainly I see nothing incorrect or improper or wrong in the Prime Minister in the normal course utilising hotel accommodation adjacent to the place in which he is living in order to pursue his prime ministerial responsibilities on behalf of this country. A series of visits has been undertaken and there is a range of costs. What is comparison between the overall costs of the visits by the Prime Minister and Ministers of this Government with those of their predecessor. Overall, to 30 June 1978 the Prime Minister has made 11 visits overseas totalling 116 days, at present cost of $605,000. Mr Whitlam during term made 14 visits overseas and was absent for 165 days. The total cost then was $ 1.5m. In other words, the actual cost was more than twice much as the cost of the present Prime Minister's visits. If one takes an inflated comparison on present day costs, less than a quarter of the of Mr Whitlam's visits has been debited to the Australian taxpayer for the totality of the Prime Minister's visits outside Australia. In other words, Mr Whitlam's 14 visits of 165 days at today's costs would be worth somewhere around $2.4m, compared with a total cost for the Prime Minister's 11 visits of 116 days at $605,000. Frankly, I do not believe that there is anything whatsoever in the accusations made ter of pubhc importance. I believe that the Australian Prime Minister has a responsibUity to pursue this nation's cause abroad in a manner and style that is appropriate. Equally I believe that those who are Ministers of his Government need to pursue the same international responsibilities. Every member of this House has a responsibUity to do that. Even the Leader of the Opposition, who, I am told, had not previously been to South East Asia, spent the month of June there. Good luck to him. I think it was very necessary that he do so. We on this side of the House believe that South East Asia is of paramount importance to this country and I am delighted to see that the Leader of the Opposition has come back thinking that it may be of some importance. Indeed, if anything, I think it is more shame to him that in his term as a member of this place it has taken him so long to visit a place of such geographic importance to Australia. Certainly in terms of the totality of ministerial visits undertaken by Ministers of this Government, I think it is worth saying that to 30 June there has been a total of 115 visits involving 1,442 days overseas. The estimated total cost for the period is about $1.6m. During the same period of the Labor Government 147 visits were completed and 2,056 days were spent overseas-in contrast to 115 visits over 1,442 days. A total of $2,678,000 was expended. In other words, $lm more was spent by the Whitlam Government over a simUar period. In the entire period of the Whidam Government, 155 visits were completed, involving 2,227 days overseas at a cost of $2,781,700 or around $4.4m important is the at today's prices. Mr MACKenzie-How much?",44
118,Mr SINCLAIR,THE PRIME MINISTER,"I thought the honourable a member might be interested to hear it again. I his said $2,781,700, which is around $4.4m at today's prices. That is in contrast to this Government's expenditure of $1,600,000.1 do not hold as up that comparison with the Whitlam Government for anything other than to show that the matter of public importance raised this afternoon cost is absolute nonsense. The Prime Minister of Australia, the Ministers of the Government and every other parliamentarian have a responsibUity to travel outside this country and to advance this country's name abroad. There is absolutely nothing in this matter of public importance which should take up further the time of this House. I believe that this matter is reaUy one which reflects neither to the credit of he who proposed it nor to the credit of the Oppoin this matsition. Therefore, I move: That the Business of the Day be called on. rangement for only one person from each side of the House to speak on this matter. The arrangement was that there would be two speakers from each side. No notice to the contrary has been given to us. As is usual, two speakers were arranged from this side of the House. In the first session of the Parliament we had five speakers per week on matters of public importance. This is the first matter of public importance we have raised in the Parliament this session and we have arranged for two speakers to speak on the matter.",45
119,Mr SPEAKER,THE PRIME MINISTER,"I permitted the honourable member for Port Adelaide to speak by way of indulgence, but the fact is that the question before the House is that the Business of the Day be called on and I must put that motion. I take it that the Leader of the House wishes to proceed with his motion.",46
120,Mr SINCLAIR,THE PRIME MINISTER,"Yes , Mr Speaker.",46

Question so resolved in the affirmative. NA 78 CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1978 30 Bill presented by Mr Anthony, and read a first 48 time. Second Reading",46
122,Mr ANTHONY,EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill proposes amendment of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act to give effect to the Government's decision to authorise the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation to provide indemnities to banks or other financial institutions which issue tender, performance Macphee. 1. M. Martyr, J. R. or related guarantees. These guarantees are provided on behalf of Australianfirmstendering for or undertaking overseas contracts involving the export of goods or services from Australia. This facility, which I announced in February and outlined again in my statement to Parliament in April on the Government's new export initiatives, will greatly enhance the tender prospects of Australian exporters. The action is in line with the Government's policy of continually reviewing the range of facilities available through EFIC in the light of changes in world trading patterns and practices. It will ensure that Australian exporters are in a position to compete with their overseas competitors. The Bill also proposes a number of amendments of a housekeeping nature. These changes are designed to bring various provisions of the Act into line with those in recent comparable statutory authority legislation. They also cover the repeal of superannuation and judicial provisions which have been made redundant by subsequent legislation. In recent years performance and related guarantees and bonds have become an integral part of many overseas contracts and a prerequihas site to consideration of tenders, particularly Middle East markets. The Bill does not attempt to define precisely these contractual guarantees. However, in general terms arrangements such bid or tender bonds, performance guarantees, surety deposits, retention money guarantees and advance payment guarantees are covered. selves Guarantees are usually required in the form of written undertaking provided by a bank or finanbest cial institution. They guarantee the payment stated sum of money should the successful tenbanks derer fail to fulfil its contractual obhgations. They are normally issued against the security a firm's capital base or net worth and can vary from one or two per cent to as much as 20 per cent of the value of individual contracts. they represent a heavy contingent UabUity for Australian exporters. Many relatively Ughtly capitalised firms, ticularly consultants and contractors, have found they do not have the asset backing to meet the present criteria for the provision of performance guarantees. They are consequendy prevented from tendering for overseas contracts which quire such guarantees. In some cases this ation can arise as a result of a firm's success obtaining business both locally and overseas this can lead to the loss of worthwhUe export opportunities to which Australia is capable of responding. The growing size of international construction projects, the increasing magnitude of individual contracts and the impact of inflaCorporation tion on companyfinancialstructures are further factors compounding the problems facing banks and other bonders when considering the extent of the support they are able to provide. mate even the more substantially capitalised firms can experience difficulties in providing the security sought by theirfinanciersand the new facility will also help them to bid for additional overseas contracts. Given the level of expertise the Australian consultancy and construction inon dustries the Government considers that a greater level of export success can be achieved with improved bonding facUities. This type of facUity is not new. Governments in many overseas countries, for example the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Japan, have recognised the limitations of the commercial sector in this area and are facilitating the provision of performance guarantees through their official export credit andfinancingagencies. It is in these circumstances, and in the knowledge that export success by Australian consultants and contractors can lead to follow-up orders of Australian capital equipment, that the Government decided to introduce this facility. Although in the measures proposed wtil have the greatest application to the consultancy and construction industries it will not be restricted to them. Exas porters of products who encounter a need to provide bonds on overseas contracts, such as bid and tender bonds, will also be able to avail themof this new facUity. It is the Government's a view that the needs of Australian exporters can be met by EFIC indemnifying a portion of of a the UabUity involved in those instances where or otherfinancialinstitutions are unable to accommodate the total amount of a firm's reof quirements. The Australian trading banks, which presently cater for approximately 90 per cent of the guarantees provided for overseas contracts, As such welcome this approach. Under the provisions of the Bill EFIC will not provide guarantees directly to Australian firms. parRather, firms seeking guarantees for overseas contracts will continue to make the initial approach to the commercial sector. If the bank or otherfinancialinstitution is not in a position to provide the full amount of the guarantee, an apreproach can be made to EFIC for cover on the situbalance. The Corporation will seek maximum in private sector participation in each case and will and require a minimum private sector participation of five per cent. This requirement for private sector participation is embodied in the Bill, thus ensuring that EFIC supplements, rather than supplants, existing private sector facUities. The will assess each appUcation on commercial grounds before deciding to underwrite a particular guarantee. The Corporation will continue its present practice of declining to cover In this clicommercially unacceptable risks. In view of the risk factors associated with this type of business and with the Corporation's risk less well secured, the Government has deterin mined that an initial hmit of $30m will be placed the level of contingent liabUity in respect of performance guarantees provided by EFIC at any time. This approach is consistent with limits placed on EFIC's other facUities and wtil be reviewed in the Ught of the Corporation's experience in this new field. The Bill also provides for EFIC to refer cases which involve particularly highrisks,or which it is not authorised to undertake, to the Government for consideration in the national interest. This provision is similar to those which apply to EFIC's other facUities. Such applications wiU continue to require private sector participation. The Government believes that EFIC is well equipped for this particular task. Through the operation of its present payments insurance and credit facilities it has developed skills and has acquired experience in assessing the creditworthiness and integrity of overseas buyers. It also has considerable knowledge of the abUity of Australian consultants and contractors to fulfil overseas contracts. In addition EFIC has a close working relationship with the commercial and banking sectors and, as a member of the Berne Union, the international association of credit insurers, the Corporation has access to that body's substantial repository of technical knowledge and experience in this field. The introduction of this facUity forms a part the Government's enlarged export development program designed to encourage Australian firms to increase their export sales and more actively pursue export opportunities. The proposal to inin troduce this performance guarantee facUity has been enthusiastically welcomed by the Aus1980 tralian consultancy and construction industries. Its introduction will encourage these and other Australian export industries to tender for overto seas contracts which would have been beyond their reach without this new facUity. I commend this Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1978 Bill presented by Mr Sinclair, and read a first time.",46
123,Mr SINCLAIR,APPLE AND PEAR STABILIZATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to extend the apple and pear stabilisation scheme to cover the and 1980 export seasons and to alter the level of support provided under the scheme. The Bill provides for the Ufting of the support price apples during the two year extension from the current rate of $2 to $2.20 per box. The rate for ing Bill? pears would remain at 80c. However, the annual volume eUgible for support would be reduced from 2 mUUon boxes to 1.5 mUlion boxes for apples and from 1.4 mUlion to 1 mUUon boxes for pears. As in previous years support will be confined to 'at risk' sales to the markets of Europe for apples and Europe and North America for pears. In extending the stabilisation scheme for a further two years the Government has been mindful of its earlier announced intention to adjust the basis and the level of support. This decision followed consideration of the 1976 Industries Assistance Commission recommendation that StabUisation support be phased out completely by 1977. The Government had not accepted that recommendation because such action would have been unnecessarily harsh, particularly following the entry of the United Kingdom into the European Economic Community. In extending the stabilisation scheme for a further period the Government is conscious of the need to avoid promoting false hopes about of market expectations and the reduction in the volume of'at risk' apple exports covered by StabUisation to 1.5 million boxes is proposed with the likelihood of continued intensified competition European markets in mind. It is this likelihood of reduced export returns for apples in 1979 and that has prompted the Government to propose the increase in the maximum level of assistance to $2.20 per box. Pear exports are expected decline further from current levels and sales to the 'at risk' markets of Europe and North America are expected to be below the 1 million box volume to be covered by StabUisation. The apple and pear stabilisation scheme has played a significant role in underpinning the export operation in 1977 and 1978 and I believe that its role in the coming two years will be equally important. I should add that in addition to the proposals within stabilisation there is supplementary assistance which this season is to be Second Reading increased. Last season the Commonwealth and participated in providing such assistance with contributions up to a maximum of $500,000.

WHEAT TAX AMENDMENT BILL 1978 Bill presented by Mr Sinclair, and read a first time. Second Reading",49
127,Mr SINCLAIR,EXPORT DUTY COLLECTION," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Wheat Second Reading Tax Act 1957, as amended, to increase the maximum rate of tax for research purposes on wheat delivered to the Australian Wheat Board from 15c to 30c per tonne. The wheat research scheme which has operated since 1957 is one of a number of such national rural industry research and schemes supported by the Commonwealth. On basis of the report by the Industries Assistto ance Commission on the financing of rural reon search in Australia the Government last year reviewed and reaffirmed its policy of continuing to provide grants to national rural industry research schemes on the basis of matching dollar for dollar expenditure from funds contributed by producers raised by a levy on a national basis. Under the wheat research arrangements established by the Wheat Research Act 1957, the proceeds of the wheat tax which is collected on deliveries to the Australian Wheat Board are appropriated for expenditure on wheat research to the State wheat research committees in each mainland State in the proportions in which those proceeds are collected. The Commonwealth's contribution has been appropriated annually to finance research programs that are recommended by the Wheat Industry Research Council and approved by the Minister for Primary Industry. The Wheat Industry Research Council is constituted under the Wheat Research Act 1957. Second Reading The industry participates in the allocation of funds through representation on the State committee structure and on the Wheat Industry Research Council. The maintenance of a sound wheat research effort is important because of the productivity improvement benefits it affords to growers. It is also important to our interests as a major wheat exporter competing on the world market where quality considerations are important to buyers. Studies by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and other authorities have shown that an increase in yields is the most significant area for improving productivity gains in the wheat industry and either directly or indirectly a substantial part of the research funded by this scheme goes towards helping the grower increase his yields. Mamtaining and improving the quaUty of our wheat as measured by protein content and nulling characteristics is important if Australia is to hold its place in the international market and compete effectively with other exporters in meeting the discriminating demands of overseas buyers. Improvement of yield absorbs the greatest amount of research funds under the scheme. Projects range from disease control, especially fungal diseases, breeding for special characteristics such as climatical and disease tolerance, nutritional requirements in various wheat growing soUs, to weed control and assessment of yield losses arising from weeds. Wheat quality research includes the breeding and selection of grain quaUty characteristics such as protein content and mUling properties. In that field significant advances are being made in methods for determining quality at early stages of growth of the wheat plant. Research continues also into aspects of farm operations such as optimal tillage and fertiliser practices with a view to minimising costs. Several specialised types of sowing and cultivation equipment have been developed, using funds from the research scheme, and are currently being evaluated. A considerable amount of research effort is being directed towards the safest and cheapest methods of storing harvested grain. In this area the development of methods for refrigerating bulk grain has been perhaps the most notable, whUe more conventional fumigation methods continue to be improved. The Australian Wheat growers Federation, representing the wheat industry, has requested that the maximum rate of tax specified in the be raised to 30c per tonne. The Act provides the actual rate of tax is as prescribed by reguensures lation from time to time. While asking for the maximum rate to be raised the Federation has also sought an increase in the the present 15c to 20c per tonne. Once this amending legislation is enacted this request will be given consideration by the Government. The present maximum rate of tax of 15c per tonne was established by amendment to the Act in 1973. The operative rate has been at this maximum level since 1975. In these three years wheat time. research expenditure from tax proceeds and the Commonwealth's contribution has increased from $2.53m in 1975-76 to $3.34m in 1977-78. It is estimated that expenditure in 1978-79 total some $3.32m. Research costs have increased along with the general level of inflaThe tion, so the higher levels of expenditure since 1975 to 1977-78 do not reflect an equivalent crease in the level of real research effort. The drought-reduced 1977-78 crop has resulted in a reduced avaUabUity of funds for research expenditure in 1978-79. A drawing down of reserves of the Wheat Industry Research Council and most State wheat research committees has been necessary to maintain the overall level of research spending in 1978-79 at approximately last year's level. Clearly this represents a reduction in the level of real research effort this year. A viable research program is of fundamental importance to the future of our wheat industry. Increased contributions made possible by this Bill will be most helpful in sustaining the research effort of the wheat industry. I commend this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned.

The amendment provides for a change in the procedures for the appropriation of the Commonwealth's contribution to the wheat research scheme. Instead of the present procedure whereby the Commonwealth's contribution is provided by an annual appropriation in the Appropriation Bill (No. 1), the amendment provides for a special appropriation under the Wheat Research Act. This procedural change will bring the wheat research arrangements into Act Une with the provisions in more recently estabthat lished rural research schemes.

129,Mr SINCLAIR,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. purpose of this Bill is to amend the Poultry Industry Assistance Act 1965 so as to increase the inlevel of funds available for poultry research. In addition to the principal amending clause of this Bill, the Parliamentary Counsel has incorporated a number of formal drafting amendments in the interests of clarity and standardisation of expressions. The Poultry Industry Assistance lated legislation were introduced in 1965 for the purpose of imposing a levy on hens over six months of age in commercial flocks exceeding 20. The levy money paid into the Poultry Indusfor try Trust Fund is disbursed as grants to the States for the stabilisation of the poultry industry. Commonwealth subvention is involved in such try payments. The Poultry Industry Assistance Act was amended in 1966 to provide, among other matters, that, in addition to the disbursement the States, the money in the Trust Fund could be allocated for research purposes. The amending legislation laid down that the Commonwealth Government would meet one-half of the expenfinancial diture on research, up to a maximum of present $200,000 in a financial year. The present Bill seeks to raise that limit by 50 per cent. In 1968 the Council of Egg Marketing expenditure Authorities of Australia-CEMAA-establishe d be a Poultry Research Advisory Committee, to procrease pose each year a suitable research program. The the Bill. total allocation for research to date, that dustry plus Commonwealth funds, amounts to $2,171,053, including $260,649 for the 1978-79 program. The funds have been and are being used for research into the control of diseases, work on nutritional studies, for investigation of egg quality aspects, together with some research dealing with genetic improvement for hens. Over the years, research projects have produced notable benefits and others show promising results. Summaries of the work are to be found in the several reports of the Committee. These reports, although not statutory documents, have been tabled for the information of the Parhain ment from time to time. In addition to its reports, the Committee arranges for a continuing flow of articles on current research topics for publication in industry journals directed to poultry farmers. Rising costs through the nine years since poultry research arrangements began have had the effect of eroding the volume of research effort that can be supported by the unchanged and ited research funds. The industry considers that insufficient resources are being devoted to search generally but more especially in the marketing and economic research field. A detailed market research survey was recently comlaneousfinancingtransactions, missioned, using existing poultry research funds. This survey developed from the earlier quantitatings ive studies funded by the State egg marketing boards. The current survey is examining consumer attitudes to eggs, egg products and egg marketing systems. It is designed to give a better understanding of the factors that influence buying patterns and to provide a sounder basis for Act and refuture marketing techniques. The poultry industry does not consider it practicable to reduce the already low level of funding technical and biological research to the extent necessary to accommodate a continuing research No program into marketing. Accordingly, the indusoffered to increase its annual contribution by $50,000 so that an effective marketing and economic research program can be maintained. The to Government has agreed to match that offer. With passage of this Bill, the total amount available for poultry research in any one financial year, commencing with the current 1978-79 year, will become, instead of the $200,000, a maximum of $300,000, with the Government's share being up to $150,000. It is estimated that in the currentfinancialyear the increase will involve additional Government of about $23,000. The industry is to congratulated for its initiative in offering to inits expenditure on research. I commend is, inDebate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. LOAN BILL 1978 Bill presented by Mr Eric Robinson, (on befor half of Mr Howard), and read afirsttime. Second Reading",50
130,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to provide legislative authority needed to meet the prospective deficit the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1978-79. At the sametimeit will, together with authorities expected to be available under other legislation, provide the borrowing authority needed to finance the estimated overall Budget deficit for thefinancialyear to be undertaken. Honourable the members will be aware that, for many years there has been legislation for these purposes in the legislative programs of successive governlimments. In the Budget Speech the Treasurer (Mr Howard) announced that the prospective overall reBudget deficit for 1978-79 is estimated to be $2,813m. Except in so far as funds are available from accumulated cash balances or other miscelthis deficit must befinancedby net borrowings. Such net borrowmust, of course, be within proper authority from the Parhament. The overall Budget deficit takes into account all relevant transactions of the three separate funds used to record the Commonwealth's receipts and expenditures. These funds are the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the Loan Fund and the Trust Fund. The amounts which may be paid from each fund are limited to the amounts legally available to it. Underlying the overall deficit estimated for 1978-79 is an estimated deficit in the ConsoUdated Revenue Fund of $1,903.5m. DetaUs of the current estimate of the Consohdated Revenue Fund transactions are set out, for the information of honourable members, in table 3 of Budget Paper No. 4-Estimate s of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure for the year ending 30 June 1979. As payment from the Consolidated Revenue Fund cannot exceed moneys avaUable in it, it is necessary either to reduce payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund by charging to Loan Fund some expenditures normally met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, or alternatively, to supplement the receipts of the ConsoUdated Revenue Fund from some other source. Appropriate legislative authority is needed for such transfers. The simplest and traditional means of providing appropriate legislative authority is a Loan Bill of the type I am now presenting. This Bill wtil authorise borrowings for defence purposes in order that defence expenditure, which would normally be met from the ConsoUdated Revenue Fund, may instead be met from the Loan Fund. The Bill authorises borrowing for defence purposes, but it does not authorise any defence expenditures additional to those which have already been authorised by Parliament in Supply Act (No. 1) 1978-79 or which will subsequently be authorised in appropriation Acts for thisfinancialyear. It wtil simply allow reallocations between the Consolidated Revenue Fund and the Loan Fund of defence expenditures to be made during the remainder of the financial year, following the enactment of this legislation. In this regard I draw the attention of honourable members to clause 8 of the recently introduced Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1978-79, which makes that Bill subject to the provisions of the proposed Loan Act. I should also mention that as borrowings under this legislation will be for the purpose offinancingdefence expenditure, those borrowings will not require approval from the Australian Loan Council. However, the Bill includes a specific limit to the amount of such borrowings that may be undertaken; this limit is directly related to the level of defence expenditure which is expected to be made from the date of enactment of the Bill to 30 June 1979. Honourable members wtil be well aware that at this early stage the estimate of the ConsoUdated Revenue Fund deficit is inevitably a qualified one. The actualfigurefor the year wtil be affected by presently unforeseen developments during the year which could cause departures from current estimates of receipts and payments of the Fund. In setting a limit on borrowings for inclusion in the Bill these inherent uncertainties need to be recognised. The limit that has been included is $2,000m. This provides a relatively small margin over the estimated ConsoUdated Revenue Fund deficit of $ 1,903.5 m. Borrowings under this proposed legislation wtil be undertaken within the framework of the monetary policy objectives which were referred to in the Budget Speech. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by MrMorris) adjourned. STATES GRANTS (CAPITAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 1978 Bill presented by Mr Eric Robinson, (on behalf of Mr Howard), and read afirsttime. Second Reading",51
131,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,POULTRY INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE," I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the payment of capital grants to the States in 1978-79, totalling $477,933,000. This amount represents the grant component of the Loan Council program for State governments in 1978-79 and is one-third of the total program of $ 1,433.8m agreed at the June 1978 Loan Council meeting. The Bill also provides for the payment of capital grants in the first six months of 1979-80 up to an amount equal to one-half of the 1978-79 amount, pending passage of legislation to authorise grants in 1979-80. Payments authorised under this Bill may be made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund or from the Loan Fund, and appropriate borrowing authority is included. This is consistent with past practice. These grants represent a continuation of arrangements initiated by the Liberal-Country Party Government in June 1970, which provided that portion of the State governments' Loan Council programs should take the form of interest-free non-repayable grants in lieu of what would otherwise be interest-bearing borrowings by the States. The effect of the grants is to relieve the States of debt charges which they would otherwise have to pay, and the grants accordingly have a substantial beneficial effect on the States'financialpositions. The grants were introduced to help the States finance works such as schools, police buildings and the like from which debt charges are not normally recovered. The States are, however, entirely free to apply these grants as they choose and no terms or conditions are attached to them. Turning to the details of the Bill, clause 3 orises the payment of grants to the States totalling $477,933,000 in 1978-79 and clause 4 authorises the Treasurer to make advance payments in the first six months of 1979-80 at the same annual rate as in the currentfinancialyear. The amounts payable to each State are set out in the Schedule to the Bill. Clause 5 of the Bill provides for payments to be made either from Consolidated Revenue Fund or Loan Fund and clause 9 provides for the necessary appropriation of these funds. The extent to which the payments will be met from Loan Fund will depend in part on the level of government borrowings during the year, and this cannot be precisely estimated at this point. Clauses 6 and 7 of the Bill authorise the Treasurer to borrow funds in the period from the commencement of the Act to the end of December 1979, up to the total of the amounts of the grants payable in 1978-79 and in thefirstsix months of 1979-80. This borrowing authority will be reduced by the amount of any borrowings made before the enactment of this Bill, under the authority of the States Grants (Capital Assistance) Act 1977, which may have been used to finance grants made in the first six months of 1978-79. I turn now to the general context in which this Bill is being introduced. The grants which are the subject of this Bill form part of the Commonwealth's total assistance to the States prises no less than 36.4 per cent of Commonwealth Budget outlays. In this year of great stringency, these payments and net advances to the States from the Commonwealth Budget are estimated to increase by 5.1 per cent. It hardly be expected that payments to the States could be immune from the rigorous approach to which all other Commonwealth outlays have the been subjected. This was both necessary and sponsible. Nevertheless, Commonwealth general purpose payments to the States, which are most important element of payments to the States and of which the grants proposed in this Bill form a part, in total are estimated to increase by 7.9 per cent to $6,232.5m. On present estiassistance mates these general purpose payments to the States should thus increase in 1978-79. Specific purposes payments are estimated increase by 1.7 per cent in 1978-79. In addition to these funds provided to the States there are the Loan Council borrowing programs for the States' larger semi-government and local authorities. These are estimated to increase by 8.5 per cent in 1978-79. These funds for the States' authorities are not Commonwealth authBudget outlays, but they are an important source of funds for the States' policies, and, of course, their level affects the market for Commonwealth bonds and the extent of Commonwealth support needed for the State government borrowing programs, which are underwritten by the Commonwealth. The overall picture then is that restraint has had to be applied to Commonwealth payments to the States, as they have to other Commonwealth outlays; but these restraints have been applied in such a way as to leave the States with the maximum flexibility to allocate their resources according to their own priorities. I emphasise that this flexibility includes the flexibility to use general revenue funds from the Commonwealth for capital purposes and vice versa. This Bill provides one-third of the State governments' Loan Council programs by way of an interest-free grant. It is an important measure in the overall arrangements for Commonwealth assistance to the States. I commend this Bill to the house. Bill (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned.

132,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,LYELL MINING AND RAILWAY," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this amending Bill is to permit continuation of assistance to Tasmania for a refurther three months up to 30 September 1978 in respect of the continued operation of the Mount the Lyell mine at Queenstown. Honourable members will recall that the principal Act provided for assistance to Tasmania for Mt Lyell for the period ending on 30 June 1978 and that the was provided pending the final Industries Assistance Commission's report on copper real terms in ores and concentrates. The Government considered the final report into June and it decided that the Commonwealth Government would negotiate with Tasmania and the Mount Lyell company on the question of any future assistance for the Mount Lyell mine being shared by the three parties. Ministers from the Commonwealth and Tasmania met company representatives on 14 August 1978. Discussions were frank, with the company expressing its concern for effects of mine closure on the Queenstown region while at the same time acquainting Ministers with the outlook for the Mount Lyell mine in the short to medium term. The Government will be considering the proposals advanced by the company and the Tasmanian Government during those discussions and an announcement will be made as soon as the Government has reached a decision on the matter. The Government previously announced that pending the outcome of the negotiations it proposed to continue assistance to Tasmania for the Mount Lyell mine for a further three month period from 1 July 1978 on the terms and conditions which applied in the period to 30 June 1978. This Bill, therefore, seeks to extend the end of the period of assistance from 30 June 1978, as provided in the principal Act, to 30 September 1978. In accord with the terms of the previous Agreement, the Tasmanian Government has indicated that it will continue to remit payroll tax due by the company during the three-month period while the Commonwealth would meet the balance of the cash deficit including the cost of necessary capital and developmental expenditure. The level of assistance which the Commonsurance wealth will need to provide is dependent on the price of copper and it is difficult to foreshadow future price movements. A recent estimate, howstatutory, ever, indicates that Commonwealth assistance the order of $lm will be required for the period. Following the termination on 30 June 1978 the previous Commonwealth-Tasmania Agreement, and pending the enactment of this legisequate lation, Tasmania will bear the cost of assistance necessary for the mine's continued operation. The Bill, therefore, will have the effect of abling the Commonwealth to reimburse expenproblems diture paid by the State in the first instance. commend the bill to honourable members.

133,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,LYELL MINING AND RAILWAY," I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. This Bill, which relates to the Northern Territory, has a simple purpose. Commonwealth and State government departments and authorities are entitled to exemption from sales tax on goods purchased for their official use and not for sale. The relevant exemption, however, does not extend to departments and authorities controlled by the Northern Territory Government which came into being on 1 July 1978. The Bill is designed to extend this exemption to goods for official use and not for sale by departments and authorities under the control of the Northern Territory Government. A memorandum explaining the provisions of the Bill is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned.

134,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,LIFE INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Life InAct 1945 to bring the provisions applying to the Life Insurance Commissioner into line with more recent legislation relating to similar offices. More specifically, the Bill will to enable the terms and conditions of appointment and service of the Commissioner to be deterof mined under the Life Insurance Act. The existing legislation does not contain adprovisions to allow for determinations to be made of the remuneration and other conditions applicable to the appointment of a Comenmissioner. This deficiency has not presented any in the past as occupants of the office of I Commissioner have until recently also occupied the position of Australian Government Actuary created under the Public Service Act and have been entitled to the salary and conditions applicable to that position. In view of the increased workloads of the posof Life Insurance Commissioner and Australian Government Actuary, it is no longer appropriate for these two positions to be filled by the one person and when the positions became vacant last year upon the retirement of Mr S. W. Caffin, it was concluded that the positions should be 'split' and filled by separate persons. Earlier this year the Treasurer announced the appointment of Mr G. L. Melville as Life Insurance Commissioner and Mr J. R. Ford as Australian Government Actuary. Pending amendment of the Life Insurance Act, the present Commissioner's salary and other conditions of appointment are subject to temporary arrangements agreed to by the Pubhc Service Board and the Remuneration Tribunal. The Bill will enable the arrangements applying to the Commissioner to be placed on a permanent basis. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Bill (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. QUARANTINE AMENDMENT BILL 1978 Bill presented by Mr Hunt, and read a first time.",54
135,Mr HUNT,LIFE INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The main purpose of the Bill is to increase penalties that may be imposed upon persons California convicted of offences against the quarantine of Australia. The existing penalties remained unchanged for almost a decade and are not now commensurate with the gravity of quarantine offences; nor do they provide an equate deterrent to persons contemplating a deliberate breach of quarantine. Quarantine breaches should be regarded as particularly serious in view of their possible outcome. Nothave withstanding the remarkable success achieved the world fight against smallpox, many other human diseases continue to pose serious probwhere lems overseas. These, and the newly emergent and dangerous viral haemorrhagic fevers, such as lassa fever and marburg virus disease, emphapersons, sise the need for continuing vigilance and effective and responsive quarantine service. Honourable members will no doubt know that despite the best efforts of health authorities in countries concerned, rabies continues its steady spread across Western Europe. We have sucrecord ceeded in keeping this dreaded disease out of countries. Australia for a century and continue to apply the most rigorous controls on the importation of animals which could be a source of infection. The establishment of this disease in Australia, could follow an illegal importation of a cat dog, would have profound effects on all Ausat tralians, requiring them to adopt a whole new lifestyle and a change in their attitudes to domestic pets and indigenous animals. In the animal and plant healthfields,I am sure all honourable members appreciate that Australia's rural production and the advantages we enjoy on overseas markets for our livestock and agricultural products depend critically on our comparative freedom from serious pests and diseases. It has been estimated, for example, that an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Australia could cost this country up to $600m per annum. Such a disaster would have grave economic and social consequences for all Australians. It has been shown that illegal importation is a most important factor in the world spread of animal and plant diseases. In this regard I refer honourable members to a recent incident in Australia where Newcastle disease was diagnosed in a consignment of illegally imported Indonesian birds. If this disease spread amongst our bird population there would be an immediSecond Reading ate and substantial drop in our export earnings and complete disruption of our poultry industry. action by quarantine authorities in this case averted any spread of the disease from the smuggled birds. Nevertheless, the importance of this incident is well illustrated by overseas exthe perience. A Newcasde disease outbreak in in 1971-72 involved the destruction of laws some 12 miUion birds and cost the American have people well over $56m. It is only in comparatively recent decades that adthe natural quarantine protection afforded by Australia's geographic location has been eroded. The comforting isolation of our island position and the natural barriers of time and distance become less relevant as transport has bein come speedier and more flexible, and trade and travel have increased, particularly from areas many exotic diseases are well established. In the face of these developments, honourable members will know that conventional entry of animals and goods into Australia is rigan orously controlled. No country can guarantee continuing exclusion of all exotic diseases. However, the Government is firmly committed to continue all practical measures necessary to the minimise the possibUity of such diseases being introduced and to maintain the quarantine which continues to be the envy of other Honourable members will be aware from the announcement by my colleague the Minister for which Transport (Mr Nixon) on 9 July that the or Government has become increasingly concerned the activities of foreign fishing vessels and others off our northern shores. Any unauthorised landing on the Austrahan coast constitutes a risk of disease introduction. This factor, coupled with the special problems of distance and remoteness across our northern shores, and our relative proximity to countries where major exotic diseases exist, was a major consideration in the decision announced by my colleague to upgrade Austraha's northern surveillance. The new arrangements, which will be implemented as soon as appropriate arrangements can be made, will include a daily aerial search by charter aircraft of the northern coastline between Geraldton in Western Australia and Cairns in Queensland. The purpose of this program, from a quarantine viewpoint, will be to alert quarantine authorities to any matters of quarantine significance and provide a basis for immediate quarantine follow-up where necessary. The Government is acutely aware that there is a greater need than ever before to maintain an effective quarantine system and the legislation which provides the framework for that system must be adequate for the task. The Government, however, accepts that a sound quarantine system not only requires tough penalties for quarantine breaches but also must provide a framework which will encourage public co-operation. In this respect, honourable members will know that we have embarked on a comprehensive program of quarantine station development initiated, amongst other things, to facilitate importation of small animals into this country. Extended waiting periods for quarantine station accommodation increase the incentive for illegal importation. As an example of the seriousness with which the Government views breaches of quarantine, I draw the attention of honourable members to the proposed maximum penalty in respect of the offences against section 50 of the Act. This tion prohibits the landing of any imported plants or animals in a place other than a proclaimed port. The Bill proposes to increase the maximum penalty for a breach of that provision from $500 or six months imprisonment to $5,000 or two years imprisonment. As another example, I quarantine would draw the attention of honourable penalties members to the proposed maximum penalty proportant vided under sub-section (1) of section Act, which prohibits a person from knowingly bringing into Australia any goods, animals, plants, disease agents, et cetera, in contravention of the Act. Offences of this sort strike at the very foundation of our quarantine barrier and call for an extremely severe penalty. It is proposed therefore that the maximum monetary penalty be increased from $2,000 to $10,000. I have time. directed my Department to maintain a rigorous approach to quarantine enforcement backed by firm prosecution action where appropriate. All quarantine personnel have been assured that they have the strong support of the Government in carrying out their quarantine duties and responsibilities. I now turn to the manner of dealing with offences. At present, offences against section 79, forging documents, and section 83, misleading a quarantine officer, are expressed as indictable offences and cannot be dealt with in a court of summary jurisdiction. In line with provisions in other Acts, the Bill proposes that these offences may be prosecuted in courts of summary jurisdiction and that these courts, when disposing of a matter, be empowered to impose a maximum fine of $2,000 or one year's imprisonment. However the Bill also provides that where an offence may be prosecuted summarily or upon indictment and that prosecution is brought in a court of summary jurisdiction, that court may commit the defendant for trial or, if it is satisfied that it is proper to do so, with the consent of the prosecutor, as well as the defendant, may determine the proceedings summarily. At present, the consent of the defendant only is required. This amendment would protect the right of the prosecution in appropriate cases to require proceedings to be determined in a jurisdiction where higher penalties are available. The Bill further provides that the maximum penalty which may be imposed by regulation under the Act be increased from $1,000 to $2,000. Amendments to the penalties applicable for specific offences against the regulations are being prepared. Finally, the Bill provides that value of goods which cannot be effectively sectreated and which may be destroyed without prior ministerial approval be increased from $20 to $200, the present $20 limit is administratively inefficient and out of line with present day values. The Bill before the House reflects the Government's firm commitment to an effective system for Austraha. A realistic set of for quarantine breaches is a most imcomponent of this system. I commend 67 of the the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1978 Bill presented by Mr Hunt, and read a first",55
136,Mr HUNT,HOMELESS PERSONS ASSISTANCE," I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. The purpose of the Bill is to extend for a further period of 12 months, those provisions of Homeless Persons Assistance Act which are due to expire on 13 December 1978. This is to for full consultation with State governments future arrangements to meet the needs of home1978-79 less people in the light of the experience with program to date. As honourable members will aware, the Homeless Persons Assistance Act was introduced in December 1974 on the basis report by a working party on homeless men and women. The program has been kept under close review since then, and has been the subject of specinc evaluation by the Department of Social Security including careful scrutiny by the homeless persons advisory committees estabUshed in each State. A report on the process of evaluation, entitled 'A Place of Dignity' was tabled Minister for Social Security (Senator GuUfoyle) on 9 June 1978. The working party on homeless men and ing, women recommended amongst other things, that capital grants totalling up to $5m a year should be made avaUable over a three-year period to voluntary agencies and local and tory authorities for approved projects-suc h as night shelters, reception and assessment centres, hostels, flats, day centres, special clinics and detoxification units-in order to upgrade and place existing inadequate accommodation build new facilities for permanently and recognised chronically homeless men and women. The Act provides for capital grants to be made to eUgible organisations, which are defined as non-profit organisations, local governing bodies and charitable or benevolent trusts, towards the full cost of purchasing, constructing or renting buildings, including the purchase of furniture and equipment. It also enables the Commonwealth to pay 50 cent of the salary of a social welfare worker employed at a homeless persons assistance centre. Approved organisations may also be paid a daUy subsidy at prescribed rates for each homeless person to whom both food and acsharing commodation are provided, at a rate day, and a subsidy of 25c for each meal supphed to non-resident homeless persons. For the information of honourable members, capital grants totalling $9.8m have been approved under the Act to date. Of this amount, $3.5m had been actually expended by 30 June 1978, $3.6m has been aUocated for expenditure Second Reading in 1978-79 and the remaining $2.7m will be carried forward to 1979-80. Expenditure on rental and salary subsidies for the period from 13 December 1974 to 30 June 1978 totalled $646,665. The appropriation for these subsidies in 1978-79 is $285,000. Expenditure under the the national welfare fund on accommodation and meal subsidies for the period from 13 December allow 1974 to 30 June 1978 amounted to $2.6m. on Estimated expenditure on these subsidies in is $lm. As at 30 June 1978, financial the support was being given towards the running be costs of 106 homeless persons centres, with a total bed capacity of 3,410. Subsidy made avaUof a able in 1977-78 represents 990,759 people assisted. In addition 847,774 meals were served to non-resident homeless people. Salary subsidies were paid for 37 social welfare workers. The Government has no doubt about the importance of this program, nor its effectiveness in helping to upgrade the standard of facUities for by the homeless men and women in many areas of Australia. Complementary to the assistance that has been provided under this program, 76 women's refuges have been approved for fundat an estimated cost of some $3m this financial year, through the community health program. Because of the involvement of the State governments in many aspects of services for statuhomeless people, the Government has decided that it is appropriate at this stage to extend the Act for a further year, to allow fuU consultations with the States on future arrangements. This is in reUne with the spirit of the report of the working and to party on homeless men and women, which the need for consultation concerning the continued development of service by all levels of government and voluntary agencies to meet the needs of homeless people. As honourable members will recall, the Act was extended for a further period of one year per from December last, so as to allow time for further development and review. The Government believes that the program is now sufficiently well estabUshed to warrant discussion with State governments on then views about the of responsibilities in this area. I comof 75c a mend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. STATES GRANTS (HOME CARE) AMENDMENT BILL 1978 Bill presented by Mr Hunt, and read a first time.",57
137,Mr HUNT,HOMELESS PERSONS ASSISTANCE," I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. The purpose of the Bill is to provide for direct matching grants, with the States for a range of home care services, and for the salaries of approved welfare officers employed at or in association with senior citizen's centres. The Bill provides for continuation of subsidy on a $2 for $ 1 basis, for the capital cost of senior citizen's centres. Thus, the Bill gives effect to policies announced at the most recent Premiers Conference which recognise that the State governments are in the best position to assess the requirements for home care services and to determine their priorities accordingly. As announced at the Premiers Conference, the new subsidy arrangements are to have effect on and from 1 July 1978 in respect of home care services, and for welfare officer salaries for a salary period commencing on or after 1 July 1978. The States Grants (Home Care) Act was introduced in 1969 on the basis of a recommendation made at the 1968 health Ministers conference. The Act broadly provides three forms of assistance: Home Care Services Senior Citizens' Centres Welfare Officers . . Total . . . .",58
138,Mr HUNT,HOMELESS PERSONS ASSISTANCE,"Because of the need for continuing constraint in the Government's expenditure, it has not been possible recently to approve new welfare officer positions or new home care services. Nevertheless, there has been a significant expansion of existing services to meet new needs. Further, this particular legislation is but one avenue of Commonwealth financial assistance for those requiring support services to continue to live independently in their own homes. Other important services include meals-on-wheels, subsidised under separate legislation also administered by the Department of Social Security, expenditure on which has increased by nearly 30 per cent in the last three years to an estimated $2.3m this financial year, and domiciliary nursing care programs, which involved Commonwealth expenditure lastfinancialyear of $ 10.7m. The estimate for the current financial year is $ 12.1m. It has been suggested in some quarters Second Reading Firstly, for home care service schemes which provide housekeeping and other domestic assistance to aged people in their own homes; secondly, for the building and equipping of senior citizens' centres; and thirdly, for the employment of welfare officers employed by, or in association with, senior citizens' centres. A later amendment to the Act increased the subsidy from one-half to two-thirds of expenditure through the States. The importance of locally based home care and welfare officer services for aged and infirm people is fully recognised by the Government. Indeed, provision is made for significant overall increases in assistance for domiciliary services in this year's Budget. For the states grants home care program overall, there is an increase of 12.28 per cent in the estimates for this financial year, over the expenditure for lastfinancialyear. For the home care services component of the program, there has been an 83.5 per cent increase in estimated expenditure for this year over that for the financial year 1975-76, when the Government took office. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table outlining Commonwealth expenditure over the past three years. Leave granted. The table read asfollows1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 (est.) $m $m $m Sm 5.668 6.891 9.138 10.4 3.561 3.997 3.946 4.0 .648 .670 .721 1.1 9.877 11.558 13.805 15.5 that the Government is suddenly withdrawing from funding home care services, causing large numbers of aged and infirm people to look to nursing homes and other institutions for help. The fact is that the Commonwealth will continue to match every dollar allocated by the States for approved welfare officer and home care services. As I have already indicated, the new arrangements for the program were announced at the time of the Premiers Conference in June, and of course are fully in line with the Government's policy of federalism, which recognises that State and local governments are well placed to assume greater responsibility for locally based programs of this nature. Provided that State governments act responsibly within the framework of the federalism policy, there is no reason to believe that there will be any reduction in the level of welfare officer and home care services. Indeed, it could be anticipated that the States will allot a high ority to these services, which make a contribution to maintaining people in their own homes. There are currently 112 welfare officers whose salaries are being subsidised under the States Grants (Home Care) Act. Of this number, more than 100 are employed directly by local governing bodies. The main function of a welfare officer is to provide a link between aged persons living in their own homes and domiciliary and other supportive welfare services. The activities and responsibilities of welfare officers vary according to local needs and priorities, but in general include determination of the needs of the aged population and the development of services and facilities to meet these needs; liaison with committees of senior citizens' centres and service clubs for the purpose of establishing or extending the centres' services and facilities; supervision of the services provided; fostering co-operation and liaison among various welfare activities for aged persons and encouraging interest in these activities; and providing an education program which will encourage senior citizens' centres to promote purposeful activities. Home care services which can be subsidised under the legislation include home visiting, laundry and shopping services, home handyman and related home maintenance schemes, housekeeper and other services which complement health or welfare programs designed to enhance the independence of aged and infirm people Uving at home. I am sure that all honourable members will recognise the importance of every encourageraising ment being given to the States to maintain, and as necessary expand, their commitment to the home care program which will encourage independent living of aged and infirm people for as long as possible, and help for people to seek institutional care. As I have shown, it is simply not true that the Commonwealth has in some way absolved itself of sponsibUity in thisfield.Rather, the Government is seeking to build on the present partnership with State and local governments in the context of increased overall funding for these services. commend the Bill to the House.

139,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) today raised an issue of privilege arising out of an article published in the magazine the Bulletin dated 22 August 1978. The aUegation hi the article was that the Prime Minister pri- (Mr Malcolm Fraser) requested the Minister for Finance (Mr Eric Robinson) to write a letter to him, the Prime Minister, in certain terms. There is no evidence in the article which supports the allegation that the request was made. It is in fact a bare allegation. There is no admission in the article that the request was made. In the House today the allegation was put directly to the Minister for Finance in terms of a question. The Leader of the Opposition said: I ask the Minister for Finance: Has he at any stage been asked by the Prime Minister or anyone else to write a letter declaring that certain evidence he gave to the MCGregor Royal Commission was faulty because it was based on an uncertain memory? If so, what was the Minister's response to this highly improper request? The Minister for Finance replied: No one has ever suggested to me that my testimony be altered in any way whatsoever. The Prime Minister subsequently said: . . . so far as any knowledge that I may have is concerned, the reply of the Minister for Finance is completely and absolutely accurate. The Minister for Finance has not raised any matter of privUege relating to the allegation. He has denied the basis of the article's allegation. To ask the Privilege's Committee to determine whether a breach of privUege has occurred in this circumstance would be to ask that Committee to undertake an inquisitorial role rather than its proper role of judging whether facts which are established amount to a breach of privilege. This article in itself does not establish a prima facie case of breach of privilege. Here the allegations are denied and the Leader of the Opposition, in the matter of privilege, has not presented anything additional to what is contained in the article. I therefore rule that there is no prima facie breach of privilege.",59

Could I draw your attention to what the Minister said? It was: No one has ever suggested to me that my testimony be altered in any way whatsover. I believe that is capable of being read as saying 'No one has asked me to change the assertions, the statements, the wording that I expressed before the Royal Commission', which is a totally different thing from saying' No one has asked me to say that when I said those things I recognised, although I did not acknowledge it, that my recollection of events may have been faulty or somewhat defective'. I suggest that in that respect it is a rather clever answer and whilst seeming to rebut the allegation in fact skates around it.",59
143,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I must point out to the honourable gentleman that he is debating the issue. There is no basis on which he is able to debate it. If I failed to rule that there is a prima facie case then there is nothing upon which the honourable gentleman can speak except as a matter of indulgence. If I fail to rule that there is a prima facie case, the matter cannot take precedence over other business. I permitted the honourable gentleman as a matter of indulgence to make a point, but now he is debating it. I point out that very many articles make allegations, and I think it would be a gross misuse of the Privileges Committee to ask that Committee to investigate allegations, which would thereby be multiplied from the mere fact that the Privileges Committee was investigating in an inquisitorial role. In my view, before long that would lead to putting in jeopardy the whole concept of privilege.

152,Mr MACPHEE,PRIVILEGE," I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. This Bill represents the first of a number of proposed changes to Australian industrial property legislation which I hope to introduce into the Parliament later in the session. The legislation will be aimed at better adapting industrial property legislation and catering for the practical needs of Australian industry and commerce. The initial changes are particularly intended to modify and extend the scope of existing legislation to encourage increased industrial productivity through innovation and improved commercial competitiveness. At the turn of this century Australia had achieved a high level of innovative activity. The necessities created by a different geographical environment and worsening economic conditions lead to outstanding and profitable inventions in the agricultural field. Innovative activity not only improves productivity but more importantly it creates new employment opportunities. I see my portfolio as having a major role to play in the development of a climate in Australia which is more conducive to innovation having direct industrial application and this I see as the main purpose of"" a patent system. The ownership of inventions, trade marks and designs creates important monopoly rights recognised to a greater or lesser degree in most countries. Laws in Australia in the past have tended to concentrate on the narrow legal issues of the regulation and grant of those monopoly rights. Little attention has been given to benefits which may accrue to an industrialised society by the existence or non-existence of industrial property laws. I have been concerned at this apparent lack of a coherent policy in developing industrial property laws relevant to Australia's present and future industrial capacity. For this reason I have established an Industrial Property Advisory Committee which comprises industry, technical and economics representation. This Committee is an ongoing body which will tinuous review of our industrial property laws and practices and advise me on proposals to reform industrial property laws and practices. The present Bill involves a change in the rent provisions of the Patents Acting the publication of Australian patent specifications in order to reduce the period during which the information contained documents is unavailable to the Austrahan pubUc. The primary purpose of that change is to encourage a positive approach to invention by Australian industry by providing it with earlier access than is presently avaUable to the technical developments which are the subject of an appliincreasing cationforpatent protection in this country. Currently, approximately 11,000 effective patent applications are lodged in Australia annuapproximately ally in respect of inventions made both in this country and overseas. Each application includes a document-the so-called complete nical specification-containin g a fuU description of the technological advance made by the inventor fore and, additionally, a definition of the scope of the patent monopoly claimed by the applicant. tive Under the present legislation, a complete foreign specification is not required to be published until 18 months after the date of lodgement of document at the Patent Office. As the legislation also provides that a complete specification need not be lodged untU 12 months after the filing of an Australian application for a patent or the filing of an earUer foreign application for protecticularly tion of the same invention, the present provision for the publication of complete specifications volves a delay of up to 2Vi years during which formation on technological developments connificance sidered sufficiently important by their owners be made the subject of patent protection is unavaUable to Australian industry. Moreover, even if information of such developments is obcants tainable from other sources, industries interested in commercially exploiting such developments, are unable during that period to determine whether they are entitled to do so without infringing an Australian patent.",60

156,Mr SCHOLES,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. Is it not out of order for an honourable member to make deliberately untrue curstatements in the House, as the honourable 1952 governmember for Bendigo just did?",61
157,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,I do not regard in those that as any point of order.,61
158,Mr MACPHEE,PRIVILEGE,"The present provisions in the Patents Act for the publication of complete specifications also involve a further disadvantage to Australian industry as a result of a recent and trend in the patent laws of the major overseas industrial countries to require earlier publication of patent specifications than is provided in Australia under those provisions. As 90 per cent of effective patent applications in Australia are based on prior overseas patent appUcations, it follows that the techinformation in respect of almost all those applications is available to foreign industry beit is disclosed in Australia. Such a situation necessarily acts to the detriment of the competiposition of Australian industry relative to its competitors. In these circumstances, it is clearly desirable that the present excessive delay that in the publication of Australian complete specifications should be removed. This Bill will remove as much of that delay as disadvantages both the Australian public, parAustralian industry, and Australian inventors by providing for publication of complete inspecifications 18 months after the earliest priinority date claimed by the applicant. The sigof the priority date arises from the fact to that a feature of Australian patent legislation, based on the consequential benefit to Australian inventors and a commitment to overseas appliunder a long-standing international industrial property convention, permits the priority date claimed by an appUcant to antedate the date of lodgement ofhis complete specification by up to 12 months. In the case of most Australian patent applications, the priority date is in fact approximately 12 months earher than the date of lodgement of a complete specification. Accordingly, the amendment proposed by this Bill will result in most complete specifications being pubUshed 12 months earlier than is presently the In other words, the technological information contained in almost all Australian patent specifications will become avaUable to Ausone traUan industry approximately 12 months earUer than is presently the case. This provision also provides a number of incidental but not unimportant benefits. Firstly, it will make the Australian patent system, so far as pubUcation is concerned, consistent with the national patent systems of many overseas countries. It wtil also conform to the pubUcation requirements of the regional patent system recently adopted by most European countries-the European Patent Convention-and also the international patent system-the Patent Cooperation Treaty-whic h has recently been adopted by most of the major industrial countries. The resultant uniformity will result in ultaneous pubUcations of inventions in all of the countries in which patent protection is sought for those inventions. In addition to the benefit to Australian industry through the earlier pubUcation of complete specifications, it is worth noting that the requirement for publication under this Bill does not deprive Australian inventors from being able to withdraw a completed patent appUcation before the complete specification becomes open to pubhc inspection. In circumstances where an inventor does not wish to proceed with an appUcation, the non-publication of his complete specification enables him to retain the right to lodge a subsequent application in respect of the same invention. The present provision reserves to such appUcants a minimum period of six months within which to make such decision before the contents of his complete specification are disclosed to the public. I commend this Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Scholes) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1978 Bill presented by Mr Fife, and read a first time.",61
159,Mr FIFE,NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS SUBSIDY," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Bill now before to extend the operation of the nitrogenous fertilisers subsidy scheme for a further year until 31 December 1979, but at a rate of subsidy reduced from $60 per tonne of nitrogen content to $40 per tonne of such content. Following consideration of the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendation in report No. 58 dated 5 September 1975, the Government decided that the subsidy on this fertiliser was to be phased out. The measures effected by the Bill represent a further step in the implementation of this decision. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) in the Budget Speech mentioned various government initiatives in support of rural industry, including the provision ofan amount of $ 10m for continuation of this subsidy for a further year. The level of subsidy to apply after 31 December 1979 wtil be considered by the Government in the light of economic circumstances prevaUing nearer to that time. The Bill proposes that from 1 January 1979 to 31 December 1979 subsidy wtil be payable at sim- the reduced rate in respect of locally produced nitrogenous fertilisers which are sold for use in Australia as fertiliser and also in respect of imported nitrogenous fertilisers which are either used in Australia as a fertiliser by the importer or sold by the importer for such use in Australia.

The Government has decided that the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority should find all those funds for capital works which it cannot meet from its own internal revenue sources through the semi-governmental borrowing program rather than half of these requirements being provided for in the Budget as Second Reading has been the previous practice. The borrowing powers of the Authority are contained in section 26 of the principal Act. The purpose of this Bill is to amend section 26 of the Australian Capital Territory Electricity the House is Supply Act 1962 to provide: 1. that the Austrahan Capital Territory Electricity Authority, which is constituted by the principal Act, may borrow moneys by issuing securities; 2. that the Treasurer, on behalf of the Commonwealth, may guarantee the repayment of moneys, and interest thereon, borrowed by the Authority otherwise than from the Commonwealth; and 3. that the Commonwealth's guarantee will apply to borrowings, including interest thereon, by the issue of securities by the Authority where the securities are of a prescribed kind. The opportunity has been taken in the Bill to provide for the Authority to borrow by the issue of securities and to attach the Commonwealth's guarantee to them where they are of a prescribed kind. This will place the Authority on the same basis as the Austrahan Telecommunications Commission and other modern statutory authorities. I commend the Bill to the House.

161,Mr FIFE,TARIFF PROPOSALS," I move: Customs Tariff Prosposals No. 21 (1978). The customs tariff proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. The proposals implement the Government's decisions on recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its reports on Ught commercial and four-wheel drive vehicles and heavier commercial vehicles and components, and brooms and brushes. The effect of the decision on commercial vehicles is that general purpose commercial vehicles and buses over 2.72 tonnes gross vehicle weight will be dutiable at 22.5 per cent and prime movers for articulated dump trucks wtil be dutiable at 25 per cent. There is no change to the level of assistance now applying to Ught commercial vehicles. The decision on brooms and brushes will means that these goods will be dutiable at 25 per cent except for iron or steel brush roU hair curlers which will be dutiable at 22.5 per cent general and 15 per cent preferential. The new duties will operate from tomorrow. A comprehensive summary of the changes contained in the proposals has been prepared and is now being circulated to honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House.",63
162,Mr SCHOLES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"These two proposals relate to Ught commercial vehicles and trucks. As it is not usual for the opportunity to debate these proposals later, I want to ask the Mmister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) one or two questions about the general matters which may or may not be in the proposals. Obviously, I have not had time to read them. In the last couple of days the Mmister has announced proposals to substitute tariff for bounty on certain parts supplied for commercial vehicles in Australia where the parts are not suppUed from in-house sources. WhUst this wtil be of advantage to the parts manufacturers in Australia vis-a-vis competition from imported parts, it could create in cases where there are marginal price differences conditions where the companies which currently manufacture in-house components- I think immediately of General Motors-Holden's Ltd and International Harvester Australia Ltd and possibly there are other companies in Australia-wti l find it no longer economic to manufacture those parts and will prefer to buy them outside with the benefit of the bounty. My concern is that this could cause transfers of employment which, whtie possibly benefiting the smaller companies, may have serious repercussions in regional areas. The Minister and I both live in regional areas where this could occur to the extent where substantial sections of manufacturing plant could go into disuse purely because of the operations of a government bounty designed to assist sections of the mdustry. I make the point that during the period of the Labor Government some forms of assistance which were given to maintain employment in certain industries, coupled with the subsidies which were then avaUable in Victoria- I do not know about other areas-create d over-capacity within Australian mdustry in certain areas. This also created unbalances in those industries because the employment creation subsidies, together with a subsidy which was avaUable in some instances from the Victorian Government to aUow decentralised industries to change to more economic forms of production, although this sometimes brought them into somebody else's market place, caused unwelcome structural changes and the breakdown of not one but two companies operating in a field where there was an adequate market for the original company but not for two companies. I do not know whether the Mmister is able to reply at this stage. I am concerned about the possiblity of existing in-house manufacture being discontinued because it may become more economic to buy outside. I am concerned also about the effect of displacement and the possible movement of employment opportunities from one House to have the area to another.",63
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TARIFF PROPOSALS," Before I call the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, I thought that the honourable member for Corio intended when he rose to ask a question, or maybe more than one question. He prefaced his remarks by saying that it is unusual for the debate on these matters to come back to the House. Do I gather that if I allow the Minister to rise, the honourable member is prepared to have this modon disposed of because he has not sought to adjourn the debate?",63
164,Mr SCHOLES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"It is a modon, not a piece of legislation. It is open for immediate debate and it is open for another member, if he so desires, to adjourn the debate to a later time. I wanted to speak to the motion now because it is normal for customs tariff proposals to appear on the Notice Paper until the end of the session and then to be disposed of in a machine-like manner. Customs tariffs may apply immediately without having to be dealt with by the Parhament. They are then put through in a separate Bill at some other time.",64
165,Mr HURFORD,TARIFF PROPOSALS,I will move the adjournment of the debate. I expect that the Minister will get in touch with the honourable member for Corio promptly to give him the answers to the questions he has raised. Debate (on motion by Mr Hurford) adjourned. NA,64
166,Mr FIFE,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS," I seek leave of the House to move a motion to discharge certain customs tariff proposals which were moved earlier in the year and which constitute part of Order of the Day No. 44. These Proposals were incorporated in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1978 which have now been assented to. Leave granted. Motion (by Mr Fife) agreed to: That the following tariff Order of the Day No. 44, Government Business, be discharged: Customs TariffProposals Nos 1 to 12 (1978) Excise TariffProposals No. 1 (1978).

167,Mr HURFORD,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"This is sumer the first in a long line of 1978 Budget Bills we will be debating in this House. The adjectives that I want to apply to the Budget generally could-and I emphasise the word 'could'-appl to this Bill. Those adjectives are 'brutal' and assurances. 'contractionary'. It could lead to unemployment. It could also be a dishonest Bill. Again I emphato sise the word 'could' because we know so Utile about the Bill that we are presently debating. The Bill could be brutal and contractionary if it adds to all the imposts that were announced last night. Of course, we know that its object is to raise $75m, so it does add to the imposts. I should have said that it wtil add to the imposts on ordinary Austrahans, the consumers of this nation, rather than, as was suggested in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Howard), merely put an impost on importers who are making monopoly profits. In the second reading speech the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) referred to: . . . imposition of a special additional duty of 12.S per cent on imports of certain finished goods. . . . What assurances have we that this 12Vi per cent will not add to the cost of those goods? The hopeful assertions by the Treasurer in the Budget Speech are noted and supported by us in the Opposition. The Treasurer said in his Budget Speech: I would like to point out that it is not intended that these arrangements should have any additional protective effect. One assumes from that that he does not expect 12 n per cent to be added to the cost of the particular goods. But we look in vain at the second reading speech of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs on this Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) last night for some reassurance that this is not so, for some statement of intention that this should not be so and for some idea of how the Minister and the Government will set up machinery to ensure that the goods that are listed in the BUT before us will not be savagely increased in price for the ordinary Australian and the ordinary housewife buying the goods because of the savage increase in customs duty on all these items. proposals, constituting part of Reference was made by the Treasurer to imand port quotas. I shall not read the reference verbatim, but he said that import quotas confer on importers who hold them a substantial advan(No. 3) 1978 tage over those who do not, thus giving rise in many cases to monopoly profits. The implication Second Reading is that all of this 12'A per cent should come from those monopoly profits. But what further assurances have we on this subject? The second reading speech of the Minister for Business and ConAffairs, who is at the table, was a mere 12 that Unes in length and certainly gave us no assurances of the sort that I am seeking. I repeat that it certainly gave us no idea of how machinery y could enable the Minister to give those The assumption must be, as I have implied up this point, that this Bill adds to the Budget imposts. It adds to the impost of the income tax surcharge that was brought in by a government which won an election on a promise to reduce taxes. It also adds to the other increases in indirect charges contained in the Budget last night. Of course, I am referring to the increased levies on beer, cigarettes and petrol. Further, it adds to the impost on ordinary Australians, for instance, by means testing pensions for those over 70 years of age. We could go on through the horrific list of further imposts that have been made on Australians. We might even make the point, as has been made already, that the Government is levying even a $10 airport charge on us when we try to escape from all these additional charges that were made in the Budget Speech that we had to put up with in this Parliament last night. The first point to be made by the Opposidon is that we want to know what will be the machinery to ensure that the consumers of this nation will not be charged the extra I2n per cent tariff which is to be placed on goods by the Bill we are now debating. That is only the brutal and contractionary part of the Bill; there is more to it than that. I mentioned earlier that this could be a dishonest Bill. I also mentioned that that adjective could be used about the Budget generally. It could be dishonest because we were promised lower taxes and we got higher taxes and because we were promised that there would not be any meddling with Medibank and we have seen the changes that were announced last night. The dishonesty in regard to this Bill is that the resumed debate was rushed on within 24 hours without an explanation of why that should be so. It was rushed on without any explanation as to the machinery to ensure that the charges are not passed on. This Bill is being rushed through the House in the manner with which we are dealing with it tonight without any justification of it as a way of siphoning off any monopoly profits that importers may be making. We would like more information about this. We would like canvassed in this House an explanation of why there are not other ways to siphon off any monopoly profits there may be in the importing of these goods. We would like some information from the department concerned, through the responsible Minister, as to the sort of profits they are. What is quantification of them? To what extent will $75m be a suitable sum to siphon off from these profits? But we are given no information of this sort. As the responsible shadow Minister I learnt at about 11 o'clock this morning, just as my parliamentary party was about to meet, that this matter was to be debated today. We were not given time to study it in the depth in which we would like to study it, and we certainly were not given the second reading speech or from any other source the information to enable us to debate the measure adequately. If the purpose ofit is to add to the costs of imports to protect Australian made goods, let us say so. But the opposite was said by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech last night. If the purpose is to add to the cost of imports in order to collect revenue, let us say that as well. But let us learn the true purpose of it and let us see how that purpose is to be carried out. I repeat: The second reading speech did not tell us. I wish to say something now about my Party's attitude to Australian manufacturing industry because it is very relevant to this measure. If the aim of the measure is merely to siphon off monopoly profits, we support that aim; but we do not support this way of protecting Australian industry. We know that it is absolutely essential for this country to have a manufacturing sector and we are on record in many places as stating that it is the Australian Labor Party's aim that there should be a large manufacturing sector. We know that in the present economic circumstances the aim must be to make that manufacturing sector internationally competitive, which means aiming for increased productivity. We know also that great help must be given to get economics of scale through assistance for exports, research and development and in some cases even for mechanisation to achieve that productivity. We believe we need planning mechanisms in this country to bring about that situation. But we have not got such planning mechanisms. We are developing a detailed policy as to what those planning mechanisms should be. In our view the Industries Assistance Commission should be concentrating on long term tariff bench marks. It should be working out in what areas we should be applying our resources so that we can increase the standard of living of the Australian people and on which industries we should be concentrating in order to get the best results. At the moment that is not happening. The IAC resources are being used to too great an the extent elsewhere for that to happen. But I repeat that we believe that changes must be made towards applying resources to those areas where we require lesser tariffs rather than to those areas where we require higher tariffs. Of course also we state that we must ensure growth of new industries in our community based on our research and development, on the upvaluing of our minerals and on areas where we have a natural protection, such as perhaps high in transport costs to this country. Having said that, however, I point out that we have many great industries in this country which are labour intensive and with which we must be very sensitive. We beheve that at the moment the quota is the proper way to protect those industries. The tariff is not the proper means to afford that protecuon. That is why we assert clearly that we do not support the idea of adding to costs, for instance, in the case of motor cars by adding a further 12A per cent to the existing 45 per cent tariff, bringing it up to 57 n per cent-whe n the quota is the proper means of ensuring that sufficient Australian-made vehicles are being produced to ensure that as much as possible there is full employment in this country. Because we are very worried about this extra tariff impost, known as a special customs duty, of 12Vi per cent being added and because we know that already a quota is protecting the industries concerned, we feel that much more explanation should be given about the effect of this 12V£ per cent tariff before we can support the Government in this measure with any certainty and any happiness. I repeat that we must not rely on tariff alone for protection in these sensitive areas; we must rely on quotas. We do not support such a large impost which we feel will end up adding to the costs of this nation, feeding the consumer price index and indeed causing much more trouble than it will cure. So we support quotas while change is taking place and while we are moving to areas where economies of scale and a lower unit cost can result. We agree that quotas cause colleague of mine, the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen), about six months ago addressed a question in this House to the Minisnature ter on the very problems involved in trading quotas and on the high profits being made as result of quotas being applied. We are not a satisfied with any explanations given to us at this time that this is the way to cure that situation. use a Scottish term, the case is not proven. That why we ask the Government to let us know why it has not chosen the option, for instance, of putting quotas out to tender, or of auctioning quotas or of ensuring that manufacturers get these quotas. Perhaps any profits of manufacturers could offset the costs of manufacture and thereby ensure more manufacture in this whether country. I know that all these options have their difficulties but I beheve that it is the job of Government to bring these options to the Parliamission ment. The Minister in his second reading speech on a measure such as this should tell the Parliagoods ment about these options and why the GovernIAC ment has not chosen the alternative options instead has chosen this option which has all the dangers that I have already indicated. I repeat that we realise that quotas have many difficulties and we recognise them. But I also repeat that the options ought to be canvassed in the Parliament. So far in discussing why this measure in our view is dishonest we have only 1 scratched the surface. Why is this Bill being hastily rushed through the Parliament? We have not been told the reason. There is probably a very good technical reason but it ought to be spelt out rather than giving us just a few hours to engage in a meaningful debate. Let me raise a number of other questions which I believe also need answering. For instance, no explanation was given last night, in the Budget Speech or in the second reading speech on this Bill, about why the goods that are mentioned in this Bill are subject to this 12'/2 per cent tariff when other goods which are also the subject of quota have not been included. I think the House deserves an explanation on this matter. No explanation has been given anywhere as to the reasoning which led to the choice of a I2n per cent tariff. Why did the Government choose 12n per cent? Why not 15 per cent? I indicated earlier that we do not know from any information given by the Government what these monopoly profits are. Let us learn from the Government what they are and then we may be able to make a judgment as to whether $97m siphoned off in a full year by I2n per cent is the problems. In fact a correct amount. Another question which comes to mind is the and extent of the monopoly profit probin lem associated with these quota arrangements. I a have already implied that we would like to know lot more about that problem. Is this just a revenue raising exercise- I have already asked that To question-o r is it another way to clobber the conis sumer in addition to all the various ways that were mentioned in last night's Budget Speech? Before going any further, let me raise two legal the considerations which should also be noted in should considering this Bill. Firstly, I believe that there are some doubts the Government can unilaterally impose such additional duties because sections 23(3) the and 23 (4) of the Industries Assistance ComAct specify that the Minister should not increase or reduce duties imposed on imported without first referring the matter to the for recommendation. In this Bill are we not but increasing the duties to be imposed on goods? How do we reconcile this situation with the particular sections of the IAC Act? Is the Government trying to sidestep this requirement by having a Minister, other than the Minister responsible for the Act, announce the tariff increase? That was one suggestion put forward when the financial Press leaked the information that this measure would be brought in. I cannot see that that suggestion appUes because my knowledge of affairs is that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs is the Minister responsible for the IAC Act and he was the Minister who introduced this measure in the Parliament last night. Not only is the legahty of this measure in doubt, as I suggested-severa l importer groups have already indicated their preparedness to challenge its legality-bu t also there is a moral question of the wisdom of the Government embarking on this course of action without considered advice as to the effects of this decision. Perhaps the Government has already received considered advice but I believe it is the duty of the Government and of the Minister to tell the House about that considered advice. Let me read from the particular sections of the Industries Assistance Commission Act. Section 23 (3) states in part: The Minister shall not take any action in respect of any of the matters specified in sub-section (4) . . . unless he has received a report of the Commission in relation to that matter under this Act . . . I suggest that in the case of all the goods specified in this Bill such a report from the IAC under the meaning of that section has not been received.Section23 (4) (b) states: Whether duties imposed on goods of a particular descripenue tion imported into Australia should be removed or the rates of those duties should be increased or reduced; Of course, the rates of duty are to be increased under this Bill. But that is not the only legal pediment which I believe appUes to this Bill. also want to draw the attention of the House to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. duties Does this Bill not breach Australia's niternaive national commitments in the General Agreeeither ment? Does it not breach the GATT rules as we know them? A member cannot break such a commitment without some offsetting form of compensation. Instead, it is believed that the Government will invoke Article XIX of GATT, arguing that the tariff increase is necessary balance of payments purposes. Clearly this is the intention of this measure for it runs counter the Treasurer's assertion that 'it is not intended that these arrangements should have any additional protective efTect'. Rule (1) of Article XXXVII of GATT in part states: The developed contracting parties shall to the fullest extent possible-that is, except when compelling reasons, which may include legal reasons, make it impossible-giv e effect to the following provisions: (b) Refrain from introducing, or increasing the incidence of, customs duties . . . on products currently or potentially of particular export interest to (essdeveloped contracting parties; It is clear that many of the goods covered by this legislation are of enormous interest particularly to the less developed contracting parties to GATT. We do not believe that Article XIX applies because the Treasurer has said that it is not intended that the goods should increase in price. Article XIX would let us out. However, we are told nothing about this in any information that is given in this House and we object to that. On behalf of the Opposition I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: the House declines to give the Bill a second reading until the Government gives the House a satisfactory explanation inter alia as to(a) whether the Bill is in conflict with section 23 (3) and secuon 23 (4) of the Industries Assistance Commission Act; (b) why the Bill disregards the commitments accepted by Australia as signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and (c) what machinery will be used to ensure that the additional Customs duty will be paid from 'monopoly profits' and will not be added to the price of the goods concerned'. Apart from the legal considerations I want to remind the House of the points that I have made. Whether this measure achieves the aims set out by the Treasurer-that is, allegedly to raise revand not to raise levels of either protection or inflation-depend s crucially upon the extent to which importers of the goods affected are able to pass on the higher duties as higher prices. Apparimently the Treasurer and I suppose the Minister I for Business and Consumer Affairs believe that importers will not raise their prices so that the will be paid for out of profits. Is this not a behef? Market forces will do this only if one of two conditions apply: First, imports are price sensitive so that the increase in price wtil lower the quantity demanded on imported goods; or, secondly, there is no unsatisfied demand for imported goods so that higher prices wtil lower the quantity demanded. We have no for evidence that either of those two conditions not apply. Both situations would have the effect of to imponers failing to sell all their quotas and pressuring prices to remain at their previous levels. Do we think this will be the effect? I do not, and I certainly do not beheve that most informed people in the community would do so. In other words, we will certainly have an addition to costs by this 12'/i per cent impost. Even if market forces have this effect in the long run, this does not deny that the immediate effect will be higher prices for imported goods, greater inflation and the abihty of domestic producers also to raise their prices and their profits. However, market forces alone are highly unlikely to have that expected effect just described even in the long run. More likely importers will be able to pass on their cost to the consumer because either imports are relatively price insensitive-in other words, they can be sold almost for whatever price is asked-o r there is some unspecified demand for imports. I assert further that these direct effects are not the only consequences. There are also indirect effects. The domestic manufacturer will be able to increase his price in line with the importer's price increase, but this will only mean profit increases not employment increases. I assert also that his production and employment levels will not rise; they may even fall as the declining real wage effects of price rises of other imported goods reduce the demand for domestic goods. Furthermore, there would be additional falls year. in domestic production and employment will associated with a retaliation by our trading partners upon the goods they currently import from us. There would also be the increased use the penalty quota under tariff quota arrangeclear ments since the disability of these penalty rates stated: of duty are decreased as the additional duties are placed on the quota goods only. There is no guarantee at all that these detrimental effects will not occur, increasing simultaneously both inflaprofit; tion and unemployment. Already there is evito increased dence of our trading partners being furious with importers. this measure. I have had feedback today about the effect this measure has had on some of major trading partners, and I believe that retaliditional atory measures will be taken against us because of the fact that this measure has been brought into this Parliament. I have asked for more inforthe mation about the 12'/2 per cent rate. In summary, I make the point that the purport of the Opposition's amendment is to delay the passage of this Bill while questions are answered. I do not think any objective observer of this Parin liament could disagree with me when I say that we are debating this measure without satisfacfrom tory information being given to this House. We believe that the legislation will place an ditional impost on prices, in spite of what the Treasurer has said in his speech. The Opposition believes that it is proper to protect the particular industries but this has to be done sensitively by quotas and not by increased prices at this time. We believe that there are such legal impediments that the Government would be well advised not to rush this measure through this Parliament at this time, but to look at the points that I have raised and give the House the courtesy of providing proper answers to my questions before asking us to vote on this Bill.",64
168,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Is the amendment seconded? Mr Keith Johnson- I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.  (8.50)-My colleagues and I on this side of the House are delighted to be able to support the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife), who is sitting at the table tonight, and the Government on the introduction of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1978. Contrary to the assertions made by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) who has just finished speaking in this debate, the Bill was introduced merely to increase the amount of revenue collected from tomorrow to the end of the financial The total amount of increased revenue for that period will be some $65m. In a full year it amount to $75m. I believe that the reason behind the introduction of this legislation should be mentioned in the House tonight. The of Treasurer (Mr Howard) made this point very in his Budget Speech last night when he Import quotas have a certain scarcity value and confer on importers who hold them a substantial advantage over those who do not-givin g rise, in many cases, to a 'monopoly' by contrast, protection provided by the tariff gives rise duty collections rather than increased profits for I would like to point out that it is not intended our that these arrangements should have any adprotective effect. The measure will produce additional revenue amounting to $65m in the 1978-79financialyear and about $75m in 1979-80financialyear. I believe that what the Treasurer has said is the truth. People must realise that it is important for us to increase the amount of revenue from as many sources as we can during the difficult period we find ourselves at the present time. The I2 /i per cent special l additional customs duty which will be imposed tomorrow will apply to imports of certain finished goods which are subject to import ceiladings imposed through tariff quota and import licensing controls. The Minister has made it very clear that where practicable goods which are regarded as imports to an industry and entering under quota and licence controls have been exempted from the additional duty. There are some grey areas which always arise in any legislation of this nature. For instance, finished articles of clothing imported in pieces and merely sewn together domestically will be included. In addition to the goods upon which this ditional duty is to apply now, it is intended that will apply to goods which at a futuretimecome under quota or licensing control. As goods beon come no longer subject to those controls, the ditional duty will be removed. The imposition this additional duty is not intended to pre-empt the findings of the review of the administration of the quota system which is currently under consideration by a number of people. That is an area under the control of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. I feel that it is very important for industry whole in Australia to make it known that it ports the Government in this action. I call upon industry to advise the Minister for Business Consumer Affairs, members of the Government and members of the Opposition that it supports this measure totally. In making this call, I ask early consideration of the matter by members industry so that the Government will know from the outside that what it has done in this area correct and that it has introduced the appropriate measure. The honourable member for Adelaide also another made mention of the fact that there would be an increase in the cost to the Australian consumer goods which are imported. I can inform the stands. honourable member that in fact in some cases the high mark-ups which are currently being placed upon some imported goods amount to 500 per cent or 600 per cent. I have seen the cusindustry. toms declaration forms which have been made out at the point of entry of the goods to this country. I know the purchase prices in Asian countries with cheap labour and I also know the retaU selling prices. I wish to outline happened in the last few years since this mess arose in 1973 after the Whitlam Government reduced tariffs by 25 per cent across the and some 40 000 people were lost from the inpreciation dustry. Australian manufacturers work on a much smaller profit margin and have much munity higher labour costs when manufacturing goods in this country. At the point of sale in the retail outlet, the importer or the individual who is bringing the goods into this country sells those goods to the retailer and they are priced at a slightly lower retail selling price than that of the Australian manufactured article. I saw an example of this recently involving a man's shirt manufactured in this country for about $8 and which retailed for $ 15.99. The item which was imported into this country for $3.50 landed was retailing in the same store for $ 15.50, 49 cents less than the Australian manufactured adproduct. The Australian manufacturer is faced it with a horrific situation when we realise the sizable difference in the amount of the mark-up the imported item and the margin of profit on adthe Australian product. The importer is working of on a profit margin of 400 or 500 per cent as against an average margin of 100 per cent in many areas in Australia at the present time. It is also important to reaUse that many people entered this industry in their early teens. They have worked in the industry and been involved in it for a number of years. They have buUt up exas a pertise over a period and the industry has had an supinvolvement with those employees. The amount of support which has been given to the industry and since the Fraser Government came to office in 1975 has been substantial, particularly in the area of the 40 per cent investment allowance. I for am delighted to note that after due consideration of of submissions put to the Government and particularly to the Minister for Business and Conis sumer Affairs, a 20 per cent investment allowance has been considered. It was announced a few months ago that the investment allowance will not cease in 1983 but will continue for two years until 1985. This is the sort of thing for which this Government stands; it is the of type of approach for which this Government The industry and the people involved in it have an assured future. They have a future because they know that our Government is concerned about the jobs of people working in the I cannot say, in all fairness, that the people who were in government during those terrible years of 1972 to 1975 understood or had a concern for people who had spent a lifetime, in some cases, working in the garment and textile what has mdustry in Australia. I am pleased to see that there are some new board members in the Opposition who have an apof the importance of this particular very manufacturing sector in the Australian comand that they are starting to bring a little pressure to bear on the individuals who are at the present time in the Opposition shadow ministry. I should point out that because of the type of leadership we have in this House they will remain in the shadow ministry. But I am pleased to see that some honourable members opposite are starting to realise that it is not possible to play around with tariffs as was done by the Labor Governings ment in July 1973. The future of the garment and textile industry will mean a great deal for this country. It is not realised generally that the figures of Australian males, females and children are different from thefiguresof people in other countries. The sizes of garments, the lasts of shoes and the types cuts that are necessary for all clothing in this country are different from those in most countries. This applies to underwear garments, swimwear, sportswear and normal day-wear clothing. If honourable members look at the Bill they will see that it covers everything from rubsome ber coated garments, men's suits and clothing, women's dresses, underwear, boys and girls' clothing and babies napkins. It covers the whole range of clothing. It is very important to realise that the sition of an additional duty of l2Vi per cent will apply across the board in most areas but that very important area which has experienced some difficulties in the last few years has been left I am referring to the textile area. This Bill applies an additional duty of 12 Vi per cent to the finished garments which are being imported and which have caused the most trouble in the last few years. We have to realise that some of the asof sertions which have been made in the last few weeks are completely fallacious. Recently, free trade movement or the free trade groupTreasurer call it what you will-cam e up with a new Fraser) argument against tariff quotas. Proponents this argument point to declining levels ployment in the local textile, apparel, and footwear industries since 1974 as being the foundation for their argument. They state that, despite the existence of a wide range of quota arrangements, employment levels continue to fall. They have selected a high employment situation as the starting point of their argument. The boom who production and retail conditions in 1973 and 1974 and the levels of employment early in the calendar year of 1974 reflect these conditions. The second point that is being used is that throughout 1974 and 1975 the Government have attempted to control the disruptive flow of ports by means of voluntary restraint arrangeis ments. I think those of us who were members this House then realise that that failed comhave pletely. These arrangements were shown subbe sequently to be useless and were replaced probe gressively by tariff quotas. It was not until mid 1976 that the first semblance of comprehensive tariff quotas was replaced in position by the products of those industries. Since then, quotas have continued to be applied to product groupon a continuous basis. The last significant additions were made in late 1977. Currently, the Industries Assistance Commission is taking evidence on a further significant range of products. Thus, for the greater part of the period since 1974 the industries concerned were in practical terms exposed to disruptive import flows. It is of small wonder, therefore, that employment levels in those industries continued to be eroded deother spite action taken by the Government. The problems which this industry has faced have been horrific. When one compares it with of the other industries in Australia one sees that some of them have gone completely offshore. I do not want to see the garment and textile industry go off-shore. I stress that the Bill with which we are dealing tonight is not a means of protection. It is merely a means of increasing impothe revenue derived by the Government. The sum of $65m is a substantial amount of money in a anybody's language. The sum of $75m for a full year is considerable amount of money. It is the out. type of money which we need at the present to reduce a very significant deficit. I strongly believe that the types of measures which the Government introduced in its Budget last nightthis is one of them-wil l ensure that this country ours will move forward. They will create extra jobs and reduce the level of inflation. I was dethe lighted to hear the statements today by the and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm in answers to questions that we can look of forward to the situation when we will have an of eminflation rate of 5 per cent. I should like to give the House an example of something which is good government. I had drawn to my attention only recently the instance of a man who is involved in charity work and had budgeted for a 13 per cent inflation rate finding that because we have reduced the inflation rate he had an extra $64,000 which he had not considered would be part ofhis total amount at the end of the year. That has meant that the particular organisation for which he works will funds for a new building which will assist imsome very needy and handicapped people. That the sort of confidence which is brought about of by a reduction in the inflation rate. When we brought down the inflation rate people will able to start to budget effectively and they will able to start to look at the employment situation. That is the key to success. The Budget is aimed at achieving success in that regard. I know that we have received criticism from certain quarters but that is inevitable. The Budget involves a number of considerations, including the matter under consideration tonight, but it is the type of good government and good management which this country has desperately needed. I am pleased to be part of a team which is bringing to the Australian people measures such as this which wtil ensure that those people who at present do not have jobs in the industry but who want jobs in the mdustry will be returning to the industry over the next few months and the next few years. I believe that it is permissible to range fairly widely in a tariff debate. I feel it is important to mention that a number of people have telephoned me today to congratulate me on these measures. I have been mvolved in this industry and the reaction has been quite surprising. I have received 14 telephone caUs from Sydney and Melbourne. I have not received a telephone call from Brisbane but those honourable members who come from Queensland wtil reaUse that today is a pubUc holiday in Brisbane. It is the annual show day; it is the people's day. I think that I will receive a number of telephone calls from Brisbane tomorrow. Those people who did ring me and who are involved heavUy in the mdustry said that they agreed with the Government's assertions that import quotas have given a large number of people a Ucence to make net profits. Recently I met an individual who became an importer three years ago. He asserted with a great deal of pride that last year he earned a total of $2,146,000, That is a lot of money. I do not mind anybody making a success of his life in this country if he works hard. I believe that that is the way it should be. But some people are assured of a substantial amount of money merely because they have a quota. This has happened in a number of areas. That is why some people are selling quotas. If one considers that on a quota for 50,000 units which is being rented out at the presenttime-it has not been sold-and which is for an operation over two seasons one can pick up the average going rate of $3 to $3.50 for a skirt or a blouse or $5 for a dress one realises we are looking at a fair amount of money in anybody'slanguage. I believe that the mdustry itself must stand up and be counted in this regard. The industry itself must speak to government with one voice. I have asked the industry to consider writing to the Minister indicating that certain members of its associations are selling quotas and have obtained quotas unfairly and are not using them for the purpose for which they were originally designed. I am deUghted to say that a number of people in the industry have considered this matter very carefully and I believe this action will be taking place. The more industry associations speak with one voice the easier it will be for this Government to bring down legislation which will create jobs and ensure that the people in the mdustry are protected and wtil remain part of the Australian work force. Mytimehas almost expired. Before resuming my seat let me assert very strongly that the legislation before us tonight-the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3)-is not a measure for protection. It never has been and it never will be. I have checked with departmental officers from the Departments of Business and Consumer Affairs, Industry and Commerce and Treasury and without exception they have asserted that this is a measure to increase the revenue. It is something which I totally support for the reasons I have outlined. The rate of 12!£ per cent, considering the huge margins which are operating at the present time on the input of goods, is very small. I am delighted to be part of a team which will assist the Government in its search for some additional revenue which wtil be distributed under our type of approach to those people in need and those people who will be involved in this scene. Part of that revenue will be put into research and development grants. Part of the revenue will go to the export incentives which the Government announced a few months ago, and that is the way it should be. We still make the best garments in the world and we have still got a huge market outside this country.",68
169,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"If  Johnson) proved nothing else to me during the course of his address to this chamber he proved something that I have thought was so since the Treasurer (Mr Howard) introduced his Budget last night. This is a bookkeeper's Budget which was never seen by an economist during its preparation. On two or three occasions the honourable member for Brisbane referred to the purpose behind the increase in the tariff on these that items, and I interpolate that there are a lot of items, running through from ladies' sleepwear to passenger motor cars. We are not talking about the knitwear industry in isolation. The honourable member did not apologise in any way at all for this increase being just another rip-off to get another $65m into the Budget to try to balance the deficit that seems to be worrying the insides out of everybody. The honourable member tried to lock mto that argument something to do with employment. Much as he might have disliked the period between 1972 and 1975, if we are going to talk about unemployment then I remind him that there are more people unemployed in Austraha now, after three years of Liberal Government, than there were under the Labor Government. Fewer people were working and more were unemployed-whic h is very significant-durin g the three years from 1975 to 1978 than there were during the three years from 1972 to 1975.I wish the honourable member had elaborated the point so that I could have been enlightened about how he intends to improve the employment situation-by that I mean getting people back to work-by increasing the price of certain imported goods by I2n per cent. He seems to believe naively another false assumption-on e of the many on which the Budget is structured-that somehow the importers are going to pay the extra tariff over to the Austrahan Government, totalling an estimated $65m between now and the end of June. If I have copied his words correctly, he said also that at the present time imported goods have a mark-up of 500 per cent or 600 per cent and that they are then put into the retaUers at a slightly lower price than that charged for locaUy manufactured goods. He went on to indicate that because of our expensive labour we have to be able to compete - a typical conservative speech. The honourable member then gave us a clear indication of how the market is expected to react. There is no doubt in my mind, and I have been around a long time, believe you me, that if a manufacturer or a merchant has the opportunity to increase his price and the market is prepared to pay, then those who are going to pay are consuming pubUc of Australia, the people who have to buy the imported goods. If there is such capacity in the demand for goods in Australia, strikes me as being very odd that this GovernGovernment ment, which holds itself out unashamedly as a government of business, does not do something about getting industry in Australia active order to take up the slack and cater for the mand for those goods that is now being met imports. On the argument of the honourable member for Brisbane, the price of those goods is already being increased to a price above that the locally manufactured goods, which seems me to put the local manufacturer in a favourable position. But the Government has not said that. It took the Minister at the table, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife), less than two minutes to introduce this measure into the House, and it has quite wide ramifications. It raises a number of questions. The Treasurer thought so Utde of it that he gave it three lines in his Budget Speech. How on earth does the Government expect us, the representatives of nearly half of the people in Australia, to understand something like that when it gives us so Uttle information? How does it expect intelUgent debate on a measure such as this when it gives us that sort of information? For example, the Government did not tell us whether the Industries Assistance-Commission had considered the matter. In fact, by its stience it is clear that the Government has not done so. A unUateral political decision has been taken in the Cabinet room and legislation brought into the Parliament. The Government expects the support of its party to allow it to raUroad this measure through the Parliament without it being thoroughly investigated. It is the purpose of the Industries Assistance Commission to look at matters of tariff, indeed it is a requirement that matters of tariff be referred to the Industries Assistance Commission. In moving his amendment the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) made the point that in view of section 23(3) and section 23 (4) of the Act there ought to be an examination of this matter by the IAC, but there has not been. The honourable member for Adelaide also raised the problem of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. From a reading of that document, it seems that the Government is flying in the face of international agreements. There has been no consultation, simply an arbitrary decision taken in the Cabinet room and brought into this place as legislation. This Parliament has been misused, abused and prostituted again. It is expected to agree blindly with propositions that the are put to it by a half-baked government that keeps coming in here with half-baked ideas that a wtil not work. We would like to know, and I have it already made this comment, what measures the will use. It uses the term 'monopoly profits', and I think that is a pretty interesting term. I would like to know what the Government in means by that. If people are making monopoly deprofits in this country, why is the Government by not doing something about it and getting its share of revenue from that area? Instead of doing that, it has increased the tariff by I2n per of cent, which ultimately will be passed on to the to consumer, on goods ranging from brandy and PVC-rubber coated garments through to footwear and motor cars. As far as motor cars are concerned, I had a bit of a giggle whUe listening to AM this morning when I heard the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) talking about the sales tax on locally manufactured cars being reduced and the price dropping by $500. When questioned about the increase in the price of petrol he said: '$500 will buy a lot of petrol.' That is a beauty! He did not bother to say that the changeover price will be the same and nobody will get the $500. On the other side of the coin, imported vehicles will increase in price because of the I2n per cent increase in the tariff that the Government is determined to impose, as the honourable member for Brisbane has told us, so that it can balance its books by adding $65m between now and the end of June. He made the point that that is a lot of money. Apparently he is mesmerised by these things, like most bookkeepers, and is not prepared to look at the consequences for the Australian community and for the Australian consumer. No attention has been given by the Governto ment to solving the problem at its source, that by increasing the capacity of Austrahan industry. I too have knitting mills in my electorate, as well as textile factories and a very turer, the Ford Motor Co. All of those factories are operating under capacity. What is wrong with the Government doing something about and getting those industries back to capacity? There would then be a lesser need for imports to come into the country. Surely the two things ought go hand in hand. But have we heard anything about that? We heard not one word from the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in the one and a half minutes it took him to address this House. He had no time to elaborate. The honourable member for Adelaide in his response tonight took his full 30 minutes, and it was best 30 minutes' worth of sense that I have in this House for a long time.",71
170,Mr HURFORD,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,Than k you.,73
171,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"That is quite all was right. The speech made by the Minister, and was quoted to the House by the honourable member for Brisbane, told the House nothing. It treated the Parhament with contempt and tainly treated the Opposition with contempt. Many questions have been raised, and I have way of knowing whether the Minister will rise toBurke. night and answer those questions or whether will just let this Bill go through. I think he has responsibility to this Parliament to answer those questions, even at this late stage in the debate. should be remembered that this matter was intended introduced into the Parliament only yesterday and the Opposition has had little time to study I could not be convinced that the Bill was preor pared in one day, yet the Opposition is expected to debate it in one day. Again, utter contempt been shown for the forms of this House and for the way in which parliaments-the people's forum-ar e supposed to operate. We have been treated with this same sort of contempt over the last three years and I guess that we will continue to be treated with contempt until we win government in 1980. At this late stage I urge the Minister to rise and to give the House some indication of why these measures are necessary; why it is essential, in the view of the Government, to impose a I2n per cent tariff increase on certain goods-the motor car industry, for example. If people are making windfall profits, to use the words of the Treasurer, why is the Government not instigating measures to tap those windfall profits? Furthermore, the threat of retaliatory action by our trading partners is not an unreal one. I would like know from the Minister whether that matter is, has been considered and whether the Government has received assurances that there will be no such retaliatory action by our trading partners large car manufacaround the world. Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a lot more business before the House to be considered yet I would be the last person to take up all my speakingtimesimply in order to take it up and to reiterate matters that have already been raised. I to think I have made a scathing attack on the Government. I think the Government should resign but before that happens, I would like the Minister to stand up in this chamber and explain thoroughly what this matter is all about.",73
172,Mr FIFE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"in reply- Mr Deputy heard Speaker, I did not want to disappoint the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson). As a matter of fact, I could not hear him clearly over here. I thought he said that he about to resign. I thought that was to be his it greatest contribution. The honourable member  answered the only points that need to be referred certo by the Government in reply to comments made by the honourable member for Adelaide no (Mr Hurford) and the honourable member for But just to restate the position and to emhe phasise what the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said a last night in this Budget Speech, the special additional customs duty which this measure proIt vides is purely a revenue measure. It is not to provide additional assistance to industry. This point was made by the Treasurer last it. evening and I emphasise it now. If tariff quotas import licensing on the goods in question were to be removed, the special additional duty would has also be removed. The measure is intended to divert to the community, through the tax system, part of the additional profits which accrue to import entitlement holders. As I have said, it is not intended to raise the level of protection; nor is it intended to add cost to the consumer. In relation to the Industries Assistance Commission, the honourable member for Adelaide raised the question of the validity of this measure. I want to emphasise that insofar as assistance to industry is concerned, the Government remains committed to its platform that assistance to industry will not be varied without a prior IAC or Temporary Assistance Authority report. The Opposition has moved an amendment designed to delay this measure. The basis for the Opposition's amendment is its claim that it has not had time to study the measure. The measure is not substantial in volume; it is a measure that has been available overnight to the Opposition and as I have indicated, the Treasurer made clear last night what was proposed and what the intention is. The Government of course, does not support the amendment. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Hurford's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided.

173,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"Fro m looking at the title of this Bill honourable members would be entitled to say that it is a worthwhile measure but when we look Ruddock, P.M. at the structure of the Bill we realise that it has very many defects. If we look at the definition of the projects embraced we see that they are Shipton, R. F. Simon, B. D. denned as developmental projects involving construction, design and supply of equipment or installation of equipment, and testing in the field of agricultural practices. If we look at the second reading speech of the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) we see that there is to be concern for the type of international competition that exists already in this world of project development. We see that there have been discussions in Austraha as to whether we could become part of that competitive process. In the course of his speech the Minister talked about other nations, quite substantial nations, which are involved already in this field. They are no less than the United States, France, Canada and the United Kingdom. He says that they are actively involved in supporting their industries. The difficulty that we seem to face with this ticular measure is that what is proposed does not seem to have the sort of strength that would give private Australian organisations compete as well as they might. In other words the proposed organisation is designed to inform and assist. It does not seem that it will have much the muscle that would be required in accordance with the definitive objective of being able to conporation struct, install and otherwise carry out a project. it is a curious piece of legislation. Whilst at the outset it appears that the Bill about overseas projects, we find that this traUan Overseas Projects Corporation would be the least able to fulfil such a project. Honourable members will see from the Minister's second It reading speech that the Corporation will be able to carry out projects at the request of private tralian organisations. The Opposition has no objection to private organisations but this tunate project of the Government is Umited to what might be the dictates of private organisproach. ations. If a private organisation is not mvolved, one wonders what in the name of fortune will happen to the worthwhUe, perhaps tentative, exCorporation ploration by the Corporation. There is to be a board of directors. Again we find that the board is to be comprised in the main of representatives of the private sector. There is nothing wrong with that but it gives rise to the question of what the Bill is all about. If the board of directors is comprised of people from the private sector it would have certain particular views as to how to judge what is a worthwhUe project. In other words, there could be a conflict of interest. Honourable members will see that the measure provides for contingent liabUities of up to $50m, so there wtil be some substantial propositions reqmring worthwhUe consideration. The Minister said that this is the most important piece of legislation in a package which will assist private Australian organisations in anyfieldbecause it will be export oriented. In that context one must hearken back to the piece of legislation that has just been passed, despite objections from the Opposition, which deals with the problems of overseas credibility. If Australia is to be invited to be involved in projects overseas, for example, in Europe or Japan, I think that those countries will have a very close look at the measure which has just been passed which indicates clearly that we are imposing some sort of tariff restriction by way of increased penalties, namely a 12A per cent tariff. It has been explained } to the House that that measure had nothing to do with the countries in which those goods originate or the countries which question our credibUity and whether we are dealing with them on a fair basis. parLet me assure the Minister that the Japanese are very angry about that measure. In fact there are suggestions that it could well affect their subthe capacity to sidiaries here. In that context one wonders how we should of look at the European position. We have before us legislation to set up the Overseas Projects Corwhich, we think, will give us a chance to So compete for developmental projects in Japan or Europe. But I can imagine those countries saying that we have not really helped them in legislation is recently passed in this House which has been Ausaimed virtually at preventing them developing and obtaining the benefit of their expertise in trade. The Government ought to be alerted to this. should not be telling the House this evening that this is only afinancialorfiscalmeasure with which Austhe Treasury has been concerned and that it does not concern trade. It does, it has and I have no unfordoubt that the European Economic Community as well as the Japanese would object to this apIt could well affect our position in the Multi-National Trade Negotiations and could well affect the ability of the Overseas Projects to effectively carry out work in those countries. The Bill is a curious piece of legislation. At first glance the proposed Corporation appears to be a corporation in its own right and able to carry out developmental projects. However, let me address honourable members' minds to the provisions which will weaken it in every phase of its operations. Clause 6 makes it clear that one of the functions of the Corporation wtil be to obtain information and make it available to Australian private organisations. So, in this regard it is merely an agent of Australian private organisations. The Corporation also is to assist private organisations in respect of overseas projects. So it is to inform and assist, but all the time on behalf of Australian private organisations. An Australian private organisation is deemed to be a person, a partnership, an Australian company or an Australian consortium not being a consortium which includes the Corporation. Finally, this limited Corporation can agree to carry out the whole or part of an overseas development project on the basis that the necessary work can be carried out on behalf of the Corporation by an Austrahan private organisation. Nowhere under this legislation can the Corporation function in its own right. Its functions are all the time Umited to projects that an Australian private organisation can undertake. Clause 7 states that, subject to sub-section of the clause, the Corporation is prevented from engaging as principal or agent in the buying or selUng of goods. Note the limitation there again. is prevented from buying or selling goods. That provision really weakens the Corporation. If it is to be involved in development projects, which clude the construction of works, the installation equipment and the testing of agricultural prachelp tices, it would be motivated further by being able to buy or sell goods. It would assist Australian vate enterprise no end if the Overseas Projects Corporation could negotiate a project with guarantee that Australian producers could sell their goods. While clause 7 restricts the Corporation by not allowing it to buy or sell goods, clause 8 brings Even has about an incredible situation by providing that the incompetent document. Corporation shall not compete against any Ausunderstand the problems traUan private organisation, whether principal or agent. I find it difficult to imagine how the Government to do it, that but the Corporation could get itself into that situation need to be indicated whether inlong-term when clause 7 prevents it buying goods as either principal or agent. This provision seems to conflict ought with clause 6 which states that the function of the Corporation is to inform, assist or agree to carry out on behalf of another private organisation any function at all. So under clause 8 it cannot pete with any other private organisation and under clause 6 its functions are limited to assisting private organisations. We could have the ridicuture. lous situation where one private organisation is prevented from receiving help from the Overseas Projects Corporation because another private ganisation says that the Corporation is competing against it when, under clause 8, it should not be. Therefore nothing happens at all. Sub-clause (3) of clause 8 provides that where an Australian priis vate organisation lodges with the Minister an projects. objection under sub-clause (2) to negotiations by the Overseas Projects Corporation, whose main thrust is to help other private organisations, the Minister may direct the Corporation to cease negotiations if he so desires. Under clause 9 the Corporation shall not agree to carry out any work at all unless an Australian private organisation that is able and wUling to the work on behalf of the Corporation requests it to do so. This seems to be in complete conflict with what the Corporation is all about. Let me make it clear that when we talk about overseas projects we are talking about projects of a very substantial nature. We are talking about Australian enterprise, Australian technology, Australian design, Australian equipment and Australian goods, and they are all in the private sector. That should be the concept behind this legislation. It is unfortunate that the Minister considers that this legis(2) lation provides the best way of approaching the Corporation's task. He completely overlooks the fact that at present there are severe problems in It Australian industrial design and development. We have had White Papers presented on what inwe should do with our industries. It is recognised of and admitted that the best thing for us to do to industries become efficient is to encourage them to become export oriented, but this cannot prihappen unless the Government gives a lead. The Minister has made the point that these measures a are in accordance with the Government's long term industry policy, but we do not know what that policy is. It has never been explained and as far as the the Opposition is concerned it does not exist. been White Paper on manufacturing industry condemned as a completely shallow and So it is important that we when we talk about acting as policies. The Opposition says, is unable to get policies structural change or manpower policies.tariffs, relation to We to know where we are heading. We can do this if we look at what already has comoccurred in Australia, not the least important example being the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. It has been a most successful venThis Corporation already can do much, if not all, of the work that the proposed Overseas Projects Corporation might do. The Snowy Mountains orEngineering Corporation's financial operations for the year ended 30 June 1977 showed a profit of $1.8m. It paid taxes of $1.15m. In other words it is a very successful operation. That Corporation able to assist the Government with all overseas We see that extremely well qualified personnel with great engineering expertise control the Corporation, with the result that it has been able to compete for and obtain contracts throughout the world. It has a total staff of 511 which comprises 164 professional, 201 technical and 146 service personnel, who are what could be called some of do the best Australian talent from private enterprise and university training and who are generally able to compete in the world. Where are these projects being carried out? During the year ended 30 June last the Corporation was engaged on work in most States of Australia and in many other countries. At the end of the year 148 personnel were located on overseas projects, that total being made up of 30 in Thailand, 57 in Indonesia, 12 in Malaysia, 11 in Western Samoa, 16 in the Philippines, three in Tanzania, two in Ghana, seven in Papua New Guinea, two in Pakistan, two in the New Hebrides, five in Kenya and one in the British Solomon Islands. So this Corporation has a fairly impressive record with regard to what it can do. What we are asking is: Why do we need this ditional and very weak piece of legislation that dressed up on the basis that it will do something worthwhile? By way of the proposed amendbody ments that I have already circulated the Oppomeasure sition will make the point that we do not need the legislation. If we were to give the tains Engineering Corporation the same encouragement to develop in this area, which it can do, we would be benefiting private enterprise in Australia because it would utilise all the goods and services that would be needed to carry out projects and would be getting them from tracts, Australia. But the Government wants this legiswhether lation, and it will not agree with proposals that come from the Opposition. It is prepared to denidraw grate the expertise of its own Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation and the Corporation's abihty to make profits. If we are to have this legistrading lation let us give it a bit of strength. Accordingly, by way of our amendments we propose to amend clause 7 to say that the Corporation may engage as principal and agent in the buying and selling goods but so as not to compete with Australian ganisations. What is wrong with that? If it cannot do that it cannot function at all. With regard to clause 13 of the Bill, why must the great majority of the personnel come from private sector? That proposition carries all the dangers that we envisage. Such personnel may well have to look at projects submitted by other private organisations with which they are not associated but with which they have to compete. Worse still, they may have to look at projects which they are associated and therefore will have a conflict of interest. How will we be able to judge that sort of situation if, as this Bill provides, personnel shall be people who are engaged in priutilise vate industry? If we want the want those people in private industry who are directly related to this sort of work, but if they are to be put in the position of acting for the government on the basis that they cannot really assist in areas in which they are directly involved we certainly will be embarrassing them and perhaps limiting Australia. The analogy is that no member of parliament may discuss in this House a matter in which he has a pecuniary interest. We suggest that the best way to overcome the problem is for the people who will be appointed pursuant to clause 13 to include the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Secretary to the Department of Trade and Resources, Manager of the Commonwealth Development Bank and the Director of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation or their delegates. We would then get a clear and, one might say, judicial appraisal of the validity of the judgments made. We admake the point that no director shall be involved is in the consideration of or vote upon any matter in which he has a direct or indirect interest. Everyknows that it is essential to have that sort of to protect the Corporation. We are critical of the Bill in that context and we propose to Snowy Mounmove amendments accordingly. The main thrust of my criticism is that we do not need the measure in the way it is designed. We fully applaud the idea of Australians being able to the develop their expertise and obtain overseas conbut a point that has been made to me is the Government is really encouraging matters to the benefit of the existing facilities. I the Government's attention to the fact that the Budget Speech last evening, at page 128, talks about other assistance in respect of overseas corporations. The 'other assistance' includes $375,000 for the promotion of Australian consultancy services in developing countries. It also talks of Sim for the capital of the Australian of Overseas Projects Corporation. That is not the orfirsttimea consultancy fee has been provided for. I notice that in 1976-77 the consultancy fee provision was $180,000 but I am disappointed to learn that we were able to use only $69,000 of that sum-approximatel y one-third. In 1977-78 we apthe propriated $159,000 as consultancy fees but we used a mere $52,000 of it-agai n one-third. The present Government seems to printfiguresand hope that they will turn out right, and if they turn out wrong it gives some explanation. There is not much point in merely puttingfiguresin the Budget with when in the last two years we have utilised nowhere near the full appropriation for consultancy fees. Accordingly, it appears fairly clear that orthe ganisations in Australia have never been able to even the Umited resources that have been very best people we made available. One critic has written to me to ask why it would not be better to encourage consultants in Australia to get moving and to work through an organisstructure ation that could well be the same as the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. In other about. words, if we already have the funds and we have had them for years we ought to consider why we have not been able to utilise them. It is important not just to win a contract for an overseas project but in so doing to use Austrahan products. other words, the Austrahan involvement in the project should not be Umited to design and installeads lation. There ought to be an additional incentive to guarantee that Australian goods and services wtil be used to fulfil the contract. That is one of points that have been made. Another criticism is that the Government has that this Corporation, given no indication of how this proposed Corporation is to secure information about avaUable is, projects. We have already the services of trade to commissioners. Surely they should be able to provide the information. How does the Government expect the proposed Corporation to do it? no particular expertise in this very competitive area. We have said for sometime-and again we were denigrated in the second reading speechthat the most effective way for Australia to trade and develop would be to have an Australian over the seas trading corporation, not as a socialist concept but on the basis of talking government to governtrade. ment with the abUity to find out about projects that ought to be developed. If we had that sort structure, which for reasons we cannot understand this Government wtil never agree to, we would fuUy alerted to the worthwhUe projects that could be developed in other countries and for that purafford pose we could utilise our trade commissioners. if this legislation is passed we will have a private enterprise corporation employing very busy men who wtil be trying to make a living in private organisations in Australia and who will be expected to be alert to what is happening in other countries. How can they be expected to be aware ation, of that? How will the Government get this sort corporation to assist employment and developEast. ment in Australia? We make the point that the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation can do that and that we cannot understand why the Government is crewould ating this structure, which can be faced by all Umitations in the world. In other words, any priation vate organisation here can object to it doing thing if it feels that it is going to do what deemed to be competitive. Why does the Governthing ment not look at the matter on the basis that it wants to assist overseas projects and it wants to so in a way that will assist all Australians? There to be no government structure in this area, pertise is certainly avaUable through an existing and the trade commissioners can provide an inteUigence service as to what it is all I come now to the final point. The Bill provides for an appropriation of $2m on an annual basis, which has to be repaid, and a $50m contingency. In That means that the Corporation has to operate within a profit oriented framework. That point one to ask: WUl the charges be increased because the Corporation has to make a profit? In other words, the Corporation will have to apply the additional charges to the private sector for which it is trying to get contracts. Also the Corporation is virtually obliged to repay the money to the Government. The impression has been created cabined and confined as it will stUl have to levy charges to the private sector which is trying to get the work and it will have add those charges to its tender prices. Mr Kevin Cairns-Surely it would be related to It has the profitabUity of the private sector.",74
174,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"The point I am making is that there is no doubt about the profitability of the private sector but it also wtil have to wear fact that this Corporation is an added incubus from the point of view of what we are about in We have to be effective, fast and definitive. If the Corportion has to go back to the private secof tor eachtimeand say that it can carry out the project but its fees in the area will be $250,000 bebe cause money has to be repaid to the Government the private sector might decide that it cannot to go on with it because of the charge being But levied on it. In other words, the Government is demanding that the Corporation has to be a viable proposition. There is no query about that. But a second unnecessary operation is created. As I say, there is no objection from the Opposition about the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporwith all its expertise, saying: 'There is a very of worthwhile proposition in ThaUand or the Middle We will help you to get that contract. We can do it for you and we could be part of a consortium with you'. The structural steel and concrete could come from Australia. We can provide all the private enterprise butidup that is necessary'. There be a complete deal with the people with the whom one was doing business. But the Corporcannot act as principal or agent. That is the anypoint I am making. It seems to be a well meaning is public relations exercises in encouraging someto be done by a private organisation in Australia which may decide not to do so. If that is do the position, nothing will happen. We have said is for sometimethat Australia has an opportunity to but extrade as a nation. Mr Deputy Speaker Drummond, you would know of the West Australian Lamb Marketing Authority, which is a very worthwhile proposition. It is a State trading authority which is doing very well indeed, thank you very much, because of its expertise and the full benefit goes to the producer. It is the same concept that one is about when one is talking about trade. I want to make the point that we as Austrahans have the opportunity to develop the expertise of Austrahans but it must be done within the concept of what we are about. This measure clearly will overlap the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. We say that it is a wasteful dispersal of skills. It is a contraction from the private sector which could embarrass it because of the structure. We ought to look at what we are about. That Corporation has had some seven years' experience in thefield.It is trading well at a profit and is paying tax. So why not get it to do this worthwhile venture? The private sector would be involved. To have the sort of structure which does not have the capacity or the legal ability to act as either pal or agent is not offering a worthwhile incentive to the Australian private enterprise sector in Australia. We oppose this measure because of its limitations. We say there is a better alternative.",78
175,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,Mr Drummond)Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition's time has expired.,79
176,Mr CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"Contrary to remarks we have just heard from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen), the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation Bill is a further confirmation of the Fraser Government's positive action to ensure strong economic growth in Australia in the long term. It is also pursuing pohcies in the shorter term which have been necessary to overcome the distortions in our economy as a result of the insanity which prevailed in the Whitlam Labor Government era. To restore long term prosperity to Austraha we must expand our trading opportunities and exports. Therefore the Government is to be commended for many of its initiatives in this regard, particularly those itiatives that have been taken in recent months. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has vigorously pursued Australia's trading interests in Japan, the United States of America and Europe. The achievement of a significant increase in our beef exports to the United States reflects one aspect of the Prime Minister's success in this area. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) has also In directed considerable attention to successfully promoting Australia's trading prospects. The Minister at the table-the Minister for Special Trade Representations (Mr Garland)-ha s been in pursuing our interests in the very difficult forum the European Economic Community. Also the  been a strong advocate of our interests, particularly in Asian countries. So the Government is fulfilling its responsibilities to expand Australian trading opportunities both in the formulation of policy and with the direct personal involvement of senior Ministers. Particularly as a result of the wage-cost explosion that was encouraged by the Whitlam Labor Government, import replacement as a stimulus to growth in manufacturing industry is over. A forward looking innovative approach is required by management and manufacturing industry to direct its growth to areas where export markets can be developed. It is simply not good enough for management to sit back and rely on tariff protection to ensure guaranteed markets in Australia. Indeed, to do so is directly contrary to princithe principles of free enterprise. Management should welcome competition and grasp the opportunity to compete in international markets. Shorter term tariff protection may be justified to allow for readjustment to export oriented production. However, in the longer term excessive protection proves to be an unbearable millstone around the neck of existing export oriented industries, both primary and secondary, and inhibits innovative growth of new export oriented industries. On that basis, far from maintaining employment, excessive tariffs in fact add to unemployment. The important economic developments that have occurred in Asia over the last decade or so have largely been overlooked by Australian manufacturing industry. I emphasised in my speech in the Address-in-Reply debate earlier this year that it istimethat we focused more closely on Asia, not only because in the negative sense Asian manufacturers are placing increasing pressure on a growing range of Australian manufacturers but also because Asia offers a vast range of challengining opportunities for Austrahan manufacturers. Austraha has the manufacturing capacity and the innovative abihty to delve quite deeply into this region. As new industries are developed within the region, Austraha will be able to compete for the supply of capital goods, essential raw material inputs, specialised manufacturers and consultancy services. In this respect I am conscious that a wide range of Australian industries have already exploited export opportunities within this region. the manufacturing sector, food, beverages and tobacco, non-metallic mineral products, fabricated metal products and transport equipment industries have experienced large increases the share of their exports going to the developof ing Asian market economies while the rural and mining sectors have experienced smaller increases. The specialisation by Asian countries in particular products associated with their general economic development will continue to create substantial export opportunities for Austrahan industry. The extent to which Australia will be able to take advantage of the benefits of increased trade with Asia will depend on the extent to which Australian industry adopts a course that complements rather than competes with the output of developing Asian market economies. It will require Australian concentration on rural based products, processed rural and mining products, consumption oriented manufactures and the outputs of the service industries. An important element in the success of Australian exporters will be the adaptive skills of tralian manufacturers. It is my beUef that adapting products to local requirements is an area of comparative advantage Australia has and can develop much further. Our strength lies in the depth of manufacturing industry's innovative skills butit up over the years to service Australian needs. WeU known examples of this would be Australia's success in dry land farming techniques and the bulk handUng and processing of agricultural and mineral commodities. There is no reason why the horizons of Australian manufacturing industry should be Umited in any way in this regard. A prime example of the success which Australian industry can achieve with an outward looking attitude is the success of the world renowned lens manufacturing firm Sola International Pty Ltd located at Lonsdale in the Kingston electorate. I have referred to this firm's initiative and success on previous occasions. Mr Kevin Cairns-Tell us again.",79
177,Mr CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"I would love to tell the honourable member for LUley again of their success. The technical expertise with which they developed the CR39 plastic lens has led to the estabhshment of a substantial export market and has allowed lower input costs of production. As a result there has been a further growth in exports. Last year substantial extensions were made to the factory of the Sola organisation at Lonsdale and also additional employees were recruited, thereby providing additional employment in that area. So the benefit from export oriented manufacturing is obvious. The Government is aware of the need for Australia's manufacturing sector to become more export oriented. The White Paper on manufacturing mdustry clearly indicates that the Government wishes to develop a stronger and more specialised manufacturing sector. Towards this end the White Paper argued that it was desirable to give encouragement to new investment in manufacturing that wtil be efficient, internationaUy competitive and export oriented, paruculary where it is based on Australian talents, skills or resources and where the degree of processing or transportation is the maximum consistent with international competitiveness. The Austrahan Overseas Projects Corporation Bill emphasises the Government's strategy to expand trade and economic relations with other countries. It fulfils yet another promise made by the Fraser Government during the 1977 election campaign. The Bill proposes to establish a statutory corporation to provide the Australian private sector with information and assistance to negotiate with overseas governments or organisations Austo carry out overseas development projects. The legislation follows consultation with the private sector and has the private sector's full support. There has been massive expansion of investment in large scale development projects in developing countries during the present decade. These projects have made a significant and growing contribution to world trade. The Australian Overseas Projects Corporation wtil meet a pressing need for government support for Australian exporters in this field. The legislation is an excellent example of effective co-operation between the private sector and government. The Corporation will provide real benefits to Australian firms seeking to enter large overseas development projects and hence to the Australian economy. The legislation reflects the Fraser Government's outward-looking approach which seeks new export markets and new links with the economies of other countries. I think that even the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) ought to be interested in this piece of legislation. Mr Kevin Cairns-Hi s interest is growing by the minute.",80
178,Mr CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"I am pleased to see that he is waking up now to listen. This approach is reflected in other measures which recently have been introduced to assist in the development of export markets. A new export incentive scheme has been established. There has been expanded promotional activity by the Department of Trade and Resources to support exporting companies combined with an export consciousness program. The Overseas Trade Commissioner Service is being strengthened. The facUities of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation are being expanded by legislation to provide export finance at concessional interest and underwrite performance guarantees. The present Government has also negotiated a new international sugar agreement and has established the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. This positive approach by the Fraser Government is in marked contrast to that of the Australian Labor Party as has been represented by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, not only in the debate this evening but also in other statements in recent times. The Deputy Leader has pretensions to be the Deputy Prime Minister one day and maybe even the Prime Minister. One would therefore expect a far more thoughtful contribution on matters of trade, particularly in tonight's debate. However, his contributions are in no way serving Austraha's interests. Instead, his comments on Government poUcies and initiatives in this area have ranged from the petty through the inaccurate to the ridiculous. His substantial criticism of Government poUcy and performance are extremely difficult to substantiate. He has recently criticised the determination of the Fraser Government to gain access to European Economic Community markets. He has claimed that Australia has no hope of increasing exports of steel and agricultural products to the European Economic Community. This negative attitude from the Opposition is not good enough. The Government will not close its eyes to the domestic market of the world's largest trading block; it wtil not close its eyes to the European Economic Community's selUng practices on third markets. The Government will continue to chalAustraUan lenge the principle of closed markets and special trading rules for agricultural products. The Labor Party ignores all this to Australia's detriment. Opposition's criticism of the Government's polilished cies and performance completely lacks vaUdity. Noticeably, the Labor Party has no coherent alternative policy to present to the Parliament to the Australian community. We are given no idea of how the supposed alternative Government would handle the present situation. The Labor isations. Party merely offers a counsel of despair-th doom and gloom of which the Leader of the Opagain, position is so fond and for which he has become so sector. renowned. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition regurgitates proposals from the disastrous years when Labor was in office. He has claimed that Fraser Government is not making sufficient effort to develop markets in fields other than Europe. He completely ignores the Government's compreduring hensive approach and policy. As I demonstrated earUer, the Government's attention has been directed not only to the unions. European Economic Community but also to marAustraUa kets in the United States, Japan, the Middle East and South East Asia. A few moments ago I tines; outlined also a range of policies designed to exporters to develop other new markets. The serve Deputy Leader of the Opposition has proposed a framework agreement between Australia and the European Economic Community. The Government remains open to such an agreement if its benefits are demonstrable, but the Fraser Government wants substance and not mere formality in this regard. A framework agreement currently exists between Canada and the European Economic Community but no one in either of those countries can pomt to any positive results from that agreement. It would seem the Labor Party has more interest in show pieces and organisational gimmicks than actual sales. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition in remarks he has made in recent months has also trotted out the Labor Party's hoary old socialist proposal for the Australian Overseas Trading Corporation. Of course, this legislation was rejected by the Senate when Labor was in office and the amendments proposed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition tonight once again reaffirm Labor's commitment to that structure. The proposed amendments in fact would have the effect of converting the Australia Overseas Projects Corporation very largely to a body simUar to the Australian Overseas Trading Corporation. The private sector, very correctly, was aghast at the proposals to establish the Overseas Trading Corporation when it was introduced during the era of the Labor Government. Far from assisting enterprise to expand trade, the Corporation could have directly competed with private business trading in goods. The Australian The Overseas Projects Corporation which is estabby this Bill provides for any benefits that were claimed for the Australian Overseas Trading Corporation and more, while not threatening the or private sector in the way that that proposed body would have done. The Overseas Projects Corporation can act only on requests from private organIt is also a provider of assistance and cane not directly engage in general trading. Once this obviates it as a threat to the private The Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the the Australian Labor Party are acting contrary to Australia's national interest through the negative attitude which they have adopted. I discovered recent discussions in a number of countries that Australia has lost a significant proportion of its export markets as a direct result of the disruptive activities of our waterfront and maritime The activities of these unions have caused to be an unreliable suppUer of goods, particularly with regard to meeting delivery deadso other suppUers have been obtained. The assist Deputy Leader of the Opposition would better Australia's national interest if he used what ought to be his undoubted influence in the labour movement to stop these militants destroying Australia's prosperity. The capacity for Australia to develop and expand its export markets on the basis of the assistance that is being provided by the Government direcdy depends on a responsible attitude being adopted by our waterfront and maritime unions. If dehvery dates are not met as a result of mUitant activity by those unions our customer countries will turn to other suppliers as they have done already as a result of the activities of those unions. In direct contrast with the attitude of the Labor Party, the Fraser Government has the runs on the board with a series of significant measures to assist business to estabhsh exports markets.",80
179,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,It has the runs.,82
180,Mr CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS PROJECTS,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, as a valued member of the parhamentary cricket team, ought to know what the term 'runs on the board' means. It means that the performance is there to be seen. The Australian Overseas Projects Corporation is a worthy addition to these initiatives. The Australian Labor Party, through the remarks of its Deputy Leader tonight, has offered no viable alternative. It is now up to private businesses to use the assistance provided and get on with the job of developing export opportunities to their individual benefit and to the benefit of the whole Australian economy and hence the Australian community. It is for that reason that I strongly support the passage of this Bill and wtil oppose the amendments which the Opposition proposes to move during the mittee stage. Debate (on motion by Mr Les Johnson) the adjourned. NA The Honourable E. G. Whitlam, A.C., QC. Motion (by Mr Garland) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.",82
181,Mr MARTIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I would not like to let pass the occasion of the retirement from this House of the former honourable member for Werriwa, the former Prime Minister of this country and the person whose memory has been revered by the people in Australia, particularly for the measures which he introduced for the period between 1972 and 1975. Unfortunately, the Honourable E. G. Whitlam, QC, did not return to the Parliament for the commencement of this parliamentary sitting. So the opportunity has not presented itself to speak of the good work which the previous honourable member for Werriwa performed in this House. It is to the credit of Mr E. G. Whitlam, QC, that by dUigence, by forthrightness and by good government during the period that he was Prime Minister he placed many measures on the statute books of this country which will possibly be better recognised after he has died and is gone. I think it is true to say that history has shown that the worth of a person is seldom reaUsed during his hfetime. I compare the Honourable E. G. Whitlam with such mighty Prime Ministers as John Curtin, the Labor Prime Minister who led Australia during the period of the last World War, and Joseph Benedict Chifley who was revered by the Australian people but who was roundly criticised by the Press during the period that he was Prime Minister of this country. He was recognised only after he had died. It is amazing to me that the Press of this country can pillory such good men as John Curtin, Joseph Benedict Chifley and Edward Gough Whitlam. I know that Edward Gough Whitlam was Prime Minister of this country in a time of great Comcontroversy. I also know that during those periods of controversy he stuck to his principles, principles which he had fought for and beUeved in over a period of many years in the Labor movement. I revere his memory and the things which he has done in this House. I am certain that the people of Austraha, when they have time to think about the great benefits which were conferred on them during the period that he was Prime Minister, wtil revere him also.

(5) Will he consult with his colleagues about the use of violent scenes from adult classified films in commercials, shown during family viewing programs.",83
184,Mr STALEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 1I have read the article in the University of Adelaide students magazine On Dit attributed to Mrs Barbara Biggins of the South Australian Council for Children's Films and Television. Mrs Biggins appeared before the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal at its public inquiiy into the concept of self-regulation for broadcasters. Her views on chUdren's television advertising were taken into account by the Tribunal in framing its subsequent report and recommendations. (2) The article quotes the results of a study of Adelaide television which indicated that approximately 50 per cent of advertisements between 4.00 p.m. and 6.00 p.m. were for food or drink most of which, according to the article, were Ukely to have high sugar content. Interim Northern Terri(3) I am aware of the existence overseas of laws relating to misleading or unlawful advertising. For instance, in the United States the Federal Trade Commission is empowered to require advertisers found guUty of breaches of advertising legislation, to make appropriate retractions. There have been cases where advertisers have been obUged to televise announcements correcting false or misleading claims made in television advertisements. The Honourable Member will appreciate that conditions prevaUing in the broadcasting field in other countries are different in many important aspects from those in Australia, nevertheless I will ask my colleague, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs to supply me with details of overseas legislation relevant to your question. (4) Guidelines for advenising directed to children already exist. These were developed by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and are administered by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal as part of its Television Program Standards. They provide as follows: (a) ChUdren should not be directly urged to put pressure on parents to purchase the product advertised. (b) Advertisements should accurately represent the product, and claims concerning specific product qualities should be capable of being substantiated. (c) Advertisements must be clearly recognisable as such and separate from the presentation of program matter. (d) PersonaUties or characters from chUdren's programs should not be used to endorse or recommend products within or adjacent to chUdren's programs. (e) Children in advertisements should be wellmannered, well-behaved, and show respect for parents. (f) There should be no implication that the possession of a product makes the owners superior to their peers, nor that lack of the product may lead toridiculeand contempt No comparison should be made with last year's models or competitive to make a child possessing these feel inferior. (g) With the objective of avoiding excessive repetition in the telecasting of advertisements directed to chUdren, a station should exercise discretion in the placement of identical advertisements within any regularly scheduled program directed to chUdren. (h) If a price is mentioned, the complete price of the product should be made clear, preferably both aurally and visually, and advertisements should clearly indicate the cost of those items which constitute the original purchase must be purchased separately. (i) Undue emphasis should not be placed on the use of such words as 'only' or product. (j) In the case of a product that must be assembled this should be made clear of power and method of operation should be indicated. (k) Where reference is made to competitions, the appUcable rules should be made clear and the value of prizes and the chances of winning should not be exaggerated. (1) Results shown or claimed for advenised products, such as toys or games, erage child without an undue degree of skill. (m) Except in the case of specinc safety messages, advertisements should not portray unsafe acts or dangerous situations, e.g. chUdren ignoring traffic regulations or conversing with strangers. (n) Advertising of products not intended for use by chUdren, except for gift-giving, should not be directed to chUdren. (o) Frightening dramatisations or effects should not be included in advertisements directed to chUdren. (5) The practice described by the honourable member prohibited by specinc provisions in the Television Program Standards except in the case of promotions consisting 'voice-over slides' as distinct from film extracts. The bunal vigorously pursues complaints program standards. Any breaches of this provision will, of course, be raised also during public inquiries into the renewal of the licence of the station concerned. In its report and recommendations 'Self-Regulation for Broadcasters?' pubUshed last year following its public inquiry, the Tribunal stated that it expected that industry codes would include provisions relating to times of promotion of programs so that those for adults-only type programs were confined totimeswhen the programs themselves were permitted to be shown. Programs for famUy viewing and for chUdren could be promoted at anytimeother thantimesset aside specifically for children's viewing when special guidelines set down by a Children's Program Committee would operate. The Tribunal's report is currently being examined by the Government and these aspects will certainly havereceivedconsideration. Parliamentary Retiring Allowances (Question No. 241) Mr Young asked the Minister for Finance, upon notice, on 1 March 1978: Which of the former Liberal Party members of parliament who hold office as judges, ambassadors, high commissioners and administrators receive their parliamentaiy pensions (Hansard, 16 February 1977, pages 116-118).

However,residentialdevelopment around the range, if continued without restriction, could seriously affect the RAAF's future use of the range. (2) Yes. outside this policy was made (3) The functional capacity of WilUamtown Air Force Base as both a training and an operational base is not at present jeopardised. The Defence Department issued, in de- August 1976, a Noise Exposure Forecast (NEF) for both RAAF Base WilUamtown and the Range. Copies of this NEF have been made avaUable to the NSW Planning and Environment Commission, the Pon Stephens Shire Council, the Department of Administrative Services and the Depanment of Transpon. Application of the NEF by responsible planning authorities is an imponant step in maintaining compatibility between aircraft operations and the local communities. In addition it should limit residential development in areas of high noise intensity. Special efforts are necessary to limit funher the development, for residential purposes, of that land inside the 25 NEF contour (the highest acceptable tion in development should be exercised). In thisregard,the Pon Stephens Shire Council has agreed to include informadon relating to aircraft every relevant building approval. If funher residential development continues to the extent where operations from RAAF Base Williamtown are threatened, the only course of action may be the acquisition of additional land to provide a buffer zone. Furthermore there is a need to restrict the height to which structures may be erected on protect low flying aircraft and radio installations. If structures are erected in uncontrolled fashion, RAAF operauons may be affected. Thus, control is proposed to be exercised through the Defence Areas Regulations which are currently being prepared for promulgation. The Department of Defence has concluded agreements with the Department of Transport for Military Air Space in the Williamtown area. These agreements, now incorporated in the 'Joint Aviation Standards and Procedures', are sufficient to protect the Defence interests for the foreseeable future.

Whyalla Rolling Stock Proposal (Question No. 1421) Mr Wallis asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 1 June 1978: When will the Government release its decision on the submission by the South Australian Government on the establishment of a railway rolling stock manufacturing plant at Whyalla, S.A. as recommended by the working pany established by the South Australian Government to find other emAustralia ployment opportunities at Whyalla following the closure of (Question No. 1419) the Whyalla shipyards?",95
193,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GENERAL NATURE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Premier of South Australia was advised on 16 June 1978 that the Commonwealth is unable to accept the proposal by the Whyalla Working Pany for the estabUshment of a plant to manufacture raUway rolling stock for State Government raUway systems. this authority by regulation In reaching that decision, the Government had before it the advice of an inter-depanmental committee which indicated that future effective demand for rolling stock is likely to be well below that indicated in the South Australian report and also that existing production esumated. In short, it appears that the most optimistic demand projections could be met from existing capacity. The Government was also mindful that the Commonwealth purchased rolling stock for leasing to the State raUway systems in 1973-74. The experiment was not successful and appears to have no Suppon from State Governments. Excess capacity for rolUng stock exists in several States and these States naturally wish their own rolling stock requirements. In these circumstances and in the context of an extremely tight budgetary situauon, the Commonwealth was unable to support the proposal. The Government is aware of and greatly concerned with the employment situauon in Whyalla and accordingly is wUling to examine any further proposals ward. My colleague, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, is doing everything possible within existing job placement, retraining and relocation programs to assist displaced workers from the shipyard. Recycling of Waste Materials Mr Uren asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 2 June 1978: (1) What arrangements are made in his Department and statutory authoriues under his control for waste materials such as paper, metals and glass. (2) If no arrangements for recycling presently exist, will implement, or investigate the implementation of, procedures for the recycling of waste materials. Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable implement, member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Where it is an economical proposition, all types of waste are recycled through contract or by disposal action administered by the Department of Administrative Services. Where it is considered that there are insufficient quantities of waste generated or the distance from recycling outlets is too great then all waste is either burnt or destroyed under local arrangement. Recycling of Waste Materials Mr Uren asked the Minister representing the Minister for Science the following question, upon notice, on 2 June 1978: (1) What arrangements are made in the Department of Science and statutory authoriues under the Minister's control for the recycling of waste materials glass. (2) If no arrangements for recycling presently exist, will the Minister implement, or investigate the implementation of, procedures for therecyclingof waste materials. Mr Adermann-The Minister for Science has provided the following answer to member's question: The general arrangement in my Department and statutoiy authorities under my control is for any potentially valuable waste materials to be sold to commercial waste collection agencies or collected by charitable organisations.

Drought Relief Assistance, Queensland Ratio (Question No. 1474) Mr Hodges asked the Minister for Finance, 0.9 upon notice, on 6 June 1978: 0.7 (1) Did the Queensland Government apply for drought 0.9 relief assistance in 1978-if so, on what date was the submission received by the Commonwealth? 1.1 0.9 (2) How much has the Commonwealth paid to the Queensland Government in drought relief assistance in 1.1 1978? 1.0 Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honour0.7 able member's question is as follows: 0.8 (1) In January 1978 the Premier of Queensland sought the 1.0 Prime Minister's agreement to widening and varying the 0.4 drought relief measures which the Commonwealth had 0.9 already agreed to support (in November 1977) under the natural disaster assistance arrangements. 0.7 (2) Department of Finance records of advances for natural disaster assistance to the States are based on financial 1.2 years. These advances are made to the States on the basis of State estimates of expenditure on agreed relief and restoration measures. If a State is receiving assistance in a financial year for more than one disaster (as was the case for Queensland in 1977-78) it is difficult, in the absence of audited statements of expenditure, to provide accurate statements of expenditure on a disaster by disaster basis. Audited statements are not generally available until some time after the close of the financial year in which the advances have been made. A funher complication which tends to prevent indentification of Commonwealth assistance asters is the requirement that each State must meet from its own resources a pre-determined 'base' amount of expenditure on natural disasters for afinancialyear before Commonwealth assistance becomes payable. The following table shows estimated total Commonwealth payments to Queensland in respect of natural disaster assistance in 1977-78. Payments in respect of State expenditure in 1976-77 (none for drought) Estimated State expenditure in 1977-78* Drought Other disasters . . . . less Queensland's 'base' contribution Payments in respect of State expenditure in 1977-78 . .

Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 7 June 1978: (1) Did his Depanment recently place orders for laser rangefinders for the Defence Forces with a Norwegian firm. (2) If so, has an Australian designed laser rangefinder capable of similar functions been developed at the Weapons Research Establishment, Salisbury, SA. (3) If so, was the estimated cost of the Australian system below the system purchased. (4) Was the Austrahan system considered. (5) Would purchase of the Australian system have given stimulus to Australian industry and encouraged continued expertise in weapon development technology. Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable gentleman's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Orders were placed in January 1978 for 41 rangefinders. (2) An experimental rangefinder has been made by WRE but it has not been developed for production. (3) An early estimate indicated that the Australian system could have been developed at reasonable cost but funher investigation showed this to be optimistic. (4) The Australian system was considered but at the time of decision to purchase, the lead time for development and production was at least two and a half years too long for Army requirements. (5) Purchase of the Australian system would have given a small stimulus to Australian industry but only forty-one rangefinders were purchased. The WRE rangefinder will be receiving consideration for funher development to meet possible longer term requirements of rangefinders for other arms as well as future artillery tasks. in terms of particular disBeef Processing and Marketing: Inquiry by Prices Justification Tribunal (Question No. 1501) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 7 June 1978: What progress has been made with the estabUshment of $'000 S'000 the terms of reference, and the actual hearing by the Prices Justification Tribunal, of the inquiry into certain aspects of the meat industry. 1S3",96
