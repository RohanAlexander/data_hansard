By brownfield, of course, about the already built-up areas as opposed forecast was 950,000 to be passed by end June plan slashed that down to 286,000, then in March again reduced to between 155,000 and 175,000, passed only 71,000 brownfield premises. There have been cascading forecasts, the about the management of this business and their August last year, they then had to dramatically appears they are going to fall short of a target There are no forecasts in the corporate This slowness of the rollout is a very understand that one of the arguments in always been that having everyone in Australia economy-wide benefits, big spillover effects, benefits are there to have ubiquitous connection what is the incremental benefit, if any, broadband at the speeds it can be achieved areas, fibre-to-the-node-and having fibre-to-the-premises? there is no argument in any of the literature connected to very fast broadband, even at speeds on fibre, is a real benefit. The problem that that we are not getting the benefits of ubiquitous Tuesday, 18 June 2013 Scott) took the chair at 12:16. NA National Broadband Network Committee Report to draw honourable members' attention to and senators which sets out some very this project. The debate over the NBN, of course, proceeding for long enough now for there to be and, indeed, in the ground. is that the fibre rollout is well behind schedule. at the end of 2010 forecast that fibre would and 319,000 greenfield premises by June had passed 71,000 brownfield and 32,000 It is not just a question of falling short of honourable members understand I am talking to new developments. I mentioned that the first 2013. In August last year their new corporate 2013, just a few months ago, that target was and as of mid-May the fibre network had This is one shortfall after another. target is dropping down, and it says something capacity to forecast. They set a new target in reduce it in March this year, and now it that was set 90 days prior to the target date. plan that one can take seriously. significant issue. Honourable members will favour of the National Broadband Network has connected to very fast broadband will deliver externalities. We do not doubt that those to very fast broadband. The big question is: between having people connected to very fast under the approach we favour-in most built-up The one thing that is clear-and or in experience-is that having everyone much slower than the peak speeds available we face, therefore, with the NBN's slow rollout is connectivity any time soon, and perhaps we might not be getting them for 20 years or so. this network will take many decades. In our re-examination of the NBN's financial that it would take another four years to complete. moment the NBN is passing less than a quarter passing, even according to its revised corporate premises a day, as it is at the moment, to seriously to be passing well over 6,000 a day is just incredible. The reality is that this project is going to universal or ubiquitous connectivity will also somebody-and there are at least two million effectively, no broadband at all since they do them to watch a YouTube video-'Don't worry, the fibre-to-the-premises option, in 10 years lifetimes of some of the occupants of these premises, children will be at school. The issue really boils down to a fundamental about technology, but even if you accept Labor's the project is just not getting there. One of contractors who have been employed-Silcar, not been delivering the premises that they knowledge in the industry that they are all street, as it were, is that these contractors something in the order of 30 per cent of the any money or any margin at all. That being the case, what does that tell forecasts? It has a corporate plan that its contracted costs, yet we know that the contractors had some pretty dramatic results: the Silcar Service Stream managing director, Graeme Syntheo joint venture appears to be about to be dissolved. The failure to have satisfactory commercial profound failure of the NBN Co., because it and is not proposing to have a huge workforce the management of the construction in the satisfactory relationship with its civil contractors enable them to pay their subbies a fair price do that, it simply will not continue. We have report. I spoke earlier about the asbestos issue. I coalition are very concerned that the Commonwealth notwithstanding that it is in Telstra pits that Telstra. As you know, the Work Health workers, including workers employed by-for At the current rate of progress the completion of model, in our alternative policy, we assumed That is a very optimistic assumption. At the of the number of premises it should be plan. For a project that is passing around 350 imagine that in 18 months or so it is going be long delayed. That means that the benefits of be long delayed. It is cold comfort to say to premises in Australia in this category that have, not have broadband at a speed that would enable you are going to get the Rolls Royce option, or 20 years time.' That may well be beyond the and it is certainly beyond the time their one of management. There is an argument argument about technology the fact is that the problems that we are seeing is that the civil Transfield, Syntheo and Visionstream-have have been contracted to deliver. It is common losing a huge amount of money. The word on the will need to have contract prices increased by current contracted rates if they are able to make us about the reliability of the NBN Co.'s cost management tells us is based on the current are going backwards financially. This has CEO Peter Lamell left the company in May; the Sumner, left the company in April; and the relationships with the civil contractors is a does not have a huge civil workforce of its own of its own, although it has sought to take over Northern Territory. But it needs to have a and it needs to have contracts with them that and make a margin for themselves. If they cannot set them out in some detail in this dissenting will not go over all of that ground again. But the will be liable for asbestos risk, are being remediated by contractors working for and Safety Act imposes on NBN Co. a duty to example-Telstra or contractors to Telstra if their work is influenced or directed by NBN Co. is in that position of influence and therefore We are particularly concerned that the issue time and this does not reflect well on either failure of supervision on the part of both companies. honourable members to the comments that we have made there. I want to now turn to the question of the public debate or discussion because the fibre-to-the-premise wireless is the technology solution for about per cent gets fibre-to-the-premise, four per satellite. I might say that under the approach households in the fixed wireless footprint at broadband. They are in towns that have less the-premise under Labor's approach but which VDSL fibre-to-the-node solution of the kind communities in rural and regional Australia convenient broadband services under our approach Looking at the way the NBN Co. is tracking on their best case scenario their fixed wireless end of June, which is only 45 per cent of the given by the NBN Co. management frankly beggar been given by the minister as well-that there rural and regional Australia.

This dissenting report, which I some detail the sorry tale of mismanagement pleasure of mine to be able to speak to this committee. It is a project that has had a great management of the project itself. In fact, I have overlaid too much oversight. I am certainly to probe and test the way in which government when you consider all of the ways in which this not have a similar level of investigation imposed sought-from my impression, and I am sure it on the government side-to cooperate with from members of parliament.

That is why, when the opposition were in and the member for Sturt even indicated in reports the best form of technology to deliver a modern capacity constraint. It is well known that as the Reserve Bank that capacity constraints grow and that failing to do so would hurt the tried, as has been reflected upon here, 19 times access to broadband.

The interim satellite solution The government said that it would be too minister said that it would cost $86 million 48,000 to 55,000.

It is widely the market to increase the cap to around published cost for the interim satellite service you do the maths, that works out to be around minister's figures, to add 7,000 to the cap was How does that work?

12,Mr FLETCHER,COMMITTEES," I am very of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the this report, the thing that is most striking is would wish it to be-including, I note particularly, Lyne-and the view of reality. There is quite Lyne is an unashamed true believer in the marvels present form in which it is being implemented bring to power. In his chair's foreword, It will make a big difference in many lives. It will identity in a flattening global culture â€¦ it will create He repeats the claim that it will 'promote Australian sectors like education as our second biggest be almost limitless in the faith of the member by unlocking entrepreneurship as a nation'. He says: What an opportunity to promote Australia and expand The chair of this committee, the member for National Broadband Network to do all of these things. But I have to say, when I hear these overblown response is: no it won't. At the very highest, could argue that the NBN is a necessary marvellous outcomes-to promote Australia's entrepreneurship. But to claim that building or will 'unlock entrepreneurship as a nation' dangerously woolly thinking that is causing careful in our analysis of what we are getting it is a contentious proposition-that if you network it will encourage economic activity, that distinction that was hammered home in first-year is certainly not a sufficient condition. It is member for Lyne and other advocates for construction of this network will lead 1,000 more that needs to happen. It may be that the will not do it by itself. And to suggest, as the sufficient to achieve these objectives, is misleading and woolly thinking that sadly has bedevilled Co. So, if the first objection that I have to the introductory comments is to say that, even if can be a condition towards achieving the outcomes second-and even more substantial-objection claimed outcomes can be expected, you need to quickly, cost-effectively and efficiently. And who do not. That is not what we want from the pleased to rise to speak on the fifth report National Broadband Network. When you look at the contrast between a view of the world as some the chair of the committee, the member for a disparity between the two. The member for of the National Broadband Network in the by the Labor government, which he helped he said about the National Broadband Network: strengthen our economy. It will promote our cultural opportunity and deliver equity for all Australians. culture to the world', 'show respect to export market'. The powers of the NBN appear to for Lyne. He says it will 'play to our strengths our export economy by getting this build right. Lyne, is a true believer in the capacity of the claims about what the NBN will do, my you could put the argument as follows. You but not sufficient condition to achieve these cultural identity to the world, to unleash the NBN will 'deliver equity for all Australians' is, I would suggest, an example of the kind of us to splash away so much money without being for the money. It may be possible to argue-and build and deliver an effective national broadband it will encourage entrepreneurship. But there is philosophy: it may be a necessary but it not enough to argue, as we repeatedly hear from the the NBN in its present form, that the mere flowers to bloom. That is not true. There is much NBN will assist in a range of outcomes, but it rhetoric in the chair's forward suggests, that it is and is an indicator of the kind of fuzzy far too much political commentary about NBN particular philosophy that is articulated in those you believe all of these claims, at best the NBN and much more needs to happen, then the I have is this: before any of these wonderful get the thing built, and you need to get it done if there is one thing that is clear, as we look at the state of progress with the National Broadband from the lofty claims about the marvels that this more prosaic level of what is actually what we are getting for it, whether the rollout designed-the answer to all those things is: this is a mess. So the coalition makes no apologies for the sunlit uplands, which the member for Lyne us. We make no apology for turning away and very troubling picture. The proper role of Australia and in turn on behalf of taxpayers designed and ill conceived project-is to spent? What is happening with the rollout? presently conceived is going to be completed? before turning our minds to the marvels believe are just over the horizon. I am a very strong believer in broadband. social benefits of broadband. I have worked government and in the private sector, for many, broadband that I wrote a book about it-and what may say! But I would make the point that it generalities in the report that we have before the parliament and on behalf of the Australian rollout going? And when we turn to that question, going very, very badly. Let us start by looking according to NBN Co.'s first corporate plan supposed to pass 1.3 million premises. In fact, year-so there is only a month to go-it had that the estimates of usage of the network are extremely troublingly, that the build of the and is behind schedule and at the same time cash and spend lavishly on headcount. Let me make this particular comment, telecommunications sector for many years. telecommunications sector that people are leaving Optus, and have been doing so for several years very substantially in excess of what they were employer. There is no question that NBN Co. spending on staff and on other things in At the same time, the rollout is scandalously has been delivered is absolutely hopeless been done. I cite, for example, the rollout network, under Sol Trujillo at Telstra. I have but Telstra's delivery of the Next G network impressive engineering achievement. Or you Network, when you turn your eye away network is going to deliver, and get on to the happening now-how much money has been spent, is on time and whether the network been well turning our eyes away from the wafting vision of has once again been all too eager to lay before looking at the detail-and the detail is a very, this committee-on behalf of the Parliament of who are compulsorily investors in this badly ask: how is it going? How much money is being What confidence can we have that the project as All of that must necessarily and logically come that the credulous member for Lyne appears to I am a very strong believer in the economic and in the telecommunications sector, both in many years. In fact, I am so interested in a festival of pointy headedness that was, if I is simply not good enough to have these wafting us. We need to get into the detail on behalf of people to ask the detailed question, how is the the answer is unambiguous. The rollout is at some of the numbers. By 30 June 2013, released in December 2010, this network was on the most recent numbers, as at May this passed around 103,000 premises. We also see well behind what is forecast and we also see, fixed wireless network is running into difficulty we see that NBN Co. continues to burn through coming as I do from a background in the It is an open and notorious joke within the existing telcos, particularly Telstra and to go to roles at NBN Co. where they are paid previously paid by their previous private sector is spending in a profligate fashion and is a way that no private sector telco would do. behind schedule and the performance which if you compare it to any benchmarks of what has within one year of the 3G network, the Next G been critical of Sol Trujillo on many occasions, within a very short period of time was an could look at the rate at which both Telstra and Optus rolled out their HFC networks, their hybrid of Australia during the mid-90s. If you look out and you compare it to what has been achieved could look across the Tasman and you could Zealand. By December 2012, the Kiwis, with Bear in mind that at that time NBN Co. in began at roughly the same time. Australia is the performance of New Zealand, we would December last year. Wherever you go, if you look at the private mobile in Australia, and if you look across broadband network, you see that NBN Co. is Indeed, if you are looking for tangible evidence expected to be, you could look at the fact that $3.5 billion compared to what had originally Midyear Economic and Fiscal Outlook. Why strategy or fiscal discipline by the Treasurer, have. It is because the rollout is running consequence of a delay in the rollout. So when we look at the very basis, the focused on, on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia, determining whether taxpayers' money is being managed efficiently and cost effectively, there than that there are very serious red flashing lights mess, unsurprisingly, because we have a implementation. We have seen that with school insulation program and we are seeing it as mentioned the fact that the fixed wireless rollout the Australian Financial Review, even in wireless network will cover just 31,291 premises, 70,000 that the fixed wireless I come now to a question I have touched on the question of the NBN's management of human in running a company than in managing your the right people into do the job. It means more-I have already talked about the extent market levels. It also means maintaining a capable executives, senior management and directors Co. we have seen a very substantial amount amongst directors. We are also seeing a very rapidly growing February there were 2,477 employees. That numbers in June 2012. So this company is continuing to add people even though the rollout, fibre-coaxial networks, across many cities at the rate at which those networks were rolled by NBN Co., it is chalk and cheese. Or you have a look at what is being done in New their fibre rollout, had passed 134,000 homes. Australia had passed 72,400. The two rollouts a country five times as large. If we had matched have been at several hundred thousand by sector and its history of rollouts, both fixed and the Tasman at an analogous rollout of a fibre doing a very poor job against those benchmarks. that the rollout is well behind where it was funding in the budget in 2014 was reduced by been proposed as recently as the October is that? It was not a conscious cost reduction because that is not the kind of Treasurer that we well behind time. Those budget cuts are a very centre of what this committee should be in having oversight of this rollout and spent well, whether the project is being is no conclusion which can be reached other here. This rollout is in a mess and it is in a government which is absolutely atrocious at halls, we have seen that with the home well with the National Broadband Network. I is a long way behind schedule. According to the best case scenario by the end of June the which is only 45 per cent of the target of network was supposed to reach. already and will deal with in a bit more detail: resources. There is no more important task human resources efficiently. That means getting paying them what you need to attract them, but no to which NBN Co. has paid well in excess of team in place rather than churning through on a regular basis. Unfortunately, from NBN of churn amongst senior management and indeed head count for NBN Co. As at the end of is an increase of nearly 50 per cent on staff continuing to grow without restraint. It is the core job it is there to do, is running very badly behind plan. This is a very significant cost that taxpayers are funding. It is another disciplines that you would see in a similar troublingly absent. On the question of churn of employees, since 55 executive level employees have left the evidence of unusually high levels of churn directors.
