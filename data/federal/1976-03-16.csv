The humble PettraUan ition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUyleged showeth: That if existing income tax laws were amended so that the State Governments had the power to vary the amount of personal income tax there would be vanous undeInsurance sirable consequences, including (a) it would be grossly disadvantageous for Tasmania their and Tasmanians and would widen rather than lessen sioner the differences in standards of Uving amongst States; (b) it would become difficult ful program of personal tax mitment by the Australian Government to tax indexation would mean Utde if State Governments themselves had the ability to increase income tax rates; (c) it would open the way for State Governments to steadily increase income taxes and would therefore tend to increase the proportion of overall taxation Australia raised through income taxes; (d) it would mean that the Australian Government would lose the complete control that it has at present over the pattern of marginal income tax rates: this would further compUcate the already difficult task faced by the Australian Government of formulating a wages and industrial relations policy which will meet with wide community acceptance; (e) it would compUcate the overall task of economic management for the Australian Government if State Governments had the discretion to move income taxes in an opposite direction to that judged desirable on econonuc grounds. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that powers to vary income tax will not be given to State Governments and that a system of double taxation will not be imposed on incomes.

Health Insurance The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the Australian Medical Association and its affiliate, the Australian Association of Surgeons, intends entering into with the Hon. the Minister of State for Health, to alter the Health Insurance Act and regulations. That such alterations as proposed are purely the wishes of a minority group seeking privileges inrelationto the billing perof patients, and particularly pensioners and less well off is a members of the Australian community, which are detrimental to the spirit of the Act and contrary to the whole intention of the legislation. That the Association of Surgeons has demonstrated by its refusal to treat pensioner patients in designated community and other hospitals providing beds under section 34 of the said Act, that its agitation against medibank is purely the reaction of a selfish vested minority, and not in the best interests of the patients. That the efforts by the Association of Surgeons to undermine medibank by seeking to negotiate changes is the thin Income Tax edge of the wedge to dismantle the Health Insurance Act' an action which will not be tolerated by the Auscommunity in general and the pensioners, less priviand disadvantaged members of society in particular. . Your Petitioners therefore ask that the Australian Parliatotal ment refuse to countenance any changes to the Health Act, and particularly those sought by influential minority interests who have demonstrated particularly by actions in refusing to cooperate in the treatment of penpatients in hospital, that they do not have the interests the and welfare of patients as their prime concern.

4,Mr SPEAKER,POLITICAL PARTY FUNDS,"Order! The question anticipates the debate. I have ruled that a question may be asked understanding order 143 but that Income Tax it must not anticipate debate. Therefore, if the House honourable gentleman asks the honourable humble member who has given notice of a motion a question which requires from that honourable gentleman an answer which will anticipate what of perhe might say in a second reading debate, it is anticipating the debate and is out of order. The in honourable gentleman may ask questions which relate to the day on which the legislation will be or her introduced or, for example, whether the legislation has been drafted or whether the honourable gentleman can see a copy of the legislation. wages for the same job would were Quite clearly the tenor of the question is inviting the honourable member to whom the question is directed to anticipate the debate and his second reading speech. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, may I ask the honourable gentleman whether the Bill as he is drafting it will cover the pubhc disclosure of funds available to pohtical parties and candidates from trust funds established overseas?",20
5,Mr SPEAKER,POLITICAL PARTY FUNDS,I call the honourable member for Port Adelaide.,21
6,Mr YOUNG,POLITICAL PARTY FUNDS,"The proposed section of the legislauon will be identical with that introduced in the House during the term of the Labor Government. The audit sections are quite specific as to what they will cover, and of course that means that auditors set up by the Government must have full access at all times to accounts",21
7,Mr SPEAKER,POLITICAL PARTY FUNDS,Order! The honourable gentleman is now anticipating the debate.,21
8,Mr YOUNG,POLITICAL PARTY FUNDS,Perhaps I could just give the House an incident that would be covered,21
9,Mr SPEAKER,POLITICAL PARTY FUNDS,"No, the honourable gentleman is not entitled to give an instance.",21
10,Mr YOUNG,POLITICAL PARTY FUNDS,"Of course, all donations and all funds, set up in any manner, from which a candidate or pohtical party would receive a donation would be covered by the proposed legislation. I would seek from the other side leave to have incorporated in Hansard a statutory declaration that has been handed to me today showing how the Liberal Party collected £Stg96,000 in 1951 in London.",21
11,Mr SPEAKER,POLITICAL PARTY FUNDS,Order! The honourable gentleman is proceeding beyond the bounds of the Standing Orders. I ask the honourable gentleman to resume his seat. NA,21
12,Mr RUDDOCK,OPEN GOVERNMENT,"Has the attention of the Prime Mmister been drawn to statements by Mr received. Justice Kirby, Chairman of the Law Reform Commission, that attempts to break down the secretiveness of government would run into intense opposition? What steps does the Prime Mmister propose to take to ensure that adequate information is available to the public?",21
13,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OPEN GOVERNMENT,"This is an imporby tant matter. Sometimeago a former administragram tion had some views on the subject. If my aware recollection is correct, an interdepartmental committee was estabhshed to furnish a report which was designed to be a framework for legisofthe lation on freedom of access to information. The former Adnimistration, when it started to come more secretive because of the activities wished to conceal, then seemed to forget its original objectives. I have instructed my Department to prepare a submission which will go to the They Cabinet on this matter because I beheve that information ought to be accessible to the public to the greatest possible extent. I have also written to all Ministers asking them to ensure not only that they make themselves available wherever possible to the media and to those people who have a legitimate right to and need for information but also that their departments are as open as possible in providing accurate information to the pubhc. NA",21
14,Dr KLUGMAN,MEDIBANK REVIEW COMMITTEE,"Mr Speaker, I do not suppose I am entitled to comment on the last answer. At least we beheve in open opposition. My question is directed to the Minister for Health. Has the New South Wales Government made one or more submissions to the Medibank Review Committee? Will these and other submissions be published so to enable interested parties to comment? Is the New South Wales Government, in its submission, attempting to reimpose a means test on public hospital patients to help struggling surgeons?",21
15,Mr HUNT,MEDIBANK REVIEW COMMITTEE,"I understand that the New South Wales Government has made a submission to the Medibank Review Committee. I have not seen it; it is a matter for the Medibank Review Committee. I could not give a direct answer on whether the New South Wales Government has made one or more submissions. With respect to the latter part of the honourable member's question, I have not yet given consideration to whether those reports ultimately will be made public. In due course the Medibank Review Committee will be reporting to the Government, through the Minister for Health, as a consequence of the many submissions that it has NA NA",21
16,Mr CALDER,TERRITORY,"I address my question to the Minister for the Northern Territory and refer to a recent report that the Territory's overall civil works program has been reduced by $158m, or one-third, while Darwin's capital works prohas been slashed by $ 125m. Is the Minister of the source of thesefigures?Is this an accurate statement of the situation regarding the Northern Territory civil works program in view fact that 80 per cent of the Northern Territory's construction contracts are dependent on be the Commonwealth Government's initiative it compared with 20 percent in the States?",21
17,Mr ADERMANN,TERRITORY,"I have seen such reports. do not fairly present the situation. It is well known that the Government is reviewing all expenditure programs. It is true also that no part of Austraha more than the Northern Territory has more to fear from inflation. There has been a deferral of cenain civil works in the Northern Territory, but the statement that the Government is unaware of or unsympathetic to the private sector and unmindful of the fact that the private sector is dependent on pubhc sector expenditure in the Territory is not a fair statement. Indeed it was not pointed out, for instance, that in Darwin within the last few weeks something Uke $18m has been provided in excess of the appropriation for the home loans scheme and the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. That is not only to help the private sector to keep going; it also takes mto consideration the humane aspect of getting houses for the people of Darwin. I do not know the source of the figures. However, it ought to be kept in mind that the projects to be deferred are still subject to review. It is important also to emphasise that the actual cash flow effected in 1975-76 would represent only a smaU proportion of the actual value of the projects. Nor did the report point out that work already in progress outside Darwin, valued at something Uke $170m this year, should maintain a high cash flow over the balance of the present year. NA",21
18,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY AUTHORITY,"Is the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations aware of grave concern among staff members of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority in Hobart due to persistent rumours of impending staff dismissals? Does the Mmister recall an agreement of October last year between the Minister for Labor and Immigration in the previous Government and the Federated Clerks Union that no such dismissals would take place, and that staff would not be retrenched or posted to other States? What negotiations on this matter has the present Government had with the Federated Clerks Union? WUl the Government give a clear undertaking that it will not dismiss Authority personnel in Hobart?",22
19,Mr STREET,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY AUTHORITY,"I am aware of the situation which the honourable member has described. As the honourable member will know, the Government has recently received a copy of the Northrop report in which Mr Northrop, after being appointed by the previous Administration, has reported on possible alternatives for the future structure of the waterfront industry in Australia. The particular problem of Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority members and members of the Federated Clerks Union of Australia employed by that organisation has caused concern both to previous governments and to this one. The undertaking which the honourable gentleman seeks is very difficult to give because the Clerks Union members employed by the ASIA are not technically members of the PubUc Service and therefore no guarantee can be given to them that they will be absorbed into another avenue of the Public Service, because they are not members of it. The problem is causing me considerable concern and I have it under active investigation at the present time. NA",22
20,Mr KELLY,MOTOR VEHICLE INDUSTRY,"Is the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs aware that Australian exporters are at present subsidising the Australian car industry at the rate of $300m each year and at the rate of $4,000 for every person employed in making cars and components? Will the Minister assure me that the size of this burden will be borne in mind when decisions are made on how to protect the car industry in the future? Is the Mmister aware that the decision to revert to a 95 per cent component plan may increase the size of this burden?",22
21,Mr HOWARD,MOTOR VEHICLE INDUSTRY,"The honourable gentleman's question raises the issue of the Government's intentions regarding the car industry in Australia. This matter wuT very shortly be the subject of detaUed Cabinet consideration and it would be premature of me to speculate regarding that matter. However I can assure the honourable gentleman that aU interests, including those to which he drew attention in his question, will be taken into account during the Cabinet considerations. NA",22
22,Mr UREN,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"My question is directed to the Minister assisting the Prime Minister in Public Service matters. Were the reductions in staff ceilings in the Australian Public Service made without prior consultation with the Public Service Board? If so, was any advice sought from elsewhere, or were the decisions reached purely by a rule of thumb approach?",22
23,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF CEILINGS,"The decisions were taken after a report had come to me including advice from the PubUc Service Board, my Department and the Treasury. NA",22
24,Mr GOODLUCK,BUDGET PROPOSALS,Does the Prime Minister recall having warned in an address last Friday to the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures that the prospect was for a tough Budget this year? Was the Prime Minister implying that taxes would be increased during the coming year? What did he imply about the Budget?,22
25,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,BUDGET PROPOSALS,"There is one aspect which I should like to clarify and which was raised, I think, in the honourable gentleman's question. Traditionally when people have spoken of tough Budgets, that has heralded a situation in which people have been concerned that the major thrust of the Budget to be unveiled in the future months would be one in which taxes would be significantly increased. But the circumstances in which Austrahafindsitself at present as a result of the past 3 years of rather odd rule are somewhat different. There was a mad extravagance on the part of the previous Administrauon and in total a level of commitment from the Commonwealth Parliament which I doubt very much that Austraha can continue to afford. There seemed to be a view among our predecessors that the dollars they spent did not have to be found by the taxpayers of Austraha. Basically of course they do have to be found by the taxpayers of Australia. Our predecessors made holes in everyone's pockets. The sort of toughness that I was refening to is the pacity of this Government to make decisions about priorities concerning its own expenditure so that expenditure can properly be related to the kinds of resources and the proportion of resources which the Government should command, leaving an adequate area for private enterprise which is the great employer in Australia, to expand, to invest, to prosper and above all, to provide the jobs that are needed for the people of Australia. BUILDING INDUSTRY: APPRENTICES",23
26,Mr LES MCMAHON,BUDGET PROPOSALS,Is the Mmister for Employment and Industrial Relations aware that the buUding industry in New South Wales is almost coming to a halt? Is he also aware that in the 6 months to January 1976 there was a fall of 38.5 per cent in the intake of apprentices in the buUding industry and that in the next 6 months the fall could be greater? The faU comprises a of 48.4 per cent in bricklayers' apprentices,23
27,Mr SPEAKER,BUDGET PROPOSALS,"Order! I am sorry to interrupt the honourable gentleman, but he is giving mation. Questiontimeis for the purpose of ehcitthe ing answers. I call the honourable member for Sydney and ask him to reframe his question asking for information rather than giving it.",23
28,Mr LES MCMAHON,BUDGET PROPOSALS,"Mr Speaker, I shall ask the question. Could the Minister explain what measures the Government will be taking to rectify the anomaly of the fall in the intake of buUding trades apprentices comprising a fall of 48.4 per cent in bricklayers apprentices, 39.4 per cent in carpenters and joiners apprentices, 39.7 per cent in plumbers and gas fitters apprentices and a fall of 30 per cent in respect of other apprentices?",23
29,Mr STREET,BUDGET PROPOSALS,"I am aware that the buUding industry, not only in New South Wales but elsewhere in Australia, has been put in a very serious situation by the irresponsible actions of certain unions which have brought some multi-million doUar projects to a halt, thus costing many thousands of Australians their jobs. So far as the apprenticeship situation is concerned there is unfortunately a reluctance on the part of some employers to employ the number of skUled tradesmen-no t only bricklayers and other people in the building industry, but skUled tradesmen in other areas as well-that this country will need in the future. The Government does provide substantial incentives to the extent of about $3 5 m a year under the national apprenticeship assistance scheme. At the moment I have under review cathe detaUs of this scheme to try to ensure that money is spent in the most effective way. I am seeking views from the industry and the State authorities towards achieving a more effective result for this very considerable annual Commonwealth expenditure in the apprenticeship area. NA",23
30,Mr HASLEM,WALTER BURLEY GRIFFIN MEMORIAL,"Is the Minister for the Capital Territory aware that as a result of a competition launched by the previous Government, it is intended to construct a memorial to Walter Burley Griffin on top of Mount Ainslie, the mountain opposite this House? Is the Minister aware that the cost of construction of such a memorial would be $ 100,000? Does the Minister feel that such expenditure is appropriate at this time?",23
31,Mr STALEY,WALTER BURLEY GRIFFIN MEMORIAL,"I am aware of the facts mentioned by the honourable member. It was the faU National Memorials Committee, not the Department of the Capital Territory, which decided that the Walter Burley Griffin Memorial on Mount AinsUe would go ahead. At that time the Chairinforman of the National Memorials Committee was then Prime Minister, the present Leader of the Opposition. I can certainly understand the by concern of the honourable member but, because this is basically a recommendation of the National Memorials Committee, I will seek the advice of the new Chairman of the National Memorials Committee as to what should be done about it. PRIME MINISTER: RECORDING OF NA Mr E. G. Whitlam - I ask the Prime Minister a question arising from a comment I noted by the Leader of the House on the television program, This Day Tonight, on the last day the House sat, 4 March. Will the Prime Minister confirm that some or all of his interviews with journaUsts are tape recorded? Are the journaUsts informed in advance that tape recordings being made?",23
32,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INTERVIEWS,"If there is any Parliament, tape recording of any interview that I am giving to anyone the tape recorder is in full sight. other words, everyone would know of it. NA",24
33,Mr FISHER,ROAD GRANTS TO VICTORIA,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. The Minister recently announced road grants of $64m to State governAnseU, ments. It is my understanding that these grants were to assist local government to maintain ployment and to meet urgent road needs. Can the Minister advise me whether these conditions have been met and whether there are apparent inequalities in aUocations to municipalities with sinular difficulties?",24
34,Mr NIXON,ROAD GRANTS TO VICTORIA,"At the Premiers Conference the Premiers were informed that the Federal Government would make avaUable $64m for mas period? road needs and that of this amount Victoria's share would be $ 13.4m. There was to be a matching provision from the Victorian Government of $ 16.7m. The Federal Government renature. quested that all the States make as much of this money as possible available to local government authorities because of the paucity of funds reaching local government authorities due to the stupidity of the previous Government and the way opinion. in which it treated local government authorities. An agreement was reached between torian Minister for Transport and me as to the distribution ofthose funds, and the great bulk of those funds will go to local government ties. I am unable to comment on the distribution of those funds shire by shire. I have had no mation at this point from the Victorian but I will try to ascertain the position. I have heard of different amounts being granted to a variety of shires and I understand honourable member's concern is that there appears to be a lack of grants north of Victoria. I will try to ascertain from the Victorian Minister what share of the funds will be made avaUable to shires in that area. I am sure that he recognises, as I do, that it is important that the outlying shires in Victoria get their fair share. NA NA",24
35,Mr FRY,COMMONWEALTH POLICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General. I refer to the Attorney General's statement in the House on Thursday, 4 March, that there did not appear to be any substance in my aUegations of investigation by are Commonwealth PoUce arising from my association with the Fretilin movement. I now suggest to the Attorney-General that he has misled the either wittingly or unwittingly. In order to resolve this matter I ask the AttorneyIn General: WUl he call for all papers concerning the Commonwealth Police investigation of organisations concerned with the Portuguese East Timor Independence Movement? Will he particularly caU for the diary of the Commonwealth PoUce officer who questioned Miss Joan Secretary of the Australia East Timor Association on a number of occasions between 11 emFebruary and 24 February? WUl he also call for the diary of the Commonwealth PoUce officer who interviewed me in my office on Friday, 20 February?

49,Mr NEIL,LABELLING OF FOOD PRODUCTS,"I put a question to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. What comof the mittees or associations have issued or are draftwho ing standards relating to date stamping of products and disclosure of contents on labels? Are these standards advisory or mandatory? If advisory only, will the Minister consider prescribing such standards pursuant to section 63 of the Trade Practices Act?",25

The Food Standards Committee has will already issued a number of standards relating foodstuffs and is currently working on detailed standards relating to the date stamping packages. When these have been completed my Department will consider the possibility of making such standards, which when they come the committees would only be advisory, mandakeen tory. In the course of considering whether such standards should be mandatory, adequate time will be allowed for consultation with industry and with those in the community who are obhged to bear the cost of complying with the standards.

In view of other pressures for finances within that Institution, there is no guarantee that the courses will be funded in 1977. Will the Minister assure the House and those people ruruiing the courses that funds will be specifically earmarked for the courses in 1977 to allow the rational planning and extension of these vital courses?",25
52,Mr MACKELLAR,INTERPRETER AND TRANSLATO R,"As the House would know, prior to the honourable gendeman asking his previous question on this matter I had contacted the Prime Minister in relation to the courses under discussion. In fact, as a result of that consultation the courses are being funded from my Department for the remainder of this financial year. The question of the future funding courses is one for the appropriate Minister, is not at this stage myself. Of course any asfood surances would have to come as a result of Government consideration of the question. NA",25
53,Mr JULL,INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. He will be aware that small business is for the change in Government policy in the effective exemption rate on the investment allowance. Is he also aware that because of the present economic situation many investments, when the allowance is deducted, create a tax loss situation? Will he inform the to House whether these tax losses can be carried forward to succeeding years so that incentives to of food invest now will not be curtailed?",25
54,Mr LYNCH,INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE,"Since his election to this House from the honourable gentleman has shown a very interest in the small business community. That is completely consistent with one of the major objectives of the present Government. This Government's economic policy is to create an environment in which companies, large and small, can grow and be self-reliant and strong. In part, one of the purposes of the investment allowance is to provide a major stimulus to the small business community as well as to larger COURSES corporations. In response to the question asked by the honourable gentleman, I can inform him that where a taxpayer-for example, a small manufacturer-use s plant which he has purchased for purposes which will entitle him to the investment allowance and is in a tax loss situation, the losses can be carried forward. As the honourable gentleman would well understand, this will ensure that the incentive which the investment allowance is intended to create throughout the entire business community will not diminish on the basis mentioned. Mr Morris- I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. I require understanding order 321 that the Treasurer table the document to which he was referring in his answer.",25
55,Mr SPEAKER,INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE,The Treasurer will be required to table the document if he read from it and if it is not a confidential document. I did see the Treasurer reading from it. I ask him whether he read from the document. Mr Lynch-No .,26
56,Mr SPEAKER,INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE,The Treasurer says that he did not read from the document. ELECTORAL ACT: COURT NA,26
57,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PROCEEDINGS,"I direct my question to the Attorney-General. I refer to recent legal proceedings in the Australian Capital Territory relating to the Senate election and the alleged breach of the Electoral Act whereby an amount of $500 in $50 notes is now in the possession of the pohce. Following the pohce investigations, can the Attorney advise the House as to the sources of those funds, including the bank accounts on which they were drawn, and also as to the ownership of the money?",26
58,Mr ELLICOTT,PROCEEDINGS,I have no knowledge as to the source of the funds nor as to the ownership of the moneys.,26
59,Mr HOLTEN,PROCEEDINGS,"My question to the Minister for Primary Industry refers to the precarious situation of the dairy industry. Is the Minister aware that an efficient dairy farmer in Victoria, milking 90 cows twice a day 7 days a week, is earning the miserable income of about $70 a week and at the same time has to meet increased costs because of Labor Government caused inflation? Is he also aware",26
60,Mr SPEAKER,PROCEEDINGS,The honourable gentleman has given suflicient information. I think the time has arrived for him to ask his question.,26
61,Mr HOLTEN,PROCEEDINGS,"Is the Minister also aware that the jobs of many factory workers and other people indirectly dependent on the dairy industry are in jeopardy? Is he able to say whether the Government has been asked to help? If it has been asked, has any decision been reached?",26
62,Mr SINCLAIR,PROCEEDINGS,"As a result of a downturn in world markets, particularly for skim milk powder and casein, the tragic circumstances to which the honourable gentleman refened are unfortunately now creating a disastrous predicament for many dairy farmers. Unfortunately, the previous Government did Uttle about it. The circumstances of inflation which its economic policies engendered rather encouraged the plight in which dairy farmers now find themselves. Last Friday my colleague the Minister for Transport and I attended a meeting of more than 1000 dairy farmers at Leongatha. We were told of a not scale of relative returns of dairy farmers which, using the year 1972 as a base of 100, saw an increase to 174 of average weekly earnings but a fall to 38 of returns of dairy farmers from 1972 to the end of 1975. That period, as my colleague so rightly says, relates specifically to the 3 years in which the Labor Administrauon was in charge of the economy of this country. Both State and Federal governments have a responsibUity in this area. It is not a matter for any one State; rather it is a matter of all States of the Commonwealth having particular problems. Unfortunately dairy farmers have fallen mto a period when expected market opportunities are not only bad, as they are at the moment, but seem to trend downwards in the 1976-77 period. As a result, certainly, we are examining quite seriously and urgently proposals that have only just been tendered to the Government by the Australian Dairy Industry Council. As a result of that I would expect that the Federal Government would come to some decision on what help it might give within the next few weeks. NA ELECTORAL ACT: COURT NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Attorney General a question supplementary to that asked him by the honourable member for Kingsford Smith. Has the Attorney-General any knowledge of who has the custody of the money now? Does he know when the ownership and disposition of the money will be decided?",26
63,Mr ELLICOTT,PROCEEDINGS,"My recollection-it is only a recoUection-is that the funds were left with the Canberra Times. That is my recollection of the matter. So far as I am aware that is where the funds still are, but my statement is based on my understanding of the facts some weeks ago. NA",26
64,Mr FALCONER,HANG GLIDING,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Has he seen reports of yet another hang ghding injury over the weekend, this time through a young man making his first ghding attempt by jumping off a 33 metre cliff at a Victorian beach? Does the Minister recall that the last annual report of the Department of Transport stated that an Air Navigation Order specifying conditions for the operation of hang gliders was being drafted? When will such an Air Navigation Order be promulgated so that this apparently simple but potentially dangerous sport can be supervised properly? Will the Minister consider requiring that those who wish to participate in this sport must undergo some appropriate training in basic disciplines such as aeronautics and meteorology?",27
65,Mr NIXON,HANG GLIDING,"As I understand it, a regulation was drafted last year by the Department, which at that time was under the administration of the previous Government, to control hang ghding insofar as pubhc safety was concerned rather than the intrepid efforts of hang gliders themselves. That is as far as I propose to take it. I would treat hang gliding like hanging-five on a surfboard, water skiing, skin diving, mountain climbing or any other sport one likes to name. The day that Parliament has to regulate to stop the enthusiasm of young men trying something out I think will be the sorriest day for this I do not propose to do anything about it.

70,Mr JAMES,PROCEEDINGS,"I ask the Attorney-General: In view of the magistrate's decision in the Garland case, has he given consideration to adopting the same attitude at his counterpart in the New South Wales State Parhament and issuing an officio indictment because of the disquiet of Canberra citizens in connection with that decision?",27
71,Mr ELLICOTT,PROCEEDINGS,"I am not aware of any disquiet on the part of Canberra citizens. I have read the magistrate's decision. It is not my intention to file an ex officio indictment. I notice that the magistrate relied on a proposition of law which he apphed to the facts of the case. The proposition was this: A magistrate is clearly bound in the exercise of a sound discretion not to commit anyone unless a prima facie case is made out against him by witnesses entitled to a reasonable degree of credit In determining whether they will commit for trial justices should not balance the evidence and decide according as its preponderance which would be trying the case but should consider whether or not the evidence makes out a strong or probable or even a conflicting case of guilt, in any of which events they should commit. If, however, from the slender nature of the evidence, the unwonhiness of the witness or the conclusive proof of evidence produced on the pan of the accused they feel that the case is not sustained and that if they sent it for trial he must be acquitted they should discharge the accused. The magistrate went on to say: Now it is my view that the evidence against each of the defendants has established a prima facie case but it is my further opinion that a jury, properly directed, would not convict the defendants and I propose to discharge both defendants. That is a practice which is followed in New South Wales and in Queensland. It has also been followed in the Australian Capital Territory. nation. This magistrate considered the evidence. He gave it thought and care over a day and part of a day and in that period came to that view. The magistrate having done that, it is not my intention to take the matter any further, and I hope that this is the last time the matter will be menmagistrate's tioned in this House.",27

76,Mr CONNOLLY,CROWN PRIVILEGE,I ask the Prime Minister a ex question. Has any request been made to him regarding crown privilege with respect to a matter currently being heard before a Queanbeyan magistrate?,27
77,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CROWN PRIVILEGE,"I am not aware Royal of any such request but I will have some disthe cussion with the Attorney-General about matter and it may be that such a request could come forward. I should think that it would somewhat doubtful whether the Commonwealth Government could claim crown privilege about matters of which it did not have a detailed and intimate knowledge because they occurred on 13 December 1974, a year before the present Government came to power. If the Leader of the Opposition, as he now is, sought to apply to self the standards which he attributes he would have taken certain action because of that case pending in the Queanbeyan court. He sought to attribute certain attitudes to other people who may well have been involved in the matter but if he had acted as he indicated he thought others ought to have acted he would viously not have offered himself for leadership his party pending that particular case. Once decisions were made that have been would clearly have stepped aside until the case had been concluded. This is just another example of the Leader of the Opposition being perfecdy ready to apply standards to other people in other circumstances which he will never in a thousand years apply to himself.

Does this thousands of children suffering from asthmatic and other respiratory complaints? Since the cost of milk substitutes is in the vicinity of $10 to $20 a week for each affected child, will the Minister acknowledge that hardship is often caused? If does, will he agree to review this decision?",28
79,Mr HUNT,MILK SUBSTITUTES,"The Government acted upon the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee in deleting certain items from the pharmaceutical benefit list. The milk substitute to which the honourable member referred was one of the items which was recommended for letion. If the honourable member has any evinology dence that hardship is caused by this deletion would be very pleased to refer it to the PharInstitute maceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, but Government acted on the advice of an expert body, in accordance with tradition.

88,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FOR THE PARLIAMENT," I move: (1) That a Joint Committee be appointed to inquire into, report on and make recommendations for (a) a balanced system of committees for the Parliament; (b) integration of the committee system into the procedures of the Parliament, and (c) arrangements for committee meetings which will best suit the convenience of Senators and Members. (2) That the committee consist of four Members of the House ofRepresentatives nominated by the Prime Minister, three Members of the House of Representatives nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the House ofRepresentatives, three Senators nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate and three Senators nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate.

Appointment (16) That the foregoing provisions of this resolution, so far as they are inconsistent with the standing orders, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the standing orders. (17) That a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of this resolution and requesting that it concur and take action accordingly. One of the major concerns of this Government is to enhance the quality of Australian democracy. Democracy is essentially a process for taking decisions. In a modern representative democracy it is a process that demands popular control over the people's representatives. The quality of the democratic process is enhanced to the degree that decisions are based on proper examination of the issues, to the extent that those affected by governmental decisions can be consulted and have a chance to be heard before decisions are taken. Only in this way can the governmental the Senate process actively foster the consent of the governed. There are 3 areas in particular in which we have an opportunity to strengthen the democratic process in Australia. The capacity of the Austrahan people to participate effectively in the decisions of government has been weakened by certain trends. In thefirstplace, the growing centralisation of power in the Federal Government has reduced the effectiveness of participation at State and local levels. The reforms of the Federal system we propose will start effective power flowing back to local and State governments. Secondly, the effect of inflation, when combined with progressive income tax scales, has relieved governments of the pressure to place clearly before the people decisions to increase the personal tax burden. This is a duty that used to be regarded as fundamental to responsible democratic government. The introduction of tax indexation will put an end to that particular infringement on the people's right to be consulted. There is a third area in which the quaUty of Australian democracy needs strengthening-the functioning of this Parliament itself. The Parliament ought to be the place above all where policy can be fully debated and where legislation can be subjected to close and effective scrutiny. The Government beUeves that one of the most practical ways in which to achieve that objective is to strengthen the committee system of this Uament. In September 1974 a Joint Committee on the ParUamentary Committee System was estabUshed to look at a balanced system of committees and to report on how such a system of committees might be integrated into the procedures of the Parliament. The honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) presented an interim report of the Committee to this House on 15 October last year. I do not propose to comment in detaU at this stage on that report. I do, however, want to mention a number of matters which the Government hopes the reconstituted committee will take into account in its further deUberations. The Government beUeves that there is much to be gained from improvedfinancialscrutiny of departments of the Executive. Honourable members will be aware of the Government's concern to minimise waste and to maximise efficiency in government expenditure. We have already appointed the Administrative Review Committee to examine these things. The Government also places high priority on achieving an appropriate balance of resources between government, on the one hand, and individuals and private enterprise, on the other. In achieving the objectives of efficiency and balance many critical decisions are of course taken by government departments in forming their estimates of expenditure. The Government beUeves that at the present time this process of formation of the mates is not subject to adequate scrutiny by this House. People are elected to this House, to this Parliament, to ensure, amongst other things, that their tax monies are well used. If it is to fufil that trust, the Parliament must have adequate instruments of supervision and control at its disposal. This Government recognises that the ultimate power of Parliament over the Executive is its control over and scrutiny of the Government's expenditure of money. This is fundamental to the functioning of our democratic parliamentary institutions. I hope that the Joint Committee will not believe that the Government is pre-empting its work if I say that the Government very much hopes that an Estimates Committee of the House ofRepresentatives will be established before the end of the autumn sittings. The broad purpose of this committee would be to consider how, if at all, the poUcies implied in thefiguresof expenditure and in the Estimates may be carried out more economically. The Government will also introduce resolutions to establish a number of other committees, pendingfinaldecisions on the future of the committee structure, decisions Par- which I hope will be based on the report of the committee. The Government expects, of course, that all committees of the Parliament, including the Committee the subject of the present motion, should bear in mind the Government's attitude on the restraint of public expenditure and the need to work within the staff ceUings and appropriations for the parUamentary departments. The attention of honourable members is drawn to clause 13 in this respect. The proposed Committee will have a similar composition as regards Government and Opposition and House of Representatives and Senate to that in the last Parliament. It is proposed that the chairman should be elected from the members nominated by the Prime Minister or by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Withers). The motion reconstitutes the Committee with powers and functions similar to those possessed by the Committee in the 29th Parliament. It gives the new Committee power to consider and to make use of the minutes of evidence and records of the previous Committee. The Committee has been asked to present its final report by 26 May with a view to allowing honourable members and honourable senators to consider it before debate in the Budget sittings. I am sure that all honourable members will look to the report of the Committee for valuable and constructive recommendations on the functioning of this Parliament. estiThe development of a practicable and workable committee system is of great importance for this Parhament if it is to discharge its functions as they ought to be discharged. Views on the appropriate structure for our committee systems differ. One view looks to specialist committees-at the extreme a committee for each department-to perform the Parliament's function of review. For a number of reasons my personal view is that a structure of specialist committees does not fit well with our parUamentary system, though I am aware that there have been particular exceptions, and there are particular exceptions, in practice. If members of Parliament are to exercise a broad judgment and control of the business of government a broad knowledge and insight into the nation's affairs often is more valuable than a highly specialised but Umited knowledge. My personal beUef is that if this House could establish two general purpose committees, such as I have indicated on earlier occasions, its work could be greatly expedited. Such general purpose committees could lighten the workload on the whole House and enable more time to be devoted to debate on important issues. It might be envisaged that on those committees there would be a core membership with a right for other members to attend when matters of interest to them are being dealt with. There would need to be a steering committee to determine which matters should go to the full House and which to the general purposes committees. Contentious matters or matters of a poltiical nature obviously should go to the fuU House. The Joint Committee on Parliamentary Committees is dealing with important matters which affect the fundamental working of this institution of Australian democracy. I believe that we have much to learn from the practice of other parUamentary systems, especiaUy the British experience. I know that aU members of the Committee will work to prepare a report which will be of lasting value to Austraha's national parUamentary institutions. I would like to add, Mr Speaker, that I believe that if this report is as good as I would hope, as good as this Parliament has a right to expect, it will initiate, or enable to be initiated, some fundamental changes in the workings of this Parliament which will be of lasting and permanent value to Australian democracy and make this institution function much better over the next 76 years than it has over the last 76 years.

(19) That the foregoing provisions of this resolution, as they are inconsistent with the standing orders, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the standing orders. Honourable members will recall that we have for some years now had a committee of this House set up to consider and report on road safety matters. The Select Committee on Road Safety was estabhshed by the House on 27 April 1972 on my motion. The Select Committee was reconstituted on 12 April 1973 and 12 March 1974 while a Standing Committee on Road Safety was estabUshed on 18 July 1974. The estabhshment and work of this Committee has received the support of honourable members from both sides of the House. The terms of reference which I propose are, as far as the scope of the work of the Committee is concerned, identical with the earUer terms of reference. There are a number of detaUed changes in the machinery provisions included in the terms of reference but these are designed to fit in with a standard approach which we are adopting with regard to all such standing committees. A review of the activities of the Committees on Road safety since their appointment shows the importance of involving representatives of the Commonwealth Parliament directly in what is undoubtedly a national problem. The existence of the Committee has provided both a forum for the presentation of information relevant to the road accident problem and an independent Une of mquiry into aU its aspects. Honourable members wiU be aware that the Committees have produced two reports. The first, in 1973, Road Safety, a National Authority, The Constitutional Position, Statistical Needs, highlighted the national nature of many aspects of road safety. It recommended the creation of a national authority on road safety and standards as a statutory authority. As part of its drive to achieve savings in administrative costs the Government decided to reverse the previous Government's decision to establish a Road Safety and Standards Authority as a separate entity. However, this does not in any way indicate a lessening of our commitment to road safety. I should make it quite clear to honourable members that the establishment of the Authority was only in its very early stages when our decision was taken. Virtually the whole of the staff of the the investigations of other ParAuthority was made up of officers formerly with the Department of Transport and still in fact have leave to report from time to located in the Department's Melbourne office. These officers will simply be returned to the departmental strength. I must also stress that the budgetary savings which we will achieve this financial year do not mean that we have cut back on efforts to improve road safety. Certainly we so far are not outlaying funds during this financial year on facilities originally proposed to be established for the Authority at Albury-Wodonga. This is simply because we are re-examining how best to provide the required facUities. The second Committee report in 1974 dealt with Roads and their Environment. During the Ufe of the last Parliament the Committee had been engaged in an active investigation of the vehicle factor in road safety but had not reported on this matter. Over the past 5 years we have seen a remarkable downturn in deaths and injuries amongst vehicle occupants. In 1974 13 per cent fewer drivers and passengers were killed than in 1970; this of course has resulted in large measure from the compulsory use of seat belts following the example set late in 1970 by the Victorian State Government. In each of the years since then the number of persons killed has been less than during that record year. Nevertheless, the annual toll of deaths exceeds 3500, with another 90 000 persons being injured. The Government fully recognises the gravity of this situation despite improvements which have been made in recent years through changes to vehicle design and the road environment. As a nadon we cannot afford to let up in our efforts to contain this major social problem. My Government's policy in this area is clear and has been stated on a number of occasions. I would in conclusion mention three vital areas. First, there will be continued support for research. My department is curremly sponsoring more than thirty projects being conducted by universities and other research organisations. We intend to seek greater publicity for results of research so as to increase community awareness of factors contributing to road accidents and preventive measures which should be taken. Secondly, we will support work for road safety through the Australian Transport Advisory Council and its associated committees. Through this we will continue to confer with the States with a view to improving vehicle safety standards and strengthening the vehicle certification systems, promulgating a uniform system of traffic rules and regulations throughout Austraha and encouraging better driver standards. Finally, and again in co-operation with the States, we will be engaged in a progressive road improvement program. The road improvement program is recognised by all in the road safety field as being as much an essential factor in road safety improvement as are improvements in vehicle safety and design and in driver training and behaviour. It is important that the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Austraha should be directly involved in the consideration of issues affecting the safety of our road system. I commend to honourable members the proposal to re-establish the Standing Committee on Road Safety. Debate (on motion by Mr Scholes) adjourned. NA ENVIRONMENT, CONSERVATION AND NA",32

The House of Representatives Standing Comand mittee on Environment and Conservation was first appointed in May 1973 as the result of a and recommendation by the House of Representatives Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation. Since its inception the Standing Comofthe mittee on Environment and Conservation has in all inquired into many issues of importance for environmental protection and has produced several five to valuable reports, including those on the environmental impact of freeways, the Blackbutt Reserve, the operation of the Softwood Forestry Agreements Act 1967-72, and development pressures on Jervis Bay.

It is generally agreed by memof the bers of this Parhament and the general public in all that Aboriginal affairs, deahng with the lives of people requiring special attention within our five to community, should so far as humanly possible be be nomioutside the bounds of poltiical bickering. The present Government, when in opposition, willingly participated in the work of the previous Committee and the passage of this motion will as a ensure the conunuance of a bi-partisan approach by disto Aboriginal affairs. It will also enhance the expression of pubUc support in the referendum of the com1967 when the Federal Government, under the leadership of the late Harold Holt, was entrusted who with the paramount responsibUity to legislate for a meeting of Aborigines throughout the country. Since the appointment of the first Standing member to Committee in May 1973, 3 reports have been prepared and submitted on different aspects of subAboriginal life. The first of these-in 1974-wa s and on the Present Conditions of the Yirrkala People who shall in Northern Territory. This was concerned to largely with the effects of bauxite mining on the Aboriginal people in the area but also dealt with health and education-othe r matters of direct and personal concern to the community. The second report, pubUshed last year, examined the proceedhealth situation of Aboriginal communities in the move any Perth, Collie and Gnowangerup areas of Western Australia. The report also covered matters have which closely related to health, such as nutritional deficiencies and alcoholism as well as to move from place housing and educauon. The third and last report was on the effecfrom tiveness of special work projects sponsored by the Government through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. These projects aim to increase before the participation of Aborigines in the work force, to provide on-the-job traiiiing for unskilled staff, workers, and, importantly, to provide employment opportunities for Aborigines in areas where jobs are scarce. Many of these projects are supervised by local councils and have the double benefit of improving facilities through pubhc works while providing jobs. All these reports have been most valuable to my Department. But I beheve their greatest value has been in drawing to the attention of the Commonwealth Parhament actions which can be taken for the Aboriginal people in the closest consultation with them. The fact that the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs is a broadly-based body, cutting through Party affiliations, lends weight to its findings and to its recommendations. Aboriginal affairs is a subject on which most people, if not all people in Austraha, have some opinion. It is a matter of importance to members of this Parhament. The present Government has acknowledged its responsibility to give new and refreshed meaning to the lives of the Aboriginal people of this country as well as a new sense of mvolvement in their future. The Committee proposed in this motion will assist in these objectives. Aboriginal Affairs is above all a sensitive issue. It is vital that Parhament be kept fully informed of what is happening in thisfield.This motion calling for the re-establishment of the Committee indicates the importance which this Government attaches to it.

Under the current program construction funds will not be needed until 1978-79 at the earhest for the commencement of site works. However, what will proceed with the re-establishment of the Joint Standing Committee is the important preliminary planning and design work which in a project of this size, requires a significant lead time.

AUSTRALIA-JAPAN FOUNDATION BILL 1976 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 February on motion by Mr Malcolm Fraser: That the Bill be now read a second time. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of community the Opposition) (3.39)- Iriseto support the Bill tance-i to estabhsh the Australia-Japan Foundation. warmer. The Bill itself has a unique history. It is the first legislation of the Fraser Government. It was the first legislative casualty of the coup d'etat. on the notice paper of 11 November in my name. I was to make the second reading speech that afternoon. The speech deUvered by the Prime Mmister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on 19 February of was, at least in the specific references to the Foundation-in the choicest parts, in the purple passages-cas t in the precise terms of my schedspectrum uled speech-m y undeUvered oration-of 11 November. NaturaUy I endorse the BUT, and I of applaud the speech, at least those parts to which I stated: I have referred. On this occasion, bipartisanship MrExtending is complete. As I was about to say before I was interrupted 18 weeks ago, the purpose of the legislation is to set up the Australia-Japan Foundation as an independent statutory authority comprising a minimum of 5 and a maximum of IS members. It seeks to develop a structure which will foster a broader and more comprehensive understanding between Japan and Australia. The Foundation is a valuable contribution to an objective which my Government set for itself steadfastly, consistently and successfuUy-the strengthening of the relations between Australia and Japan, and the deepening of understanding between our two peoples. Japan is of course our principal trading partner, but the Foundation recognises that the relationship is, or should be, many-sided. There has tended to be a great imbalance in the nature of the relationship between Australia and Japan. The commercial connection has tended to be ovemhelming, almost to the exclusion of cultural and social links. The Bill arises from the events of 1 November sciences, 1974. On that day, Prime Minister Tanaka and I teria signed the Australia-Japan Cultural Agreement. try Also on that day at a parUamentary luncheon in and honour of Prime Minister Tanaka, I stressed the Australians need for our two countries to establish a genuine assistance and deep understanding of each other's attitudes and cultures. I said: For all the growth in co-operation of the past for all the growing closeness in our relauons in that must be said that all too often we look at each other stare of mutual incomprehension and mutual ignorance. It is therefore very important that we should create a framework within which well motivated and competent Australians Japanese who wish to build understanding and goodwill tween our two countries can operate more effectively. this in mind we are proposing vehicle to promote and foster a continuing program to and widen mutual contacts at all levels-business , cultural, scientific, trade unions. We all recognise our great of interest, equally we have to recognise that there are great barriers-language , tradition, culture, disn the way of making that community even closer and Let us begin to break those barriers down. In a letter of 12 December 1974,1 invited a comIt was mittee comprising Mr Kenneth Myer, DSC, Professor E. S. Crawcour of the Australian National University, Mr Munro of my Department and Mr J. R. Rowland of the Department Foreign Affairs, under the chairmanship of Sir John Crawford, to prepare a basic outUne report on the arrangements needed to advance a wider of relauons between the peoples of Australia and Japan through the estabhshment a foundation or simUar institution. In my letter beyond the range of the Cultural Agreement Tanaka and I agreed that it was essential that Australia and Japan should increase the opportunities for the people of each country to come to know each other better and to understand more deeply the importance of each country to the other. We agreed accordingly that there should be further consultations on the arrangements needed in each country, and between them, to advance a wider spectrum of relations between the two peoples . . . Basically, I would like to see a concept developed which would give Australia a base in Japan for the range of contacts we wish to develop, with Japan, of course, having the option to base a counterpart operation in Australia. I envisage that such a concept would look to the eventual establishment of a joint Australia-Japan committee of management or foundation to advise policy for both governments. On 2 March last year Sir John Crawford sent me the unanimous report of the Committee which I had asked to assemble. On 13 August last I stated in a Press statement announcing our decision to legislate during the next session of Parliament for the estabhshment of an AustraliaJapan Foundation that: The Foundation will promote mutual visits by selected persons and also research and comparative studies in depth of a diverse range of topics embracing but not limited to the social institutions of the two countries, the social and natural industrial and creative arts and the humanities. Crifor assistance by the Foundation will be based on the contribution proposals will make to knowledge of one counin the other, tofillingkey gaps in mutual understanding to extending the scope for fruitful co-operation between and Japanese in each country. Those receiving will be competent persons who are already making a contribution to their own sphere of activity. The present Bill stems therefore from initiatives generation, which were taken in November 1974 and from time it the report of the Crawford Committee. I join in with a the tribute that the Prime Minister paid to Sir John Crawford in this regard. As in so many matand ters, he has shown himself to be one of the great beAustraUans of our generation in administration, With in academic Ufe and in international affairs. I to establish a foundation as a build also share in the Prime Minister's admiration for academic, the work of our ambassador Mr Mick Shann in Tokyo. With very long experience in the Department of Foreign Affairs and a most acute mind and engaging personahty, he has devoted himself admirably to this task- a task which I had in mind when I appointed him to that post. I also think it appropriate to mention the former Japanese ambassador to Australia, His Excellency Mr Kenzo Yoshida who throughout his period in Canberra-h e was ambassador throughout the term of my Government-prove d a good friend to Australia as he is a most distinguished servant ofhis own country. Perhaps I might be forgiven for saying that I found it extraordinary, remarkable and unpalatable to note some statements made outside the House by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and the Foreign Minister  neglected or downgraded relations with Japan. These are quite fallacious and gratuitous statements. The truth is that my Government placed our relations with Japan at the very forefront of our foreign pohcy. No government has been more active in promoting the mutual interests of the 2 countries, though certainly we never assumed that spokesmen for Japanese business interests were automatically the spokesmen for the Government and people of Japan. We worked to place and did place relations between Austraha and Japan on a more assured and more mature basis than ever before. Accordingly, I welcome the commitment in the Governor General's Speech, repeated in the Prime Minister's second reading speech on this Bill, to the early completion of the treaty of friendship and co-operation which my Government was in the process of concluding with Japan. The delay in signing to which both speeches referred was the result of events before and after 11 November. One of the very earliest decisions I made after taking office in December 1972 was to reverse the attitude of previous Liberal-Country Party governments which had consistently rebuffed the Japanese wish to conclude with Australia, as Japan has concluded with so many other countries, a treaty of friendship, commerce and navigation. That attitude had been reiterated as late as October 1972 at the first meeting of the Australia-Japan Ministerial Committee when the Australian delegation was led by the then and present Deputy Prime Minister. Negotiations between Australian and Japanese officials had been carried on since October 1973 when Prime Minister Tanaka and I agreed in principle in Tokyo to the NipponAustralia Relations Agreement. The term NARA was suggested by Prime Minister Tanaka himself, partly as an acronym and partly because of the historical significance of the city of Nara in the Japanese islands-th efirstpermanent capital which was ever established by a government of Japan and a city which is the prime archeological as well as one of the prime historical sites in that country. The problems associated with those negotiations had largely come down to questions of definition of terms. My understanding is that there are now no matters of substance which cannot be swiftly resolved. A few days before the coup d'etat I had given instructions for the negotiations to be concluded forthwith. I can see no reason why the 2 Prime Ministers should not sign the treaty during the Australian Prime Minister's visit to Japan later this year. Like this Foundation, that treaty will receive our full support. I take particular satisfaction in both. It is more important to be the father than the midwife. The Opposition supports the Bill and, even more, its aims-the continuing and enduring strengthening of relations between Australia and Japan and their peoples.",37
98,Mr CONNOLLY,PARLIAMENT HOUSE," I take great pleasure on this occasion in being able to speak on a subject which for obvious reasons has achieved a considerable degree of unanimity on both sides of this chamber. Whether one wishes to be th"". father or the midwife, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) so eloquently pointed out, no doubt depends to some extent on the legality of the union. The honourable gentleman also said that in his view the position adopted by the present Government in relation to the activities ofhis Government with regard to Japan was less than straightforward. May I point out that whUe we may all agree on the obvious need to maintain a close and growing relationship with Japan, the phUosophical approach adopted by various Ministers in his Government, in particular the former Minister for Minerals and Energy, leaves one to conclude beyond doubt that there could be no Japanese businessman today who had any deaUngs with Australia, in particular with the Australian Government, during the last 3 years who did not return to his land confused, on occasions berated, and with no doubt in his mind that the close relations which should have developed between our 2 nations had suffered fundamentaUy during those 3 years. The Australia-Japan Foundation is another guidestone on the road to better relations between our 2 countries. Nevertheless the substance of our relationship is and will remain economic. This is easUy Ulustrated by a few basic statistics. Japan is Austraha's largest export ket and our third largest source of imports after the United States of America and the United Kingdom. In 1974-75, Austrahan exports to Japan reached $2,40lm or 28 per cent of our total exports while imports from Japan had a value of $1,420 or 18 per cent of total imports. Thus in terms of the value of 2-way trade, Japan is Austraha's most important trading partner. Conversely, Austraha is Japan's second biggest trading partner in terms of total 2-way trade. Japan's imports from Australia in 1974, represented 6.5 per cent of its total imports while 3.5 per cent of Japan's exports were sent to Austraha. We remain a major supplier to Japan of a wide range of industrial raw materials and agricultural products. We are currently Japan's main source of iron ore, coking coal, alumina, bauxite, wool, sugar and meat. Nevertheless the depth of the relationship must also develop on the human level. It is putting on record that in the last 30 years, since the conclusion of the Second World War, commodities Australia's attitude to Japan has markedly. From a state of complete and utter distrust when no Japanese representative of that Government could visit Austraha without some fear and trepidation, we have developed to the point where it remains in the national interests both countries that our officials and our peoples be encouraged to come closer together so that can not only overcome the sad legacy of the but also together, and only together, build South East Asia and in the Pacific a region of peace and Security for us all.' I believe we much to learn and the Japanese have much to teach us apart from their capacity to unite, to work together, to overcome their own common problems and by so doing improve the common good. In the commercial field, for example, it is information. worth taking account of the famous which is a federation of economic organisations. We do not have an equivalent in Austrahan but it is worth noting that this organisation, which is Austraha the Japanese Industrial Structure Council, is complex made up of some 20 committees which facets and sections of the Japanese economic community. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which is equivalent more or less to the Austrahan Department of Overseas Trade with commerce and industry thrown in for good measure, never enters into international negoprices tiations without the full support and coUnfortunately operation of the Keidanren and the relevant Japanese industrial committee. Unfortunately area for far too long Austrahan industry has tended mardivide itself between companies, to allow our markets to be dissected and the prices which should be paid for our commodities to suffer from the fact that we are divided in our approach to the purchaser. This is a matter of considerable importance because for obvious reasons advantages can be gained by both sides to a negotiation if the Australian coal industry, for example, is able within its own organisation to come to an agreed price and with the support of the Australian Government then go into a negotiating role. There have been examples in the past of representatives of Japanese companies wishing to import Australian commodities going to every producer in an industry on the wise principle of dividing and ruling with the obvious result that Austraha has often lost from those negotiations. I believe the Government's policy today makes it quite clear that in future, along with Austrahan industry, we will work to ensure that we get a fair price for our commodities, worthwhile at the same time guaranteeing the Japanese and the other major importers of our that they will have adequate access improved to Austraha's resources. The Leader of the Opposition made a few references to areas in which there have been some difficulties with Japan in recent years. Of of course one of the most notable of these is the question of Japanese beef imports. The Japanese we Government imposed a ban on beef imports in past January 1974 and that seriously affected in Austraha's rural industry. The ban was not finally relaxed until June 1975 after Australia have had used considerable diplomatic pressure on the Japanese to have the situation rectified.",40
99,Mr LLOYD,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,It is still not entirely relaxed.,41
100,Mr CONNOLLY,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"It is still not entirely relaxed. I thank the honourable member for that Austrahan tariff and quota policy is Keidanren difficulty especiallywill a matter which probably always be a of raw materials who wisheswith in dealings to an importer export to thefinishedproduct. Thisfieldis both and difficult but it is an area which must cover all be mentioned in this context. Another subject which must be considered is our prices policy of exports to Japan. In 1974, in the wake of massive increases in the price of oil, the Department of Minerals and Energy tried directly to intervene in the process of negotiating for various Australian raw materials. it went too far and caused much confusion both in Australian and Japan. Another of potential political contention is the questo tion of foreign investment. By 1974 Australia accounted for only one per cent of Japan's nonferrous metals investment abroad, compared with over a third in 1970 and nearly the same amount in 1971. Japan has expressed on many occasions its desire to become involved in various projects in Austraha. It is prepared to do this on the basis of majority Australian ownership. All it asks is a degree of participation as it Ueves, not without reason, that through participation it is in a better position to guarantee its sources of raw material. There is no doubt that the possibUity of Japan equity in some of these projects, notably coal mines in Queensland and iron ore projects in Western Australia, must be to Australia's long term benefit, for today, as in the past, Australia suffers from real Umitations in relation to our capacity to produce enough domestic capital to meet the enormous needs which we have in developing our significant resources. UnUke the previous government, we do not espouse a pohcy of leaving our resources in the ground. We believe they are there for the good of Australia, for all Australians and certamly for those who come after us. For example there is considerable doubt as to how long the world's needs for uranium will exist. Many people presume that it will not be after the year 2000. Therefore there is a case for the development of Australia's uranium resources as soon as possible because there is nothing so pomtless as having a resource in the ground of Uttle value. The future of Australian and Japanese relaprepared tions are fundamental to Australia's economic convinced that Australia development. A recent study by the Economic Research Centre forecast an annual such a treaty. It may well be that the growth rate of some 7 per cent. Many economists believe that is somewhat optimistic. Whether accept a base of five or six per cent, the fact remains that this represents a significant expanever, sion of the Japanese economy countries Uke Australia, enormous opportunities share common for our exports. The Deputy Prime Mmister (Mr trialised, democratic Anthony) on his return from Japan pointed out Australia, underdeveloped-w several areas in which Australian exporters expect considerable expansion in their trade with in our part of the world from the same see Japan. I should enumerate some of them. The first is natural gas from Australia's North West Shelf. Enormous resources of finance will be the required before that gets off the ground, but it watch can and must be done. The second is uranium, sure that for which Japan will be a major market I mention also coal and iron ore. Japan has been planning a 50 per cent increase in its steel prowUl duction by 1980. Joint research and developultimate ment of hydrogenation projects involving conversion of coal to other forms of energy will also cost an enormous amount for research and technology progress. But together Japan and Australia can work to achieve these most important goals. FinaUy I mention our long term products, wool and wheat, which will always require the maintenance of a substantial expon market. The Deputy Prime Minister also envisaged a new phase in Australia's trading relationship be- with Japan which we hope will be enshrined in a revised Japan-Australia trade agreement to be concluded in due course. The diplomatic symbol of this new relationship is the treaty of friendship and co-operation which was initiated by the previous Government, but it found to its cost that it was easier to talk in glib terms about such a treaty without examining in detail its full ramifications. The negotiations which have taken place between Australia and Japan for over 2 years are symptomatic of the fact that a treaty of substance between 2 major trading nations is not an easy thing to achieve. It is not just a question of sewing words together and hoping that they are sufficiently clear that future generations will not try to read into them what was not meant to be there in thefirstplace. Our agreement must be one in which both parties are aware of the dotting of every ' i ' and the crossing of every't'. Because of the linguistic difficulties between Japan and Australia it is even more important that our agreement be fully understood by all parties before it is signed. For that reason I applaud the fact that neither Government has been such to force Australia mto an agreement of enormous importance until we are fully and Japan wiU both Japanese benefit in then: own way from conclusion of Australia-Japan relations are about to enter upon the new phase, we refened to by the Deputy Prime Minister. Howit is quite probable that there will be and hence, for changes tionship in the overall framework of the relabetween the 2 countries. Although we interests-w e are both rich, indusand relatively, in the case of e will have our could disagreements. We will not necessarily events viewpoint. The relationship which Japan will build between the Soviet Union on the one hand and China on other could cause tensions. Australia must the position with great caution and make by 1985. clear to theourJapanese, point of view is always made quite because in the long term it be upon Japan's economic shoulders that the development especiaUy of South East the Asia and the Pacific must depend. There are many nations in South East Asia today which suffered greatly from the Japanese during the Second World War and from what they see as her economic colonialism today. Japan does not hold in South East Asia a reputation as good as that of Austraha. Therefore another facet to our relationship. We must encourage Japan to change its commercial attitudes so that its position in South East Asia will be enhanced. Through the acceptance of Japan's position in our part of the world Austraha's interests will also be met. These are matters of considerable subtlety. They are very difficult problems to solve and they will require a considerable diplomatic effort on the part of Austraha. I beheve that the Foundation about which we are debating will remain as a Uving testimony of the work of men Uke our Australian Ambassador, Mr Mick Shann, the previous Japanese Ambassador to Australia, Mr Yoshida, and the many other Japanese and Australians who are convinced that the overaU development of our 2 countries will require that we pass from an entirely economic relationship to one of more human depth. Through this Foundation we must buUd a structure not dissimUar to the famous ChurchUl Fellowships which have helped so many Australians to travel and improve their understanding of other people, then* problems others: and achievements. The Japanese are an island people. Island people are said to have some strange characterseUers istics. For example, the British were said to Ueve that God must be an Anglo-Saxon. We dent know that God is neither an Anglo-Saxon nor Japanese. The similarities in the history and attitiating tude adopted by both the British and Japanese deserve very serious exarnination. Many of us the descendants of an island people and we inhabit the largest island in the world. We need to show Australia to the Japanese as a nation which appreciates theh* problems and achievehe ments but which expects in return to receive from the Japanese a sinular effort to bring our nations closer together. The bonds are significant in economic terms but they have a long way to before they build up a substantive human industry. element. Australians have done much in recent years. We had an inter-departmental committee on Japan, the Australian-Japan Business CoThat operation Committee, the Pacific Basin omic Council, the Australian-Japan Committee, the Cultural Agreement and now the Australian-Japan Foundation. Australia has done its fah share to bring our 2 nations together. Let us make sure that in this Parliament the bipartisan spirit for the development of the relations between our 2 countries will grow even this is stronger in the years ahead.",41
101,Mr CONNOR,PARLIAMENT HOUSE," I listened with great interest to the remarks of the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) who has just resumed his seat. Anyone who was not informed might infer that the former Labor Government never existed or that it did not inherit a chaotic situation in relation to the minerals export industry to Japan. I repeat that the Labor Government found sheer unadulterated chaos. In the mining industry and particularly in coal and iron ore it found internal divisiveness in each of the States. EquaUy it found divisiveness and competition between the States. The Labor Government organised and introduced a fundamental principle, that there should be the maximum Australian ownership and control of Australian resources. One thing which the honourable member has conveniently overlooked is that the Japanese have a better appreciation today than ever before of Australia as a result of the activities of the recent Labor Government. The Japanese respect 2 things above all One is strength and the other is integrity. They know that Australia has both, and particularly under a Labor administration. To the letter we approached them on this basis-of willing deaUng with wUUng buyers, of mutual becomplementarity on both sides with each depenon and vitally interested in the other. The Japanese responded. I have the credit for negothe biggest single commercial transaction with them. That was for the arrangement I are entered into with the Nippon Steel Corporation now and its Chairman of Directors, Mr Inayama. That has been glossed over. When the Minister for Overseas Trade (Mr Anthony) went to Japan was told that that was what the Japanese adhered to, and there were very good reasons for 2 it. For thefirsttime a government in Australia knew, understood and exercised a benign but go effective supervision over the minerals export I repeat that it was a benign supervision but it was an effective one. For the first time an Australian administration was fully informed as to aU the vagaries, all the complexities and the inner costs of mineral production in Australia. information is avaUable to this day, the Econpropaganda of the current Government Ministerial notwithstanding. I want to refer the House to an editorial of the Sydney Morning Herald of 6 February last when it was clearly indicated to the Minister for seas Trade, who was then in the process of going to Japan to do a Utde trading of coal in particular and meat, that he might well take a leaf out the book of the Labor Administration which had done well. The Labor Government found when a it came into office that the average export price hard coking coal to Japan was about $ 11 per ton. When it left office the price was over $38. More than that, in the arrangement which I entered into with Mr Inayama, we laid the basis for a soft coking coal trade. We also estabUshed the ous categories and quaUties of Australian coal. Each section of the industry knew precisely where it stood. Each section of the mdustry knew what its obUgations were. More than that, Japanese knew that a Labor administration and technology. a Labor Minister would provide and back up the necessary supervision to ensure that the contracts were entered into. Today what do wefind?We find what one might term a knee-jerk laissezber faire reaction on the part of this Government to anything that the Labor Administration introduced. It seeks to minimise for its own stuAustralia pid, petty, fooUsh reasons the achievements of Labor Administration instead of buUding on them and carrying them on. Our trade and our relations with Japan are too important to be transcended by the vagaries and the vicissitudes and the venom of Liberal-Country Party pohtics as displayed in this House. When I go to Japan and read the EngUsh language Press there I hang my head in shame an Australian to see the standard of Uteracy the Japanese, their economic competence, their mental. breadth of economic analysis, the sheer patriotism of those people, their efficiency, their to Uft themselves up literally by their economic bootstraps-becaus e in natural resources they have very little. I found there a very deep gooddays will, a very great reservoir of goodwill for Australia, and it dated back to the days before reasonable World War I. Many of the people who were in Australia then in connection with the Japaneseproper Australian wool trade had the happiest recoUecparity, tions of Australia. It is a fund of goodwUl that there to this day. There is a new Japan. The young people in Japan today know nothing, and even the middlelence-n aged people know practically nothing, of World War II. They have the same social problems, their new generations have much the same outAnthony's look, as the generations in Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States and elsewhere. strongest Those people have a real respect for Australia. They have a respect for this country because know that just as British integrity-th Overan Englishman-wa s the binding word of many a deal in Asia in the days before World War II, it is the word of an Australian today that counts. of There should be no low posture on our part, nor was there under a Labor government; there was tolerance and a basis of equality on both sides. of Between us, Australia and Japan, we are capable of UteraUy ruling and if necessary dominating the economies of the eastern Pacific Ocean and the whole of the Indian Ocean areas because we are the only two advanced countries in this region. variWhat Japan has in technology, in sheer competence, in engineering, in every branch of science we can back up with the necessary raw materials and in turn we can profit by the adopthe tion of a considerable amount of Japan's There are points on which I would disagree with the previous speaker, the honourable memfor Bradfield. One of them in particular is this: Just as the Japanese want to do business in Japan in Japanese ways so should we also in want to do business in Australian ways. a I have never accepted the principle that there ought to be a 10 per cent interest in any mimng undertaking. After all, whUst they are our trading partners, they are quite competent to look after themselves, and more, and an interest of even 10 per cent denotes a corresponding entitlement to representation on boards of directors. Frankly, I have no greater desire to have Japanese directors on our company boards than as they would have for counterpart Australian of representation on their boards. This is fundaabUity I have noted-and disagreed with-the tendency for certain trading elements in Japan these to put as a basic proposition that we should sell to them at predetermined cost plus a reasonable mark-up. We are not endded to just a mark-up, but we are entitled to a mark-up and we are entitled to the world and that is precisely what we have got is and that is precisely what we ought to continue to get. In terms of the approach of the present coaUtion Government to Japan, let me revert to the celebrated Premier of Queensland and his trucuo cattle sales, no meat sales, no coal. Crazy! AUright,there is a refinement at that apand proach, and it did not work in the case of Mr visit. I regret that he was not able to do better in that field, but I do object in the possible terms to the trading off of coal against beef. They are separate commodities. they They have a separate pricing structure. There e word of should be separate viewpoints. With regard to the future between the 2 countries, Austraha and Japan, the arrangement that I had with Mr Inayama and Nippon Steel was this: I quite dehberately, over the term of 3 years when I held the responsibility, assured them that their basic pohcy of not putting all their trading eggs in the one basket was fundamentally wrong. Austraha, for instance, provides approximately 45 per cent of Japan's coking coal requirements and a similar proportion of its iron ore requirements, but 25 per cent comes from the east coast of the United States. When I went to Japan last July I found that the Japanese were being screwed by the United States coal producers and let down in terms of contract fulfilment. In that Japanese fiscal year the United States was able to meet only 35 per cent of its total contractual obligations. It was also restricted in what it could produce and its production was being seriously limited in respect of open cut mining, by the objections of United States conservationists. The United States was selling at spot sale prices-there for e at the highest possible prices-to Europe. If you want to get down to the stark economic fundamentals of relationships between Austraha and Japan, consider the Pacific Ocean as virtually a closed lake. Within it we have a distinct competitive trading advantage. The haul for iron ore, for example, from Western Australia to Japan is very much shorter than the haul from Brazil. From time to time. I read articles by idiots- I use that word advisedly-withi n the Australian Press speaking in terms of the competitive advantage of friable Brazil. Brazilian iron ore happens to be friable. Apart from its competitive disadvantage in respect of freight it also in the sizing process blast furnace feed produces an excess of iron ore dust which in turn has to be aggregated at considerable cost by a sintering process. Honourable members can see the fundamental difference between the products of the 2 countries. I pointed these facts out clearly to the Japanese but at the same dme I said: 'We know the exact position; do not try to tell us anything different. At the same time we do not intend to screw you. We want a fair thing.' In respect of coal there are even greater advantages both in the haul and in our ability to meet contractual commitments, and above allthis is one thing that is of vital importance to Japan-ther e is a very low sulphur content in Australian coking coal. The market that Mr Anthony claimed he had estabhshed for steaming coal had already been estabhshed by a Labor Administration. It is a future market; not a present one. At the present time the Japanese have yet to decide finally on the 2 areas where they will locate their coal-fired steaming plants for the generation of electricity, and even when they do this they will be looking for a very different coal type from that which comes from the open cut areas. The Japanese also have a particular interest in the Walloon coal from the DarUng Downs area. If anyone takes the trouble to look at the map of mining leases that have been granted by a feckless government in Queensland they will find that there are representatives in that area, either by name or by subsidiary, of practically every one of the major oU companies which now call themselves major energy companies. At present the Japanese are seeking- I do not blame them for trying-to import that coal which happens to have about a IVi per cent hydrogen content. It is the nearest thing we have in Australia to a suitable coal type for the purposes of liquefaction by hydrogenation. The Japanese want it for an entirely different purpose. Their existing power generating plants were designed for the burning of fuel oU. It is very difficult to install a coal-fired fire box in a plant of that type but it is very easy to feed in a gas and the Japanese want to take that coal, gasify it and then feed the gas in as a fuel in substitution for the crude oU. I do not blame them for trying but my attitude is, and I put the challenge strongly to this Government, that if we are to have a future for coal hydrogenation in Australia and to supplement, in the final crunch, our liquid fuel reserves, that Walloon coal in the DarUng Downs-it runs in an area north-east from Toowoomba for a distance of as a about 300 miles, not in seams but in what are termed pods by the coal people-need s to be kept for that purpose. I warn the Government that it will betray Australia's best interests if it aUows any of that coal to be exported. I was not prepared to do so. After aU, Mr Anthony is a new boy at school and I do not mind giving him a few lessons without being patronising. Mr Anthony needs to learn also that it does not follow that hard coking coal will be the final blast furnace feed for the Japanese steel mUls because at present there are very advanced experiments in the development of formed coke which the Japanese will definitely turn to for that purpose. Hence their great interest in the coal loading amphfication that is now taking place in Newcastle harbour. After all, they will be able to get that coal for about US$12 per tonne less and I do not blame them for using it. These are the factors that have to be considered. If the present Government wants to go on and big-note itself or pretend that it is, it can do so. But there are hard reahties that need to be fully examined and that will not be done by merely playing pohtics and above all by the mere reversal of prejudices which seems to be the best of which this Government is capable. It must also be understood that the Japanese people work by consensus and there is no immediate acceptance of any proposition. It will be discussed fully and exhaustively at all levels but when a decision is made it is worth getting because they will adhere to it. As I see the future in a world that is breaking up, that is entering another trade war and is forming into different and rival economic blocs, we, together with Japan, have a tremendous advantage in the economic bloc of the Indian and east Pacific Oceans. Naturally I support the measure. When the debate commenced I expected that it would have been conducted in a different fashion but in view of the comment of the previous speaker I felt that he should be rephed to and cut down to size.",43
102,Mr CADMAN,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"I will be deUghted to return to the contents of this Bill because I think the contents alone are sumcient to occupy the full time of the House. Matters of trade have been of great importance in the relationship between Australia and Japan. At this stage if I could offer some advice to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) it would be that he go nowhere seeking lessons on how he should conduct himself. Having been in Japan at the same time as the Deputy Prime Minister I found that the response of Government officials, Ministers and businessmen to his common sense approach to the difficulties of trade between the 2 countries was ovemhelrning. The basis of past relationships has been related solely to trade and economics. I note that the 2 previous speakers spent the majority of their time on the areas of trade and economic relationships; and rightly so in the present day context. The areas where we have the greatest interest with Japan have been mentioned-ou r great primary products and our mining industry. We have a complementary nature that the 2 countries share by sheer circumstance. This complementary nature will work eventually, and has worked, to the benefit of both. However, the measure before us highlights the shortcomings of the relationships between Australia and Japan and rightly should this be termed the AustraliaJapan Foundation. The key points of the Bill touch the shortcomings that have occurred over the number of years in which we have traded together. The problems of culture and language and the difference in history have not been properly assessed or considered by our 2 nations. There have been some attempts but in no way has there been a concerted effort to look at the difficulties arising from the differences of background, reUgious understanding, reUgious belief, cultural practice and, of course, the overriding and extreme difficulty of language and the written word. The practice within the Department of Foreign Affairs has previously been that career diplomats, having learned Japanese and having spent some time in that country, will often move elsewhere in the world and that is their last contact with that country in their career. To me that is a tragic waste of expertise. I understand that this is now being remedied and that career diplomats will be posted to Japan perhaps for a period of 6 years, moved away and later transferred into an area where they may have an association with Japan and the Japanese people. The stalls and understanding acquired by a stint of service within Japan are hard-acquired attributes that should not be wasted as they have been wasted previously. We need to understand the Japanese legal system and what is meant by a contract in Japanese terms. We have heard much talk of contracts, of honouring our word and the written law, but the Japanese concept of a contract and its legal terms is not of our understanding, and the application of legal minds to a correct and true relationship of contracts is of vital importance to our trade. Too often Australian busmessmen have found, when signing a contract, that their concept of what is entaUed in that contract is binding on them. Under our legal system, this is so. To a Japanese businessman that may not be so. The Japanese businessman tends to look on a contract as a guideline. It is binding. He trusts the person with whom he deals. It is a binding provision but one in which there is room to move. I mention to the House the difficulties at present faced by the sugar industry where variations in contracts are being sought. If they are varied, in our terms they are broken. Perhaps, by goodwill and understanding, contracts can be varied in such a way that at a later date we recoup any advantage that may be given away at this stage. Negotiation cannot be on a hard and fast basis; it must be, I think, on a basis of understanding the complementary and different legal systems. Trade requirements and specifications, how ordering takes place, the demands of particular industries, the understanding of consumer demand, the understanding of the requirements of a housewife or famUy in relation to goods from Austraha, are of key importance and the Foundation seeks to estabhsh contacts in those areasforeign affairs, language, culture, history, contracts in the legal system, trade requirements and understanding between business. I am sure that the presence in Austraha of Mr Okawara, the new Japanese Ambassador to Austraha, will lend greatly to understanding between the two nations. He is, I understand, an outstanding diplomat. He was formerly posted to Washington. He is considered by Japanese diplomats as one of their most outstanding men. The purposes of the Foundation were refened to in the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) when he introduced the Bill. He said that the Foundation seeks to develop a structure which would foster a broader and more comprehensive understanding between Japan and Australia. He said: This Foundation is the vehicle ations. Proper understanding between Australia and Japan is of enormous importance to peace and security in the AsianPacific region. In the past the Government parties to bring about a close and constructive understanding with Japan. The Australia-Japan Foundation will be a further nificant means of confirming that objective. In that speech the Prime Minister linked the Foundation and the setting up of the Foundation with the work done by Sir John Crawford and the Crawford committee which was appointed by the previous Prime Minister to examine this matter. The Crawford committee drew out very salient and relevant points in what it felt should be the scope and sphere of operation of the. Foundation. In part it drew attention to the extent and depth of economic relations between Australia and Japan, and to the difficulties that were posed in moving understanding to other areas. The committeefeltthat there was need to move to other areas and not to confine our interests necessarily to self-interest on either side. The committee suggested that there be appointed in Australia a councU of 15 members serving in a personal capacity, drawn from the key elements in Australia, to give a wide basis to the coundl. The committee also suggested that the councU be representative of the community. The committee felt that it was possible perhaps to give the councU that would operate the Foundation as much stature as possible in Japanese as well as Australian eyes. The committee felt also that financial suppon of the Foundation should be encouraged from non-government sources. The committee further felt that it would be most desirable to define at an early stage that there be no conflict or difficulty because of other treaties. The area of interest of this Foundation relates to cultural agreements or trade agreements. The committee felt that there should not be conflict or crossing of purposes. The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr ConnoUy) refened to the vast number of foundations, committees or councUs of this type relating to Australia and Japan. I think the core of this matter is that none of them should be dupUcated but that this Foundation should seek to go more widely and more deeply than anything that has previously been undertaken. The proposal that it be something Uke the ChurchUl Fellowship is something that I commend. Honourable members will obviously be aware of the fine reputation of the ChurchUl Fellowship. People from all walks of Ufe benefit from the ChurchUl FeUowships. Recipients of a Fellowship of necessity make reports on their return and bring back information which is provided to the community at large and not retained for a personal interest to bring about those aspiror for personal satisfaction. I think the committee suggested that the Foundation act as an advisory body to the Government on matters of cultural have acted importance. It could aUow, I would suggest, a way of exchange between government emsig- ployees, such as parUamentary staff. It could also aUow for an exchange between sports coaches, trade union officials, farmers and journalists. There is hardly any area of human activity in which this Foundation could not be active in seeking understanding and goodwUl. I refer to areas such as the arts, education, science, economics, law or poUtics. Some of these areas I have already mentioned. There could be every kind of social and intellectual interchange conducted on the basis of promoting mutual respect and the mutual exchange of knowledge and ideas between Australia and Japan. To some extent, that is a summary of what was proposed by the Crawford committee. The Bill, as we see it, completely incorporates those provisions and the advice given to the Government by the Crawford committee. The suggestions made by the committee have been incorporated, without exception, in the BUL I refer the House to clause 5(2), which states: If the Minister so requests, the Foundation shall furnish him with advice concerning any specified matter falling within the scope of the functions of the Foundation. Clause 5(1) gives as one of the functions of the Foundation: (a) to promote the study by the people of each of those countries of the language, culture and traditions . . . Line after Une we find incorporated in the Bill the exact proposals of the Crawford committee. Reading the Crawford committee's recommendations, it is not possible to let one's mind to dwell on the vast scope and range of expertise which was apphed by that committee to the establishment of the Foundation without in some way being referred back to the concepts and the deep understanding for an initiative-somethin g that is relative and important but something that is practical-that were brought forward by the present Australian Ambassador to Japan, Mr Shann. In early days these measures to establish a foundation were termed by some people as grandiloquent gestures. People in high positions in the Department used those terms. Nevertheless, Mr Shann's proposition has been incorporated in the legislation from which Australians and Japanese will draw great benefit. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) has spoken in this debate. He has whirlwind. shown great interest in the matter. I think his understanding, with that of Mr Shann, was probposition ably the key link, but it needed somebody to the midwife. I am afraid it would have been a countries. prolonged pregnancy if there had not been that understanding. It seems that for reasons of red tape and because of difficulties in relation interdepartmental considerations this matter delayed for some time. The delay indicates no lack of interest on the part of the then Governin ment but a lack of capacity in administration which was evident in manyfieldsother than this. I fear that in his interest and personal attribute attempting to understand and delve into the minds, the culture, the history and the backtween ground of the Japanese the former Prime Ministhat ter was over-weighed and misled by the activities of other Ministers. We heard one of those Minisdeeper ters speaking just a short while ago. It would seem to me, after having discussions with the Japanese, that the important thing to do when domg business is to understand what a contract about, to understand something of the culture and the nature of the Japanese people. That seems to me to be vital. But once having made a great. decision one should abide by that decision so that one achieves the respect of those people whom one seeks to negotiate. I have said something of the current difficulties of the sugar industry. The salt industry undergone similar problems. Only byfirmaction can these problems be resolved. There is no need for an academic approach, as expressed by the former Prime Minister. Neither is there a need for elephantine activity, as was demonstrated the previous Minister for Minerals and Energy. There is a need to be firm and a need to underThe stand. Fortunately the activities in Japan, of the previous Minister, whilst damaging to some expresses extent, are not irreparable. I think we have now moved to the stage where there is true and proper understanding, where departments and people with expertise within our embassies and on our consular staff can exchange ideas knowing that they will flow to the Minister, that the Minister will perceive the value of those comments and act upon them. There is no way that a nationalism, expressed by way of resources diplomacy, is of any great value to any nation in the world. We have seen the Arab nations express to some extent diplomacy of resources. The fearful circumstances of that soon became obvious to the world. I put it to the House that part of the reason for the previous catastrophe between ourselves and the Japanese people was a denial of resources. I think that if one starts to get into the area of resources diplomacy one will reap the I think that whilst the former Minister did not reap the whirlwind, he was not in that sufficiently long for the whirlwind to be build up. It was a fortunate thing for both The support of private enterprise for the proto posal to estabhsh the Foundation is something was that I would like to stress. I hope that those businesses and enterprises which have an interest Japan will strongly support the Foundation by benefit of gift or contribution so that they, their employees or future generations can benefit. of Since the foundation of our understanding started with the economy and with trade beour nations, it seems an obUgation almost private enterprise and business should be involved in the Foundation. It is a wider thing, a thing, but the benefits will also be wide and deep. I cannot stress too strongly my feeling that business of Australia has in some way a debt to play a part in achieving future understanding is and the future security of the relationship between our 2 nations. If business can permit itself to be involved I think the benefits will indeed be with The establishment of the Foundation is probably the forerunner to further acts which will consoUdate our relationship with Japan. The former Minister touched on the Treaty of Friendhas ship and Co-operation, the so caUed former Treaty of Nara. I trust that that Treaty will be developed and signed shortly. It too was delayed by lack of will to press it forward. No one denies that it is a difficult measure, but the lack of will by was the reason for its delay. It is an umbrella treaty and there are many areas of complication. inference for Australia and Japan is far reaching. There is significance in the fact that it an intention. But an intention in these circumstances must be expressed in fact at a later stage, such as the upgrading of the trade agreement between the 2 countries which was last written in 1957. As I have said, this measure has been described as a 'granduoquent gesture', but I think the travailling conflict of the past has solved through necessity and that the future for our 2 countries holds a prospect for mutual benefit and understanding. It is by measures such as this and the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation that depth is given to such a relationship.",46
103,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"It is inevitable when we have a debate about Austraha and Japan that there should be discussion about purely economic matters. They seem to occupy the minds of most people. The Austraha-Japan Foundation Bill which is before the House- I am very pleased to see that the new Government acted so quickly on the Bill that was drafted by the previous Labor Government and brought the matter forward for discussionraises other questions of the relationship between 2 peoples, particular cultural relationships. The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) in moving into that area mentioned the difference in understanding between our 2 peoples of such a simple thing as a contract. To us it is a simple thing. Then the honourable member set about saying- I do not think I have taken his words down correctly, but he seemed to suggest this-that the previous Minister for Minerals and Energy, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Connor), was not very well accepted in Japan, was a bit bumble-footed and a bit elephantine. I think they were the words he used, giving the impression that the honourable gentleman did not understand the Japanese psychology in trade. It was my understanding when I was in Japan and when I spoke to people in Japan-peopl e who have Uved there for many years, people who are occidentals and who claim to understand the oriental mind-that the honourable gentleman was held in very high regard in his negotiations with the people of Japan. It is my firm beUef, having watched them in action, that the Japanese business people are very astute business people in that sense. I think that the so-called captains of industry in cash Australia appear to be something Uke a kinderwere garten class when they come up against the Japanese businessmen. They are manoeuvred at every turn of the wheel and they do not have capacity to deal with the Japanese people on equal level. The Japanese, to use a coUoquiaUsm, in fact play them on a break in every deal that made. But there was a slightly different attitude towards the honourable member for Cunningham, because in the first instance he went to Japan not to make any sharp deals or anything Uke that but to look after the interests of our AusdistraUan heritage, our natural resources. He had seen enough of previous governments trading away the natural resources of Australia at bargain basement prices and was determined to redress that situation. Indeed, in the 3 years that he was Minister he in fact did that. I think the House will recall the occasion when the smart miners in this country, in writing their contracts for the export of minerals, made an error of judgment and wrote theh contracts in American dollars. When the Australian dollar was revalued they did not know how to get out of the situation. It was the honourable member for Cunningham who approached the buyers of our minerals and sought renegotiation of the contracts. So the smart captains of industry in Australia got themselves hoist on their own petard. It was only the elephantine efforts, if one likes to use that phrase, of the Minister for Minerals and Energy at thattimewhich saved those people fromfinancialdisaster. The honesty of the Japanese people is incredible and something really to see. I well remember an occasion in a very crowded store in Kyoto when I was buyingfilmswhich at thattimewere priced at 1,000 yen each, which is roughly SA2.50. In my haste I gave the girl a 1,000 yen note and a 10,000 yen note, beUeving that I had given her two 1,000 yen notes, and I walked away. In fact she had received one note worth $A2.50 and another worth $A25.1 had paid, or was prepared to pay, $A27.50 for 2filmswhich apparently were worth $A5. But she chased after me out of the store and into the street and insisted that I accept the change from the 10,000 note which I had given to her. I do not want to cast aspersions on any shop assistant in any country but I would be surprised if a shop assistant in another country in simUar circumstances pursued somebody half way round the town to ensure that change was given to him when that person was quite happy with the transaction that had been carried out. This is indicative of the honesty I found amongst the Japanese peoplefrom this Uttle girl working in a store, operating a register, aU the way up the line to those who arranging deals of international magnitude. This is something which is not generally the understood by the Australian people. Ifindwhen an speaking to people in my own country that there are many misconceptions about the Japanese is people. There seems to be an aura of mystery about the Japanese language. Of course it is a difficult language but to Austrahan people any other language is difficult, including Queenslandese. The difficulty with Japanese is magnified by the fact that it is not written in Roman characters. I suppose that that is a difficulty but it is not an insurmountable one provided people are prepared to sit down and look at it. There is a great deal of misunderstanding and misconception by the Austrahan people about the people of Japan. This is reciprocated by the Japanese people, who have a very limited knowledge of our country. We are at opposite ends of a trading route, at opposite ends of the eastern Pacific area, yet there is very httle intercourse between the 2 countries except at the trade and commercial level. There is no wholesale movement of Austrahan tourists to Japan or vice versa. I understand from the Bill that the Foundation is to be charged with the responsibility of making sure that closer relationships are developed. I have 2 minds about the need for a Foundation. I recognise and fully understand the need for it but it strikes me as very strange that a government, the Austrahan Government-and the Government should be congratulated on its initiative even though it is taking up a measure introduced by the previous Government-shoul d set up a Foundation to encourage trade, intercourse and cultural relations between 2 peoples. Austrahan people are quite noted for their capacity to travel to other places, and for the way that they do travel, but seldom do they travel north along the route to Japan. Australians generally drop off at what they consider more exotic places such as Singapore and Hong Kong. I do not know that we can coerce people into engaging in cultural exchanges. I do not think that is the intention of the Bill, anyhow. I think the intention of the Bill is to provide a centre or a font from which information can be disseminated about the people of Japan and about their cultures. I am afraid there still are a lot of Australian people who caricature the Japanese culture as being that of the geisha house, mixed bathing, sukiyaki and the Datsun motor car. I am pretty sure that the Japanese caricature Australian culture as being based on the meat pie, tomato sauce and Australian Rules football. We all know that that is not the culture of Austraha and our own intelligence should tell us that the Japanese culture is much deeper than those superficial things. There is a Umited amount of information available in Australia about the real Japan and perhaps the Foundation will overcome this situation. Perhaps the Foundation will set up resource centres where information can be disseminated to the community. I found the Japanese people to be remarkable, considering the work they have done in their islands and the fact that Japan has no real natural resources. Japan had no raw materials with which to buUd its freeways, bridges, underground raUways and to do many other things that have been done in that country. The raw materials were imported and processed and then these tilings were manufactured or erected. The Australian transport authorities could well learn from Japan's underground raU system. It runs a train every 2 minutes in Tokyo and the system covers every part of the city. After 5 minutes study of a chart the system can be used by any dumb foreigner such as 1.1 managed not to get lost on the Japanese raU system. I travelled all over the city on it. It was quite a magnificant arrangement. Everything was colour coded so that I did not have to understand the language. All the stations are spaced out and all I had to do in order to find out where I got out of the train was to count the stations. There was not even confusion about how much I should pay for a ticket. Tickets are issued automatically from machines. I just pumped corns into a machine and it pumped the tickets out for me. The railway that runs some 300 miles from Tokyo to Kyoto is fully computerised, and trains run every 20 minutes. I cannot get that sort of service from the Victorian raUways at Broadmeadows and that is only 9 miles from Melbourne. Mr Fisher-If we had their machines we would be right. We do not have them. They are going to put in ticket machines.",49
104,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"Ticket machines would be a big help but the service is more important. That sort of information should be disseminated generaUy among the Australian people. Australians should be encouraged to visit Japan and Japanese should be encouraged to visit Australia, just as they move westward across the ocean to HawaU and the United States of America in large numbers. That in itself would bring about a greater understanding. I am very much afraid that prejudices still exist in Australia- I am not so sure that they exist to such an extent in Japan-followin g events that occurred over 30 years ago. Those events are still remembered and, unfortunately, still spoken of. It is better that they be forgotten now than that they should continue to be a barrier between 2 people living in a region, one of them occidental in origin and the other oriental. We have to continue to live in this region and to trade with one another. There will never be successful trade treaties unless there is understanding by one of the psychology of the other. So long as there is some form of distrust between the 2 peoples there will continue to be conflict. I am not so sure that the resources of this try can be left in the hands of individuals. I do not agree at all with that proposition. I think the development of the natural resources of this country is a matter for the Government of this country. I speak not of the separate State governments but of the Australian Government, the national Government. Negotiations that take place to dispose of or seU those resources should be conducted at government to government level, not at individual to individual level. That appUes to the minerals of this country, such as coal, and our primary products. It is not my intention to take up the full time avaUable to me. I welcome this Bill. I have some regrets that it was not brought in much earUer. That is always the case with somebody who beUeves in something and finally sees it come about However, the Bill is here now and it is assured of a speedy passage through this House and the other place as there is no opposition to it. The measure was proposed by the previous Government and therefore the Labor Party has no objection to it. This Government has introduced it and it has no trouble in getting BUls passed through this House or the other place. It is quite clear that the Bill will not be delayed. I believe that the sooner the Foundation is set up, the sooner it wiU function and the sooner will the benefits become apparent to both the Australian and the Japanese peoples. I commend the Bill.",50
105,Mr LLOYD,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"I wish to be associated with the Australia-Japan Foundation Bill because I believe the Foundation will be important in mamtaining and developing good relations between our 2 countries. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) referred in his second reading speech when introducing the Bill to the 1957 trade agreement between Australia and Japan. He referred to that agreement as being a bold and historic step, a statement with which I would agree. One of the major movers for that trade agreement was my predecessor in the seat of Murray, Sir John MCEwen. I believe that the Australia-Japan trade agreement at that time was one of the great achievements of that great Australian, Sir John MCEwen, an achievement of national and international significance. I would place with that achievement 2 other things that he achieved for this nation and for the world. One was the international commodity agreement for quite a range of goods, to bring some stabUity, for at least a period oftime,in some markets and to include better food aid provisions in foreign aid arrangements. I believe that in these international commodity agreements, which included food aid convencountions, he for thefirsttimeencouraged wealthy nations that may be food importers rather than food exporters to share some of the burden of foreign food aid. I believe as a result of that, at that time at least and for some years afterwards, there was a better basis and arrangement for food aid for underdeveloped countries than exists at present. The report of the committee on the proposed Australia-Japan Foundation, which is referred to as the Crawford report after its Chairman, came out in February 1975. As a matter of coincidence, in one of today's newspapers it is reported: Australia-Japan repon timed to the minute. Sir John Crawford, Chancellor of the Australian National University, and Dr Saburo Okita, chairman of the Japan Economic Research Centre, are to present to their governments the same historic report on the 2 countries' relations at the same time. The weighty document took 3 years to produce and involved ISO economists. The article contains more information and states that the report will be released on 28 April. I think as a matter of coincidence that this points to the role that Sir John Crawford has played in establishing a greater understanding between our 2 countries. The purposes of the Foundation are clearly stated in the Bill. Basically they are to promote study of each country's language, culture, traditions, geography, etc and to encourage visits between the 2 countries by various groups of people. The general points of the legislation have been canvassed and I would agree with those general points. I want just briefly to refer to some specific points concerning the importance of a rural input to the Foundation. I believe that it is most important for the future of our 2 countries that the rural sectors bf both countries get to know each other better. As the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr ConnoUy) mentioned in his speech, the basis of Australia-Japan relations at present is economic. He went on to state that Japan is our major market and we are Japan's third major market. Rural exports from Australia are very significant in the commodities traded between the 2 countries. When one looks at some of the activities in Japan in considering whether certain trade will be aUowed one reaUses that rural politics is of considerable importance. One can say that both in the Liberal Democratic Party Government of Japan and in this Government there is a weighty rural voice which will, to tain extent, modify and change the pohcies and the attitudes of the Governments to each other. Because of this I beheve it is most important that the rural industry organisations, rural pohticians and rural people generally in each of these countries get to understand each other's problems and attitudes better. It is the hope of rural Austrahans that Japan will, if it has not already-it certainly has not to the extent that we would have hoped-replac e Britain as the major market for so many of our products. In the last week a group of 23 Japanese farmers was in Austraha. I think that is the sort of thing that is important from a rural point of view. I believe the leaders of our State and nadonal farmers' organisations and commodity organisations should be spending more time in Japan. Perhaps of more importance than this is that their Japanese counterparts should be spending more time in Australia because of the complications-sometime s unnecessary complicationsthat can arise in our attitudes to each other because of this lack of understanding. I should like to give one example of this. As honourable member for Bradfield mentioned, the Japanese shut the door on our beef exports that country in January 1974. There was a build-up of stocks of beef in Japan. The rural lobby is also very important in the Japanese polliament itical situation. There are quite a large number of Japanese beef farmers even i cattle they have is not large. As a result of this Japan has introduced the LIPC- I think it is called the Livestock Improvement Promotion add Corporation-whic h has I believe the general effect of forcing an artifically low price for beef Australia for producers as opposed to an artifically high price for that same beef when sold to the consumer in Japan. It also breaks the even flow of the beef. The difference is pocketed in Japan. The Corporation also restricts the flow or the possibihty of sale of chilled beef to Japan. This was a most important aspect of the beef trade we were developing. I think credit is due to the Deputy Prime MinJapanese ister (Mr Anthony) because on this trip to Japan, as well as getting some greater flexibility in tas, he was able to obtain some concessions on chilled beef. Surely there is an alternative safeguarding the interests and the rights of the Japanese beef producer. I recognise that he has theserights.But surely they do not have to be the expense of the Austrahan beef producer who is not able to obtain a fair market price for product which is later sold at an artifically high price. This raises the question of the use of a cer- British deficiency payments system at the Japanese end to assist Japan without hurting us. That is just one example. One could go on dealing with quite a range of other products just in the rural sector apart from the mineral sector and all the other sectors of our trade between the 2 countries. No doubt Japan has the same points to put to us in these matters. In relation to the question of a rural voice or rural recognition, I suggest that, as the Foundation will consist of not less than five or more than 15 members, it would be most appropriate that least one of those members be an eminent rural person. I note that the members are to be appointed on a personal basis rather than on a representative basis. I think that is a good idea, but I am sure the rural community has some eminent people who in their own personal right would be eligible for appointment. The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), who spoke earlier in the debate, has the added advantage of just recently having been to Japan. His speech showed the advantages to be gained from thisfirsthand contact. I the believe that is another example of the benefit of greater contact between our 2 countries. I hope to that opportunities are provided for members of other parties of this House also to be able to study Japan and for Japanese members of Parto be able to come to Australia more frequently than has happened in the past. I support f the number of the legislation.",51
106,Mr YATES,PARLIAMENT HOUSE," I should like to a few words about this Bill. I want to concentrate mainly on the cultural aspects of the Bill in and to consider it with rather more care. It is remarkable to note that Japanese is not one of it is the major languages in any of our major State schools-no r is Indonesian for that matter, either. I cannot see how we can propose to take part in the events of the changing social patterns in the world unless we can understand and converse in the language of our neighbours. For 4 years Brighton Grammar School has piloted a scheme of international exchange directly with a school. I think some of the lessons that have been learned by the host families on one quoside in Japan and by me as a member of a host family in Australia are of importance and are of way of great interest to us. Perhaps the most important thing to realise is at that we must all have patience and understanding in deahng with international exchange prohis grams. In passing I must pay tribute to one school in Victoria, Waverley High School, which the also has piloted an international exchange scheme for students of forms four, five and six. These international exchanges must form the pattern for and form part of what some of the money will be devoted to under this Bill. What are the points that are of value in an international exchange of 2 boys or 2 girls, one in Japan and one in Austraha? First and foremost is the complete understanding of the social customs of the 2 nations. In understanding the social toms of the 2 nations one brings together the understanding of how families hve in the 2 countries. In supporting this Bill I do not want to delay the House in its deliberations or to go much further than to add a plea that this Foundation, from its very early stages, should do all it can assist those in this country who are anxious improve the direct cultural relations between younger generation because it is their future we are in fact building. In short then, I support this Bill because we must be sensitive and alert and make creative decisions here in Australia which will make a significant contribution to life in the Far East in times of rapid social change. strategy too, we are partners with Japan. In strattogether. egy too, we reahse that we are also to be friends with China and all our neighbours. As I said in my maiden speech, the nation must be a good neighbour nation in the years ahead. I commend and support the principles and ideals of this Foundation. I hope that it will bring lasting positive enjoyment and endurance to the generally-tha younger people of the nation and will build strong, firm, friendly and understanding relato tions between the people of Japan and the people of Austraha, I commend the Bill.",52
107,Mr KATTER,PARLIAMENT HOUSE," I most cerwith tainly will occupy only a few minutes of the House's time. I do feel that I should like to sociate myself with what I think is a splendid forward in Austrahan-Japanese relations. That the establishment and, I hope, the continuance the Austraha-Japan Foundation. During the last 10 years there has been a growing recognition both Canberra and Tokyo of the wide comwhich mumty of interests shared by the 2 countries. These shared interests are most evident in the economic field. We have these shared interests with Japan despite the antagonism which grew up during the last 3 years. I say any feehng of meanness towards the demised government, the previous Government, but based on facts. A government cannot, on the hand, berate the capitalist countries of the world and almost point a finger across the waters to Japan and the United States, and then on other hand put out a miserable, hypocritical hand of friendship. It just does not work out that way. As though that were not enough, from time to time we see in the minds and the hearts of many a person who sits on the Opposition side, their uncontrollable racist attitudes. No one knows more of them than I do. I have kept a little dossier. One of those most responsible for racial outcus- bursts was the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Connor). There was a great spokesman for Australia. On the one hand he will give vent to his racist emotions and on the other he will go across to Japan and expect these people of Asiatic origin to greet him with open arms. The situation just did not turn out that way. to However it is a fact that whatever be the circumto stances, the relations between Australia and the Japan more particularly at this stage are based that on our trade relations. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who is an enthusiast in this regard and the Government with him are intent now on taking our relations beyond that. It is fairly obvious from this Bill that there is going to In be an effort to bring our peoples much closer Most members in this House, I suppose, have visited Honolulu or the United States in one way or another. It will only be one way from now on I guess-the other has gone. However, these members would have observed-this is more particuand larly noticeable in Singapore and Hawaii t there are literally thousands of up Japanese tourists. Admittedly we are beginning get a trickle of Japanese tourists into this country. The people who come into the country-the people who embark on a tourist safari of this nature-ar e usually people who are concerned talking about their trips, not only with coming over for the ordinary pleasures which I supaspose are in evidence here and in some respects to step an even greater extent in Japan. I think that is when we plan our tourism it should be done with of the idea in mind that people will take back not just the reaction of an ordinary tourist but an by appreciation of what this country has to offer goes beyond the ordinary tourism. I hope that the Foundation will stimulate a much greater flow of tourists from Japan to Australia. I think we have a fairly heavyflowof tourists from Australia to Japan. No doubt that flow would be that not out of accelerated too. The main point I should Uke to make in the one one or two minutes that I propose to speak on this Bill is the importance of bringing together the peoples of Australia and Japan generally, but the more particularly the peoples in northern Australia and Japan. My mind immediately goes to the huge and almost hmitless possibihty of producing solar energy in this country. We have vast areas and recent experimentation on solar energy has brought it almost to a stage of perfection. It has almost reached a stage now where it could become a commercial enterprise. Two scientists, a husband and wife team in southern Arizona whose names just escape me for the moment, have recently produced what was the unattainable. That was a means of storing solar energy in a small, compact area, in a sort of battery form. Those who know what they are talking about claim that Austraha is probably the one country in the world which could produce huge quantities of hydrogen from solar energy and so on. If one goes a little further and gets a Uttle more practical in this matter, it is quite possible that within the next 10, 15, or 20 years, we may see our motor vehicles running on hydrogen. This is a simple proposition. The only complexity about it is that a tank about twice the size of an ordinary petrol tank is required. What has this got to do with the Foundation? It has a lot to do with it and it has a lot to do northern Australia because geographically the people there are a Uttle closer to Japan than the people of the southern part of Australia. Hence I think it is a little hard to explain the great wastage that occurs in taking some of our materials from the southern part of the nation right around the coastline and up to Japan when the very same products could be taken out of the soUthey are being produced in great quantities in northern Australia-and shipped to Japan at a much lesser cost. This has been a great point in northern Australia. The TownsvUle Harbour Board and all of those people up there who are anxious to stimulate direct trade with Japan just get a Uttle appalled and browned off when they are excluded from such an arrangement. I ask the House to take heed of this possibUity and when the Foundation does come into operation and our people are brought together with ties not only of trade, but of culture, of industrial attitudes and so on, to keep well in mind that northern Australia is a little closer to Japan than the nation generally. I would go along with the other speakers and express my support for the Bill. I hope that not only will it come into action but that it will stimulate and bring our people together in a very effective and, most importantly, in a genuine way. There should be not just a sudden change of attitude towards these Asiatic people because we can cash in on them but a genuine attitude of friendship. Unless there is a genuine attitude, the Foundation will not survive and will not be stimulated to become the powerful force it should most certainly be. Quesuon resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Ellicott) read a third time. LOANS (QANTAS AIRWAYS LIMITED) BILL 1976 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 February on motion by Mr Lynch: That the Bill be now read a second time.",53
108,Mr ELLICOTT,PARLIAMENT HOUSE," Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Loans with (Australian National AirUnes Commission) Bill 1976 as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the BUls at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore that you permit the subject matter of both BUls to be discussed in this debate.",54
109,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARLIAMENT HOUSE," Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these 2 measures? There being no objection, I wiU aUow that course to be foUowed.",54
110,Mr HURFORD,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"The Opposition is not opposing the passage of these BUls which are standard machinery measures. The 2 BUls, the Loans (Qantas Airways Limited) Bill 1976 and the Loans (Ausuahan National AirUnes Commission) Bill 1976, are to enable overseas borrowings to be made on behalf of Qantas Airways Limited and Trans-Australia Airlines. The borrowings are for the purchase of new aircraft. In the case of Qantas, the money will be used for the purchase of an additional Boeing 747 aircraft with associated spare parts. The total cost which will be incurred by Qantas in this package is $33.9m. The Export-Import Bank of the United States of America-Eximbank , as it is called-ha s already agreed by means of a preUminary commitment to provide a credit facility of $12.85m which is roughly 40 per cent of the cost of the aircraft. I presume that this 40 per cent of the aircraft cost is without spares because my mathematics tells me that 40 per cent of the total cost of $33.9m is not $12.85m. I hope that those who write the second reading speeches of the tab Treasurer (Mr Lynch) on these loan Bills in the future will make these details clear. The loan carries an interest rate of 9 per cent over a period of 10 years. Because of the special financial needs of the aircraft industry, the loan repayable over the last 5 of the 10 years of its hfe. The loan will be in the name of the Austrahan Government and, as on past occasions, it will on-lent to the airhne on the same terms and conCouncU ditions as the funds are borrowed by the Ausbe trahan Government. The airline will meet all costs and charges associated with the loan, so there will be no net charge on the Government, thus the taxpayers of this nation will not be ring any costs. The costs will be incurred of course, by those who use the airlines, as it should be. This loan is part of an on-going program by Qantas to expand its Boeing 747 fleet and the aircraft to be purchased by this loan will bring the number of 747 aircraft in the Qantasfleetto twelve. If the Parhament approves this Bill Qantas will have government backing for a borrowing $25.7m of the total $33.9m required by the airfinancial line for this package, that is, for the aircraft plus associated parts. Qantas will find from its own resources $8.2m. I have stated already that Eximbank has a preUminary commitment to reading lend $12.85m of the $25.7m total borrowing to under this Bill. The balance of the funds required, namely, another $ 12.85m, will come from leading overseas banks and underwriters. My research tells me that it will be a surprise this loan for the balance is not negotiated with Eximbank. IncidentaUy, if the Ufe of the loan less than 10 years the interest rate is reduced under the Eximbank terms from 9 per cent to 8.75 per cent. Nevertheless it should be said against that there is no firm commitment to Eximbank and the total loans could be negoMinister tiated elsewhere. No doubt if lower interest are the result of the upturn in the United States economy which is takuig place at present, lower interest rates could be achieved in relation loan which it is more likely than not wiU be negotiated in the United States. The other Bill provides for the Australian Ltd Government to borrow on behalf of TAA an amount up to $7.4m for the purchase of an ditional Boeing 727 jet aircraft plus spare parts. That will bring the number of aircraft in the TAA 727 fleet to seven. This amount represents 80 per cent of the total cost of the purchase of aircraft plus spares, the total cost being $9.3m. As with Qantas, the loan will be on-lent to TAA and the Government will not be left holding any for this loan or its charges. In fact, the funding arrangements are the same as those for the Qantas loan. In other words Eximbank has already agreed in a preliminary deal to lend half of the amount pro tern on the same terms as the is Qantas loan but the total package will be let out for tender, if it has not already gone out for tender, after this Bill becomes an Act. The Qantas be loan has already been approved by the Loan and only the precise details have yet to approved. However, the TAA loan has yet to come before the Loan Council but it is anticipated that it will be put before the Council at its meeting in June this year. The TAA aircraft is incurdue to be delivered in November 1976 whereas the Qantas 747 is due to be delivered earlier, and that is namely, next July. These BUls give opportunity for those in the Parliamentary Labor Party who specialise in transport matters to enter the debate. I am glad to say that the honourable member for Shonland (Mr Morris), the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) and perhaps some other of my coUeagues intend to enter this deof bate. Before I as shadow Treasurer leave the aspects of the BUls, I would Uke to ask the Treasurer to state explicitly when he is replying to the debate, why these BUls are necessary. This was not done in the Treasurer's second speech. Of course, it is not good enough say that this has always been the way in which Qantas and TAA have financed their aircraft purchases from overseas, although I realise that even Labor Governments have put through Bills if such as these. I have no doubt that the answer to my question is that the airlines achieve better is terms for their bonowings when these loans pass through government hands. This should be said, provided it is conect, and perhaps the Minister that will say so when replying. Because of his presence in the House now, I am presuming that the for Transport will be replying to this derates bate notwithstanding that the Treasurer introduced these BUls. As shadow Treasurer I am leading for the Opposition on these matters and to this am putting onlyfinancialquestions. In a simUar way Ansett Transport Industries is helped with its loans when it wants to purchase aircraft abroad. I ask the Minister for adTransport-perhap s he knows the answer-wh y Ansett is not in the market on this occasion. We have not a Bill relating to Ansett before the House at the present time. Normally whatever this TAA does Ansett does, or vice versa. They are like Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Has Ansett decided to make to do an older aircraft whereas TAA has decided to trade in its equivalent older aircraft on this new one? I hope the Minister gives us the reasons in this debate. This raises the whole question of which undertakings in our country should have their overseas borrowings guaranteed and which should not. Has the Government ever guaranteed the overseas borrowings of, say, the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, in order to achieve a lower rate of interest and thus, presumably, a lower price for steel? If not, why not? Do we have the situation of these borrowings being guaranteed in the case of the Austrahan airhne industry because we have the phenomenon of two of the three large corporations in that industry being pubhc enterprises? Qantas and TAA, of course, are the public enterprises. Is this another example of the worth of public enterprise, namely, a lower rate of interest on overseas borrowings? I look forward to hearing the Minister philosophising on the subject when he repUes to this debate. To encourage him to philosophise on this subject. I am going to embark on a little of my own phUosophising. Qantas and TAA are two magnificent examples of public enterprise which are a credit to our nation. I congratulate aU who work in those enterprises. They have their bad times and they have their good times. However, I make the claim that they are both managed as well as any concerns in our country and those who work for those two public enterprise corporations are as dedicated to the job in hand as the employees of any other corporations. We hear a lot of nonsense talked about the inefficient pubUc sector and the efficient private sector. I say it nonsense because some public concerns are efficient and some inefficient. SimUarly, in the private sector efficiency and inefficiency are more related to whether a concern is too big and impersonal than to whether it is a public concern or a private concern. We are suffering at the present time government by a Liberal-National Country Party coaUtion which sees all virtue in the private sector and has set about, in my view, to damage the public sector. This is a false doctrine. The people are already beginning to suffer from this false doctrine. My colleagues and I are committed to the mixed economy. We see some things best done in the pubUc sector; we see other things best done in the private sector. We see stUl other things best done in industries whose structures provide competition between the private and the pubUc sectors. Banking is an example of a mixed industry with competition between the Commonwealth Bank and some State banks on the one hand and the private banks on the other hand. The insurance industry is already a mixed industry with State government insurance offices providing competition with private insurance companies. It is difficult to credit this when one contemplates the ballyhoo which took place last year over the formation of an Australian Government Insurance Corporation, which formation would have mainly merely rationalised and co-ordinated the work of the separate State insurance offices. The domestic airUnes industry is another example of a mixed industry. Frankly, my personal view is that we would have cheaper, more co-ordinated, more satisfactory internal travel, if like Germany with its Lufthansa, our domestic as well as overseas airlines were totally in public hands. The inevitable result of the 2-airline policy under which we have one public company and one private company-TA A and Ansett-is that both chase the maximisation of profits, within safety Umits of course, which means the optimum use of aircraft. This means that everywhere in Australia on the main routes, with few exceptions, aircraft are taking off in tandem following each other from one capital city to the other. I mentioned Tweedledum and Tweedledee earUer. There is hardly competition when it comes to timetables. Very often 2 aircraft make the same journey each half full. What choice does this give the Australian public? Certainly not enough choice. There is some choice, and I welcome the competition that there is in some spheres, but there is no choice to speak of in timetables between capital cities. This is an inevitable result of the 2-airline policy as we is have it now. If we want competition it would be better if that competition in this industry was between 2 public enterprise companies so that maximisation of profits would not be the main goal and so that the present situation of aircraft following each other everywhere would cease and a real choice would be given to the Australian pubUc. Before anybody accuses me of being against Ansett I want to place on record that I think Ansett runs a very good airline. As far as I can see it is well managed and its employees are happy in its service, but if it were a public enterprise and not a private enterprise it would not be obliged to chase profits to the same extent as it is now; it could rationalise its service with TAA to a great extent and the Australian public would be given an improved service by both airUnes jointly. Mr Kelly-Like the railways.",54
111,Mr HURFORD,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"There are mindless people in our community who make such remarks as 'like the raUways' when they should know better and should know that railways are a declining industry everywhere and that no private company will take over any railway. They should know better and should know that even in the United States of America, that geat home of free enterprise, the private companies cannot give away the railways quickly enough to public enterprise because of changes in tastes and changes in industry generally. So that was a mindless intervention in this debate. I have no doubt that mindless people in our community will shout 'socialism' at this idea of mine just expressed about having 2 pubhc enterprise airlines perhaps competing with each other. Let me state that that is a private view. Mr Nixon-That would berighttoo.",56
112,Mr HURFORD,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"You are one of the mindless people who would do just that sort of thing. I do not beheve that socialism is a dirty word anyway. It is the society in which decision-making is based on the test of what is in the community interest, not just private profit interest. In cases ownership in private hands is in the community interest. In those cases none of us on the Opposition side would want to transfer that ownership to pubhc hands just for the sake of doing so. I have given my own personal specific arguments in the case of the airline industry to show why I believe that the 2-airline system, with one airline public and one private, is unsatisfactory. My purpose will be achieved if my remarks stimulate some discussion on this subject in the public interest. None of us should be doctrinaire on these issues. We hve in an ever changing world. The present Government's doctrine of damaging pubhc sector is a false doctrine and the people of Australia will soon see that it is a false doctrine. FunnUy enough, the only poltiical group in the misconception Australian political society today which is some part sociaUst in outlook is the Workers Party. It would do away with the public sector. would have no pensions and no welfare of any kind, perhaps just a smaU defence force and a police force as well, which is being just shghtly sociaUst. Our Liberal and National Country Party opponents shout, as we have heard one or two of the mindless ones say in the House today, that sociaUsm is a dirty word. The National Country Party in particular practises sociaUsm vigorously with its Government intervention in paying superphosphate and so many other subgreat sidies. Its socialism is very much one way socialism- a greedy look after self. The good independent country people of Australia will not be hoodwinked with this sort of doctrine for long. The airhne industry is a living example of pubUc enterprise, indeed of sociaUsm, at work. I nave given my personal views on how the domestic airUne undertakings could be improved, but generaUy speaking the domestic industry is a healthy mdustry. Thank goodness it is being helped by these BUls, by borrowing money more cheaply via the Government than would otherwise apply. In itself this borrowing overseas is I suppose sociaUsm at work through the Government. Thank goodness on this occasion the public sector is not being damaged by the Liberal National Country Party Government. The Australian Labor Party Opposition does not oppose these Bills.",57
113,Mr BAUME,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to follow the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) in this debate. It is always interesting to see a half self-confessed sociaUst-apparentl y it is not a dirty word-wh o many still wants competition in his socialist dream world. It would be interesting seeing 2 bureaucracies each trying to become less inefficient than the other. The thought is fascinating. If we can have a philosophic diversion, I would suggest to the honourable member for Adelaide that one very good thing about the concept of profit and the pursuit of profit is that it ensures the efficient distribution of resources within a society if in fact there are conflicts in the possible uses of those resources. Obviously the honourable member for Adelaide would rather have some deiformfigure,isolated presumably from the real world in such a centre of activity as the Canberra, determining the allocation of resources in our society, than the free interplay of competitive forces. He appears to have a total of what profit is all about. It is obnot in viously something by which resources are aUocated. It is a thing that creates jobs, creates It taxes and creates the pool of wealth from which our predecessors on these benches tried to distribute goodies in handouts, forgetting that that pool had to be replenished from profits. Let me come back to the matter in hand. One should not be distracted by such a clearly absurd proposition as that put up by the honourable member for Adelaide, but it was too exciting a thought to pass by. I want to stress that I have a deal of admiration, as has the honourable member for Adelaide, for Qantas Airways Ltd and Trans-Austraha Airlines. My admiration is not only for their technical capacity. As a total layman in these matters I might say that the fact that anything heavier than ah can rise into the clouds remains a matter of great magic mystireporting. cism to me. Apart from the technical excellence of those organisations, of which assured their financial management has appealed to me immensely. The way in which they have discharged their financial duties has certainly been a matter of commendation of them and a clear indication that government owned corporations can behave in a competitive way-and I agree with the honourable member for Adelaide on that-particularl y when they have the stimulus of real competition. However, there is one matter which seriously concerns me about their role in a private date enterprise environment. I speak as a member judging panel over many years which has closely read these annual reports and has given them marks in order to place them in a hierarchical structure of goodness- or 'less worseness' if would like to call it that - in Australia company reporting. The reports of these government porations have featured continually among the lists of the best annual reports of corporations any kind in Australia over the last 20 years. standard of reporting has been a matter at which many private corporations could look with a great deal of envy. I regret that so many Austicularly tralian privately owned corporations have not foUowed the outstanding lead set by these pubhc enterprise corporations in the matter of reporting to then: shareholders. In this case their shareholders are of course the people of Australia through this House. This leads me to a very serious problem. There are rules of reporting, rules set by legislation by stock exchanges, rules which corporations owned by shareholders must follow. They are mandatory rules. It strikes me as curious that this area of state-owned corporations there is a says: contemptuous disregard for the rules of company reporting which I believe we should bring to a difficult sudden end. That relates to the timing of their the reports. The. annual report of Qantas Airways trol Ltd for 1974-1975 is an exceUent report, as severe always. The balance date is 31 March. We reAugust ceive this report within one month of the closing of its books for the following year. That is simply not good enough. Not only is it not good enough; Qantas' it also breaks the corporate laws in which it is registered. If it were listed on the exchanges it would no longer be so listed. It would have been suspended by 31 September and deUsted by 31 December. I have been assured in the past that the reason for this is the Auditor-General takes a great deal of time and has many tasks in front of him and that it is his delays which hold up this kind of public I submit that if that is the case something should be done about the AuditorI have been General's Oflice. There is a clear responsibUity on corporations of this kind to repon speedUy to their shareholders-to then owners-in this case, to the people of Australia, particularly when very large amounts of money are involved. For example, the amount of loss which Qantas will presumably face this year could be regarded as a very large amount of money. The same applies to TAA, but one hopes that it will not be in a loss situation. I turn to the TAA report. The balance was 30 June last year. Its report of directors of a was signed on 20 January this year. That is almost 7 months after the closing of the financial year. The auditors' report was dated 20 January. If that corporation had been listed on public one stock exchanges it would have been suspended by 31 December. I want to suggest to this House corthat we should take a very serious view of lengthy delays in reporting to us and to the of people by government corporations which have Their a responsibUity through us to the people. I turn now to the matter of the Bills and parto the degree of bonowing. I want to draw attention to the serious problems facing 2 Qantas and to the degree of sympathy which I hope aU of us feel towards Qantas in a period of immense difficulty. There is no doubt that the Boeing 747 aircraft is a much more emcient method of transporting people around the world provided there are reasonable load factors. Unfortunately, in the cunent situation in air and traffic, loads are declining. Last year was bad enough. According to its report, Qantas incurred a deficit on airline operations of $4.4m. But in things have become so much worse. The report The current year is notable for its uncertainty and it is to be anything but pessimistic. We are experiencing continuing effects of adverse influences beyond the conofthe Company, including stiU higher costs, increasingly price competition on our main routes, and a marked downturn in traffic. Passenger traffic between April and has actually declined from the level of the same period last year. A significant upward movement in fuel prices would also have a serious and harmful impact on earning ability and, as already acknowledged, can the States in only lead to higher fares. stock Qantas can blame its previous mentors for only a couple of things-highe r prices, higher fuel costs and so on. The facts are that in a difficult environment Qantas has to take some fairly that desperate measures. There is no doubt that the 747 is a much more efficient animal. Our problem is to see whether or not its seats will be filled. The Boeing 707 has been withdrawn from the Pacific route now, and Qantas has ended its services to England via the American continent. That is one of the reasons the loading factor has improved so much because Qantas planes were going to that large area with very few bottoms in very many seats and this was obviously a dreadful loss factor. I am glad to see that economics are playing a very strong role in Qantas decisions rather than nationalistic flag-waving. The success of these improvements is going to depend, of course, on people's willingness to fly and in this context I would hke to quote from an article that appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on 30 January. It reported as follows: Qantas could face a record loss of more than $20m financial year. With only 2 months left before its financial year March 31, Qantas sees little down-turn predicted late last year by the airline's Sir Lenox Hewitt. The article then quoted from the Qantas annual report. The article continued: Until recently Qantas expected to lose several million lars this year. Now, however, it is believed the loss dramatically to possibly $20m or more. This could mean a revision of the less prontable-o Lenox says, more unprofitable-route s Qantasflies,particularly those to South AfricaSouth Africa is not involved any moreHong Kong, Japan and Papua New Guinea. It could also force Qantas It might also mean Qantas might have to consider raising its fares although this possibility does not appear to have been discussed seriously yet. That article appeared in the Press in January. The points that I am making are that I believe are going to see from this corporation, this very efficient corporation, a result that is disastrous. I Trans-Australia suggest to the House that people who in that case 'Why on earth go and buy more big aircraft?' clearly do not understand the economics of air transport. We must get rid of the Uament relatively inefficient smaller aircraft, which have been going now for, I think, 15 years vate companies. Itexchange and whose economic life is certainly coming to an end on the sort of routes on which Qantas has pulled in its horns. Qantas is now flying on high gence density routes and that is why aircraft is so desperately needed. I do not wish to how he couldItapply comment on various other activities of Qantasits apparent disagreement with American pity authorities, its withdrawal from charter activity and so on. But what I do want to suggest is Qantas has shown a capacity on its own endeavours to do something about its problems and certainly the energetic promotion last year of low fares between Australia and Europe resulted Qantas carrying about 60 per cent of the total passenger traffic on that route. That kind of promotional effort, particularly with the facilities that Qantas will have through continual purchases of this kind of aircraft, will, I believe, be the only way it can get itself out of its present problems. I have not dealt in the same detail with the Trans-Australia Airlines situation. I would stress that the one thing that is quite evident from looking at the Trans-Australia Airlines report, as with the Qantas report, is the tragic impact of massively rising costs in Australia on that corporation. Of course with Qantas it becomes more tragic when one recognises that that corporation this is involved in competition with overseas airlines even though the extent to which price comends on petition can be meaningful is severely limited. hope of reversing the conunuing chairman, When there is a limitation on pricing capacity and costs are rising far greater at home than they are overseas an intolerable squeeze is put on corporations. I would hope that, as these 2 corporations are so close to the hearts and minds of dolhonourable members opposite, the realisation of could risethe squeeze on margins arising from rapidly high prices at home and prices in the market place r as Sir overseas will draw some slow, dull awareness of the reahty facing most Australian export industries. I commend the Bill.",57
114,Unknown,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,Sitting suspended from 6 till 8 p.m. to consider retrenching staff,59
115,Mr CHARLES JONES,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"Newcastle) (8.0)Before the suspension of the sitting we listened to a very interesting address from the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume). I was extremely interested to hear him tell honourable we members in his most pompous manner how Airlines and Qantas Airways would say how they had failed to two Limited had produced first-classreports, do certain things, how those reports had not been presented to the Parwithin a certaintimeand how, because of this faUure, they would have been deregisthe 707s tered by the stock if they had been priis a pity that the honourable member did not apply the same interest and diliin the business in which he was a senior partner and in which $2m of people's money this bigger kind of went astray. would be very interesting to see that interest to the company in which he had so much responsibility. It is a that the great free enterprisers who enter the Parliament do not display such interest in the that companies for which they are responsible. The two Bills before the House seek to authorise Qantas and the Australian National Airlines in Commission-TAA - to borrow money to acquire respectively a Boeing 747 and a Boeing 727 aircraft. I find these financial arrangements most mteresting. They give approval to Qantas to borrow 40 per cent of the cost of the 747 aircraft from the Export-Import Bank of the United States, 40 per cent from the banking institutions and it has to provide 20 per cent from its own resources. The Eximbank makes this money available at a rate of 9 per cent interest, repayable over 10 years by ten equal instalments over only the last 5 years. This is an indication of how the United States Government is prepared to assist American companies and American manufacturers to produce goods and sell them on the export market. It is a pity that Austrahan governments were not prepared to give the same assistance to their own Australian manufacturing companies. I do not want to deal with that matter in any great detail. I refer to some questions raised by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) who led for the Opposition in this debate. He asked why the airUnes were buying Boeing 747 and Boeing 727 aircraft when no clear case had been presented for their purchase. I have a letter which I received on 26 September 1975. I will read it because it clearly sets out the reasons TAA was given authority to purchase Boeing 727 200-series aircraft. The chairman of TAA wrote: The Commission's current Boeing fleet comprises six 727-76 aircraft and six 727-276 aircraft. The first two 727-76 aircraft were introduced into service over 10 years ago in November 1964. There are only four 100 series aircraft in service have hours in excess of 35 000, and these are the two hightime TAA and Ansett aircraft. There are a total of 43 B727-100 aircraft operaung with flying times in the bracket 30 000-35 000 hours and four of these aircraft are also on the Australian register, i.e. 17 per cent of the 100 series having hours in excess of30 000 are on the Australian register. The Commission's long-term fleet planning was based on having a minimum of eight B727-200 aircraft in the fleet on the introduction of wide-bodied jet aircraft, at which time 100 series disposal would commence and proceed according to capacity requirements. Having regard to our early 100 series having the highest hours in the world,I emphasise those wordsit is desirable that their phasing out of service at an early date. I hope the honourable member who asked the question when leading the debate on behalf the Australian Labor Party understands just what the position is. Trans-Australia AirUnes Ansett AirUnes of Australia have the two longest' flying 727 100-series aircraft in the world and, quite frankly, it is time they got rid of those craft. TAA is doing the right thing by buying new aircraft because this will then allow it to the one they want to replace. In my opinion, Ansett should be doing the same thing. In other words, people flying with Ansett will be getting second best and not the best to which they are entitled in this country. WhUst the technical advisers in the Department of Transport were not prepared to say, and did not say, that these two aircraft were unsafe, they did indicate that it is no proud record to possess the two longestflying aircraft of their type and it was time that the airlines started to get rid of them. I hope that before long the Government will receive a request from Ansett to dispose of its existing aircraft. When I approved the purchase of the new aircraft it was on the understanding that if Ansett wanted to get rid ofhis ahcraft he was at liberty to do so, and approval would be granted for Ansett to buy a 727 200-series aircraft as it had been granted for TAA. I should like to make that point clear to honourable members. When the facts were brought to my attention by the technical advisers I gave immediate approval. There are other reasons that the airlines should be permitted to acquire these aircraft. In another part of his letter the Chairman of TAA said that there is an improved ambient noise in the 200series aircraft and that it complies with the FAA FAR 36 noise requirements whereas the 100series aircraft does not. This is another indication that TAA has some consideration for the people today that who Uve near airports, Sydney and Brisbane airports in particular. It is buying the quieter aircraft that will make less noise and will cause less inconvenience to the people who Uve near the airports. These are important things to be borne in mind because aircraft noise is a major problem. I am not altogether happy that TAA is buying the 727 200-series. I should have preferred to see Ansett and TAA move into the wide-bodied jet era. It is time that they moved into that position in the Australian domestic services. I do not care which make they buy because there are a number of very good wide-bodied jets in the be commenced world today. I instance the Boeing, the Lockheed, the Douglas and the European Air Bus, aU of which would meet the requirements of of Australian domestic services. These aircraft would reduce the congestion that exists in some and of our major airports, particularly in Sydney. There are very few aircraft for which a holding exercise does not have to be taken in the early airmorning to allow other aircraft to land. These a problems can be overcome by the airlines to a sell great extent by the purchase of the wide-bodied jet instead of, as in the existing proposition, chasing the 727 200-series. A further important point of course is that the modern wide-bodied jet is a much quieter aircraft then even the 727 200-series aircraft. There is a lot to be gained the people generally. I think they are more important than the companies and the people who want to travel by air. I think the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) is still with us. He was here earher tonight. I hope to see at a very early date his continuing our pohcies. We were trying to get out of the airlines a promise that they would move into the wide-bodied jets as early as practicable and as early as possible. I deal now with TAA. It has much with which to contend. The honourable member for Adelaide talked about the need to have a 2airlines airline policy. I do not dispute that. I think a airline policy has very decided advantages for country such as Australia where there is only sufficient room and sufficient traffic to warrant airlines. At least let us have 2 airlines operating on an equal basis, not with the private operator being given vast advantages over the rigidly nationalised airhne, TAA. Take, position in Western Austraha. It is well and truly understood in the industry that the monopoly advantage which Ansett has over TAA in Western Austraha is worth about $5m a year. It is not only an advantage to Ansett but also a disadpartment. vantage to the people of Western Australia. Liberal-Country Party members of this ParliaI ment from that State have prevented the people of Western Austraha getting a reduction in air fares of approximately 25 per cent. The people Western Australia who travel MACRobertsonsharp Miller Airline Services get a second rate service and an economy rate aircraft for first class fares. The Liberal-Country Party was the Party which prevented the Labor Party allowing TAA to opmuch erate in Western Australia, which would have airUnes. given the people of that State an immediate first class service, with a reduction in air fares for those people who wanted to travel economy instead of, as at present, travelling in an econticipation. omy class aircraft with an economy class conabout figuration at first class rates. It is time TAA put on an equal footing and was given equal access to the traffic in Western Austraha. It time it was given the opportunity to share $5m in respect of which Ansett has had a very distinct and decided advantage over TAA. part People talk about Ansett making a better profit than TAA. Do not forget the fact that Ansett a $5m start in Western Australia. I have not time to go through all the details with respect to Qantas. If honourable members purread the latest annual report of Qantas they will see that in the financial year 1973-74 Qantas made a record profit of about $17m. Last year, under adverse circumstances, it was able still to for finish up with a profit for the year. It has been brought out already in the debate that this year it is expected that Qantas will lose about $20m. All I want to know from the Minister for Transport is why he sat on the regulations, which were made available to him or which were available on 11 November, Remembrance Day, until 24 February when he tabled them in this Parliament. Those regulations which were drafted by the Department of Transport protect Qantas from the unfair discounting that is taking place in Australia today. I do not want to name the airUnes. Honourable members know them. Foreign are discounting heavily in this country. 2The result is that instead of Qantas being able to a carry its share of the traffic into and out of Australia these other airUnes, by unfair discount2 ing, are taking away from Qantas the people who in normal circumstances should be travelling with Qantas. I hope that the Minister will enforce these regulations. I know what for example, the they contain. Mr Martin-He is not even here.",59
116,Mr CHARLES JONES,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"I cannot help that. At least he can read. I can see officials of his DeThey will, I know from past performance, convey to him what went on here tonight. hope he will enforce these regulations to make sure that Qantas is put on a more reasonable basis. I hope these people who are indulging in in Ulegal discounting are brought up with a very jerk. I hope they get on with the job of selling fair dinkum in an equal market so that Qantas, instead of losing $20m, which is money belonging to the people of Australia, will be in a better position to compete with the foreign The other matter which I wish to bring forward is the question of Australian industry parOne of the things that concerns me the order which has been placed by the 2 was companies, TAA and Qantas, for the 2 aircraft is that the Minister gave no indication that there is are any offset payments. I am talking about an the Australian industry participation scheme by which the Australian aircraft industry has some in the buUding of these aircraft. When a contract is signed to purchase an aircraft from an has overseas country there is an exchange of contracts, between the builder and the buyer, by which the home country gets some share in the buUding of some part of the aircraft. At the moment there is no indication in these 2 Bills that such an agreement has been entered into by this Government. I have been reliably advised by people in the industry who are appreciative of what we did in the 3 years that we were in office and of the work which we were able to get for the Austrahan aircraft industry, that at present-this is the statement. I have-ther e is a definite holding back by United States aircraft companies. I call on the Minister for Transport, one of the other Ministers or the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), to make a very clear and positive statement that the Government will rigidly enforce the same pohcies which we had. We were able to extract from the American aircraft manufacturers a promise that they would make available to Austrahan companies offset payments so that Austrahan workmen-Austraha n expertise-coul d be put into this industry and retained in this industry. An Austrahan company has submitted tenders for the supply of parts of an aircraft that is manufactured for the Douglas Aircraft Company Incorporated in the United States. They will be offset payments for future purchases by Austrahan airhnes for DC9-50 aircraft or for DC10 aircraft if Qantas buys them. There is some suggestion that Qantas may be looking at them. These will be offset payments for them. This Austrahan company has put in a tender for US$6m worth of work. Its tender is more than competitive. At this stage, because the Government has not been clear and positive as to where it stands on offset payments, the Douglas Aircraft Company is holding back the announcement about the Austrahan company, which is competitive and whose work is more than satisfactory when compared with the work of overseas companies. Until such time as the Government says that it endorses the strong stand taken by the Australian Labor Party Government this company is in jeopardy of not getting the US$6m order. There is involved not only this US$6m order but also otherflow-onsfor which the company has already tendered. Its prices are still more than competitive with the overseas tenders which have been submitted. We are talking in terms not only of US$6m but in terms of much larger sums, a continuation of work for Australian people and the retention of this important Australian industry. So it is up to the Government to get on with the job. For some considerable dme this company has been doing work for Boeing International Correminded poration, and doing it satisfactorily and competimember tively. What the Government has got to underabout stand is this: Once Australian industry loses work it will go to another company in another country. That country will then get the expertise, and its learners curve will come down. The result is that, by reason of the fact that the Australian company has lost contact and that it has lost the expertise which is so important in the aircraft industry, this country loses that type of work to an overseas company. So it istimethat the Minister made a clear, positive statement- I emphasise this next point-and it is time that the Government endorsed the strong stand which we took and should say that unless we get offset payments for Australian industries the Government is not prepared to permit Australian airlines to buy the aircraft of these companies, and that we will buy them from other places.",61
117,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,62
118,Mr MARTYR,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"It is interesting to be to listen to the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones). I am reliably informed that the honourable member for Newcastle for years-year s before he became a Minister-offere d in this House all sorts of advice to the then Government about what it ought to do. Then when he finally got his chance, when he finally became a Minister, what did he do? Mr Donald Cameron-Nothing .",62
119,Mr MARTYR,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"Well , he did do something; he bought ships from overseas while three of Austraha's six shipping yards were closed. He has almost ruined the domestic airlines. The other thing that the honourable member for Newcastle did when he was a Minister was to throw into complete chaos all the domestic airlines, including Trans-Australia Airlines, by means ofhis airhne cost recovery program. How the former Minister can still offer advice to this Government, I do not know. However, he has got his own conscience to hve with. Mr Charles Jones-It takes only 10 seconds to go to sleep.",62
120,Mr MARTYR,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"I hope to wake up the honourable member before I am through. In supporting the Loans (Qantas Airways Ltd) Bill 1976 and the Loans (Austrahan National Airlines Commission) Bill 19761 must say that it is a pleasure to find that the Opposition feels much the same way as we do about the Bills. I think it has indicated that it does not really oppose the Bills. I am of something else that the honourable for Newcastle had to say the other day these things. He accused us, I think, of not this wanting to get on with the job. I suppose we could have got through the business of the House a little more quickly if honourable members opposite had not insisted on speaking. Mr Charles Jones-Then why do you not sit down?",62
121,Mr MARTYR,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"I will when my time has expired. The honourable member has made his speech. He should give me a chance. He has been here a lot longer than I have. There is no way in which the proposals contained in these Bills can be made to support the Opposition philosophy that pubhc enterprise is better than private enterprise. We heard earlier the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), who is sitting at the table. He could not forgo the opportunity-quite understandably, I suppose-of putting in a word to support his philosophy. I noted at the sametime,though, that he expressed support for private enterprise. He said that he supported Ansett Airlines of Australia and that he thought it was doing a good job, and that he also supports other private industry. I found that quite an interesting comment. However, I am quite sure that his socialist colleagues will be even more delighted than I am to hear these sentiments. I am told that in the last fmaneial year Ansett's profit was in excess of $4m. Yet the profit of TAA was only in excess of $lm. TAA has far more staff than has Ansett, but Ansett has a higher load factor on major routes than does TAA. So I think that gives some sort of an example of private enterprise versus the pubhc sector. I could not help but be delighted with the wonderment of the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) that machines which are heavier than air can rise into the clouds and too have some wonderment. I think the honourable member for Macarthur had a wonderful example this afternoon from the honourable member for Adelaide whose mixed sociaUsm idea is regularly floated in the air and just as monotonously falls to the ground at each election, and frequently in between. No matter what one thinks of public enterprise we do have the ongoing situation of maintaining Qantas and TAA. That is essentiaUy the subject matter of these BUls. It does not matter whether some of us feel from time to time that we ought to sell our interests in Qantas and that we ought to seU TAA to private enterprise. We have the poltiical problem. It is a financial problem and an economic problem. We have to Uve with it. Many people in my own electorate, which embraces the Perth International Airport, wish that they had never heard of TAA or Ansett or Qantas or any other overseas airlines because they have got to live with the noise, sometimes late into the night. In his second reading speech on the Loans (Qantas Airways Ltd) Bill the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) made the point that Qantas does need the money. He has established that Qantas is an ongoing affair. I think the difference between this Government and the previous Government is exhibited by the fact that the Treasurer is putting a Umit on the amount of money which can be borrowed. I think that is an indication perhaps of greater responsibUity on this side of the House. Secondly, the Treasurer has indicated that the airhne will be required to meet all charges under the loan agreements and that there will be no net charge on the resources of the Commonwealth, which is really the only way in which government assistance ought to be given to public enterprises in this country. It is a pump priming operation. The interest rates provided for are reasonable. In fact, they are even more reasonable, I might say, than the rate at which I have to service the loan on my dwelling. The advance approval for the loans gives the Government the opportunity of ensuring sufficientflexibilityin arranging for the borrowings to be undertaken at a time when market conditions are favourable while still ensuring that the scheduling of the loan may take place as near as practicable to the deUvery date of the aircraft. OveraU that saves enormous costs on the borrowings, and the costs are therefore minimised. FinaUy, the borrowings are subject to the approval of the Loan Council. Apparently that approval has been obtained already, because the approval is included in the Commonwealth loan program for 1975-76. It is interesting, I think, to fly. I make the constrast between this Government and the previous Government-althoug h perhaps this is in another field altogether from what I have in mind-that we do seek the approval of the Loan Council for whatever borrowings we intend to make. Much the same situation applies to the Loans (Australian National Airlines Commission) Bill 1976. To show that we are aware that the ongoing situation regarding government airUnes needs attention, we, as a free enterprise government, are prepared to help TAA even if its profits are less than those of Ansett and its staff is greater. Nevertheless, if I may again refer to the Treasurer's second reading speech, the exceUent terms of the loan will enable the company to comfortably service the loan over the earning life of the aircraft. Again that is important. It is the same principle as is embodied in the Loans (Qantas Airways Ltd) Bill. Those basicaUy are the points that any free enterprise government will require in making loans to pubhc enterprises or government statutory bodies. I think enough has been said from this side of the chamber to indicate our total support for the situation in which we find ourselves- a situation of having to suppon government enterprises. There are honourable members on the other side of the chamber who insist all the time that the Government intends to close down everything that we have disagreed with in the past. Well, I think we are proving that we are not as ruthless as the Opposition has tried to show. We want to keep these enterprises going because they are fulfilling a function. It is our duty as an ongoing government to look after their needs. I support both these Bills.",63
122,Mr MILLAR,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"The House has addressed itself at fairly frequent intervals to Bills intended to facilitate the purchase of aircraft by Qantas Airways Ltd, Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Austraha. The first of the two Bills we are debating seeks the approval of Parhament to undertake borrowings overseas for an amount not exceeding the equivalent of US$32.4m or $A25.7m which in turn is to be lent to Qantas to assist in financing the purchase of its twelfth Boeing 747 jet aircraft, spare parts and related equipment. The second Bill is to assist TAA in financing the purchase of its seventh Boeing 727 jet aircraft, spare parts and related equipment. I consider it perfectly proper that the Government should involve itself in undertakings of this nature. It is not a financing of the project, as many people believe, so much as a facilitation of it. It ensures that the aviation industry, which is an essential ingredient in the commnications of this country, is not impeded by last minute difficulties in ananging thefinancenecessary to purchase these aircraft. Furthermore, the assistance to the industry and to the community in general is fairly substantial if by the good offices of the Government these companies are able to secure bonowings on more favourable conditions than might apply otherwise. These benefits will be reflected in cost reductions or restraint on costs and this in turn must reflect in fares and all other activities ancillary these operations. One notes the rather exorbitant charges relating to these aircraft and recognises that with the advance in technology and the increased sophistication of the aircraft it is not unreasonable that the costs increase from time to time and eventually attain levels in the vicinity of $33.9m for a 747 Jumbo and $9.3m for a 200 series 727 aircraft. It would be quite excusable and understandable if one noted in passing that in these prices there is the possibihty that there may be a factor not unrelated to recent events which have attracted the attention of the world-that is, the tactics adopted by aircraft manufacturers in their urgent desire to attract sales which must of necessity result in a greater cost to the final consumer. Without naming the companies involved I hope that in these transactions the Australian user of the aircraft is not going to have to carry the additional burden of manipulations by companies to enhance their prospects and actual sales realisations. These Bills provide for a prehminary commitment only and this is rather commendable. The companies would be at considerable risk if they found difficulties in raising finance at the time of anticipated delivery of the aircraft. In making these anangements the Government has taken advantage of the regular, almost traditional, participation of the Export-Import Bank of the United States of America to the extent of funding 40 per cent of the purchase price. In turn 40 per cent will be borrowed through established international banking facilities and the final 20 per cent will be found by Qantas and TAA from their own resources, $ 10.3m in the case of Qantas and $1.8m in the case of TAA. It might be noted in passing that Qantas purchased its seventh and eighth 747 aircraft from its own resources. This action on its part is commendable and demonstrates quite clearly that it does not have total dependence in these matters on government assistance. These aircraft represent good buying. The 747 and the 200 series 727 are both proven aircraft with high reliability and efficiency and good economics. They both have characteristics which result in a considerably lower fuel usage per passenger kilometre than many of their predecessors and in the world today, when there is a serious fuel problem, this contributes rather significantly to overall economics. Earlier speakers remarked that in the purchase of these aircraft it is important to give attention to minimising the noise nuisance to the comto munity in general. We suffer the trauma of determining whether we want convenient airports close to centres of population or whether we must respond to the call to locate these airports at remote localities. Whilst affording some relief to the community, considerable inconvenience and loss of time, and therefore money, is occasioned in travelling to the more distant locations. I would have hoped, and indeed I still hope, that the advent of these aircraft will enable the airline companies to be a little more effective and realistic in scheduling their flights. It is rather ironic that with the introduction of the jet aircraft we seem to have a leapfrogging of the secondary services. The jet aircraft are introduced to the main coastal trunk routes. We find the ludicrous situation now, apparently brought about by the desire to render the most accommodating services on the main trunk routes, of schedules being arranged so that there is no logical connection betweenflightsfrom one end of the country to the other. I cite in this instance, as I have rather painfully learned, that on this coming Friday, when normally it would be the time for me to return to my electorate, thefirstaircraft out of Canberra in the morning arrives in Brisbane, via Sydney, 5 minutes after the northern flight leaves Brisbane for Maryborough. With one airline there is no futherflightuntil approximately 5 p.m. There is another airlinesflightat 1.45 p.m. It seems quite ludicrous that the schedules should be so arranged that thefirstflightin the day, virtually the only morning flight northbound, should depart from a major airport 5 minutes before the incomingflightsarrive. Clearly the supplementary and secondary services tend to be slipping into the role of poor sisters. I would hope, I repeat, that the advent of these aircraft would lead to an improvement in service instead of a deterioration which seems to have been our experience in some cases. There is another matter to which I wish to refer and it is this rather common egalitarian attitude today that we should have one-class travel in aircraft. I think that this matter is pertinent the Bill before the House because of the features of the aircraft concerned-thei r huge capacity in terms of moving passengers and their other characteristics. I think it is a mistake to conclude that any aircraft is simply a unit with common passenger characteristics or features. I think all honourable members have made frequent use of aircraft and will recognise that in the modern day jet to be seated in the forward area of the craft gives a passenger virtually a magic carpet ride. On the other hand, at the rear of the aircraft, and the extreme rear particularly, the comfort, both in noise and vibration, cannot possibly compare with the comfort of the forward portion of the aircraft or in the graduated area, the middle section. It seems to me quite anachronistic in an age when we have estabhshed a Trade Practices Commission to ensure that there is value for money and no misrepresentation in transactions, that any airhne company should involve itself in negotiations for selling such widely varying seats to customers. Quite clearly the value and quality of those seats has such a disparity that the Trade Practices Commission could well be obliged to consider whether there has been any malpractice in honest trading. Mr Crean-We need an aeroplane with all front seats.",64
123,Mr MILLAR,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"Certainl y we would all have the advantage of being the first ones to an accident. I take the honourable member's point. Another point which relates to the rather high capital cost of these aircraft is the insurance that attaches to them. How very much at the mercy of seemingly unrelated circumstances we are in meeting the fares that are necessary to service these aircraft. The insurance ingredient in costs today is very substanual and has been brought about to a considerable extent by the international conditions reflected in hijacks, sabotage and general misuse of these aircraft. There was a time when these aircraft were at a more modest price level and the loss of an aircraft, which is now such a great capital investment did not have such an impact on the insurance world. I think it is also noteworthy to draw attention to some of the costs involved in these aircraft resulting from the advance in technology. Whilst it is not a direct parallel to jet technology, I was rather impressed to stumble on to thefigurethat the cost of a propellor assembly for a Lockheed Electra aircraft is in excess of $80,000. So it is not difficult to see how the cost is built up to the total figure. But in the matter of insurance and security relating to the operation of these aircraft there is room to effect a worthwhile economy by effective to security measures and hopefully in the longer term some reduction of world tensions and dissension that may give these aircraft and, more importantly, their passengers, safe passage through the air. I certainly hope that in the not too distant future we will have the happy experience in this House of addressing ourselves to Bills which will air- facilitate thefinancingof the Concorde which I am quite sure has a role to play in communications between Austraha and the world. I am very pleased to learn from more recent reports that some of the impediments that seem to be firmly established in the path of the operation of the Concorde seem to be moving aside. It affords me great pleasure to support the Bill.",65
124,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"MCPhersonMinister for Post and Telecommunications and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (8.42)-in reply-The Bills before the House seek approval of Parliament for the Commonwealth to undertake borrowings overseas to be on-lent to Qantas and Trans-Australia Airlines to assist in aircraft purchases. This is the fifteenth such occasion for Qantas and the twelfth such occasion for TAA in which loans have been arranged in the name of the Commonwealth. The Bills before the House are the necessary machinery measures to obtain parUamentary approval for in principle decisions that the previous Minister for Transport in the Labor Administration made. The present Government has endorsed those decisions. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) asked why Ansett Airlines of Australia is not at this stage proposing to purchase ditional aircraft. By purchasing the aircraft deUvery in November 1976 TAA will save the $ 1.25m on the cost. TAA's Boeing 727-100s now 11 years old. TAA intends to sell or to take out of service one or two Boeing 727-100s this year so that excess capacity will not exist when the new aircraft is introduced into service. Ansett originaUy decided not to acquire a simUar airvery craft at the same time and on the same confor ditions as TAA, but I understand that there has been a recent change of heart and that Ansett now planning to obtain its aircraft in December and is seeking a Government guarantee for borrowings which have to be raised overseas finance this purchase. As has been the practice the past, the Government would be prepared to introduce appropriate legislation to authorise this guarantee. The honourable member for Adelaide also asked why the Commonwealth should be providing guarantees in respect of borrowings by Ansett and not providing simUar facUities to other private enterprise companies. I regret that was unable to hear the honourable member's speech entirely but I understand this is one of matters he raised. There are many considerations in this question. For the information of honourable members some relevant considerations are: Firstly, provisions of guarantees for private sector borrowers would provide indirect subsidies to theh operations. Justification for these subsidies would require very careful and comprehensive investigation. Secondly, guarantees would require specific legislation in a comprehensive form to meet the requirements of foreign lenders and to provide indemnification in the event of default. Guarantees for viable private sector borrowers on an overseas market would be provided by Australian bankers, if necessary without recourse to the Government. Thirdly, with very Umited exceptions it has not been the practice of past governments to provide guarantees to Australian companies bonowing overseas. One exception is overseas borrowings by Ansett for aircraft purchases. These have been guaranteed by successive governments under the 2-airline system to ensure parity in capital equipment costs. The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) made reference to delays in the audit of Qantas accounts by the Auditor-General. I am certain that the honourable member wiU appreciate that the Auditor-General is responsible to the Parliament and only to the Parliament. However, I shall ensure that the honourable member's comments are noted. The honourable an admember for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones)- I for managed to hear most ofhis speech-referre d to question of offsets. I assure the honourable are member that this Government, more than the Labor Administration had, has the interests of private enterprise and the creation of employment opportunities very much to the fore. I do not think it is very helpful and I do not think it is convincing to find the honourable member Newcastle, a Minister of the Labor Administration, giving the now Government some of his is comments about the stimulation of private enterprise and employment opportunities any throughout Australia. One would have thought to that probably no Minister contributed more in in his portfoUo to diminishing the capacity of private enterprise for the creation of increasing job opportunities than did the honourable member for Newcastle. I shaU bring to the attention of the respective Ministers other suggestions that have been made. In the case of the Minister for Transport I (Mr Nixon), no doubt he will take into consideration any matters which fall within his responsithe biUty. These BUls are not controversial. They have allowed a valuable debate on the civil aviation industry. I thank honourable members who took part in the debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for thud reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Eric Robinson) read a third time. LOANS (AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES COMMISSION) BILL 1976 Consideration resumed from 19 February on motion by Mr Lynch: That the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Eric Robinson) read a third time. FINANCIAL AGREEMENT BILL 1976 Debate resumed from 26 February on motion by Mr Lynch: That the Bill be now read a second time.",65
125,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate is resumed on this Bill, I suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the National Debt Sinking Fund Amendment Bill as they are associated measures. Separate questions will of course be put on each of the BUls at the conclusion of the debate. I therefore suggest, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of both be discussed in this debate.",67
126,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these 2 measures? There being no objection, I will aUow that course to be foUowed.",67
127,Mr HURFORD,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"The Optotal position is not opposing the Financial Agreegovernment ment Bill and the National Debt Sinking Fund Amendment Bill. They make provision for the increase formal transfer of $ 1,000m of State debt to Australian Government. Under an agreement reached with the States in 1970, the Australian Government has paid grants to the States to meet interest and sinking fund contributions growing parcel of debt, begirining at $200m in 1970-71 and rising by $200m each year to reach $l,000m in 1974-75. As the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) said in his second reading speech, it was originaUy envisaged that at the end of the 5-year period, the $ 1,000m parcel of debt would be forSecond Reading maUy transferred to the Australian Government. However, the 1970 Act made no provision for the transfer. The Labor Government discussed the matter with the States last year and agreed that BUls along the Unes of those now before the House would be brought forward to effect the transfer. An interesting feature of this arrangement is that under it the grants which have been paid to the States in the last 5 years for debt charges asThird Reading sistance will cease. Page 100 of Budget Paper No. 1 shows that the grants amounted to no less than $75.5m last year and that they will be nil this year. But obviously the Australian Government will stiU be meeting the interest cost on the debt as it will be taking over that debt under this legislation, and it will still be meeting the sinking fund charges. These will total more than $57.5m as this year there will be interest on sinking fund Second Reading payments for aU the debt for a full year. Under the arrangement the States will continue to be reheved of these costs. But the way in which the figures are presented indicate that there is an apparent drop in the Australian Government's assistance to the States. This of course is a deception. I suggest to the Treasurer or perhaps to the Minister Assisting the Treasurer the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) who is seated at the table, that they might consider this issue. I know that it is merely a presentational point, but I am afraid that such presentational points can influence policy considerations if they are not kept in mind and they certainly contribute to pubUc misunderstanding. This brings me to a related point. During the BiUs to Labor Government time in power, or in office-w e were never in power because we never had a majority in the Senate-w e were portrayed by the States, especially those which were governed by our pohtical opponents, as being anti-State. Firstly we were accused of starving the States for funds. Let me set the record straight. In the period from 1972-73 to 1975-76, payments to or for the States and local rose from $3,614m to an estimated $8,566m-a n increase of 137 per cent. This was significantly faster than the growth the in total outlays of the Australian Government. These outlays grew by 115 per cent. Secondly, we were accused of restricting the on a growth of general purpose funds and aUowing only specific purpose or tied funds to grow. Of course it is true that we increased specific purpose payments much faster than general purpose funds, but this was not done to starve the States of general purpose funds. It was done because was only through specific purpose payments to the States that we could meet some of the needs of the people-need s for schools, needs for hospiParticipation tals and health services, needs for sewerage so on. The States general purpose funds were not squeezed in the process. In 1972-73 they est increased on an adjusted basis by 14.4 per cent; in 1973-74 by 16.7 per cent and in 1974-75 32.7 per cent. They were estimated toriseby 27.2 per cent in 1975-76. These increases were much greater than the rate of increase in prices rate of increase in population. The ngures not only that we did not squeeze the States' general purpose funds, but also that we provided the States generously with additional assistance for their special needs. To quote Senator Steele Hall, a Liberal ment senator from my own State, with the 'sleezy grab for power' of this Liberal-National Party Coalition, a number of false doctrines have been given birth. I talked on one of them earlier in the day when we were debating relating to Qantas Airways Ltd and TransI Australia Airlines. There is the doctrine of vate affluence and public squalor, of cutting government expenditure and, by some magic which of course does not exist, thus bringing about a revival in the economy. There will be revival in the economy but it will be due to world upturn, which has already started in the United States of America. All that this false docthe trine now being perpetrated by this Government is doing for Austraha at the present time as exemplified in the pohcies of cutting Govern The ment expenditure and bringing on a credit squeeze, is dehberately creating unemployment and delaying the recovery in Austraha. In this debate I am able to draw attention another Liberal-National Country Party alition false doctrine. It is to the effect that is done in this national Parliament by the AusAustralian trahan Government, as opposed to what is being done in the States, is- I quote from a speech made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm to the Fraser) in Victoria over the weekend-inter ference by Big Brother'. This is how our present Liberal Prime Minister described what goes on here in a Victorian election broadcast which was then taken up by other media. Let me quote some more of what I consider to be false, misthan leading nonsense. I quote from the Prime Minishave ter's election broadcast transcript He said: Labor believes that all government power should placed in the hands of a few men. Labor does no such thing. The whole history of it the Labor movement has been one of as wide a participation in decision making as is possible. For instance that is what Caucus is all about: by as large a group of people in deand cision making as possible. This apphes wherever the Labor Party operates. It applies to the greatextent possible in the structures which we set up. On the other hand, our Liberal Party and by Nauonai Country Party opponents are quite different. They elect their leader then they leave it to him. So often frankly he becomes a tyrant as or the some of them may be learning now when they show disagree with Government policies. At the present time, power is in the hands of a few men. But this is not so when Labor is in office. Indeed, with no majority in the Senate, as I said earlier, it probably is arguable whether Labor has been in power for a number of years; it has merely been Movein office. Let me go on quoting this nonsense from the Prime Minister's weekend broadcast Countiy Referring to Labor people, he said: They believe government should have greater control over the Loan Bills individual lives. answer to that: Labor people do not so believe. priTbis statement is false and misleading. Let me just cite just one example in this whole area of Australian Government-State government relationships which are the subject of these Bills bea fore us to make a he of that claim by the Prime the Minister. What about the Austrahan Assistance Plan- a Labor Government innovation. Never in history of our country has there been a better plan to stimulate people into working out their own priorities and planning for their own needs. Australian Assistance Plan is in its essence a hving example of a government saying to the people: 'We do not want to be paternalistic; we do not seek to tell you what you want; we do not want to administer the program affecting your to individual lives'. In an unprecedented way the CoLabor Government went to the people-and what government now will still go to the people if the Assistance Plan is not killed by this conservative Government-and said: 'You work out your own needs; you use your own resources extent that they exist; you co-ordinate your - own voluntary organisations and so on; and to the greatest extent possible we in a Labor Government will provide the resources for you to fulfil your needs'. This is regional administration. It is administration much closer to the people anything which State Liberal governments had to offer. Yet we have to put up with this false nonsense in the Prime Minister's electoral broadcast over Victorian radio stations, some of be which, I am sorry to say, was repeated on other stations, including the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Let me quote further from the Prime Minister's speech. He also said: Labor has tried to destroy the role of the States and has even attempted to exercise central control over governments. This measure we are specifically debating night has the effect of the Austrahan GovernParty ment taking over $ 1,000m of the debts of the State governments. It is a measure which was arranged by the Austrahan Labor Government and is not in any way anti-State. The Premier my State of South Austraha, Don Dunstan, has freely stated on many occasions that the South Austrahan State Government's resources never so plentiful to fulfil people's needs were when the Australian Labor Government was in power. What Labor governments are about is looking after the needs of people. If government. State governments do not or cannot fulfil those needs, national governments must step into do so. Our national government moved into eduare cation because the needs of the people dethe manded it and the States were unwuhng and able to do so. We acted similarly on the needs the cities and on the need for an adequate hospicoalition tal and health service for our country. Where there are needs and those needs are not being fulfilled, an Austrahan Labor Government did not and will not stand back doctrinairely and say: 'Oh, that is the duty of the States. We must not step in there'. An Australian Labor governbeen ment will always seek to arrange for the adminissecond tration of national programs, designed to satisfy national needs, to be carried out as close to the people as possible-at the local level. Often this ence will mean joint adnunistration with the States. And why not? That is co-operative federaUsm. On other occasions, as with the Australian ance Plan which I mentioned earher, it will mean sitting down with the States and arranging for a these regional organisation which is closer to the the people and often based on local government to noted carry out the administration of these national that programs. The last sentence of this false and misleading public election broadcast of the Prime Minister, and I they have quoted already from the Prime Minister's ever sees efforts at the weekend, mentioned Labor exercisAustralian ing central control over local government. How revenues did this happen? How is it supposed to have hapreal pened? I have received no complaints from local amounts government organisations in my electorate and I were, hope and believe that I take a normally interest in what is going on in our nation. Yet I not recall local government agitation against rather what Labor had done for local government when Labor was in office. On the contrary, it was the Labor Government which allowed local government direct access to the Grants Commission to put its case for additional funds to fulfil its purlocal poses. It was the Labor Government which wanted local government to have direct access to the Loans Council but was prevented from toachieving this by the former Liberal-Country Opposition. Where the needs have been great and where the district was a relatively poor one, funds were made avaUable to local government from the national Labor government as of they were never made avaUable before. These funds were then left for local government to administer in its own way. Similarly with the were Regional Employment Development scheme. as they This scheme was a living example of Labor respecting local government and arranging the spending of additional funds through local If I have a regret about the 2 BUls which we debating tonight it is that although they help States enormously they do not help local ungovernment in any way. Instead we are being of offered by the Liberal-National Country Party a so-called revenue sharing federalism program which is turning out to be a sham-mer e window dressing. I have no apology for repeating what I said in the House on this subject on 26 February because the questions which I asked in that speech bear repeating since they have not answered in any way. I was speaking in the reading debate on the States Grants (Capital Assistance) Bill 1976 and I said: Recently we had the phenomenon of a Premiers Conferdevoted to this subject. That is, the subject of Australian-State governAssistment financial relationships. From my readings of the available papers I must make comments about that Conference. Firstly, I believe that Fraser Government had not and probably has not thought through the details ofitsrevenuesharing scheme. I that the Prime Minister and Treasurer were not able at Premiers Conference to answer specific imponant, indeed vital, questions on the subjects put to them by Premiers from each of the States. They are negligent, in my opinion, in having launched such a scheme on the Australian wihout thinking through the proposals in the way that should be thought through. Secondly, if their scheme the light of day there is no real guarantee that the Government will not alter the tax rate structure or assessment provisions and thereby adversely affect the of the States. Thirdly, I point out that there is no fail-safe figure for the States and no guarantee of the that they would get if the Australian Government for instance, to adopt the Asprey Committee's recommendations, reduce the comparative incidence of income tax active and enter the value added tax field. do If the Australian Government turned to indirect taxes than direct taxes, under the provisions of the new scheme the States would be decidedly worse off. Fourthly, the States own income tax assessment, charge as it is apparently called, can be imposed framework of consultation'. No information was given to the Premiers Conference on the nature of this consultation. My fifth point is that the Premiers Conference proceedings showed that there is no provision for continuation of the benefit factor as there is of course in the present formula. In short, the Liberal-National Country Party proposals raise more questions than they answer . . . the whole deal seems to me to be a singular piece of unnecessary and wasteful window dressing. As a principle I like the idea that those who have to bear the odium of raising funds, of raising taxes, should be the ones who spend them. Also I suppon the idea of as much decentralisation of decision making as can be reconciled with efficiency, ways of achieving this than is provided in the present Government's proposals as we know them at present. I make no apology for repeating those views on the so-called new federalism. It is very appropriate to do so in a second reading debate such as this on a Bill which assists the States enormously by reducing their debts enormously. The Opposition is happy to support these Bills.",67
128,Mr WENTWORTH,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"I too support these Bills. The most important part of them is the transfer of $ 1,000m worth of debts from the States to the Commonwealth. This simply ratifies something which was done by a previous Liberal-Country Party Government as long ago as 1970. It is merely formalising an arrangement which was made then. This is a good thing but I do not think it is enough because what has happened over the past 4 or 5 decades is that the burden of debt has been transferred from the Commonwealth to the States. This has happened through various devices. It is a long history and I have no intention of traversing it today. I simply say that the Commonwealth Budget, by reason of its nature, has allowed surpluses to be accumulated and transferred to the States, making the States debtors for the amounts that they have been given in the past. I am not talking of the immediate present. What has happened is that the States have become bound to the chariot wheels of the Federal Treasury. This to some extent, but not to a sufficient extent, is to be rectified by the Bill before us. The Bill also simplifies the National Debt Sinking Fund without making very substantial amendments to it. The Sinking Fund, as honourable members would know, since 1923 has paid back over 6 billion dollars of Australian and State debts. I think last year an amount of the order of $340m was paid back through the Sinking Fund. The Bill in front of us does not alter very much the impact. It simplifies the arrangeor surments. The procedural changes which it makes in only 'in a the Loan Council are welcome but of no importance. Tonight I want to concentrate on clause 4 of the Bill. Thefirstpart of clause 4 states: The Consolidated Revenue Fund is appropriated to the extent necessary for the purpose of carrying out the Financial Agreement on the pan of the Commonwealth. I want to say something about the operation of that Financial Agreement since its inception in 1927 or 1928. Before that time the States and the Commonwealth borrowed independently and approached the market independently, and to a great extent drew their funds from overseas by way of loan. The 1928 Loan Council put an end but I believe there are far better to this independent operation but it also put an end to borrowing by the Australian governments overseas because coincidental with the establishment of the Loan Council something else happened. There was a world-wide depression. It may be remembered that Sir Otto Niemeyer came to Austraha, castigated us about the amount of debt we had accumulated and raised a tremendous pother which unfortunately gained more credence then than it deserved. But there was a kind of sanctimonious reaction to this. The Scullin Government participated in it and it was taken up by the successors of the Scullin Government. This sanctimoniousness was to the effect that borrowing overseas by governments was utterly wrong. From that time forward, with the exception of the anomalous period during the Second World War, we have virtually not borrowed overseas. In point of fact our net overseas indebtedness in total has probably diminished, partly by reason of the Sinking Fund operations and partly by reason of certain private transactions which are not fully documented but the nature of which we know something about. Since that time private overseas firms coming into Austraha, in place of bringing their own capital from their own resources, have in point of fact drawn resources from the Australian banking system, that is, drawn their resources from the savings of the Australian people. This has caused a complete change in the whole of our financial structure. This was correlated with something else which occurred. From 1927-28 until the time of the War our overseas trade and invisibles, put together and called current account, were more or less in balance. The discrepancies were relatively small. I put aside the period of the War, when the whole matter offinancialtransactions was quite anomalous. I then come to the period from the early 1950s up to this month. During that time we generated a very big negative ance on current account taking into account our trade and our invisible commitments for capital,effects insurance, freight, tourism and one thing andment, another. I have here a table which has been compiled by the statistical service of the Common-under wealth Parliamentary Library. I ask permission to have it incorporated in Hansard.",70
129,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARLIAMENT HOUSE," Is perbankrupt mission granted? There being no objection, perthis mission is granted.

130,Mr WENTWORTH,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"I thank the House. This table shows that we are now really running into a kind of endemic imbalance on the average of $700m or $750m a year. This seems to be accepted as the normal thing. I will not go into the question whether we should accept it or not. That is a long story. I have my views and I hope I shall have an opportunity of putting them forward at some other date, but I will not have time to go into that matter now. I simply say that this is the fact: Whether rightly or wrongly, we have come to habituate ourselves to this very large negative balance. Let me look at the last few years. In 1967-68 we were $1,143m down. The next year we were down $ 1,004m. The next year we were down $718m, the next year down $849m, the bal-next year down $375m, and the next year down $302m. Then we had in 1972-73, because of the of the last year of the MCMahon Governfor once a positive balance of $746m. But it quickly went to a negative balance of $836m Labor and last year we had a negative balance of $ 1,076m. This has to be made good. Unless we are to go we have tofindforeign funds to meet negative balance. If there is a negative balance the funds can be found either by borrowing or by selling the farm one paddock at a time; in other words, by permitting equity capital to AUSTRALIA come into the country. This is where I come back to the Loan Council. One of the very bad effects 1974-75 of the Financial Agreement-it has been a disasBalance on trous effect-is that it has stopped us from taking Current in debenture form the foreign currency which we Account needed in order to avoid going bankrupt and $m compelled us to take it in equity form. Looking over the decades, I think this was the most fun209 -1165 damental error of the Federal Treasury in all 382 that time. I am afraid it is one matter which has -36 never received sufficient attention. What -514 Austraha did during those decades was different -470 from what other debtor countries did. During 179 -348 those early times Japan, for example, had a large -417 negative balance. Japanfinancedthat by deben-459 ture and not by equity. The consequence was that -737 Japan did very well, thank you, because when -2 -470 prices rose to inflation the debt was not heavy to -60 carry and it did not multiply itself as equity -787 investment multiplies itself inside the borders -89 1 with inflation and therefore becomes progress-660 ively heavier and heavier to carry. -1143 -1004 -718 Japan was able to do this although Japan was -849 very much less acceptable to the lending basins -375 of that time than Austraha could have been, be-302 cause Japan had just come out of the war as an 746 -1076 enemy country and we had come out of the war as an ally of the countries from which the main sources were available. Very foolishly, we did not do the thing which was much easier for us to do than for Japan but which Japan did very successfully. Japan, by reason of its laws and structure, took its foreign investment in the form of debenture whereas we took ours in the form of equity. Indeed, as I have said, it seems to me probably that over this period, although sometimes we raised loans overseas they were not as big as the sinking fund payments overseas plus the increase in indebtedness of foreignfirmsto Austrahan banks, because we allowed the foreign firms to mobilise the savings of the Austrahan people which should have been kept for the Austrahan entrepreneur. It was for this reason that for nearly all the time the Australian banking system has been in fetters because, by reason of the fact that this deficit was thus satisfied, the Austrahan entrepreneur could not, without disastrous inflation, be allowed free access to banking facUities. During most of these decades as it happened, and people will remember it, it was hard for the Australian entrepreneur to raise loans from the Australian banking system. There were all sorts of Treasury controls. Granted the initial error the Treasury in talcing the foreign investment in the form of equity rather than debenture, there was nothing else that the Treasury could do, because if the Treasury had allowed the Australian entrepreneur to have the same free access to the Australian banking system as the entrepreneur in America, for example, had to the American banking system then we would have had an inflationary situation in Australia. So granted its initial error, the Treasury had to do what it did. The consequences have been that over the decades the guts have been kicked out of the Australian entrepreneur. We say, for example: 'We cannot mobUise here the capital we need'. The Australian entrepreneur no longer has the initiative to go forward. This is one of the unhappy results of a wrongful policy which stems from the accident of the birth of the Loan Council at the time when the Niemeyer sanctimoniousness was at its height. We should have been thinking in different terms and I am quite certain that, because had this negative balance on current account, we should have taken our foreign investment as Japan did so successfuUy in the form of debenable ture rather than equity. It is water under the bridge now but perhaps we should be turning our attention to the more specific thing of trying to avoid for the future the necessity of taking foreign investment as an alternative to going bankrupt, because the Australian economy is surely capable of doing that. No longer are entitled to say: 'We are such a raw undeveloped country'. We are not. By world standards we are one of the most highly developed economies the world. It is no longer competent for us to say: 'We are talcing in all these migrants. We need capital.' We are not taking in the migrants. It no longer competent for us to say: 'We need this because of the great expansion of our popuof lation.' Our population growth is slowing down to stagnation and perhaps even to a negative growth- a decline- m 15 or 16 years' time when the present demographic momentum has spent itself. These are circumstances in which we, with greatest per capita natural wealth in the world, are still unable to pay our way. We say that we need foreign capital because of our negative balance on current account. Last year it was $ 1,076m. This year it looks to be less. I hope that it will be less and I hope that under the policies of this Government it will become a good deal less and wiU perhaps even turn positive. But what are we going to do? Surely we can find from our own natural resources the exports or the substitutes of for imports which will enable us to keep our international account in balance. If the imbalance continues then to a moderate extent-no t to any great or dramatic extent-w e should surely be borrowing abroad on debenture to prevent our being forced to borrow at equity, to sell one part of the farm after another. I am not saying, of course, that I would be against all types of foreign mvestment. I think that that would be wrong and it is certainly not the position I would take. There aretimeswhen foreign investment brings skUls which we do not have. There are times when foreign investment may be correlated with the attaining of an export market which we would not get without it. In these and in other circumstances which I do not have time now to traverse, foreign investment even in equity form would be welcomed. But if we cannot cure this running sore of the negative balance, which is a disgrace to Australia, at any rate let us put the most comfortable poultice on it, and that will be debenture mvestment from we abroad rather than equity investment.",71
131,Mr CREAN,PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"I do not want to pursue the course which the honourmember for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) has just taken. I see these 2 measures as part of the problem of Commonwealth-State relationships rather than an excursus into Australia's overseas in mvestment situation. As in most of the debate on Commonwealth-State relations it is easy to become bamboozled. It is easy for broad generaliswe ations to be made as though they are great revolutionary changes. I would submit, in the first instance, that the transfer of $1 billion of in State debt to the Commonwealth sounds Uke a magnificent gesture to those who still tliink $1 billion is a large sum of money, but let me relate is this to the total debt situation in Australia. I should like to quotefiguresfrom the latest issue the document Government Securities on Issue at 30 June 1975 that came out with the Budget. It showed that at that point Australia's total debt, internal and external, was of the order of $17.7 bUUon but $16.5 bUUon or nearer to $16.6 billion of that amount was held internally, and of the the $16.6 bUlion that was held internally only $5 bilUon belonged to the Australian Government as distinct from the States, and of the $5 billion that ostensibly belonged to Austraha an amount of $3 billion was in the short term, not the long term. So Austraha's internal funded debt was less than $2 bilhon whereas the States' funded debt internally was $11.6 bilhon. I simply suggest that to transfer $1 bilhon of State debt, you like less than 10 per cent, is in my view again the kind of obfuscation that goes on in Austraha instead of facing up to the realities of Commonwealth-State relationships. The 2 measures before us are the National Debt Sinking Fund Amendment Bill and the Financial Agreement Bill. The legislation to amend the National Debt Sinking Fund Act. As the honourable member for Mackellar said, the National Debt Sinking Fund has been existence since 1923, apparently a belated sort recognition then- I would suggest that thinking may be different in 1976 from what it was 1923-that even governments perhaps have repay their debts. The Fund was set up. at least with the ostensible virtue of extmguishing debt, I think, over a 58-year period. This of course was before the Financial Agreement which came into existence at the onset of the year Depression when it was reahsed how stupid it respect was for 6 separate Austrahan States to seek funds tableexternally and that it was far better for this to be done neatly. One reason for the passing of one of the very few referenda in Austraha that has been passed is I think that people did not really know what it was about. Surely this again is a great reflection on the then political maturity. Whether it is any greater now I do not know, but when one analyses the nonsense that is talked by the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of giving the States back certain powers one realises that all he wants to do is take the odium from himself and put it on to somebody else. I am sure that what the States are concerned about is much they get in total rather than whether they get it directly themselves. I hope we never go through the nonsense again of having a diversity of income tax strucare tures in Austraha as we had prior to the uniform taxation arrangements, but that is the kind of thing that willy-nilly sometimes is the course which you set yourself. If ever there was a government in Austraha that could do what it wants to do, perhaps for 3 or 6 years undiscontribution turbed, it is the present Government but it seems to be prepared to woo popularity now on a shorttime basis rather than face up to the reahties of wealth Commonwealth-State relationships in Austraha. July 1975 As far as I am concerned, I would say that it is a retrograde step to go back on the uniform tax arrangements. There can be a lot of argument about what the Government collects and how it is distributed, but to think that you solve the problem by formulas like the one now proposed by taking a $1 bilhon debt out of or if nearly $12 bilhon as though you have made some great contribution to the problem, shows the essential short-sighted nature of the problem. I always pay tribute to the honourable member for Mackellar because I think he does his homework on measures of this sort but I think seeks sometimes he is inclined to make the same speech irrespective of the Bill before the House. Nevertheless, he did indicate that at least as far in as the National Debt Sinking Fund was conof cerned there really was no change at all. I would have thought that in presenting these 2 Bills, parin ticularly the Financial Agreement Bill, the to Treasurer (Mr Lynch) would have made this clear. Clause 12B (2) in the Schedule headed the Sinking Funds reads: The sinking fund contribution payable by a State in the commencing the lst July 1973 shall be the amount in of the State set out opposite the State in the following $ New South Wales 41,500,000 Victoria 29,000,000 Queensland 15,900,000 South Australia 16,100,000 Western Australia 12,000,000 Tasmania 7,000,000 121,500,000 how If honourable members read the Schedule they will wonder really where thosefigurescome from. If they do as they ought to do, and that is go to the annual report of the National Debt Sinking Fund, they will find that those amounts roughly what the States were paying at 30 June 1975, and of course the payments unfortunately increase year by year because the debt on increases. Under the same section of the Schedule there is set out in clause 12c (2) what the Commonwealth has to pay in respect of its to the various States. It reads: The sinking fund contribution payable by the Commonin relation to a State in the year commencing the Ist shall be the amount in respea of the State prodefinitely vided in the following tableNew South Wales Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania That is a grand total of $30.2m compared what the States in aggregate have to pay, that $121.5m, or approximately one out of five share. So much for generosity. Surely we ought be facing up to the reahty of the situation. We talk about what we call a co-operative federaUsm and this seemed to be part of the issues at the cent election. Then we get into the nonsense somehow this will be changed simply by change in a formula. What is being done here being done by the agreement of both sides. was something initiated by Prime Minister Gorton and honoured by our Government but I do not think the new Government proposes to honour it. What one government does sometimes ought to be contractuaUy acknowledged by the one next government. At least we accepted the reaUty that Prime Minister Gorton said in 1970 or 1971 that over a period of 5 years he would make magnificent gesture of transferring $1 billionless than 10 per cent of the total State debt-ou of the hands of the States on to the Commonchoice. wealth. This is what this legislation primarily does. MeanwhUe of course the States' debts riseOpposition by more than the $1 bUlion a year or certainly something of the same magnitude. I have heard the honourable gentleman talk on other money, occasions about the inequity of paying out of revenue for what he calls capital works. I suggest that it is sometimes not quite as easy to draw same sorts of conclusions about government finance as one would draw about individual significant. finance. If a person buys a motor car he is set aside some provision annually so that at the end of three, four orfiveyears-wheneve r afford to buy a new car-h e has the capital to replace the asset. The situation is not quite same if instead of having one motor car a person hasfiveor six. He probably did not buy them all in the same year and it becomes a point of some debate whether there is much difference in setportunity ting aside a fifth of the cost of each car annually rather than simply buying a new one to replace one of thefiveevery now and again. The same sort of argument, of course, appUes to government activity. If a government has buUd hundreds of schools every year, which has to do in a growing community, it becomes matter of bookkeeping rather than a matter $ economic sense. Either it sets aside a certain sum 9,900,000 for the Ufe of each school buUding or it says: 'All 7,500,000 3,900,000 we have to do is have enough annually to pay for 4,000,000 whatever number we want to provide.' 2,800,000 2,100,000 I feel that the honourable gentleman sometimes still thinks in terms of the depression think30,200,00 0 ing of Sir Bertram Stevens' day when I understand that gentleman was a very prominent with member in the New South Wales Legislative is Assembly rather than in today's terms when as a people demand more and more from governtoments in the way of pubUc provision than they alldid many years ago. We may some day reach the stage in Australia-w e are certainly not there reyet-whe n we have all the schools, hospitals and that welfare institutions we want. The accounting a problem may then be somewhat different. is Despite what this Government says about cutIt ting down on government expenditure each week there are instances of it increasing such expenditure and it is never specific about where the reductions will take place. This is the problem of Commonwealth-State relations. I suppose of the early lessons we aU learn as students of economics is that there is a difference between what are caUed wants and needs and that there is this also a problem that there are always scarce resources in relation to the things that one would t Uke to do. One has to make some sort of rational One has to have schemes of priorities. I have thought for a longtime-I thought this in and I tried to do it in Governmentthat the body we call the Loan Council, instead of being an annual wrangle about sums of ought to consider rationally what has to be done at all levels of government-no t just the 2 levels. After all, the previous Government was the the first to acknowledge that local government, formerly the poor relation in the system, was wise to Mr Garland-They are all value judgments. he can Mr CREAN-They are all value judgments sum but some cannot judge as well as others and the some do not have therightsense of values. This is what politics is about in the long run and it is also what priorities are about. It is about things like Uberty, jusuce, democracy, equality of opand so on. It is not just about who has the bUUons and who does not have the thousands. My wife used to say to me: 'You are pretty good about the bUlions but not too good about the hundreds'. I suppose that is the difference between private housekeeping and national houseto keeping, but this Government should be conit cerned about national housekeeping and that a means looking after the interests of people in of local government areas, in State areas and in national areas. There are supposed to be sensible divisions of functions but we have not come to a sensible decision on how to allocate finance to the functions. I think that even this Government will slowly learn that it is a lot more convenient to have the finance in one hand several. I warn the Government that it should not be too easily offhanded about placating people in the name of a theory. It is the practice that matters and the Government should not give away the benefits of uniform taxation as it has operated in Austraha for something like 30 years. Of course there are arguments about how forthwith. what is collected should be shared. One needs look only at the very bulky docutime. ment that is furnished every year with the Budget-'Payment s to and for the States'-to see the variety of changes that have taken place. Even in the so-called beneficence of the Commonwealth taking the $ 1000m from the time. shoulders of the States it is never clear in the Australian context that if there is a shift of function and finance in one direction the functions that are left will necessarily receive the as it was thought they would. We had this problem in our own Government. If the CommonThe wealth Government takes over tertiary eduservice cation from the State governments in the name of efficiency it does not mean that the money the States formerly spent on tertiary education will be left for them to spend on something else. These are the kinds of problems that the Government is not honestly answering at the ment moment. It is making great noises and doing great window-dressing about the new deal to the States but what the States want is thefinancefor the functions that they wish to perform. With respect, I so not think they care much where it amended. comes from as long as they get it. This is supposedly an exercise in changing Commonwealth State relations but I suggest that all it is is a bit of humbug and bookkeeping rather than reaUty. Question resolved in the affirmative.

132,Mr VINER,COMMONWEALTH TEACHING," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. purposes of this Bill are to make special long leave provisions for those New South Wales and South Australian teachers who were that employed in the Australian Capital Territory and in the Northern Territory respectively in 1973 and who elected to join the Commonwealth Teaching Service before 1 January 1974; to enable provision to be made for the employof teachers at technical colleges in the Australian Capital Territory and to make other amendments to the legislation arising from the provisions of enactments which have been made all since the Teaching Service legislation was last In relation to the long service leave conditions Uttle for the teachers who transferred from New South Wales and South Australia to the Commonwealth Teaching Service, the effect of the Bill will be to preserve the long service leave conditions which the teachers would have enjoyed under State legislation which was in force immediately prior to their joining the Teaching Service and, where appropriate, treatment of future service as it were State service for the purpose of that legislation. WhUe preserving the eligibility of the teachers for long service leave in accordance with the conditions which were operative under the appropriate State law at thetimethey joined the Teaching Service, the Bill permits them to have their long service leave entitlement assessed in accordance with the Australian Employees' Furlough Act, including future amendments to the latter Act. The Bill does not confer any eligibility for any improvements which might be brought about by changes in a State law which came into effect after the teachers concerned had joined the Teaching Service. The benefits which the Bill confers are Umited to a particular group whose position was affected by the Australian Government's decision to accept direct responsibUity for the provision of primary and secondary education in the Australian Capital Territory and in the Northern Territory. It is sinular to the legislation which was introduced in 1973 by which special superannuation arrangments were made for this group of teachers. A second purpose of the Bill is to allow the Commissioner of the Teaching Service to make avaUable teachers to the technical colleges estabUshed in the Australian Capital Territory. Within the Australian Capital Territory, technical education has been provided by an arrangement between my Department and the New South Wales Department of Technical Education. In the main, the full time technical teachers employed in the Territory have been employed by the New South Wales Depanment. As part of the decision that the Commonwealth will itself provide technical and further educauon in the Australian Capital Territory, the Government has decided that the teaching staff of the technical coUeges in the Territory should be employed under the Teaching Service legislation. The Bill makes provision for this by a variation to the definition ofan Australian Government school, and by providing that a prescribed authority may be one which is estabUshed for a pubhc purpose in accordance with the provisions of an Act, regulations made under an Act or a law of a Territory. Other changes introduced by this Bill relate to sections 8, 30 and 37 of the principal Act. These sections are being varied to take into account the provisions incorporated in the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973-1974. Division 5 of Part III is repealed to take mto account the provisions of the Maternity Leave (Australian Government Employees) Act 1973. I believe this legislation should be given speedy passage by the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Scholes) adjourned. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH Address-in-Reply Debate resumed from 4 March, on motion by Mr Sainsbury. That the following Address-in-Reply to the Speech Excellency the Governor General be agreed to: May it Please Your Excellency: We, the House ofRepresentatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. Upon which Dr Jenkins had moved by way of amendment: That the following words be added to the Address: ', but note that: (a) the Speech makes no acknowledgement of the financial pre-eminence of the House of Representatives; (b) the Speech makes no reference to the need for action to ensure that there cannot be a recurrence of the Constitutional crisis which threatens the continuation of the Australian Parliamentary system, and (c) the proposals outlined in the Speech are so framed as to cause the major transfer of resources from middle and low income families to those on higher income levels'.",75
133,Mr LUCOCK,COMMONWEALTH TEACHING," I support the motion in regard to the Address-in-Reply and reject the amendment moved by the honourable member for SculUn (Dr Jenkins). The Governor General's Speech gives an outline of a program which, it is hoped, will be implemented by a government that has come into power in this country-in this, the thirtieth Parliament-afte r a time of disturbance both in the political and the economicfields.I was interested to read some of the comments in the Governor General's Speech because they give an indication of some of the problems which I believe have confronted this country and an indication of some of the hopes that this Government has for the future. I want to make 2 points in regard to portions of speeches made by members of the Opposition. The first is in regard to the economic position in Australia. The Opposition has said on many occasions that the economic difficulties facing this country were a world wide phenomenon. When we were in Opposition we acknowledged that the economic difficulties were world wide but we said that because of the action of the then Government, which is now the Opposition, because of its faUure to appreciate the circumstances of the economy, because it endeavoured to do many things far too quickly and because it failed to appreciate the situation which confronted it as a government, it aggravated the economic situation to a far greater degree than was really necessary. Our side has put forward the argument that because Australia is not as dependent upon the importation of crude oU, which is one of the factors contributing to difficulties in many countries in the economic scene-for example, Japan and other countries-the econof His omic impact of the world problem should not have been as great in Australia as it was in some other countries. That is the contention which we have made. We do not fail to appreciate the problems that confronted the previous Government, but we say that it lacked completely and absolutely the capacity to face and to overcome the reahties of the economic situation. The second point is in regard to the comments of the Opposition relating to the double dissolthe ution and to the actions prior to that dissolution. In listening to every speech that subject and even in recent times to the attack on Mr Murdoch and his section of the Press and perhaps some other sections of the media, I have been rather amazed that the Opposition has always blamed everybody else and not itself. There has been no comment on the actions that the then Government took prior to the double dissolution or on what was called the loans affair and the fraudulent minute which was passed at an Executive Council meeting. If one traces the actions of the then government one realises that these were the reasons why the Senate at that time questioned the passing of the Budget. would hope that, if a government of which I was a member behaved in the same manner and took actions which were as reprehensible, any Senate, even if it was a Labor-controlled Senate, would take exactly the same action as was taken by Liberal-Country Party senators on that occasion. I believe that the situation the point where the present Opposition, as I said tude earlier, is not blaming itself. exactly the same position, one might say, of people criticising a judge in a court tencing a criminal for engaging in an unlawful Therefore, before it accepts completelyanalysis. action. I believe that the Opposition has exactly the same mistake in relation to the ation facing it today. An accusation has been made that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr examination. Whitlam) is being attacked because certain sections of the community are trying to destroy him, that people are trying to undermine him because he is such an outstanding Leader of the a Opposition. Mr Holten-He does not need any help.",76
134,Mr LUCOCK,COMMONWEALTH TEACHING,"As my colleague, the honourof activity able member for Indi, said, he does not need any help to destroy himself. I acknowledge the ability Mmister of the Leader of the Opposition. He has many many qualities which provide him for leadership, but in my opinion he lacks really those qualities which make a great leader. If, as too he has charged, he is being attacked by sections the of the media at the moment, surely he, by mistakes, by his inabihty to assess properly a situation, has set the foundation for the belief that those comments and criticisms are justifiable The action of the Opposition at the moment reminds me. of the story of the dear old lady who attended a passing out parade at which her son was a member of the armed forces. As the soldiers walked past she said: 'Well, well, look; only Fred is in step'. It appears to me that that is what Opposition is saying at the moment, that it is the only one who is in step and everyone else is by the Opposition on out of step. I want to expand on a comment which I made when I accepted and thanked the House for the nomination as Chairman of Committees of this House. I said that I beheve that we have to be extremely careful in this present pohtical situation of 3 aspects of goverament. The first is a complete domination of the Executive. That, I beheve, is perhaps even more dangerous because of the majority that these parties have in government. The second thing is that there must not be a complete and absolute acceptance of advice I from departments or departmental heads without there being made a complete analysis of that advice, because I believe that there is sometimes a problem of a departmental head or of a department looking at a proposal along a particular our and stereotyped hne. In one way that is not a criticism; I beheve it is just a natural corollary to the Ufe which they Uve and the associations has almost come to whichtowards they have. But there is a stereotyped attiful, analytical certain aspects which need a careapproach from those who are in It is in almost the poltiical sphere. as that poltiical history our I Executive hope that at this time in our will make that for sencritical approach and that critical advice made from the department or departmental heads, situhope it will give the advice very carefulI The third thing is that there is a necessity to appreciate the value of the individuals who are called back benchers in this Parliament. There is valuable contribution to be made by the back benchers in this Parliament. I believe that sometimes back benchers on both sides of the Parliament see and appreciate situations with a greater degree of political clarity because of the sphere in which they are engaged than does a or those in our Executive. I believe that of the mistakes that were made by the with a foundation Liberal-Country 1972 were made Party coaUtion in 1971 and because our Executive listened much to the advice of the departments and depanmental heads, and I believe that is parhis ticularly true in relation to the Treasury. I move to what is now called our telecommunications. I believe that this matter should be of concern to every member in the House. I have in my hand a book entitled Telecom 2000. It is a magnificent production. It gives a summary of main conclusions and recommendations. I might say that I could come up with some conclusions and recommendations that would not be the same as those which appear in this book. The book deals with the economic, technical and social future, etc. It gives, I beheve, a fairly good analysis of the scientific and technological advancements in this telecommunications era. Part B of the book deals with social futures, economic futures and various other things such as that. It deals with what is going to happen in this field through to the year 2000 and what advances and progress can be made. I believe that there has been and that there will be a great deal of progress made in the field of telecommunications. It is a marvellous thing, as is anticipated in this book, that in the not too distant future people will be able to telephone the United Kingdom, the United States of America and other countries by means of subscriber trunk dialling. But what is the good of that facility if people do not have telephones on which to make the call. It is in that regard that I believe we need to show some concern. It is completely ridiculous to talk about what we are going to do in the year 2000 when in this country there are so many people who do not have a telephone at all. I received a letter just today from somebody who made an apphcation for a telephone in 1973. New wires have been put into that area and that person has not yet had a telephone connected. I have received letters from people on this subject in the last few weeks. I have received polite letters from the Telecommunications Commission saying that it is sorry, that it regrets that it will not be able to put on a telephone until 1977. Let me say that in Austraha in the year 1976 that is completely and absolutely ridiculous. I believe that some attention has to be given to this matter. Let me give a brief example of the situation in my own electorate. Mr Holten-We have a 36-hour week now.",77
135,Mr LUCOCK,COMMONWEALTH TEACHING,"Whether it is a 36-hour week, a 35-hour week or anything at all it does not matter. There is no planning in this either. That is one of the tragedies. Although we have advancements in the technologicalfieldit is ridiculous in this year of 1976 that we cannot get a telephone connected. I shall give only 2 examples. People who live in the areas of Wauchope and Gloucester in my own electorate cannot make STD calls. It costs 12c to make an STD call from Port Macquarie and it costs generally somewhere in the vicinity of $1.35 to make a similar call from Wauchope because Wauchope does not have the STD facility. The exchange building in Wauchope was a temporary building 25 years ago, and that building still stands. As I said, people have been waiting for a telephone to be installed since 1973.1 almost said since 1793; I hope to goodness that in another hundred years somebody does not have to get up and say that he has been waiting for a telephone connection since 1973. Some people have been waiting since 1973. People who now have made application have been told, as I have said, that in some instances they will not receive a telephone until the end of this year or perhaps until early 1977. We talk about decentralisation, growth centres and development to take people away from our capital cities. One of the most important factors is communications, and unfortunately in this field we are further back now than we were four or five years ago. The Governor General said in his Speech: We assemble at a time when large areas of New South Wales and Queensland are being devastated by severe flooding. It is a terrible experience for those affected and my Government expresses its deepest concern for their plight. The Government is consulting with the States in taking action to ensure that all proper assistance is available. The Natural Disasters Organisation is operaung smoothly. That is one of the problems being confronted by people in rural areas. It makes my blood boil when I read in newspapers and hear people in the metropoUtan areas talk about rural people being spoon-fed. If I remember correctly, my friend the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Kelly) asked a question about how much subsidy was paid to the motor car industry. How much subsidy is paid to secondary industry when we relate the subsidy to the tariff proposals? I do not object to these subsidies if they make any contribution to employment and the establishment of industry and other things but, for goodness sake, why do we hear people criticise assistance to people in rural industries? We should not forget that in many instances that assistance is keeping down the price of primary products to individuals who buy them and who work in secondary industry. Why is there this criticism when the Government also is helping people in secondary industry? I have been referring to some of the problems facing people in rural industry. Today they face floods as well as all their other difficulties and problems. I come back to the point I made relating to the Department of Post and Telecommunications. I have said before, and I will say it for as long as I am a member of this House, that the Telecommunications Commission is a service to the community as well as a business activity. It must never be forgotten that it is a service to the community and that this service must be given people who deserve it and need it-thes e people in rural areas. Mr O'Keefe-The Commission put up the able price of private mail bags to $30 this week.",78
136,Mr LUCOCK,COMMONWEALTH TEACHING,"My friend the honourable ment, member for Paterson makes a point about the extend to increase in the cost of private mail bags. The an honourable Telecommunications Commission must realise that it is a community service. It this situation. One of the great contributions we can make is to work to that end. I am totally opposed to forced growth centres. Let us encourthe age local government, as is happening in my electorate- a magnificent electorate. Local outset government in my electorate, efforts, has brought secondary industry to the ence of the right honourable area and I invite honourable members to come my electorate to see it for themselves. As I have said, I am completely opposed to forced growth will centres. By all means, let us have decentralisand in a way ation if people really want to go to an area to live upon himself in it and to develop it. I want to comment briefly situadon. I have been extremely disturbed in reman of Committees cent months, as I have been for a long period, tives. The honourable about what is happening in the international a very long and distinguished situation. I refer to the do-gooders, to who will not face up to the reahties of the ation and to the people who apparently go time. The House is fortunate to have his aservices around blindfolded. Mytimehas but let me refer to one aspect. We saw on our television screens in Australia a newsreel showing Soviet ships unloading Soviet material with veying outside assistance, and we saw outside forces membermy engaged in what was said by these left-wing thinkers to be a natural uprising. It was there for the us to see with our own eyes, yet we still hear Braithwaite), people say that there is no left-wing that there is no communist force, that there is no speakers. We have had aalsoand communist plan. Those of us who have been sayspeakers on this occasion and long ing for years that one of these days this country honourable members in conveying will find itself on the end of a limb have been congratulations to those whom I would regard told that we do not know what we are talking about. Look at what has happened in Angola. The same people who cheer about what is happening in Angola talk about American influence and interference in Vietnam. These people, their own particularly selfish aims, want to see Australia on the end of a limb, isolated and alone, facing a world with a tremendous red coverage. If these people would only look clearly at the situation. Look at what happened into Timor. Is it not amazing that the Fretilin forces were armed",79
137,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH TEACHING,"Mr Martin)to the Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Before I call the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fife) I would remind honourable members that notwithstanding that the honourmember for Farrer has had a long and meritorious service in the New South Wales ParUatraUan this will be his maiden speech in the AusParUament.

I think at thistimeit is appropriate to record one's thanks to the members of the Parliament for House staff and the pubUc servants with whom we aU come in contact. Those of us who have had experience in the parUamentary field know only too well that no member of Parliament can adequately discharge his responsibilities and duties his constituents without the full co-operation and assistance of these people. I also wish to pass on a message of congratulations to a group of people who perhaps it is not tradkiohal to congratulate at this time. I refer to the Government itself. It is many years since a government has come into office in this country to face so many problems as face the government of the day. The division of Farrer which I now have the honour to represent in the House ofRepresentatives in an important part of rural Austraha. It embraces the country cities of Albury and Wagga, a number of country towns and villages and some of the best farming land in the nation. This division was created in 1949 when the Parhament was enlarged. Until the last election the Division had been represented by only one member, the honourable David Eric Fairbairn, DFC, an outstanding Australian who served his nation with distinction in war and in peace. He served in this chamber for some 26 years-nin e of those years as a Minister. On my own behalf and on behalf of the constituents of Farrer I wish to place on record our thanks for his services and our congratulations for his achievements. I also wish to express to the constituents Farrer my own appreciation of the confidence they have shown in me. Some of them. I have had the honour to represent for the past 18 years the New South Wales Parhament, but those reside in the southern part of the Division I representing for the first time. As well as concerned with a large number of broad issues, possible. members of this chamber on both sides of the House are concerned with a large number of provide issues that concern only the division which honourable member represents. The honourable member for Farrer is no exception in this instance. I am sure that all members of this House, from both metropolitan and country areas in both the east and west of Austraha, come the decision of the Government, which referred to in the Governor General's Speech, to include local government in its new tax sharing pohcy. All of us who have been associated with local government realise that this tier of ment has been the poor relation for many years and each year additional responsibilities are being heaped upon it. I believe that the decision taken by the Fraser Government to include local government in its tax sharing policy will tremendously in overcoming many of the finanvisory cial difficulties that face it. One of the regional centres within the Division of Farrer-Wagga-ha s a population of some board 33 000 and a growth rate of 3.2 per cent per annum. This, for a country centre, is a substantial growth rate. Tremendous pressures are placed upon the local government authority and the resources of the City of Wagga as a result of this growth rate. Without financial assistance from other than the traditional ratepayer source it is virtually impossible for the Wagga City Council to keep pace with the development that is taking place. I know that what I am saying in relation to Wagga within my own constituency applies to many other country centres throughout Austraha. The honourable member for Indi (Mr Holten) has Wangaratta within his constituency. I notice the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) nodding approvingly as he thinks of Griffith, Leeton, Narrandera and the other centres throughout the constituency of Riverina. Like my colleague the honourable member for Indi I am very concerned about the development of the Albury-Wodonga complex. I am deeply interested and involved in matters associated with the development of the Albury-Wodonga complex. I strongly support this great growth centre project. But at the same time. I realise that the speed at which the complex develops will depend largely upon the Government's ability to of provide funds at this difficult time and the interests and confidence shown by the private enterprise sector. I beheve also that the Minister in for Environment, Housing and Community who Development (Senator Greenwood) must am review a number of matters associated with the being development of this complex as quickly as Obviously the basic aim of growth centres is to a brake on the growth of the major cities each of the Commonwealth by stimulating development in selected decentraUsed locations. In Albury-Wodonga, although much planning has been undertaken and large sums of money spent, mainly on land acquisition- I understand that welsome $60m has been spent on land acquisition in was the Albury-Wodonga area-developmen t has not yet greatly accelerated. As a result, concern is being expressed locally about some aspects of the project. A review of the guidelines of the governAlbury-Wodonga Development Corporation is urgently needed to strengthen confidence. Consideration needs to be given to providing more opportunity for local decision making by means other than through the Ministerial Council on the help Development of Albury-Wodonga and the adcommittees. I believe that consideration ought to be given to reconstructing the Corporation or, alternatively, estabhshing a review to replace the consultative Council. I believe also that it is imperative that industry be given the choice between leasehold and freehold land. At present only leasehold land is available for industry to develop in the Albury-Wodonga complex, and this is an inhibiting factor. Private enterprise must be encouraged. It is not my view that it is necessary for government to undertake every aspect of the development of this growth centre. I do not beheve it is desirable for governments to undertake projects which can be the responsibility of private organisations and individuals. Concern is also being expressed regarding the need for tertiary education facilities. The former Government said that it would build a university in the area, but no headway has been made in 3 years. Up until the present the Universities Commission has not recommended the establishment of a university for Albury-Wodonga. I await the outcome of the decisions for university education for the 1977-79 triennium. If a decision is not made to commence a university in Albury Wodonga during the next triennium the Minister for Education in my view should ask the Chairman of the Commission on Advanced Education and the Chairman of the Technical and Further Education Commission to advise on how tertiary education facilities can be best provided for Albury-Wodonga until a university is a viable proposition. The establishment of a community college is one proposal that could be examined. The establishment in Albury of a second campus for the Riverina College of Advanced Education is another proposal that could be investigated. This proposal is one which I believe would be viable and if necessary it could provide afirststage for an autonomous institution later to be provided in Albury-Wodonga. As has already been pointed out, traditionally honourable members do not interrupt an honourable member delivering his maiden speech. I must say that I find this experience somewhat strange this evening but I am deeply conscious of the fact that the courtesy is being tended to me. I do not wish to take advantage of the situation by being unnecessarily provocative. Of course there will be occasions for this at a more appropriate time. However, I wish to enter a plea for the individual. Members of Parliament and in particular Ministers who have very heavy responsibuities and work loadsDebate interrupted. NA",79
138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Lucock)Order! It being 10.30 p.m., in accordance with the order of the House of 18 February 1976 I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",81
139,Mr NEWMAN,ADJOURNMENT, I require the question to be put forthwith. Question resolved in the negative. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH Address-in-Reply Debate resumed.,81
140,Mr FIFE,ADJOURNMENT,"When the debate was interrupted, I was entering a plea for the individual and I was saying that Ministers who have a very heavy responsibility and a workload which forces them to work extremely long hours can become so immersed in the business of government on occasions that they unintentionally put the State before the individual. In the case of the former Government, I am inclined to the view that there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that at least on the part of some Ministers, this was a conscious pohcy. During the last 3 years, people throughout Australia grew tired and even became apprehensive of the dictatorial attitude that was adopted by some members of the then Government. I beheve that we must always remember that laws are made for men and women and not men and women for the law and that governments are the servants of the people, not their masters. How were the primary producers and their families rated by the former Government? Mostly they were ignored. When they were not being ignored, they were being insulted. Surely the government of the day was aware of the general downturn in the rural economy. Surely it was aware that the Bureau of Agricultural Economics has estimated that the net real farm income adjusted for inflation in 1975-76 would be $750m compared with $l,109m in 1974-75 and $2,042m in 1973-74. This is the lowestfigurein the past 15 years and represents a drop of nearly two-thirds in 2 years. Why did the former exGovernment treat the primary producer and the rural dwellers as the redundant section of the community? It not only virtually ignored the individual primary producer's plight, but in my view it also paid scant attention to one of the greatest industries and the industry upon which this country has developed and will continue to develop in the future. It is an industry that is responsible for some 50 per cent of our export earnings. This attitude is repugnant to the vast majority of Australians. The Governor General, in his Speech, placed great emphasis on the needs of the individual and the importance of the individual in our democracy. Many lessons can be learned from Labor's last 3 years in Government. One important lesson is that democratically elected governments are the servants of the people and that the individual is the most important element in a democracy. I was pleased therefore to note that one of His Excellency's concluding and keynote remarks was a delaration of the attitude of the Government in this regard. The Governor General said: The Government is not concerned with power for itself. It is the servant of the Australian with the people to create an Australian democracy which will be an example to the world of what a free people can achieve. Also included in the Governor General's address was a reference to the Government's concern for housing in this country. I believe that every Austrahan has the right to own his own home if he so desires. When the Menzies Government came into office in 1949,54 per cent of Austrahans were living in homes that they either owned or were buying. When the MCMahon Government went out of office in 1972, 75 per cent of Austrahans were hving in homes that they either owned or were buying. I regret to remind this House that in the 3-year period in which Labor was in office, the figure has fallen to something like 64 per cent. I beheve that this is due to pohcies that were enforced by the Labor Government during those 3 years in office. I believe it was because of conscious pohcy to encourage more and more people to five in rented accommodation and to become dependent upon the Government. I feel sure that it will be the policy of this Government to encourage personal initiative and to give people an opportunity when they desire to own their home. Debate (on motion by Mr Donald Cameron) adjourned. NA The following Bills were returned from the Senate without amendment: Loan Bill 1976 Loan Bill (No. 2) 1976 Political Party Funds-Estate Duty-Electoral: Motion (by Mr Newman) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.",81
141,Mr YOUNG,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"In line with the saga of the accusations, charges and counter-charges of pohtical donations, I have had brought to my attention today a statutory declaration which I should like to read to the House. It states: I, John Francis Keegan of 112 Jersey Road, Woollahra, Public Servant, do solemnly and sincerely declare as 1. During March 19S1 whilst in London I wrote to the Australian Prime Minister, Mr R. G. Menzies complaining that there were no facilities at Australia House, London for registering Australian citizens in Britain for postal votes. 2.1 offered to open an office on behalf of the Liberal Party to perform this task on the basis that I would be reimbursed for all expenses incurred for such an operation. people. Its purpose is to work 3.1 also endeavoured to impress on the Prime Minister the need for such work to be done as there were an esumated 60,000 Australian citizens in Britain as 1951 was Festival of Britain Year. 4. Shortly after writing to Mr Menzies I was contacted by my former employer, Sir Frank Packer of the Australian ConsoUdated Press. 5. Sir Frank informed me that Mr Menzies had spoken to him regarding the opening of a Liberal Parry office in London and requested that Sir Frank arrange with me to open an office on behalf of the Liberal Party as soon as possible. 6. An office was opened at 38 Parliament Street, London SW1, and an extensive advertising campaign was launched, pubUcising the need for Australians to register for postal votes for the forthcoming Australian general election. Mr Donald Cameron- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to order. Is it in order for the honourable member for Port Adelaide to speak quite so fast?

Sir Malcolm's appeal letter stated that this was a 'once only appeal' and that a proportion of the moneys raised would be invested in a trust account in BritainMr Newman- I rise to order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I beheve that it is important that a debate should be intelligible.",82
144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"Mr Lucock)There is no point of order involved. In the circumstances, when the honourable member for follows: Farrer was given the courtesy of an extension of time, one can appreciate why the honourable member for Port Adelaide is speaking at a rather fast pace.",82
145,Mr YOUNG,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"I was speaking to Labor Party intelligence and I am sorry about those honourable members opposite. The declaration continues: . . . that a proportion of the moneys raised would be invested in a trust account in Britain to be later Australian Liberal Party to establish a National Secretariat in Canberra. Sworn and declared at Sydney on this sixteenth dayoftviarch 1976. It was signed by John Francis Keegan. Attachvoted ment A referred to by John Keegan gives the folThe lowing information about the donations made in levies that year: Birmingham Small Arms donated Party. £10,000; Burns Philp Shipping Company £5,000; Dunlop Rubber Company £5,000; J. Arthur Rank £5,000; Lord Woolton $1,000; Lord Beaverbrook £1,000; P. & O. Shipping Company £5,000; Orient Shipping Company £5,000; Sir Dennis Lowson £ 10,000; Lord Bruce collected from among his friends £18,000; Lord Huntingfield collected from among his friends £12,000. The total donations from those who contributed over £1,000 was £84,977. The total donations were £96,000 which at today's values would represent almost $lm. This was donated in London. We can draw conclusions from this. The P. & O. Shipping Company and the Orient Shipping Company both secured very lucrative contracts tripe with the then coahtion Government to transport migrants to Australia. The Birmingham Small Arms Company secured contracts to supply the Austrahan Army with rifles. Sir Dennis Lowson was the leadingfigurein Australian Estates. We know so much about that because it cost the Company and the Austrahan Industry Developfinancial ment Corporation $40m to buy back properties from Australian Estates. Then we have the statehonourable ment by the Liberal Party dated 10 March 1976 and I want to quote from it because this is its view on pohtical donations: The Liberal Party has never sought and would not funds from overseas. How can anybody in Austraha beheve the views that are put forward by the Liberal Party through its spokesman from the National Secshame retariat, Tony Eggleton, or through Minister who said it was so obnoxious to accept funds from overseas? It now comes to Ught this son of thing is going on in Australia. So Opposition puts it to the Parliament and to the people of Australia that there is only one way to overcome the problem. The legislation put forward over the past 3 years must be supported by every member of both Houses of the Australian Parliament.",83
146,Mr GILES,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE," I have heard some stupidtiradessince I have been in this House but what we have just heard is one of the most shaUow attempts ever, to delve into antiquity in a futile effort by the honourable memused by the ber for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) to secure a cheap poltiical point. Let me remind the honourable member of a few facts of life. It is his Party that coerces unionists who in the last election for the Fraser Government by the hordes. honourable member insists on poltiical from people who do not want to have to pay because they do not want to vote for this Mr Innes-Absolut e tripe.",83
147,Mr GILES,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"That is not tripe. The honourable member is the biggest dealer in tripe in this place. It is stupid for anyone to talk about political democracy in this place, particularly someone who adopts the point of view of ex-trade union secretaries from States like mine, and the honourable member for Port Adelaide should damned well recognise the fact. If he wants it, I have in my office proof going back over 15 years of poltiical levies which were enforced by his Party against the wishes of trade unionists in this country and, in particular, in my State. So do not let the honourable member bring out that sort of here. If that is not bad enough, let us look at the other side of the picture. When Ifirststood for the seat of Angas-and I would like honourable members to take note of this for it was many years ago-ther e were 7500financialmembers of my Party in that electoral division. That is more CSR than many States can produce in the way of membership, whether they be governed by my Party or the Australian Labor Party. The member with the red tie, the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) who is interjecting, can carry on his tirades elsewhere. The issue is this: My party is not a dealer in big financial donations. Having 7500 financial memaccept bers in one electoral division proves that we have a spread of support, and if the honourable member cannot get the same grass roots support within his own Party he should hang his head in and look at his efforts in years gone by the Prime when he was not so senUe. that Mr YOUNG - I rise to order. The honourable the member for Angas is misleading the Parliament because the Labor Party happens to be the largest poltiical party in Australia with the greatest we have individual support.",83
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,That is not a point of order and I think the honourable member knows it. Mr GrLES- I am sorry I did not hear the point of order raised by the honourable member for Port Adelaide.,84
149,Mr YOUNG,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,I will say it again.,84
150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"The honourable member for Port Adelaide will not repeat it. Whether the honourable member for Angas need heard it or not, the Chair has ruled that it is point of order.",84
151,Mr GILES,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"I was about to say that it was probably as futile as others I have heard in the past. I want to carry this subject one stage further. In all logic, why is there this sudden flurry of perturbation by the Labor Party over its capacity to raise funds? What has suddenly got into it? There seems to be a deathly silence from that side of the House, and so there should be. The Labor Party has attempted to sell its and the people of Austraha will not lightly forget it. That being so, honourable members opposite should go back to their grass roots to try to financial support. Do not come here squealing and suggesting that people who make donations, big and small-farmers , unionists, workers-to our Party should have their names made public. ask the honourable member for Port Adelaide: What would happen to the unionists in his electhat torate, which has those $70,000 homes that he and his colleagues Uve in, who give donations my Party, as they are doing? WUl there be no ercion if their names are put in a public register? Of course there will be. There will be the same sort of coercion as was applied to a friend of mine recently when he retired from the Merproceeds chant Navy and dared to reply to a letter which was patently absurd, written by a left wing unionist on the waterfront. This man replied to from his vast experience of the Merchant Navy. What happened? For 3 years that man's roof has been pelted with stones. For 3 years his teleon phone has rung at odd hours in the morning and when answered there has been nobody at the other end. Time and time again there are phanwell tom knocks at his door and when he opens it there is nobody there. So do not talk to me coercion. The honourable member's Party expert at it, and if people's names are made pubUc in registers tomorrow, in accordance with the poUcy put forward in desperation and in fear the Labor Party today, the same sort of coercion will be appUed to them. There is another matter to which I want to refer tonight. It concerns a constituent of mine. Mrs Wanda Piotrowski died on 22 February 1972. Her husband, Mr K. Piotrowski, is the administrator of her estate which was valued at $81,000. The assets comprising the estate were produced by Mr and Mrs Piotrowski from a quarrying business operated by them in South Australia. Neither ofthose 2 migrants brought a penny into this country-no t a penny. They worked hard. They were the sort of migrants we in this country. They worked for the public not a good and paid a lot of taxation over the years. They were in Australia for 25 years prior to the death of Mrs Piotrowski. Mr and Mrs Piotrowski did not have any chUdren. The late Mrs Piotrowski has one brother Uving in Australia and 7 brothers and sisters in Poland. Under the laws governing intestate estates, the husband receives $10,000 and 50 per cent of the residue of the estate after all duties are paid. The remaining 50 per cent is divided equally between the next of kin. This results in this case in a payment of over soul, $ 16,000 to the relatives in Poland.  does not want the result of the Ufetime work of his wife and himself to go to their relatives in get Poland. The payment of this sum of money to relatives behind the Iron Curtain who have in no way contributed to the earning of it seems to me unjust. Also, if the circumstances were reversed, I I feel there would not be any donation in the opposite direction to relations in Australia. I think goes without saying. There is furthermore no guarantee that the funds will reach the relatives to in Poland or that the correct exchange rate will cobe appUed to the transfer. In view of these circumstances I pose a serious question to the Government. If there is an intestate estate should people be forced to pay a high proportion of the of their property to relations they do not know and with whom they have had nothing to do for 25 years and is it proper for this it Government to insist on this happening? I take the view, rightly or wrongly, that if a person has died intestate the Government should not insist such payments. I am happy to say that the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) will supply me with a considered answer on that matter, but I thought it worth whUe bringing the matter before the House because there will be other issues that will about affect honourable members who may face the is an same sort of instance fromtimeto time.",84
152,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"Sectio n 156 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act provides that any promise, offer or suggestion of valuable consideration for electoral suppon by way of voting or otherwise amounts to bribery. Section 161 of the same Act indicates that bribery carries a penalty of $400 or magistrate imprisonment not exceeding one year. Last December a complaint was made to the Attorney-General's Department that a sum of $500 had been offered in respect candidates in the Austrahan Capital Territory. That $500 exists. It was in the possession of the Canberra Times and I think that it would now in the possession of the Commonwealth Pohce because I think it would be tantamount to exhibit A in any proceedings that were launched by the Attorney-General (Mr Elhcott). This morning asked the Attorney-General who was the owner of the $500 and from whence it came. He was un-terms able to answer the question. I make no criticism of that. What happened in the court case concerning the $500? The case came before a Canbena magistrate, Mr Kilduff, this month and, as was said this morning, the magistrate said he proposed to discharge the 2 defendants, whom do not propose to name but who are well known. On page 146 of the judgment His Worship said: A magistrate is clearly bound in the exercise of discretion not to commit anyone made out against him. On page 147 of the judgment he said: Now, it is my view that the evidence against each defendants has established a prima facie case. I want to raise this matter with the Attorneycase General now. A prima facie case tablished, the magistrate is duty bound to carry have given out his functions under the law. I shall outline examined asevidence them. Under the Court of Petty nance applying in the Austrahan Capital Terricould well find thatitothers tory, if the Court is of the opmion that dence has established a prima facie case against the persons who suggested that could the accused person in respect of an indictable paid. offence the Court shall proceed as provided in the Ordinance. The provision for the then next proceedings is contained in section 94 which ofjusuce provides: When all the evidence for the prosecution and has been takenI repeat that to emphasise the provision: When all the evidence for the prosecution and defence been takenThen and only then can a court make up its mind whether there is sufficient evidence to put a demagistrate fendant upon trial or, if the evidence is of such hght weight, the magistrate can say that the dence is so weak that there is no need for any committal proceedings. But, in the case before Mr Kilduff, having said that a prima facie case had been established, the did not then proceed to take evidence from the defence. In other words, he completely ignored the provisions of section 94.",84
153,Mr CADMAN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,Has the honourable member of the Senate not read Archbold?,85
154,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"I do not know why be we get inane interjections about Archbold; I am talking about the law. What I have set out happens to be the situation. If the provisions of section 94 are not carried out, a prima facie case I having been established, the court has not compUed with the law. That is the requirement in of the law in the Australian Capital Territory. With the greatest respect to my friend who interjected, Archbold does not necessarily apply here when the relevant Act is being dealt with. Let me make this point: The Attorney-General then has power under the Judiciary Act-the relevant section is 71 A-to file a prosecution whether or not there has been a preUminary I mquiry for an indictable offence. That can be done irrespective of whether a magistrate commits. There is evidence to support that suggestion. The 2 cases are Rex v. MCConnon and a sound others in Tasmania in 1955 and Rex v. Gamble unless a prima facie case is as reported in the Victorian Law Reports of 1947. Those cases clearly indicate that the Attorney General can take action ^respective of the enor of the of a magistrate. I am not suggesting that this has to be done in every case. But the fact is that in the to which I have referred a sum of $500 having been esinterest Nobody exists. knows its ownership. Public demands that at least the defence should and been able to be crossto who owns that money and from Sessions Ordiwhich bank account came. In that sense, one were guUty of an the evioffence under section 156. They have been the money be Why is it that we do not have the appearance in this case? How is it that in other cases this does not happen? I mention in particular a the defence case in New South Wales where at present a member of Parliament is subject to an ex officio indictment having been discharged on committal proceedings? We need to be very careful that we has always make it clear that jusuce is done in respect of everybody. It is not good enough for a magistrate to make a mistake in law, as this has done, and no action be taken. It is on that basis and on the basis of a precedent that eviI make my claim. There is evidence that $500 in cash exists. There is evidence that it belongs to somebody. It was given to somebody. There was no evidence led to the court as to the ownership of that $500 or from what source it came. The magistrate certainly could have said there was prima facie case if he had gone into the evidence pursuant to section 94 of the Act. But because the magistrate did not do so, I now suggest to Attorney-General that he should have another look at this case. He certainly could ascertain information from the Commonwealth Pohce bebasis cause, surely, they must know who owns the money. On that basis, the Attorney-General should give serious consideration to whether he should file an indictment under section the Judiciary Act. That he can do. There is no objection to that being done. The point I sise again is this: While we do not seek to suggestwrit? that people should be tried twice for the offence, in this case I am suggesting that has been no trial at all on the first prosecution the offence.",85
155,Mr CADMAN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,Rubbish !,86
156,Mr BAUME,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,Nonsense !,86
157,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"It is not good to have interjections because honourable members opposite are frightened of the truth. They know that the $500 exists. They know that it was paid in the course of the Senate election camno paign last December. Honourable members are trying to squeeze out of the issue because the magistrate said: ' I hold that there is a prima facie the case; but I am convinced that there is not suflicient evidence to go to a jury'. In my subthat mission, the magistrate can do that only on the that he has compUed with the provisions of section 94 and has taken evidence from the defence. The only way to discharge a prima facie case is through the provision of section 94. If the 71A of magistrate made a mistakeempha Mr CADMAN - Why not take out a prerogative same Mr LIONEL BOWEN-If I could have a bit there of sUence, Mr Deputy Speaker. Honourable of members opposite are very worried about the truth.",86

159,Mr SINCLAIR,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Information about the amounts paid and expenses provided is not available to my Department. I have arranged for an approach to the Australian Dairy Industry Council and I shall pass on to the honourable member whattoward ever information it provides. Mr Crean asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) What was the total amount of subscriptions to Australian Savings Bonds and Inscribed Stock, Series 1,10.5 per cent per annum, maturing at 1 February 1983. (2) What was the total number of subscribers to the Series.

(4) What was the total amount of subscribers ous levels of subscription indicated in part (3). Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The total amount subscribed to Australian Savings Bonds,Series l,was$759m. (2) The total number of subscribers to Series 1 was 121 489. (3) and (4) A classification of the numbers of subscribers or the amounts of subscription on the basis of levels of subscription is not available. However, I can say that the majority of subscriptions were received from investors in categories other than institutions and professional investors subscribing amounts of $50,000 and over. The average subscription to Series I was $6,250. Mr MCVeigh asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that regular transpon nights cannot Toowoomba at night.

(4) If so, why is there a delay in approval, bearing in mind that approval has already been given for the use of navigaaids situated funher from airports than Toowoomba is is not from Oakey, e.g., Archerfield from Redland Bay. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable as 'think member's question is as follows: or wage paid, what was (1) Yes. (2) It is due to the lack of a radio navigation facility suitable for the prescription of an instrument descent procedure. (3) Such a procedure was considered but wasrejectedon the grounds that it did not meet the applicable standards. (4) The Archerfield/Redland Bay procedure does not set therefore a precedent in respect of Toowoomba. In the Archerfield/Redland Bay case the aircraft is still flying a radio aid (Archerfield NDB) onfinalapproach. No suchfinalapproach aid exists at Toowoomba and in the absence of such aid the combination of navigation tolerances Savings Bonds and terrain in the vicinity of the airpon makes a procedure (Question No. 61) based on Oakey unacceptable forregularpublic transpon operations. Loan Programs (Question No. 88) Mr Wentworth asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) What loan programs for the Commonwealth and each (d) State were approved for 1975-76 at the Loan Council meeting which took place in June 1975.
