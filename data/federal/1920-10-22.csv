1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 11 a.m., and read prayers. I MOTION OF CENSURE. Debate resumed from 21st October (vide page 5900), on motion by Mr. TUDORThat the Government he censured for their failure to make provision for the payment of 5s. per busliel cash at railway season's wlieat.",19
2,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Wannon-Assistant Minister for Eepatriation) [11.2] When the House adjourned last night, I was reminding honourable members of the financial magnitude of the Commonwealth and State guarantees respecting the coming - wheat harvest. I pointed out that in New South Wales the guarantees aggregated Ss. 2d. per bushel. It must not be forgotten that in addition to the amount guaranteed for the coming harvest, there is to be paid before the termination of the present year dividends on past - Pools, totalling'approximately £1,830,000. the Prime Minister's statement yesterday showed conclusively that the Commonwealth Government is - prepared to use its financial resources and those of the banks to the greatest extent possible. In addition, it is - placing at the service of the wheat-growers the Commonwealth line of steamers, which was a most potent factor in the completion of the sale of wheat already madej and this sale, I venture to pi-edict,-will be found to be the most advantageous that will be made during the present harvest. There is abundant evidence that the Government is determined to honour the guarantee that has beeu given. Although not in the first instance a party to the creation of this year's Pool, the Prime Minister, in fulfilment of a promise that he gave, is doing everything that is reasonably possible to make the Pool a success. Would, however, draw the attention of the House and of the farming community to the fact that in the immediate [240] future the strain upon the financial resources of the Commonwealth will be very great. A very large sum of money will be needed to finance part of the wool clip which will not be readily saleable, and other money will be needed to financethe stock transactions of the men on the land, which are of great magnitude, and to carry on the other enterprises of the country. If we were to devote'the whole of our financial resources to one branch of industry alone, we should be straining them too much in one direction. The wheat-growers have abundant evidence that this Government will not only give effect to its own promises, but will also render all possible assistance to make the sidings for this Wheat Pool a success. I think that on reflection the honor Moloney) will regard his interpretation of the guarantee as an absurd one. Yesterday the most accredited wheat farmer in Victoria, the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) who is the representative here of a farming constituency, and is the wheat growers' representative on the Australian Wheat Board, gate his interpretation of the Prime Minister's promise.  think that the Prime Minister pooled the honourable member for Echuca?",19
3,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"The utterances of the honourable member in this Chamber and elsewhere prove clearly that he cannot be charged, to use his own words, with holding a brief for the Prime Minister. Ou the other hand, we have the interpretation of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart).",19
4,Mr STEWART,Unknown,I gave what is the interpretation placed upon the promise by nine out of ten of the farmers in my constituency.,19
5,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I have not heard thac a vote has been taken to ascertain the views of those farmers so accurately. The pressure for the payment of the maximum dividend is chiefly from New South Wales, which is easily to be understood, because last year there was a complete I failure of crops in that State over 1,250,000 acres. Mr STEWART;-The' y are getting an extra 2s. 6d.",19
6,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Yes ; but what can be paid will depend on the financial position. I foresee difficulties in the New South ""Wales Government paying immediately that 2s. 6d., which, on the estimated 40,000,000 bushel crop, would mean an advance of £5,000,000.",20
7,Mr STEWART,Unknown,The New South Wales Government has not repudiated its promise.,20
8,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I do not suggest would. that; but in the end it will be seen that the Commonwealth Government must mastay terially assist in the payment of that 2s. 6d. The first charge on the wheat in the Pool will be a banker's charge i spect of the first payment of 5s., and New South Wales Government will have to finance on its equity in the wheat. is easy to ask for the immediate payment of obligations; but, as I pointed out last night, on a 130,000,000-bushel crop, after deducting 15,000,000 bushels for seed and fowl food, and otlier uses, the amount quired would be £32,000,000. In addiguaranteed. tion, there would be 8d. per bushel f freight and handling and adminisavailable trative charges, which would aggregate £4,333,900. Then a further advance of 2s. 6d. per bushel on the New South Wales 40,000.000-bushel crop, bring the whole outlay to £41,000,000. That is a staggering amount, in view of the fact that we money to keep all our industries going. Were shipping available to carry away wheat, there would soon be money to for it ; but honourable members know that although there has been a very satisfacwhich tory sale, we should like to see the harvest sold at a much more rapid rate. The farmers owe to the Prime Minister success of the transaction that has already been completed, because it was due to pertinacity with which he pressed the sale, and to the effort he made to - obtain shipping necessary to carry away the wheat. It is difficult, however, to how, within the next few months, £41,000,000 can be found for wheat vances, if , at the same time, sufficient money is to be available for the financing of our other industries, to which I just alluded. Attention has been drawn undertaking. to the fact that restrictions have been placed on overseas trading such as have not been experienced before, which make the task of our financial institutions tremendously difficult. Under these circummember stances the farmers would be unwise to press for the stretching of finance in their the way of favour to a dangerous extent.",20
9,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"Directly the £41,000,000 is paid to the farmers, it will flow through the ordinary channels of trade.",20
10,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I wish I could think that after the money had been paid to the wheat farmers, it would be immediately available for the financing of wool and other transactions. I do not think that it",20
11,Mr STEWART,Unknown,The money will not in the pockets of the wheat-growers.,20
12,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"That is so. But any n reone acquainted with finance knows that the we cannot today undertake commitments involving £41,000,000, and then enter It into other engagements on the assumption that that money will be available within the-course of a few weeks. Therefore, I ask the representatives of the farmers not to press too strongly for the reimmediate payment of the full amount The Prime Minister showed o r yesterday that he is determined to make to the farmers as large a sum as possible. A Conference of those who will have to shoulder great financial burdens in connection with this matter will be would held on Wednesday next, and to commit about the Commonwealth and the other parties to that Conference to definite need figures in advance would, in my judgment, be a most unbusiness-like procedure. the In view of all the circumstances, I ask pay the producers of this country to rely upon the undertaking of the Government, will be honourably fulfilled .",20
13,Mr GBEGORY,Unknown,"Dampier) [11.16]. the - The motion which has been submitted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . the Tudor), affirming that the Government should be censured for their failure to the make provision for the payment of the wheat guarantee, seems to me somewhat say premature. A considerable time must elapse before next season's grain can be adharvested, and I have not hitherto observed any great anxiety on the part of honourable members opposite, to expedite have the fulfilment of the Commonwealth's",20
14,Mr GABB,Unknown,Then the honourable member has not read the notice-paper.,20
15,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The honourable for New England (Mr Hay) has repeatedly asked questions of the Prime Minister, urging that early consideration should be given to this matter, but very l it t l e sympathy with h im has been exhibited by members of the Opposition. Consequently, I am driven to conclude, as the Prime Minister has done, that this motion was merely a political dodge with a view to influencing the electors.  able member going to help the Governhaving ment out of their difficulty again?",20
16,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,I intend to submit an amendment. ,21
17,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,I do not think that the honourable member will like it .  the Government would use the honourable member.,21
18,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,I shall take very good care that the honourable member does not use me.,21
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," Order ! ""Will the honourable ber for Hume cease interjecting? Mr..GREGORY - The honourable memproducer ber will be very dissatisfied when I read my amendment, and I am sure that he same will find it exceedingly difficult to vote against it .  member always gets the Government out vent of a difficulty. He will not hear the for division bells when they ring. Mr GREGORY When the Budget was under consideration in this Chamber, honourable members opposite did not complain of the arrangement which had been made regarding this matter. They were all fairly content, and but motion which has been submitted by their Leader, they would have been quite satisment fied with the explanation which was given by the Prime Minister' yesterday.",21
20,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,There would have been ring. no explanation had L not moved this motion ,21
21,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,There would have been no explanation? Why the Conference was arranged long before ever I - heard of the honourable member's motion.,21
22,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"However , the mothat tion having been brought forward, honan orable members are now afforded an opportunity of impressing upon the Gofinancial vernment the need which exists for assistloans ing the farmers financially in connection with the approaching wheat crop. When one considers the seasons which have [2401- 2 recently been experienced in New South Wales, one is bound to admit that the farmers there have been subjected to a very severe gruelling.",21
23,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"And in Victoria , too.",21
24,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The position is not so bad in Victoria, but in New South Wales the farmers have experienced a honormost disastrous time. The Government given a guarantee in connection with the forthcoming harvest, and having thus induced an enormous area to be put under crop, every effort should be made to provide cash assistance for those who will garner this year's grain. Recognising the difficult position that is occupied by many of our farmers, I am satisfied that not only the Prime Minister, but the Governments of all the wheat producing States, will do everything that is possible to enable a substantial cash deposit to be paid when the wheat is delivered at our railway sidings. Before rememsuming my seat I intend to move an amendment to make the motion readThat the Government, having guaranteed the os. per bushel at sidings for this season's wheat, should arrange for payment of on delivery hy cash and certificates, such certificates to be repayable in such instalments and at such periods as are recommended by the Central Wheat Board, and that in the opinion of this House nothing should be done to prethe producer receiving the export parity all wheat, including whe.it for home consumption.",21
25,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,That is a squib.,21
26,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,In connection with the first portion of my amendment Mr JAMES PAGE : - I am sorry that it is for the like the Farmers party- a dud.  the result of an all-night sitting ? I am afraid that the honourable member will be absent again when the division bells,21
27,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !  member for Dampier looks quite weary.,21
28,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,21
29,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"- I quite recognise honourable members opposite occupy embarrassing position. But after the strain which has been put upon our institutions by ""our huge war",21
30,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,The amendment provides the Government with a threechain road upon which to get away.,21
31,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! I must ask lionorable members to restrain their i m petuosity.,22
32,Mr TTJDOK,Unknown,In the circumstances it is very difficult to do so.,22
33,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,It seems rather strange that almost every Friday-morning we have exhibitions of this kind. I do not know whether it is the result of the strain of the week's sittings. But honourable members must see that it is extremely difficult for the honourable member for Dampier to get in a single sentence without other honourable members interjecting; often in chorus. ask honourable members to desist from that practice.,22
34,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The large sums which have been taken from our financial institutions in connection with our war loans, and the possibility which exists of furthe r large sums being required fro m them, will make it very difficult for the Commonwealth to finance the wheat guarantee, particularly when we ta.ke into consideration the bumper harvest for the coming year. If our farmers were going to reap a very moderate or a poor harvest, it would not be difficult for the Commonwealth to make similar financial provision to that which it made last year. But the different conditions which obtain this year will render that impossible. 1. am sure that the Prime Minister will do all that he can to make available in cash, by way of deposit, the largest sum possible when this' wheat is delivered. I desire that the wheat certificate issued shall be somewhat different from the ordinary wheat certificate; in fact, a Commonwealth security or bond which the producer can take to his bank, and upon which he can obtain an advance up to the 5s. guarantee, should that course be found necessary. This is the only point in connection with the amendment upon which we are at variance with the Government themselves. If the Prime M in ister can accept my amendment, I hope that he will be able to assure us that the certificate which will be issued will be a negotiable asset. The Commonwealth having guaranteed the payment of 5s. per bushel, that amount should be payable at such times and in such amounts as the Central Wheat Board may recommend. Upon that Board, the Commonwealth, the States, and the producers will be represented. It s members will know how the wheat is being sold, and how the cash is coming in , and they will be able to make their recommendations to the Government .accordingly. Personally, I am hopeful that within the short period of three months from the opening of the harvest the total advance of 5s. per bushel will have been paid to the farmers. We know that past Wheat Pools have not"" been administered so satisfactorily as the Assistant Minister (Mr Rodgers) would have us believe. Indeed, the I must operation of the first couple of Pools was anything but satisfactory. The amounts which were paid to our farmers by those Pools were very small Considering the great increase in the cost of production. The figures which were given to me some time ago by the Prime Minister, in answer to a question, show that during 1915-16 the New South Wales farmers received only 4s. lOd. per bushel for their wheat, and this amount was supplied to them in six different advances, extending over a very long period. As a matter of fact, that Pool has not yet been cleaned up. In the year 1916-17 the farmers of New South Wales received only 3s. 3d. per bushel for their wheat, whilst the average sum paid to them over the four periods covered by the Pools amounted only to 4s. 2d. per bushel.",22
35,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,Would they have been better off without the Pool?,22
36,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"That is very problematical. I am doubtful whether the first Pools could have been managed very much worse than they were. However, I do not wish to discuss that phase of the question now. But , in view of the increased cost of labour, of seed wheat, and, indeed; of everything that the farmer requires, it must be admitted that 3s. 3d. per bushel was an absolutely absurd price to pay to the farmers. The Department of Agriculture in the United States of America, in a report which it recently issued, says that the cost of wheat production there has averaged 8s. l i d . per bushel. In New South Wales over the four periods to which I have referred, the average selling price of wheat was 4s. 2d. per bushel, in Victoria it was 4s. 9d. per bushel, in South Australia 4s. 6d. per bushel, and in Western Australia about 43. 6d. per bushel. We know perfectly well that wheat has not been a paying proposition for the farmer during recent years. The Prime Minister himself knows how difficult this proposition has been for the farmers of New South Wales, and I hope, therefore, that some special consideration will be extended to them . As far as the export parity is 1 concerned, the arguments which have been advanced by honourable members opposite, and which have been stressed in resolutions passed by the Trades Hal l party, clearly show that that party desires that the price of wheat ""shall be fixed. Its members wish to average the cost of production, and to fix a reasonable selling price for wheat in this country. I am not going to refer to the disaster which would certainly attend any such procedure, but I should like.to ask honourable members how it would be possible to get at the fair average cost of production. One man secures a 10-bushel crop, while another man gets a 30-bushel crop at exactly the same cost. How would the Labour party pay the man who had harvested only a 10-bushel crop ?",22
37,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,They would need to fix. different prices for different parts of the country.,23
38,Mr GREGOEY,Unknown,"Exactly , the proposition is absurd. Mr BLAKELEY.'-We have to put the honourable member and his party in such a rotten position that they have to compromise with the Government",23
39,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,We have put honourable member3 opposite in such a wretched position that they do not know where they are.,23
40,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,We have forced the Government to recognise their obligations to the farmers.,23
41,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The honourable member and those representing country constituencies, as the result of my amendment, will have to come out into the open.",23
42,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"We have compelled you to come out into the open. Several honourable members ing,",23
43,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown, Order! 1 members to cease these interjections.,23
44,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I do not think I have said one word that should be regarded as offensive to honourable members opposite. They seem to take my proposal somewhat bad-humouredly. Under the amendment which I intend to submit honourable members representing country constituencies will have to come out into the open and say distinctly whether they are prepared to tell the farmers of Australia that they want to fix the price of their produce. I have already pointed out how preposterous it is for the Labour party to say, "" We are going to average the cost of production and to pay for your wheat on that average cost, plus a reasonable profit. "" The proposition is so absurd that I cannot understand why any person with a knowledge of farming pursuits should consider it at all practicable. If we are to go further than that and to say that we shall pay the farmer so much per day in respect of his labour, plus interest on the capital he puts into his industry, he will have no incentive to try to secure a good harvest. He will not take the same trouble as does a farmer who knows that his prospect of securing a good crop depends largely upon his industry and exertion.",23
45,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,That is a grave reflection on the farmers in the honourable member's constituency.,23
46,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I am not going to class my constituents with those of the honourable member, who are quite prepared to down tools for twelve months and live on the .charity of other people. If that sort of thing is wanted all round in Australia, it will be quickly secured by passing such resolutions as are recommended by their association. I want to be very clear and to obtain by means of my amendment an emphatic expression of opinion on the part of this House with regard to the payment of export parity for our wheat. Several honourable members interjecting,",23
47,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I rise to order. It is very rarely that I complain of interjections. I do not object to them while I am speaking, bu t I find it quite impossible, because of the many interjections that are taking place, to follow the honorinterject- able member for Dampier (Mr Gregory). I call your attention, Mr Speaker, to these disorderly interjections. I again ask honourable Mr SPEAKER - The Prime Minister has found it necessary to specially call my attention to the disorderly interjections which, despite my appeals to honourable members to observe the rules of the House, are constantly going on. I desire now to intimate that I shall name the next lionorable member who does not obey the call of the Chair to order. I give this fair warning, since I do not propose to be continually exerting my voice in the effort to prevail over the disorder which, for some unknown reason, seems to arise every now and again. I ask that the honourable member for Dampier be heard in silence.",23
48,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I thank you, Mr . Speaker. It has been exceedingly difficult for me to carry on, and I repeat that 1I have not said a word that should arouse the ire of any honourable member. I can account for these interjections only by the fact that this is Friday morning. I was about to point out when interrupted that the export parity should be determined by the Central Wheat Board, which has to carry on negotiations with different countries. It is its duty to make investigations in regard to all these matters, and must, therefore, have at hand full details to enable it to make sales in different parts of the world. That being so, it should be left to the Central Wheat Board to determine what the export parity shall be. I wish the House to be very insistent in regard to this matter. In the early stages of the war the London parity for wheat was 5s. 2d. per bushel, and it was clearly and definitely understood by the people of Australia, when the Wheat Pool was established, that London parity should be paid for all wheat sold for consumption in Australia.",24
49,Mr RILEV,Unknown,Nonsense !,24
50,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,I would refer the honourable member to the preamble to an Act passed by the Victorian Parliament when the Pool was originated. It sets out that the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth-and we had at that time in powei a Labour Government of which the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) was a member-and the Ministers of Agriculture of the four wheat-producing States of Australia had agreed that the price paid for wheat in Australia should be London parity. The Victorian Parliament was the only State Legislature to pass a measure legalizing the Pool.,24
51,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The Board was' established on the principle of London parity.,24
52,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,Yes . and that is absolutely confirmed in the Victorian Act to which I refer.,24
53,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,The farmer did not get London parity for his wheat during the war period.,24
54,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"No . In consequence of certain industrial troubles which took place in Victoria, while the then Prime Minister was in the Old Country, the Acting Prime Minister, Senator Pearce, on behalf of the Government, of which the present Leader of the Opposition was a member, reduced the price of wheat for local consumption from 5s. 2d. per bushel, which was London parity, to 4s. 9d. per bushel. That was a clear departure from the pledge which had been made, and a robbery from the farmer of 5d. per bushel. We must have no more of that sort"" of thing. The Prime Minister was quite emphatic in stating that export parity should be paid for wheat. I wish, however, to be perfectly fair. If wheat becomes so dear that difficult}' arises here I have no objection to the Government entering into purchasing wheat for local consumption, and selling it below London price. If a cheap loaf is to be given to the people, who should pay for it ? Should one section of the community alone pay for the concession? It is not f a ir that the farmer alone should be called upon to provide for the giving of a cheap loaf for the Etheeople. I , therefore, say that the price ere should be ex,port parity, but that Government of the Commonwealth or of any State should be free to purchase wheat for local consumption, and sell it at a lower price. W h at does this huge population of Melbourne, comprising agents, doctors, and many other professional men, earning large incomes, pay for its bread ? Why should they be provided, at the expense of the farmers, with a cheaper loaf than the rest of the world? Why should the farmer be compelled to sell his produce below ths world's value?",24
55,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Then , why do not the farmers control the whole marketing"" of their wheat without the intervention of a Pool ? AVhy not let them do the whole of the wbrk themselves ? Why are the Government taking up the work for them?",24
56,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"We are quite prepared to do this work ourselves; but when the war started it was realized that tliere were difficulties in the way of marketing our products, and that it was absolutely essential that we should increase our production. Some honourable members may not be aware of it , but we are approaching a very dangerous condition, financially and otherwise, in this country. Our only hope is to increase primary production-to encourage people to go into the back country, and build up our primary industries. Unless that is done w« shall have to face very bad times. In the absence of a prosperous community settled on the land, we cannot have prosperity in our cities. If there is no wealth in the country to pay' for what our secondary industries produce, what must be the result? I repeat that the whole future of the Commonwealth depends entirely upon increased production. The Prime Minister realizes this.",24
57,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"He a r , hear! course, he does I",25
58,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The honourable member is aware that I am no great political friend of the Prime Minister, and that there are many political questions on which I am bitterly opposed to him. The Prime Minister knows that perfectly well, and lie knows, also, that this amendment has not been brought forward with his' concurrence. In the circumstances, I feel quite satisfied that the Government will be acting in the interests of the producers and of the whole Commonwealth by accepting my amendment. That all the words after the word "" Government"" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, "" having guaranteed the producer 5s. por bushel at sidings for this season's wheat should arrange for payment of same on delivery by cash and certificates, such certificates to be repayable in sucli instalments and at such periods as recommended by the Central Wlieat Board; and, in the opinion of this House, nothing should be done that will prevent the producer from receiving export parity for all wlieat, including wheat for home consumption.""",25
59,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"West Sydney) [11.45] The motion of the Leader ol the Opposition (Mr Tudor) deals with a very definite subject-matter. It calls upon the Government to fulfil the pledge which was given by the Prime Minister at Bendigo i u his policy sneech-to guarantee a sum of 5s. a bushel at railway sidings for the 1920-21 wheat crop. The ambit of the discussion upon a motion of that sort should be very narrow. should be confined to the meaning of that pledge, and the question of whether it has been carried out. What does the pledge mean? What is the meaning of the plain words that were used by the Prime Minister ? What is the meaning of the words "" a guarantee of 5s. a bushel at railway sidings for the 1920-21 crop "" i",25
60,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What is your idea of a guarantee ?,25
61,Mr RYAN,Unknown,My idea of a guarantee is that it means what it says. It is a guarantee of 5s. a bushel at railway sidings. ,25
62,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"That is, on delivery at railway sidings. It can mean nothing else. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) has .taken it upon himself to give an explanation of the meaning of Of "" guarantee."" He says a guarantee does not mean a payment, but that it is an undertaking by some one else to make good a payment. Supposing I go that far with him. Accepting his meaning of a guarantee, then, it is a guarantee to do what? It is a guarantee to make good a payment of 5s. a bushel at railway sidings if some one else does not pay it . If the farmer can get 5s. a bushel in cash on delivery at railway sidings from some one else, there is no necessity for the Government to pay the 5s., but if the farmer cannot get 5s. in cash per bushel I move- at railway sidings, then the Government's guarantee comes in , and the Government have to pay the 5s. in cash. That is the plain meaning of the pledge, accepting the definition given by the honourable member for Flinders. If you give a guarantee, it is a guarantee to do something definite, and, in this particular case, the Prime Minister set out a definite thing that he guaranteed to do. Does any honourable member sitting opposite believe that, if some private company guaranteed to a particular farmer that he would get 5s. per bushel at the railway siding, the company would not be bound to pay the cash on delivery at the railway siding if some one else did not pay it?",25
63,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Thos e words, "" at railway sidings,"" meant that there would be no deduction for freight.",25
64,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"The words are plain English words. Honourable members op1 posite are in this position, that they can It really either accept the plain English meaning of those words, or go into these technical explanations and excuses in order to justify thsm in not carrying out tha pledge which they solemnly gave to the farmers. If the Government found that they were unable to carry out their guarantee, the f a ir and proper course for them to take would be to come down here and say so. They could say, "" The financial position has so developed that we are not able to carry out the pledge or guarantee which we gave to the farmers.""",25
65,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,If we would you withdraw this motion ?,26
66,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"I should be inclined to reply that then we should want a Government in power which could so manage the financial situation as to be able to carry out the pledge. I think so, because the party which is led by my honourable friend, the honourable member for Y a r r a , gave the same pledge to the farmers of this country when we were seeking support at the recent election. A guarantee was given that 5s. per bushel would be paid at railway sidings. We know what it meant. I know what I meant when I was referring to it , and I know what the honourable member for Yarra meant. We meant a payment of 5s. in cash at railway sidings, and, therefore, in moving this motion we are not only seeking to condemn the Government for their failure to carry out the pledge which they gave, but we are also endeavouring to give effect to the policy and programme which we put before the country when we sought to be returned to power.",26
67,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,This wheat payment should not be a party question.,26
68,Mr RYAN,Unknown,It is not a party question.,26
69,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Very, the honourable member indicate some source from which the whole of this money can be found 1",26
70,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"The doctor prescribes when he is sent for. If our honourable friends opposite are not able to carry out their pledge, then they should hand over the reins to the party who went to the country with the same pledge, and who say that they can carry it out. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr . Lazzarini) gave a very simple explanation O'f how the matter could be met. He showed how credits could be given on the Commonwealth Bank in different parts of Australia in order to enable the payments to be made.",26
71,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Does the honourable member endorse the suggestion of the honourable member for Werriwa?,26
72,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"Yes , I think it is a very wise proposal. I have no hesitation in saying that it, commends itself to me, and I am glad to have the opportunity of in dorsing it . What answer do the Government make to the charge levelled did that, against them by the Leader of the Opposition ? It is a definite charge, dealing with a definite subject-matter, and there has been a definite intimation that the Government do not intend to carry out their pledge. The answer of the Government comes first from the Prime Minister, and then from his colleague, the 1 Assistant Minister (Mr Rodgers), and then from some honourable members sitting behind them. First of all, they seek to avoid the issue. A red herring is drawn across the trail. Misrepresentation is indulged in by the Prime Minister with regard to what supporters of this party have said in the dim and distant past. He makes no reference to the programme that was placed before the elec. tors of Australia by this party at the last Federal election; but he makes statements, which I have no hesitation in calling misrepresentations, not only with regard to the doings and sayings of certain persons who supported this party, but also with regard to the doings of the Labour Government of Queensland. He read out a string of things which, I think, came fro m some Nationalist question of pamphlet-at any rate, they sounded uncommonly like it-thing s which had no foundation in fact, and which, in any event, had no> relevancy to the subject matter of the discussion in this House. well. Will That is the Prime Minister's first line of to UF attack. He then says that this motion is premature, and he is supported in that by some of his followers. They say to us, "" Y o u have come too soon."" Too soon, although representatives of the farmers have been meeting, not only in New South Wales, but in other parts of Australia, complaining that the Government are not going to carry out their .pledge, and calling upon them to carry it out! The Government say that next week, if we wait until then,' they are going to have a conference, and then they may carry out their pledge. That is their second line of defence. The next thing they say i6 that although a payment was made in cash for the last crop it was made because the crop was only a littlft v one. That is the attitude of the Government. It is an attitude which I would expect from them. It is clear evidence that the Prim ^ Minister is still going on with, what the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) called his manoeuvring and blundering. It is the same kind of tactics as the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt ) referred to here on Wednesday, as ""backing and filling."" The Prime Minister also obtained support from a quarter where I would expect him to obtain it . The honourable member for FlindersFlinders-lane-come s to the rescue. F l i nders-lane is the place where the lionorable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson) said that the profiteers could be shot with a short-range gun from an upstairs window of Parliament House. I am not making any personal reference to the honourable member for Flinders in quoting that saying, but it is remarkable that support for the Government in this matter comes from Flinders-lane. Flinders-lane interprets the guarantee, and declares that it is going to vote with the Government. Of course, it is. That is what I would expect. In fact, we all expected it . The middleman Government is naturally supported by Flinders-lane in going back on a solemn pledge made to the people of Australia to pay this amount to the farmers at railway sidings. It is an actual going back upon the policy that the Government put before the country, and that was approved by the country. What is the attitude of our honourable friends in the Country party ? They were sent here-o r no doubt the people who sent them here thought they were returning - them for that purpose-in order specially to represent the interests of country districts, and to be the special representatives of the farmers. What are they going to do? So far, with one exceptiona notable exception, and I give the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr . Stewart) credit for the stand he has taken - the y are all making excuses for the Government. Instead of helping to keep the Government up to the collar in the matter of carrying out their pledge, they have spent their time in finding excuses for the Government. They explain that the guarantee does not mean what it says. They say they did not understand it to mean that. I wonder what the farmers will think of that attitude. Should they not be the honourable members who, above all others, if they are true to their name and to the principles which they profess, should be demanding from the Government that they carry out that pledge? But they are not doing it .",26
73,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,What is wrong with our amendment ?,27
74,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"I admit, of course, that there are some who have not yet spoken. I will show the honourable member in a few minutes what is wrong with the amendment. There is something materially wrong with it , and I am astonished that the Country party should have been so misguided as to bring forward the proposal that has been tabled by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory). It is an amendment which actually proposes to excuse the Government from carrying out their pledge. Instead of asking the Government to carry it out, and instead of waiting for the conference next week, which the Government have told us might result in their paying 5s. in cash, the Country party want to say beforehand "" pay 3d. in cash and 4s. 9d. in bonds; pay what you like in cash, and the rest in bonds."" They are actually opening the door for the Government to walk oufc^ Could there be a more lamentable exhibition of a party failing in the d u t y which those who elected them sent themhere to perform? If this amendment is : carried, the Government are excused by this House from the carrying out of their pledge. They are invited not to pay cash. They are invited to give certificates. I do not know how much cash may be included in the amendment, but at all events, if carried, it would be an affirmation by the House that the Government were excused fro m their pledge, and that the so-called Country party had interpreted that pledge as meaning not cash, but "" some cash and sdme certificates."" What else does it mean?",27
75,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,We have a very good idea.,27
76,Mr RYAN,Unknown,The honourable member would have been well advised to r e f r a in from moving that amendment.,27
77,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Don' t you think the Leader of the Opposition, who was interested in the 1915-16 Pool, should have considered this matter a little earlier?",27
78,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"I am quite satisfied that the Leader of the Opposition did his duty in whatever capacity he held. Ifc has been perfectly plain to every honourable member who has been following what has taken place in this House, that the Corner party-the Country party-hel d a meeting while this debate was in progress, and evidently fearing that their true attitude would be exposed in the country, they withdrew to find a way out. The "" m o u n t a in "" has brought for t h a "" mouse "" by the effort of the honourable member for Dampier. We have observed him passing to and f r o amongst the Government representatives, discussing the matter and endeavouring to find a way out for the Government, and let the farmer down. All this tacking on about the world's parity is so much camouflage; the real purpose of the amendment is to defeat the motion of the Leader of the Opposition. What does that honourable gentleman ask? He asks that the Government shall honour its pledge to pay 5s. per bushel to the farmers on delivery at the railway siding, and he asks nothing more.",27
79,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"Yes , he for a change of Government.",28
80,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"All the Leader of - the Opposition asks is that the Government pledge shall be carried out. The Corner party could support this motion if they so desired, and there is no need whatever for this camouflage about the world's parity. I am satisfied that the farmers of this country are intelligent enough to understand the real purpose of the amendment. The public are no fools, and they will readily see that the real purpose is to defeat the attempt that is being made by the Labour party, on behalf of the farmers of Australia, to have this pledge honoured.",28
81,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"An attempt to defeat the proposition to inflate the note issue by £30,000,000 or £40,000,000. Mr RYiAN - There is no proposition to inflate the note issue.",28
82,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes , there is.",28
83,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"I am referring to the proposal of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini), who Sid not suggest there should be any inflation of the note issue.",28
84,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Of course, he did.",28
85,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"This lamentable amendment is only what one might have expected. Of all the explanations about - this guarantee, the least logical have cpme from our friends in the Corner party. The honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) is able to work the matter out so as to make it appear that the guarantee means 3s. per bushel at the railway siding-that it might mean 3s. I can understand the special pleading of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) about a guarantee. I used to understand that a guarantee was signed as a matter of form, and paid as a matter of course; but the honourable member for Flinders has a technical explanation. The Government supporters also have a certain explanation, but the honourable member for Echuca tells us that 5s. at the railway siding may mean 3s. at the railway siding. I do not know how he arrives at that conclusion.",28
86,Mr HILL,Unknown,I did not say any such thing.,28
87,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"I shall be sorry to misrepresent the honourable member, but I do recollect him saying that the guarantee might mean ""3s. per bushel at the railway siding. asks",28
88,Mr HILL,Unknown,"AV h at I said was that the guarantee, in regard to country stations, was not a promise to pay 5s. as a first payment.",28
89,Mr RYAN,Unknown,That it might mean 3s. as a first payment ?,28
90,Mr HILL,Unknown,That it might mean the farmers would have to take 3s. as a first payment.,28
91,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"That is an explanation that I fail to apprehend. I understand "" 5 s . "" to mean 5s., and "" r a i l w a y siding "" to mean railway siding.",28
92,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"It did not mean that under the scheme of the Leader of the Opposition, and it does not mean that now.",28
93,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"In this House we have the Government party, the Country party, and the Labour party. What is the attitude of the Labour party ? In submitting this motion we are standing for the policy which we put before the country; and it is well that that should be understood. This is no attempt to make political capital, but an attempt to carry out the programme we placed before the electors at the end of 19.1.9. What do we say in our programme ? I refer to this in order to answer the suggestion that the motion is a mere move to gain political capital. The Leader of the Opposition in his manifesto, saidWe shall stimulate production, and with that object in view we shall guarantee to the producer a return which will secure to him a price for his products that will cover the cost duction, and allow a reasonable margin of profit. Amongst other things we shall, in addition to carrying out existing undertakings,, guarantee to the wheat-growers 5s. per bushel at railway sidings for the 1920-21 harvest, and shall consult with their representatives regarding future crops, with a view to protecting the interests of producer and consumer alike on sound economic lines. That is the same policy that the Leader of the Opposition stands tor today, and it is contained in the motion he has submitted.",28
94,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"He does not "" cash.""",29
95,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"I understand that when we refer to paying any sum of money we refer to cash. If I say that I will give any person £ 5 I do not mean that I will give him a bond, but that I will give him £ 5 in cash, and it is just the same in regard to 5s.",29
96,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,You did not do it .,29
97,Mr RYAN,Unknown,This party is not in power to do it .,29
98,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,But that party was in power.,29
99,Mr RYAN,Unknown,We said that if we were placed in power we would carry out the pledge.,29
100,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is not a party question.,29
101,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"The position is a very dear one. The Government gave that pledge, and the Government have indicated that they do not intend it out; and our friends of the Country party are opening a door to let the Go-' vernment out. Whatever explanations may be made, that fact will remain. When the Conference meets next week, can there be any talk of a cash payment if an amendment of this sort is carried ? The people will say, "" Here are the members of the Country party, whom the farmers sent to this House, expressing themselves as satisfied with bonds."" That is the position, and, as I say, it is a plain one.",29
102,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"What can the Conference do but find the money, and there is only one set of persons can do that.",29
103,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"Of course, the Governpay ment should have the power, but instead of taking up the attitude that they masters of the situation, the Prime Ministhe ter talks about all the resources of the country "" backed by the banks""-backe d by the banks! Is not the country to of prothe superior of the banks ? I can understand the banks being backed by the country, but when we have a Government in power that makes the banks the Government, and talks of the country being backed by the banks, it is readily seen why - the Government are unable to finance. But, after , all, the farmers of this country are now only experiencing what other large sections of the community have experienced .on previous occasions. The Government have, broken pledges, say time and again; and can we complain if they break further pledges ? ' Mr MAXWELL - W it h all their faults, the country would sooner have the Government than honourable members opposite.",29
104,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"W it h all their faults, the Government are preferred by the country because of misrepresentation, and because of an electoral law which was "" f r a m e d up "" to suit the Government purpose. What I am pointing out is that the - Government, although they have broken pledges in the past, are still in power, and their success in breaking previous pledges encourages them to break more. The Government have come to regard pledges as a sort of joke; indeed, the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) is laughing, for he knows that the Government' make pledges full y intending to break them.",29
105,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,What are you to carry going to do about it 1,29
106,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"Unfortunately , we can do nothing about it , except place before the House and the country the real position, in the hope that when the opportunity offers the people will see the error of their ways, and return a Government that will carry out its pledges. Whatever happens next week, the fact will remain that had it not been for the action of the Labour party the Government would have been allowed to break very this pledge without anything being said; and we on this side mvust be credited for bringing the Government "" up to the collar."" If , when the Conference is held next week, the Government are able to a certain amount in cash, the farmers of the country may thank the Labour are party for this motion, which compelled Government to take that step. This is another evidence that the Labour party is the only .party which stands for the in be terests of the producer and the consumer alike* Those two interests are identical, and they are represented in the programme which we put before the country. When the division bells ring we shall have an opportunity to see where honourable members are. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), need not have any fear-h e will have to come into the open, and show the wheat growers of this country what he stands for. The wheat-growers will see by this division that the men they have to look to for support are the miners of Newcastle, the waterside workers along our coasts, and the men in the shearing sheds, whose interests are identical with their own. We shall have accomplished something if we compel the Government to give, at all events, a substantial amount in cashif we show the farmers who are their true friends.",29
107,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) has, deliberately or unknowingly, represented by interjection more than once that in my remarks I advocated the issue of notes to finance the wheat. I advocated nothing of the sort. I pointed out that Sir Joseph Carruthers, in the Legislative Council of New South Wales, advocated thab policy, but that I did not. I advocate a policy altogether different, namely, the extension of the operations of the Common, wealth Bank, and the creation of credit instruments,, by means of cash credits in the bank, to finance the scheme. I object to the Treasurer misrepresenting me.",30
108,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is the same thing, only a little worse.",30
109,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"It is nothing the sort. If the Treasurer desires to dis> cuss the matter, I desire him, when he refers to my arguments, to quote them as I gave them, and not misrepresent me.",30
110,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I accept the honourable member's explanation.,30
111,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Eranklin) [12.15]. - A great deal of this discussion hinges upon what was meant by the guarantee {?iven by the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes).

112,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,What guarantee is the honourable member referring to ?,30
113,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,-The guarantee given in regard to the 1915-16 harvest.,30
114,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown," On several occasions this morning I have been obliged to call the attention of the House to the disorder prevailing, and I wish to warn honourable members who may not have been in the Chamber when I have spoken previously, that I shall name any honourable member who, upon 'being called to order, refuses to obey the call, and immediately afterwards interjects. It is the duty of the Chair to afford every honourable member a proper opportunity of making his speech in reasonable silence. Therefore, while I may overlook an occasional interjection which may possibly be helpful, I cannot permit a chorus of interjections, which is very objectionable.",30
115,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,When the 1915-16 guarantee was given it was not paid in cash in the first payment.,30
116,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,What were the terms of the guarantee?,30
117,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,An honourable member must not interject immediately after I have drawn attention to the disorderliness of interjections.,30
118,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,But it was a helpful interjection.,30
119,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Older ! The honourable member is not in order in interrupting a speech in that way. . Mr MCWILLIAMS - I repeat that the whole question hinges upon what the Prime Minister meant by the guarantee of he promised. My opinion is that he did not give the matter much consideration at the time. He was then engaged in a campaign in the wheat-growing areas represented by some of my friends who are sitting behind me, and, unquestionably, it was a bit of a political bid which did not come off. However, in the condition of the finances today, I regard it as impossible for the Government to provide a cash payment of 5s.. per bushel for wheat. They could not raise the terrific amount of money which would be involved in making such a payment.",30
120,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"Then why do they not Mr MCWILLIAJViS - I cannot help what they say. I want the 5s. to be paid in cash if the money can be raised, but as the Government cannot get the money, nothing is to be gained by chasing rainbows. The Prime Minister has announced that during the coming week a conference will be held, after which he will tell us how much cash the Government will be prepared to pay, and what arrangements they are ready to make.",30
121,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,How can the conference find the cash?,31
122,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The Prime Minister will probably consult the conference, and seek its advice as to how the cash can be found. But, if after t h » conference the Prime Minister does not anbushel for wheat. nounce that the farmers will be paid a very considerable portion of the 5s. cash, and given a satisfactory bond for the balance which can be used as cash, will have to face this House, and honordone. able members can take up whatever position they choose in regard to the matter. A p it if u l tale has come to me in scoresfjof letters written by men of repute, and resolutions have been adopted by comgambling munities right throughout the northern portion of Victoria,, and in the AvheatA growing areas of New South Wales, pointing out that in very many cases the wheat-growers will not be in a position finance the garnering of their harvest. Tasmania is not a wheat-growing State, and there are no wheat producers i electorate, but owing to delays to shipping occasioned by the strikes and the war, the d'o that. fruit-growers there have had to watch their f r u it rotting in the orchards, and have been obliged to suffer most seriou3 privations in order to pay the interest their mortgages,»and carry on u n t i l the next 'season. Wheat-growers in a siderable portion of New South Wales the cities. have been in precisely the same position., and although the farmers in the northern portion of the Mallee district of Victoria as others did. may not have been handicapped to the same extent, many of them have been hard put to it to know how to carry on. again ? However, I am not concerned as to what the Prime Minister meant by his guaranHouse tee. The finances of Australia have got into such a deplorable position that it not possible for the Government to raise £35,000,000 or £40,000,000 during the next twoor three months when, if a cash payment were to be made for the wheat, the great bulk of the money would have to be found. Nevertheless, the Government should strain every nerve to make the proportion paid in cash as large as possible, and give a satisfactory bond or certificate for the balance, which will enable the farmer to finance himself until his wheat is sold.",31
123,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"There is a substantial difference between f r u it in store and wheat in store, in respect of which a certificate has been issued, because the wheat in store has a good commercial value.",31

Honourable members of tfee Country pa-rtv are endeaivouring to do their best for the farmer in a practical way. Tliere is not au lion orable member in the House who would not like 5s. to be paid i u cash; but in the state of the finances of the Commonwealth it is practically impossible to raise £35,000,000 or £40,000,000' in two months. I hope the cash advance will be more than 2s. 6d. per bushel. Any proposal to pay less than fifty-fifty will have no support from me. My honourable friends opposite put forward the suggestion that there may be a cash payment of 3d. or 6d. per bushel, and a certificate of 4s. 6d. per bushel; but they are quite misinterpreting the object which members of the Farmers' party have in view. Nothing less than fifty-fifty .will satisfy me, and I hope that the cash payment wiU be more than half.",31

141,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I am giving my opinion. I regard it as being no more a political move than is the amendment we have submitted. As I credit honourable members opposite with good intentions and a desire to help the farmer, I ask t them to credit us with the sajme honesty of purpose. I reiterate that I am not restricting the cash payment to 2s. 6d. I hope it will be a good deal more, as much and I as the Government can possibly arrange getto pay; but it is within the range of practical politics to pay 2s. 6d. cash i m the mediately upon delivery, and to give a or bond or certificate for the balance, which will be as good as cash, to enable the farmer to get out of his difficulties. For thab reason I am? supporting the amendment, and I am keeping an open mind we to deal with the proposals of the Prime such Minister when he submits them next",32

If the world's for wheat goes too high, it will be an the bounden duty of the Government to take action.

160,Mr GABB,Unknown,"Angas) [12.41] - The honourable member for Franklin (Mr. MCWilliams) presented a bouquet to honourable members on this side, but it was a bouquet with a brick in it . said/-that he did not think the motion had been moved by the Labour party for any political purpose, any more 'than the Country party had moved its amendment for a political purpose. That was a bouquet containing a very sharp brick. If the Country pai'ty is so m in d f u l of the interests of the farmer, it is a remarkable fact that only this morning, following a party caucus last, night, have they come forward with any proposal. W hy did not this soheme originate with them before ? As all sorts of reasons have been given as to why the motion of censure has been moved, I shall state clearly, as some of my colleagues have done already, some of the real reasons which influenced us. The first was that members of the Labour party believe that an individual should keep his word, and more particularly that the Government should do so. This promise in regard to the wheat guarantee was made at election time, and was made in ordinary language which would convey the ordinary meaning to the man upon the land. We believed that when the promise was made, it was intended to bear the interpretation th?* the farmers have placed upon it . I am sure that if I had been able to hear the election speeches of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers), for instance, I would not have heard him quoting figures to show that the primary producer had done twice as well during and since the war as in the five years previous to the war. He is more likely to have said that the Government were guaranteeing to the farmer 5s. per bushel at the railway siding. It is all very well, when many circumstances are makins: the honouring of the promise rather difficult, to quote strings of figures and advance specious arguments in order to find a way out for the Government. This motion was moved in the interests of the moral integrity of Parliament. We be-, lieve that it is dangerous to allow any Government to make all sorts of promises at election time, and then not keep them. A similar breach of promise occurred in regard to the war gratuity. It was a bait held out to returned soldiers for the purpose of getting their votes, and this was a bait to another section of the community for the same purpose. But honourable members on this side are not going to allow the Government to He make all sorts of promises, seemingly with no intention of giving effect to them, without voicing our protest.",34
161,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I call attention to the state of the House, Mr. Speaker. [Quorum formed.]",34
162,Mr GABB,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for attempting to get a bigger audience for me. It is very pleasing, indeed, to think that some of the older members are following in my footsteps, and that, apparently, they believe there should be .a sufficient number of members present to listento debate. It is satisfactory to know that I have made at least one convert to this view. I was advancing my first reason why honourable members on this side decided to submit this motion of censure. I say we could not allow the Government to make promises upon which they are returned to power, and then quietly sit down and do nothing; although excuses have been advanced why the Government have not carried out their pledges. So much for the first reason. Now for the second - Honourable members on this side, in common with other honourable members, realise that the farmers and wheat-growers, and particularly the wheat-growers in the newer areas, deserve all the encouragement that we can possibly give them. During the last election campaign I was an eye-witness of the difficulties which farmers in these newer areas have to encounter, so I know what I am talking about. I was campaigning on my bicycle, and, in order to avoid the heat of the day, I rose one morning at Eudunda before 4 o'clock.",34
163,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,I desire to call: attention to 'the state of the House. [Quorum formed.],34
164,Mr GABB,Unknown,"I must again thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for endeavouring to insure an attendance of honourable members. Evidently, he thinksmy remarks are worth listening to, or else he is trying to count out the House, and thus side-track this motion of censure.",34
165,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown, I should be obliged if the honourable member would address himself to the question before the Chair.,35
166,Mr GABB,Unknown,"Yes , Mr Speaker, I shall do so. When the honourable member for Eden-Monaro called attention to the state of the House just now I was advancing as our second reason for submitting this censure motion, the necessity there was to give every encouragement to our wheat growers, especially those in the newer areas, and I was giving as an illustration an incident of which I was an eye-witness during the last election campaign in my division. I had got as far as saying that when I rose before 4 o'clock one morning, I saw at a dam outside Eudunda, some local farmers with their water cart teams drawn up alongside the dam. There I saw these farmers climbing up and down the mud banks, nearly 20 feet in height, with kerosene buckets in their hands, and then standing on a kerosene case, tipping the water into the tanks. No doubt, other honourable members have witnessed similar scenes. I am familiar with all the hardships of our farmers, for during my work in connection with the Methodist Church, covering a period of eight years, I moved about a good deal amongst the wheat growers of the mallee districts of South. Australia, and so I know quite well what they have to put up with. all admit that the farmers in these areas to which I allude deserve every encouragement, and this is the reason why honourable members on this side of the House have stepped into the breach in order to expose the intention of the Government. I wish some of those farmers were present when the Prime Minister was acting the clown a little while-ago, and I wish they could have heard the laughter. Two scenes were before my eyes then: one, the scene in this House, and the other, the scene in which these farmers move in their dailv life.",35
167,Mr LAIKD SMITH,Unknown,"The honourable member is doing a nice bit of acting now, at all events.",35
168,Mr GABB,Unknown,"The Minister is entitled to his opinion. A man who has been a member of one party, and then crawls over to another, knows",35
169,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must discuss the motion before the Chair.,35
170,Mr GABB,Unknown,"I should like to do so, Mr Speaker, if only honourable members will leave me alone.",35
171,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I remind the honourable member that if he takes no notice of interjections they do not appear in Hansard.,35
172,Mr GABB,Unknown,"Ver y well, Mr Speaker. I have given as my second reason for this censure motion the fact that the farmers in the newer areas deserve the greatest possible encouragement in order that our primary industries may be satisfactorily developed. We should not have the spectacle of promises being made and then dishonoured, all at the expense of these men who, we all admit, are the backbone of the country. Our thir d reason for moving the vote of censure is that a large number of our farmers, on the strength of the guarantee, obtained monetary advances, in the hope of a quick realization, and now it looks as if they will have to wait until eighteen months after the harvest before anything like a settlement is made. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Eichard Foster) knows the position quite well; but when he said that as a representative of the South Australian farmers he was satisfied with the Prime Minister's promise of the best price which the financial resources of the country rendered posWe sible, he forgot, evidently, that this was not the election pledge given by the Prime Minister. If the honourable member for Wakefield is satisfied, and is content to let the Prime Minister make one statement before an election, and then make another statement in this House afterwards, all that I can say is that I am not satisfied. I feel sure, also, that some of the farmers in the honourable member's own district, particularly that part of it which touches mine on the Murray flats, wliere the farmers have had hard times, will not be satisfied either. The honourable member was able to say that, so far as he was concerned, he had only to sell one portion of his wheat scrip. His financial position enables him to carry on, but many otlier farmers in his own district cannot afford to do that. I could, if I wished, speak of the sound position of the farmers in the better parts of my own division. No doubt, they are not worrying much over this guarantee, because they are wealthyBut there are others, and it is ou their behalf that we speak now. They interpreted the promise made by the Prime Minister in the ordinary way,, just as would the man in the street; and they certainly understood that it meant cash.",35
173,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,I call to the state of the House. formed.],36
174,Mr GABB,Unknown,"Now I come to the promise itself. I have listened to all the speeches made during the debate, and I think we are all agreed that the promise was to this effect:- "" A guarantee of 5s. per bushel at railway sidings.'' Nobody will quibble about that. The election promise was a guarantee of 5s. at railway sidings. Now, what is the reasonable interpretation of the word ""guarantee""? It is all very well for the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) to say that it means payment in default of another; but I should like to remind him that the average Australian citizen has not been blessed with an academic education, nor has he had opportunities of wide commercial experience such as he has had, and, therefore, would not attach any technical meaning to the Prime Minister's promise. The reasonable course is to interpret the word "" g u a r a n t e e"" as it is ordinarily .understood throughout the country.",36
175,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,I again attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.],36
176,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 12.59 to 2.15 p.m.,36
177,Mr GABB,Unknown,"Prio r to the suspension of station or departmental staff. the sitting I was endeavouring to deal with the word ""guarantee."" I was in viting honourable members to examine and to regard it in the light in which Australian farmer generally has looked upon it . The distinctly technical and clusively dictionary meaning placed upon point of the man in the country. the word by the honourable member f o Flinders (Mr Bruce) is altogether ferent from the meaning which has been attached to it by the man on the land. The latter is a busy man, and he has no time to consult dictionaries. He intersome prets a term in its accepted sense. The board ship. Leader of the Country party, the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCW liams), who is now supporting an amendfor ment which practically cuts the ground from under the motion of censure, admits that lie has received numbers of letters from farmers who all expressed the view that the employment of the word ""guarantee "" by the Prime Minister predicated to their minds payment in cash at the rate of 5s. per bushel upon delivery at attention railway sidings. The Treasurer (Sir [Quorum - Joseph Cook) indicated by interjection yesterday, that if it meant 5s. cash, it would not be a "" guarantee,"" but a "" payment."" From the view-point of this moment, one can understand that interpretation; but we have to regard the promise in the light of the period when it was made. It was uttered on the eve of harvest, as well as of a Federal election, and every farmer considered it to imply a straight-out guarantee, without possibility of a varying interpretation, for the payment of 5s. cash. Sir JOSEPH CooK - r-Where are we to get the money from?",36
178,Mr GABB,Unknown,"I admit there is a difficulty there. I do not admit, however, that the Government had any right to make such a promise for electioneering purposes, nor that the difficulty of finding the money can now excuse them from f u l filling it. Now, I desire to turn attention to the expression "" railway sidings."" How is call that phrase understood in the country? Tliere is, in the mind of the farmer, a wide distinction between a railway siding and a railway station. The former is understood as a point on a railway system where there is not an established Honourable members opposite may say that a - railway siding can be situated at a raili t , way depot. Of course! There are sidthe ings at all the bigger railway stations. But I am regarding this expression in the ex-Prime Minister's promise from the viewFarr mers understood that a cash payment of difos. per bushel would be made for their wheat upon delivery at a railway siding, and not that the money would be withheld t ill their vvheat had arrived, from siding, at a railway depot, or on W it h respect to the proposal of the i lLabour party, in this matter of payment wheat, it has been pointed out by honourable members opposite that we did not offer cask as against the guarantee of the Government. It may be taken for granted that liad the Labour party at the time interpreted the Government guarantee a& other than an undertaking to pay cash, they would have been astute enough to i sert the specific word "" cash"" in their proposal. Without doubt the Labour party thought, as did the farmer, that the promise of the Prime Minister covered an actual cash guarantee. I am certain that if honourable members opposite, who represent rural constituencies, had told their farmer supporters during the election campaign that th<j promise of their Leader was not to be interpreted as a cash guarantee, they would not have polled so heavily. As an ordinary man, I ask myself why was the promise made? We have been told that it was made with a view to encouraging greater production. I will concede that that was one of the objectives. But, besides encouraging wheat production, it was made for the purpose of encouraging vote production.",36
179,Mr WIENHOLT,Unknown,That comment applies as aptly to the guarantees of the States.,37
180,Mr GABB,Unknown,"The promises made by been the .States were not uttered during elecbeen tion campaigns, or so close to an election, as the promise of the Prime Minister. The pledge of the latter was given for two purposes, which I repeat: first, i order to encourage wheat production; and, second, to increase favourable vote production. Why has not the promise been kept? The Government say that fchey are keeping it . They say that they will honour it in the spirit in which was intended that it should be kept, l appears to me that it is not going to kept, for the reason that the difficulties are too great. What are those difficuldifficult ties? As a matter of fact, some are not difficulties afc all, but are advantages. One reason why the promise is not goinf fco be kept is that its utterance encouraged too great a production of wheat. The farmers cropped vast areas and Australia is about to reap a far larger harvest than those difficulties, however, was anticipated. The promise will not be kept because Providence has treated us too kindly; practically all over wheat-growing areas of Australia there will be a bountiful harvest. Still another reason is that the world's wheat situation has undergone a considerable change since the promise was made. The world is rapidly approaching a position in which production will have again balanced consumption. In the course of recent reading, I learned that wheat-growing is being actively carried on in the huge territories of' Manchuria. Plour is now n - being sent into Europe from that source, and forms a considerable factor in the market, for the reason that, owing to cheap labour conditions, it can bb sold at a lower rate than the product of other parts of the world. Not only has the wheat market changed considerably since the Prime Minister made his promise, but it will have altered still more markedly by the time we have sold the last of OUT exportable wheat. I propose now to quote several significant expressions by members of the Country party, including the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) . I admire the honourable member for one thing at least, ancl that is that he is always with his party. We know where he is. . He is always at hand to vote according to his party principles. The honourable member stated that the Prime Minister and the Wheat Board were much exercised because up to the present only one sale had effected. I regret that there has not more than one sale to date, and I certainly do not gloat over the fact. It has accentuated the difficulties of the Government in keeping their promise, but n it has not absolved them. The honourable member for Echuca also said, in effect, that if the money were available to make a cash payment, he would vote for the motion of censure. It would appear that he is caught in a cleft stick. He realizes it that the Government made a definite prot mise, and he feels that they ought to keen be it ; but he perceives that the financial position is such that it will be exceedingly for the Government to fulfil thfc Prime Minister's pledge. The remarks of the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson) were similarly concentrated upon the difficulties of the Government in the matter of finance. Admittin g honourable members on this side would be failing in their duty if they permitted the Govern the ment to reap the fruits of the Prime Minister's promise, while at the same time they were unable to honour it . In conclusion, I believe that much good has been done by discussing this motion, and if we have not done anything else, we have caused the members of the Country party to take some active interest in the farmers' welfare. listening to the debate for two days, the members on the Corner benches, with the exception of the honourable member for New England (Mr Hay) had to leave the Chamber and hold a party meeting to decide what they would do. The discussion on the motion has also been the means of extracting a promise from the Government that a statement will be made at an early date in regard to this matter. I notice that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) pooh-poohed the interjection of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) when he said that as a result of the motion, the Government had been brought up to the point where they were going to make the position clear. I am going to watch the operation that will soon take place, with great interest. The members of the Labour party are accused by many of not having any interest in the farmers' welfare, but it must be admitted that we are more than doing our share, even in comparison with the members of the Country party, in keeping the Government up to their obligations. The members on the Corner benches claim to be the farmers' friends, but one of their members has now moved an amendment which will be the means of opening - the door to enable the Government to avoid the difficulties confronting them. During .the six or seven months I have been a member of this Parliament, I have never, until today, heard the Prime Minister appeal for a quiet and attentive hearing for any honourable member, but this morning he made that request on behalf of the honourable member for Dampier Gregory). I realise that that honourable member is the ambassador for the Government in the Country party, and he has introduced ""this amendment to enable the Government to clear itself. I shall watch with interest the result of the representatives of the so-called Farmers' party opening the gate for the Government to ignore its obligations. observant man in this community must' realise that during the period of stress and drought the primary producers of the Comm.onweafl.th, and particularly those in New South Wales, have experienced untold hardships, and their friends im the Corner aire now opening the way for the Government and the middlemen to Mr Gabb. get away in the smoke. If , that is so, After we might well say, "" Save us from our friends.""",37
181,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [2.35] - The amendment of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) has perturbed the ranks of Tuscany, and members opposite are in great doubt as to what they should do. During the luncheon adjournment, instead of paying regard to those priceless laws of health that the ages and our own experience have taught us to disobey at our peril, and allowing their digestions to have an opportunity of carrying out their mysterious processes, they have been engaged in ruminating over this amendment. The way of the transgressor is hard. The motion has been moved, and lo! and be1 hold there has come this amendment, intruding its rude presence on their special preserves. It is very unfair. They had hoped to gain from this some kudos, but now the difficulty confronting them is which way they are going to vote.",38
182,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Whic h way are you going to vote? Mr HUGHES' - Ah ! Which way are you going to vote? I did not have the opportunity of hearing the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb), before the luncheon adjournment, but since we have resumed he has appealed to the Deity, with whom, so far as I can gather, he is on intimate terms. He is solicitous concerning the future welfare of the farmers, and pictures their difficulties in struggling against a thousand obstacles, (Mr such as drought, flood, and other adverse conditions. He did not mention the Labour party, but no doubt that was an oversight. The honourable member devoted some time to discussing the difference between the meaning of "" guarantee"" as it appearsi n the dictionary, and as he understands it . We are not concerned with that any Any more than we are with the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition. We know there are motions of censure, and that there are other motions. The honourable member who submitted this motion knew that it would not be carried, and took the opportunity of saying what he would do. He is a. very fearless knight sans pew et sansreproche! If the honourable member and his supporters had thought there was one chance i u a million of the motion being carried, would have talked u n t i l doomsday than allow it to go to a vote. There is hardly one of them, who does not realise that in their own respective electorates it in silence? is a "" toss up "" whether they will ever be selected again. They see it going on day; they saw it at the last election, and they are taking no risks. Let me refer to the amendment.

If this wheat crop proves what we hope it will be, then there must be found, by the States and the Commonwealth, in the month of January at the latest, at least 1 £45,000,000. There is our own 5s. that we would have to pay at once, and the 2s. 6d. to be paid by the State of New South Wales, which cannot amount to much less than £10,000,000.",40
224,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"I should t h £5,000,000.",41
225,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I think it will be more, but I accept the correction. There is also something to be paid by the State of Queensland. Honourable members imay pass what resolutions they like, but those resolutions will not improve our credit, nor advance the negotiations that the Government are now undertaking to raise the money, or to enable us to pay it. There is not a single man here, with a sense of the responsibilities which rest"" upon every one of us, who does not appreciate to the full what this tremendous amount of money means. The House is asked, in effect, to give the Government a direction to pay the money before the end of January. I suppose all the wheat will be delivered by the end of January, so that, beginning in December and running righ t to the end of January- a period of six or seven weeks- a sum of £40,000,000 would have - to be found. That is a great deal of money. Last week I had an opportunity of consulting the bankers on financial matters and of going into details with the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. I say frankly that unless we are able to make further considerable sales, the financial position of this country will not permit us to pay £40,000,000 from the middle of December to the end of January - We cannot do so. The amendment, I think, cognisance of the circumstances in which we find ourselves, because it says that the Government should arrange for the payment of the 5s. by cash and certificates, such certificates to be repayable in such instalments and at such periods as are recommended by the - Central Wheat Board. To that I take no exception. The Central Wheat Board is a thoroughly representative body. On it are representatives of the four wheat producing States of the Commonwealth. All sides and sections are represented, including the consumers. I want the consumers to realise that the Wheat Board does represent them. The fanners, of course, as is very proper, have representation. The Board is, therefore, a very representative body, and it is a proper body to entrust this matter to. But neither that nor any other representative body can go beyond th» nnancial resources of the Commonwealth. Inside of and in k, subject to that, however, the Commonwealth and the States ought to strain every effort to pay every penny in cash that they can directly the wheat is at the railway sidings. The farmers of New South Wales, I think, suffered more during the recent drought than any other farmers did, and if we axe to make any distinction so far as cash is concerned, we should make it in favour of those who suffered most heavily. The amendment says that the Wheat Board shall decide that matter, and on that Board, as I have pointed out, all the wheat-producing States are represented. To that part of the amendment, therefore, I take no exception whatever. I ought to say that I see no prospect of being able to raise £40,000,000 before the end of January, but I shall be able to speak with more autliority after the conferences that are to be held next week. I repeat that every effort ought to be made, and the financial resources of this country ought to be strained, in order to pay the last penny that is possible. The second part of the amendment says that world's parity ought to be paid for wheat used for local consumption. If the wheat crop fetches, on an average, 10s. a bushel, and amounts to 140,000,000 bushels, that will mean £70,000,000- a colossal sum. It will certainly be the first time in the history of Australia that takes wheat has fetched more than wool, despite the high price of wool. But we do not know, of course, what wheat will be worth in one month, six months, or nine months' time, although we hope it will remain at that level. The amendment says that London parity or world's parity ought to be paid for local wheat, and asks that the Government shall do nothing to prevent it . I hope honourable members will follow me while I put the position quite clearly. The Government were returned upon a policy clear and unambiguous upon that point. I said, not once, but many times, that we would do nothing to prevent the 'farmer getting world's parity for his wheat, whether it was sold here or elsewhere. To that we stand.",41
226,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Thos e who sit opposite were with you at that time, including the honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr Tudor) and others.",41
227,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"No , they were against me. They were not in favour of world's parity for local consumption. The honourable member for Dampier misapprehends what I said, I said that the Government and the Government party would do nothing to prevent the farmer getting world's parity, not only for export wlieat, but for wheat sold in this country. The view of honourable members opposite is that, for local consumption, the price should be based upon the cost of production. The honourable member for Dampier himself pointed out this morning, not only the unfairness, but the difficulty of that proposition. For all practical purposes it cannot be done. It may cost 30s. to put in an acre of wheat in the Mallee, and it may cost £ 2 10s. in another place. One man may get 10 bushels per acre, and another 30 bushels. What is the cost of production? Y o u could not fix the price on that basis.",42
228,Mr STEWART,Unknown,They all have to take the same price now.,42
229,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"They would not have to take the same price then. I do not know which side the honourable member is on. However, we shall soon see. Therefore, to the second part of the amendment I also take no exception, but I want to point out to honourable members, and to my fellow citizens, that the wheat is now, for £15,000,000: all practical purposes, owned by the four wheat-producing States, and that they will decide at what price it shall be sold within Australia, This Government has nothing whatever to do with that matter, but it is pledged not to do anything that would prevent the farmers getting world's parity inside Australia. The amendment practically leaves the whole matter in the hands of the Central Wheat Board. I could have wished that the honourable member for Dampier had not anticipated the result of the negotiations that are to take place next week. I cannot but help thinking that it was unwise for the honourable member to submit the amendment, since we are going to deal with men without whose co-operation we cannot get'the money unless we i-esort to confiscation and repudiation. We must look to the bankers tc assist us, and, therefore, to pass an amendment of this kind, and then to call a meeting of the bankers to consider the whole matter, is, in my opinion, tha wrong way to go about the business. The amendment, however, has been moved, and I am called upon to express an opinion upon it . I am asked whether I agree that we should make every effort to pay to the utmost of our ability the 5s. per bushel in cash and certificates. My answer is that the Government is prepared to do so. I am asked, further, whether I am in favour of the Commonwealth doing nothing to prevent, the producer obtaining export parity for all wheat, whether sold with in or beyond the Commonwealth. I am also in favour of that, so that I can vote for the amendment. I am, nevertheless, sorry it has been moved, since I am perfectly certain that it will handicap our negotiations and render them somewhat difficult. The amendment having been launched, it is not for me to suggest that it should be withdrawn. I regret that it has been moved, but if a division is called for I shall vote for it . I want only to point out, in conclusion, what an. important bearing the local price of wheat has on the question of the guarantee. It will take, let us say, 30,000,000 bushels of wheat to feed Australia, and at 10s. per bushel, if that is to be the price, that represents Then there is the seed wheat, as well as the margin that we must keep over and above the bare quantity required for home consumption. If we put that down at 5,000.000 bushels, we thus have £20,000,000 worth of wheat to be sold inside Australia, assuming that we pay 10s. per bushel for it . That is a very material consideration, and the sooner we can settle what is to be the local price of wheat the sooner we shall be in a position to say how much money we can give to the farmers for their wheat in January next. I have nothing more to add. I am sorry the amendment has been moved, not because of what it contains, but because it anticipates the conferences which must necessarily be held, and some of these gentlemen may resent the attempt to direct them and to anticipate what they can do. If the amendment is pressed to a division, the Government will support it .",42
230,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Bourke) [ 3 . 1 0 ] - I am delighted that this amendment has heen moved, and am pleased to have the assurance of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) that if it is pressed to a division he will support it . I conclude from that statement that the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) may possibly withdraw it . I quite agree with the demand for world's parity. I always did. I i is a sound principle. When I see a nigger working on a boat for the world's parity, I want that parity for myself. I therefore, can see no reason why we on this side of the House should vote against the amendment. The honourable member for Dampier wins my admiration when, as an ardent supporter of the ' far m ing interests, he submits such a proposition. The Prime Minister, of course, objects to it because it does not emanate from the Government. As I do not come from a wheat-growing district, I know nothing about the subject, and do not profess to know anything about it. Some honourable members on both sides of the Chamber, I understand, are familiar with it ; but, as a rule, those who know the least about any matter have the most to say in regard to it . That wil l doubtless account for the direction from which the amendment has come. It comes from the honourable member for Dampier just as appropriately as it would come from me a.j the representative of Brunswick brickyards.. It is suggested that this motion of censure has been submitted by the Labour party because they are trying to catch the farmers' vote. Of course, our party could not have been actuated by national considerations in moving it ! It must have been put forward for some bass ulterior motive; otherwise such a party as ours would not have moved it . The amendment comes from the Country party-the genuine representatives of the farming interests.",43
231,Mr ROBEBT COOK,Unknown,"Hear , hear!",43
232,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I am glad the honourable member applauds me. The Country party could have no greater testimonial to their genuineness than my affirmation of it . I desire only to point out that, although they were so unanimous and solid the other evening, we have now a fresh division of interests on their part. Apparently the members of the Country party, who are going to f all back in this attack on the Government, are the very honourable members who led the onslaught against them in connection with the Estimates last week.",43
233,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It is their turn to f all away.,43
234,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Yes . The other evening when the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) led his gallant little army forward in an attack on the Government, some members of his party were so deaf that they could not hear the division bells ring. Apparently today some other members of the party are to be afflicted with deafness, and wil l not hear the bells. To-day it is the honourable member for Dampier who leads the attack really on behalf of the Government.",43
235,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"It does not matter if they all vote, as long as they do not vote together.",43
236,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Q u it e so. Their one object at this juncture is to save the Government. I am just as anxious to save them as is the honourable member for Dampier. If the Prime Minister can advance to me some sound reasons about the motion, just as he did to the honourable member for Dampier, he will find me quite as open to conviction, and just as ready to extend to him the same consideration. What are these cohorts that have been moving backwards and forwards, and in and out of the chamber? To what are we to attribute the sudden absence fro m the chamber of certain honourable members during the last few hours? What was the reason for the invitation to members of this party and that party to go out for a few minutes ? Why were one or two honourable members of the Corner party keeping guard in the House during the absence of others? Why do they come along now ? W hy these demonstrations by the Prime Minister? All these things are but mere party moves on the political stage. For the real things that matter no one cares a "" continental."" The one consideration is that our positions shall be preserved - I do not care how honourable members vote or what they do. If I think the safety of the Government is endangered I , too,, will be stone deaf when the division bells ring. All I ask is that I be given fair warning. I beg honourable members opposite not to take me unaware, since, if they do, I may be here to record my vote when the division is taken. The amendment provides that world's parity shall be paid for all wheat, including that sold for consumption in Australia. It comes from the representative of a Western Australian constituency. The farmers of that State are today receiving, for the most part, good prices for their products. They have received from the State of Western Australia £1,000,000 of public money, and they have been granted far more concessions in every direction than has any other section of the community. They have been a favoured and privileged class so far as the people of Western Australia are concerned. But where is the soundness of the principle the world's parity? Take the case of a man who has no money behind him and who goes out into the country, tills the soil, and produces nothing. Does he want the world's parity? Why, he could not exist for a single week without help from the community. Does the farmer want the world's parity when wheat is only 2s. 6d. per bushel? He does not want it then.",43
237,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,He has to take it.,44
238,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,He should not take it if he does not want it. Does he want the world's parity at that hour ?,44
239,Mr STEWART,Unknown,He has to take it.,44
240,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,Then let him take it all the time. But he wants to take it when the world's prices are high and not when the world's prices are low.,44
241,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,The world's parity always did apply to the farmers' products when prices were low.,44
242,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It did not apply at beginning of the war.,44
243,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,No . When the world's prices are low the farmer always receives large concessions from the States. They want the world's parity only at this particular hour when the world's prices are high. Nobody will be more determined to fly from the principle of the world's parity next year if the world's prices are low than will the farmers themselves.,44
244,Mr STEWART,Unknown,The honourable member's party did not bring forward a proposal to give the farmer a fair price for his produce when the price overseas was not fair.,44
245,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I have no objection to the amendment, but why interpolate it at this particular moment for the mere purpose of wiping out the original motion? The honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) is inviting us to vote for his amendment in order that members of the Country party may escape from their obligation to vote for the original motion. But they ought not to forget that at some other time their own argument in favour of the farmer receiving the world's parity for his products will be used against them.",44
246,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [3.19] - Betwee n 8 and 8.30 o'clock last evening I was informed by the Government Whip that of the Ministry intended to continue the debate upon my motion until a division was taken upon it. Less than two hours later, the Honorary Minister (Mr. Rodgers) commenced to make a long speech. When he had been speaking twenty minutes, I thought that the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) was urging him to cut it short, in order that we might get to a division. But instead of doing that, I learn that he was suggesting to the honourable gentleman that he should ask leave to continue his speech. Why? The reason is given in the Age of today. Long before the honourable member for Dampier moved his amendment, that journal knew exactly what was going to happen. It saysI t is probable that the Country party will move an amendment today to the censure motion before the House. A meeting of the party was held last night, and certain plans were discussed for the framing of an amendment that would prove acceptable to the Government and at the same time enable the members of the Farmers party to save their the face and escape the trap set for them by the Labour Opposition'. It was the Government's knowledge of this proposal, and the fact that an understanding had been practically arrived at on the matter between the Country party and the Government, that the debate on the no-confidence motion was adjourned so abruptly at a comparatively early hour last night. Before this understanding was reached, it was the intention to carry the motion to a division without a further adjournment, even though it might have been necessary for the House to sit all night. The Country party is to meet at 10.30 a.m. today to finally decide upon its plan of action. It was stated last night that members of the Farmers party favoured the Government issuing to wheat-growers bonds for the amount represented by the difference between the first advance payment on wheat delivered at country sidings and the 5s. a bushel guaranteed by the Government. These bonds, it is suggested, could be made use of as securities, but would uot be redeemable until the wheat sold was paid for by the purchasers. Every word of that is accurate. There is not an honourable member in this chamber who will not admit that it was intended to take a division upon my motion last night. But the debate Upon it was abruptly adjourned. B y the way, my forecast of the result of the Victorian elections yesterday was not very far wrong. I predicted that the Nationalists would lose some seats and that the Labour party would gain' some.",44
247,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Assumin g every word which the honourable member has read be true, what is wrong about it ? .",45
248,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I will deal with matter presently. Everybody knows that the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Dampier would never have been moved if I had not submitted my motion of no-confidence in the Government. In other words, the amendment is a mere afterthought. The honourable member for Dampier will admit that.",45
249,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"If were set, .political tactics would not be necessary.",45
250,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"'My motion was not a trap. In moving it yesterday, I said that I was anxious to get to a vote, and I deliberately limited my remarks to less than half-an-hour, in order that we might have a short, sharp debate upon it . The long speeches have come from honourable members on the other side of the chamber. Honourable members who vote against my motion are not in favour of paying 5s. per bushel cash to the farmers for their wheat. I am now speaking to the amendment, because I do not intend to exercise m y right of reply upon the original motion. Yesterday the Prime Minister made a deliberate misstatement regarding the Inter-State executive of the Labour party which has been meeting in Melbourne.",45
251,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is strong language. The honourable member says that the Prime Minister made a deliberate misstatement.,45
252,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown, Order! 1 The honourable member for Yarra must withdraw that statement.,45
253,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I withdraw it . When I called the Prime Minister's attention to his statement, he admitted that he was wrong. The statement to which I refer readsThe question, they were told, was to be decided by inquiry. Inquiry by whom? The farmers? Members opposite asked the farmers to refer the price of wheat to a jury composed only of consumers. There has never been any suggestion of that character made by auy honourable member upon this side of the chamber or that by any responsible member of the Labour organization. .Any inquiry ought to be representative of all sides-no t like the Butter Board, with its eighteen producers that and no consumers; or the Bureau, of Commerce and Industry, with all the members from one side. Such a method has never been adopted by the Labour party.",45
254,Mr ROBERT COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member is absolutely incorrect, so far as the Butter Board is concerned.",45
255,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,There are no consumers' representatives on it . no traps,45
256,Mr ROBERT COOK,Unknown,There are.,45
257,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Why , I placed all the names on record before the honourable member came to this House.",45
258,Mr BOBERT COOK,Unknown,If the honourable member is as incorrect in all his statements as he is in this,45
259,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I placed on record the name of every person on the Butter Board, and there is not a consumer amongst them. When the Prime Minister stated that we desired the inquiry to be made by consumers only, he was stating what is absolutely incorrect; not a member of the organization to which I belong has ever made such a suggestion.",45
260,Mr RYAN,Unknown,He means that everybody is a consumer.,45
261,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"At that rate, any man from a boot factory could be accepted as a representative on a Board to inquire pretty into the price of boots, on the ground that he wears boots; or a hatter, in the case of a hatter, because he wears hats. Every inquiry set afoot by the Labour party is made by representatives of all the parties interested. I trust that in the vote on my motion the farmer will be given a fair deal.",45

290,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"It would be premature for me to discuss the Treaty of Peace, although I would like to express a few thoughts upon that subject, about which 1 feel somewhat strongly; and I certainly would like to protest against the long delay in promulgating peace with Austria and Bulgaria. But if it would be irrelevant to the present motion to do so, I can only say that, while this is neither the time nor the hour for the introduction of new and very grave measures of international importance",49
291,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member was against the war, and now he is against the peace!",49
292,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Why not agree, and let me put the Bilb on the table?",49
293,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"If I am to understand that the Prime Minister gives a pledge not to go any further, I am inclined not to press my opinion at this stage; although I realise his past attitude generally towards pledges, and it must not be taken that I allow the Bills to be placed on the table without prejudice to my rights when the matter comes before us at a later stage.",49
294,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Bourke) [4.3] - I was sorry to hear the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) speak in this manner. Nothing disheartens me more than to hear; the ardent pacifist of yester- to day at this particular hour objecting the pacific intentions of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), who was not fairly always the pacifist he is at this moment. I am a supporter and a member of the same party as the honourable member Batman, and I have endeavoured to instil iuto him some of those eloquent notions with which I have identified myself. Now. sir, there is on the stocks a meaper sure dealing with the Treaty of Peace made during the year 1919. Apparently, the honourable member for Batman does not know anything about the terms of that Treaty, or that there was a Treaty of Peace in 1919. . Is he aware that that year peace was settled for the Prime Minister at the very moment when he trying to spread discord in this comthe munity?",49
295,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Tell us about the oilpainting outside.,49
296,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"That is the finest work of art we possess. It is an emblem of peace. It puts me in mind of Rembrandt's ""Night Watchman."" I understand it is very important that these measures should be introduced; that they should be laid on the table at once. Does not the Prime Minister think he has "" laid "" enough today ? Does he think it is absolutely imperative he should lay these Bills on the table at this particular hour ?",49
297,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Don' t you want to make peace with Bulgaria?,49
298,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,Yes ; I do.,49
299,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Then let me make peace with Bulgaria, and let us go home. - Mr ANSTEY - But you do not want to make peace with any one else. Very well. If there are any honourable members in this chamber who can advance any more cogent arguments than I have advanced, I shall resume my seat.",49
300,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,"Calare) [4.5] - I oppose the motion, and I may say that, a' f ter having been "" gagged "" so successfully by the Government on two occasions on one evening, I do not intend be so treated again if I can help it. to There' axe a great many items of business on the notice-paper which may be said to be of considerable public importance. But there is' nothing more important than the introduction of for the Commonwealth Bank Bill, which, when it has been introduced, will give the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini) an opportunity-at the prostage-to move his contingent amendment. Had that Bill been introduced earlier, and had the honourable member's amendment been agreed to, we could not have had the discussion which has occupied the past two days concerning the in financing of the Government's wheat guarantee; and we would not have had was the spectacle of honourable members in Corner, who claim to represent the farmers, moving an amendment to the motion of censurej whioh gave the Government a way out, and which was intended at the same time to provide a way out for the Country party.",49
301,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown, The honourable member is quite out of order. He is discussing the motion of censure which is already disposed of by a vote of the House.,50
302,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,"I consider that T am in order in endeavouring to prove how necessary Mr Laird Smith' interjecting,",50
303,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,"Why cannot you keep quiet? I never ""ratted"" like you did.",50
304,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,50
305,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"I have got your' history, and can give it here.",50
306,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,Does the Minister movethreaten me? I am not afraid of anything he can say.,50
307,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! If the honourable member is not prepared to discuss the motion, I must direct him to resume his seat.",50
308,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,"I will discuss it if I am given the chance; but at the same time. I want to say that the allegations of the Minister for the Wavy will not go down with me. He cannot threaten me. He says he has got my history. I , at any rate, have never "" ratted."" have always been true to Labour and its principles.",50

311,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [4.8] I desire to bring under your notice, sir, I the ill-lighting of this chamber. It is such as to be very trying to one's eyes. I do not know how these splendid officers of the House, both the clerics and the members of the Hansard staff, contrive to carry on their work at the table. I have been compelled to use a .stronger pair of glasses than usual, and I certainly think something ought to be done to improve the lighting.",50
