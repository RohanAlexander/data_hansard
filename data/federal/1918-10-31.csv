The Commission is vested with full statutory powers under the Royal Commissions Act to conduct its inquiries and investigations, and has full and complete control over the conduct of its own proceedings. The Commission has not advised the Government whether it proposes to conduct this investigation in public, hut yesterday I communicated with the Chairman, asking what is the intention of the Commission. As the investigations being undertaken will include a full and impartial examination of the acquisition by the Government of the Shaw wireless plant,., the matter now being sub judice, in accordance with the recognised procedure of Parliament, I ami not in a position to further discuss it at this stage.",21
2,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"In view of the urgency of the matter, I ask the Acting Prime Minister, without notice-1 . Are the inquiries being made by the Royal Commission on N/avy and L)ef ence Administration private and confidential? 2. ""What is the name of the officer from the Crown Solicitor's office who, in response to the Royal Commission's request for legal assistance, was placed at the service of the Commission ? 3. Does the Minister consider that officer justified in disclosing to persons connected with the Royal Commission the nature of the inquiries being made, by the Royal Commission (see statement by the Acting Prime Minister appearing in the daily press of 30th .October) ? 4. Is the officer still assisting the Commission ? 5. Is it proposed that he shall make to the Acting Solicitor-General progress reports of the Commission's confidential business, and that the Acting 'Solicitor-General shall forward the said reports to the Acting Attorney-General, who, in turn, will submit them to the Acting Prime Minister?'",22
3,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The honourable member has been good enough to hand me a copy of'his questions. The answer to No. 1 is contained in the statement just made. I am not aware at this stage as to whether the Commission proposes to conduct its investigation privately or not, and I have written for information on the subjeet. The reply to No. 2 is that the officer in question is the Assistant Crown Solicitor, Mr Sharwood. In reply to No. 3,1 consider the - procedure adopted by that office* quite proper in the circumstances. 4. Ha is still assisting the Commission. Question 5 I cannot answer until I receive in- formation regarding the procedure of the Commission. PAPERS.

4,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Havin g regard to the fact, as reported in the press, that Dr Liebknecht and all the militant politicians of Germany who were imprisoned during not the war have been released recently, and are allowed full opportunity of expressing their opinions, although they are in opposition to the ruling powers, and that the suppression of free speech has been discontinued, and the censorship removed, will the Government take into consideration the advisability of releasing all political prisoners in Australia, and the removal of all the censorship restrictions on free speech and publication?",22
5,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The Government have no official information regarding the proposal recently adopted by the German Government in relation to the matter mentioned by the honourable member, and I am not sure that if we had such information it would influence us in any way. We have no desire to follow German methods; we have been often warned against doing so by honourable members opposite. Further, I am not aware that there are any political prisoners in Australia. Certain men,, by reason of the laws adopted in consequence of the war, made themselves liable to punishment, and have been punished, but the term "" political prisoners"" is not an appropriate one to apply to them. I can hold out no hope of their release, unless better cause than that contained in the honourable member's question is shown. NA WOMEN. - Mr FALKINER - In view of the large number of women who have been singled out for honour on account of 1 Red Cross activities, I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether there is any reathe son why such recognition should be fined' to the inhabitants of the cities, that the very earnest women workers the country should be ignored ?",22

Will the Acting Prime Minister inform the House the reason for. this high-handed and obviously unjust procedure on the part of the Administration?.",23
8,Mr SPEAKER,DECORATIONS FOR AUSTRALIAN,Order ! The honour and able member should not put a question a form which conveys a reflection on the drunkards ? Administration.,23
9,Mr WATT,DECORATIONS FOR AUSTRALIAN,"The concluding portion of'the honourable member's interrogation was not a question, but a comment upon the administration of justice. I am not conversant with the facts relating to mattei he has mentioned, but if the honorresult. 1 able member will give notice of a question, the Acting Attorney-General will . answer it tomorrow.",23
10,Mr SPEAKER,DECORATIONS FOR AUSTRALIAN,"I again remind honourable members that it is not in accordance with the Standing Orders for honourable members, in asking questions, to express opinions or to make allegations or statements of fact. The purpose of a question ' is to seek information, not to give it . T ask honourable members to bear that rule in mind. CAPTURED GERMA N ISLANDS. Mr MoWILLIAMS - A cablegram has appeared in the press stating that the their Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and the Acting Prime Minister have declared that island's which have been seized from conGermany should remain in the hands of and a neutral' power, preferably the United ini States. I ask the Acting Prime Minister whetherhehas made any such statement ?' Mr Watt. - I made no such proposal, but apparently the Morning Post, an important London journal, based Ausupon the cabled version of my remarks a suggestion that the United States should be asked to. take charge of those islands. The Government are in no way responsible for that suggestion. REPATRIATION . SOLDIERS SENT TO INEBRIATE HOMES",23

22,Mr WATT,SETTLEMENT IN EEDERAL,"It is not correct to say that the Government are bringingtwo. experts from the United Kingdom. The.

30,Mr WATT,NAVA L AND MILITAR Y,"We are not embarking on any new forms of expenditure in regard to military work.

Mr Watt - The .Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom), who was at one time Assistant Minister for Defence, confirms my impression that such a badge as that referred to by the honourable member has been authorized.

54,Mr ORCHARD,NAVA L AND MILITAR Y,"All the pamphlets required in .connection with the - recruiting I ballot have been printed, so that it - will be unnecessary 'to indulge in more printing in that respect. It is to be regretted that in some cases pamphlets have been .'sent to people to whom they should not have been addressed; but ""bhis has been largely due to incorrect information supi n g plied from local sources, and to the f a ct .that there is no compulsory means ""by which information can be obtained in r.e.gard to the names of .eligibles.

95,Mr TUDOR,DEFENCE DEPARTMEN T,"Ha d Ways and Means been the first order of the day, the House would have anticipated the discussion of a taxation measure. No doubt, honourable members generally were no better in formed than myself about the intentions of the Government regarding the Income Tax Bill , I assumed that we were going on with the Electoral Bill .

98,Mr HIGGS,DEFENCE DEPARTMEN T,"Capricornia)' [ 3 . 3 3 ] support the honourable member for Yarra. I do not think that we have had another Treasurer who has approached us more insinuatingly than the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) , who is almost generous at times; but I would remind him that the business-paper exists for a certain purpose. On it a Government arranges its proposals in order, with a view to giving honourable members warning of the business that may be expected to.be brought forward for consideration each day. An honourable member interested in , say, Order of the Day No. 3, may propose to make some remarks about the Spirits Bill , but, seeing the Electoral B i ll and. the Distillation Bill down for discussion before it , may postpone the collecting of facts on the subject, under the impression that the Bill will not be brought on for a few days. But if the business-paper is to be altered in the manner proposed, such an honourable member may find that the Spirits B i ll is made to precede the other two measures, and he may thus be unprepared when the opportunity for discussing it presents itself. The Acting Minister is a very frequent offender in this respect. I have come to the House on several' occasions, and thought that we should not reach acertain Bill for a few days, but in a most gracious way the Acting Prime Minister has leaned across the table, and asked the Leader of ""the Opposition whether it would be inconvenient if that particular Bill were taken before other orders of the day which preceded it on the notice paper. I feel sure that the honourable gentleman will feel no resentment, but will rather give us credit for proper watchfulness in requesting that he will , in future, give due notice of any proposal such as he is making now. - Mr Watt - If I intended to dispose of the matter today, I should say that my procedure was unfair, but it is not unfair when I am proposing to merely introduce the measure, and then to afford honourable members time to study it .",37

The tax yielded in 1915-16 a sum of £3,932,775; in 1916-17, £5,621,9.50; in 1917-18, £7,385,543; while .the' estimate for the year T918-19,, including the 30 per cent, increase now proposed, is £9,600,000. As I 'explained in a former analysis of - the matter the estimate of tihe' original Afr. Watt. to the , revenue due to the 30 per cent, increase cash prize in a lotis £2,200,000. The statistics for 1917-18 aTe not yet available. Figures are not procurable to explain full y the increase in 1917-lS as COMPANY. compared with ' 1916-17, but it may be stated at this stage - that the increases are disdue to three factors. The first is the colthe lection in 1917-18 of arrears from the years 1915-16 and 1916-17"". In the early stages of a tax the office takes some time to catch up to the assessment work, but in t h i r d year it commences to overtake The second cause is increased abincomes. We have evidence that in many cases the increase has been colossal. The be third cause is the .more efficient machinery for icollection. That is 'to be expected when an office has been running for three or four years. The need for a greater income tax is .shown by the expenditure figures, with - whioh I will refresh the minds of honorl be able members. The war payments out of revenue have been as follows:-1914-15 , £640,217; 1915=16, £3,778,3!78; 1916-17, In £S,427,329; 1917-18, £11,856,335;; while the estimate for 1918-19 is £21,129,602. It to me a matter for regret that .the Oomn - monwealth began its levy upon incomes by means of a .scale so complicated as .to and - bewilder .all but the highest - matheA n attempt was made to are alter the mode of computation, but the difficulty at once presented itself that a cent, new scale would .impose upon some taxpayers increases much in excess .of those 'The Government be therefore decided to adhere - for .this year, any r.ate, to the <old basis, to which, in tax spite of its intricacies, the taxpayers have As honourable cent, members .are .aware, .a handbook has been per issued showing ithe amounts .payable on It - is a ready reckoner that he who runs may read, and before honourable members .commence to .either support or criticise the historic 'eurves that ladorn the schedule 'of the Income Tax Assessment Act, I suggest that they spend a.considerable time in this post-graduate .course. 1I have found it both illuminatin g and enervating.",37
101,Mr FALKINER,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,It is easier to understand - when one has to pay.,40
102,Mr WATT,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"The taxpayer knows what he has to pay; he does not know why, but he has an idea that the taxation machinery works unerringly and upon scientific principles. If the Committee and the House assent to these proposals to in crease the tax by 30 per cent, a new book will be prepared which will include the increase now sought; to be levied on the people. The tax on lotteries is to be increased fro m 10 to 13 per cent. organizers at present are withholding 10 per cent, of each prize. It is thought unwise to attempt to collect an additional 3 per cent, after the money has passed into the hands of the winners; therefore, the new rate will apply only from the passing of the Act. The rate for companies has been fixbd nt 2s. 6d. in the £ 1 , which represents slightly more than an increase of 30 per cent., but is a convenient round sum. This rate will apply only to that portion of the companies' taxable income which has not been distributed to shareholders. dividends are taxed in the hands of the shareholders at the rates payable by them as individuals. Moneys payable by a company to absentees were formerly taxed at fid. in the £ 1 . The rate now proposed is Sd. The income tax of 1917 included a provision known as the bachelor tax, which required bachelors and widowers without children to pay income tax to the extent of £5, or 5 per cent, of their taxable in come, whichever was the greater. Government arranged that this tax should not be collected, and we now' propose its formal repeal. In viewing the effect upon the taxpayers of the new rates, it is necessary to include the income taxes of the States, and examples are given in a printed statement, which will be handed to honourable members later in the day. That the income taxes of Australia have reached high rates is shown by the following comparison with those in Great Britain . In each case the highest State rate has been included. The British tax on the higher incomes is the [265] same for property as for personal exertion.

104,Mr WATT,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,There are many direct taxes in existence there.,40
105,Mr RODGERS,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,But there is no land tax. The lottery,40
106,Mr WATT,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"Yes, "" there is an I m perial land tax, but it is not based on the same principle as ours. At present I am comparing only one form of direct taxation with the corresponding form which exists in Great Britain . On the lower incomes, the. British impost is much heavier than the combined taxes in Australia. On taxable income of £ 1 0 0 The English rate for earned income is 2s. 3d. in the £ 1 , and for unearned is 3s. in the £ 1 . The The Commonwealth and State rates for personal exertion vary from 7^d. to ls. 4^d; and for property they vary from 7|d. to ls. 8|d. On taxable income of £1,000The English rate for earned income is 3s. in the £ 1 , and for unearned is-3s. 9d. i u the £ 1 . The Commonwealth and State rates for personal exertion run. from ls. 3Jd. to ls. 10£d.; and for property they run from 2s. to 2s. Sd. The The Government recognises that the income tax now proposed will be a serious burden upon the community, but feels sure that the people will cheerfully bear it as part of the cost of maintaining the independence of Australia. There may be differences of opinion, quite irrespective or inclusive of party, as to whether the proposals of the Government are the best that are possible in all the circumstances of the case,- and I take this opportunity of saying very briefly, particularly to my friends opposite who criticised some other forms of taxatioii emanating from the Budget, that the distinct endeavour I have made in the preparation of tke finance proposals and statement of this year has been to leave room for the operations of next year. It is an easy matter, even nowadays, to prepare a Budget that will make the revenue meet the expenditure, that is to say, bridge the difference by cumulative rises, but in making levies for this year one has to keep in sight what it will be possible to do next year. If ever there was a time in national finance when this is an imperative and inevitable duty, it is the present. Even if the war should stop today, we all recognise now that our war expenditure must proceed for many months, if not for a year or more, at the same considerable rate, and that our war borrowing would have to keep pace with the outgoings here aud overseas, which would mean on top of this year's levy another cumulative rise. In former years, when Treasurers of the Commonwealth or of the States were asked to prepare their balance-sheets and their financial proposals, one step only was enough for Parliament and the A d ministration of the day, but at the present time it would be criminal folly to merely take a glimpse at one year's operations. There ought to be no party or politics in regard to finance. The more honourable members, irrespective of party feelings, will attempt to study this question, the more they will see that room has been left for operations, whoever may be compelled to conduct them,- next year, aud possibly the year afterwards; and close study of the resources of Australia should not discourage us in the belief that the Commonwealth can support the indebtedness which falls upon it as the result of this war. We are still a very wealthy people, with vast diffused wealththat is easily mobilizable, and we are becoming accustomed to credit in such an extraordinary way that what was not money or a mobilizable asset previously has now by the general use of the operations of banking institutions become as available to us as if it were actually coin.",40
107,Mr WEST,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,We are beginning to teach you something.,41
108,Mr WATT,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"The honourable member Commonwealth Treasury, out of the clarity of his wisdom has decribed my finance as "" muddle,"" but I hope history will write him down as having been wrong, so that it may not write me down as having been wrong. I am not a believer in dogmatizing on these matters, but I am a believer in talking frankly to a Committee of Supply or Ways and Means, and in telling honourable members what my researches lead me to believe. It is in that spirit that I recommend the Bill as a healthy and necessary measure, and one which I hope the people, when they understand it , will cheerfully accept.",41
109,Mr TUDOR,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,I think it is the wish of honourable members to have a rough Hansard proof of the Treasurer's speech made available before the Committee deals further with the Government's proposals.,41

That platform was drawn up a S3 Australin . by a conference of delegates selected by Wester n a j Victori at Grea t . the people controlling the Labour moveSout h Australia. eft Britain . o H ment throughout Australia, and each and 3 1 every person who desired to take up polid. d. d. d. £ per £ per £ tical honours in the interests of the 5 2 3-3 27 Labour party subscribed to it , and was 5 2-3 4-4 27 told that, provided he adhered to the 5 2-8 5-2 27 5 3-3 5-B 27 platform for three years, no one could say 5-4 3-9 0-3 27 him nay, or remove him from the posi6 8 6-9 7-6 36 tion he held if he succeeded in being 0 4 24-4 13-3 30 B-7 28-3 17-2 30 14 -1 85'8 15-3 100-5 elected to Parliament.

Mr HIGGS - Of course there is.",42
112,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Where is it ? I have listened most attentively to the speeches delivered from the Opposition benches. One honourable member speaks SECOND READING . with one voice; hisneighbour speaks with another. How many honourable members opposite will endorse the platform of the . honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) ? I admire that honourable member, because he says distinctly what he means, and is not afraid to set before the people the platform in which he believes. How many men are there on the Opposithe tion benches representing constituencies such as mine which are not absolutely have Labour seats, who would support the platform laid down by the honourable Not one of them would do so. But why does not the honourable member - create a party of his own, instead of tacking himself on to the Labour party? Is vothe not aware that, prior to 1914, memof the Labour party were opposed by has gentlemen following the same lines of thought as he does today, and with the I same policy which he enunciates ? They called themselves Socialists. To-day we find them sitting side by side with their parold opponents, and each man has his own distinct platform. In an endeavour to prove that the Labour platform does not exist, I shall quote freely, not from my own views ou this important but from the utterances of members sitting opposite. dreadful war broke out, the Labour party was a united body, and there was no need for preferential voting, because the two parties in the House were evenly leaving no room for Independents, shown by the results of the different elections. That state of affairs does not exist today. Parties in the House are split up into fragments. The old Labour party no longer exists. In fact, it is unknown. I believe that there are some honourable members opposite who still adhere to the views which they when members on this side were associated with them'. They still display a little bit of the courage that they had in the old days. Not long ago, I was delighted to read a manifesto by the New South Wales of the Opposition, in which distinctly declared that they not be bound by the little that now controls"" the remnant the old Labour party of That party is controlled today, not by the great mass of the workers but by one or two individuals in each of the States. In New South Wales today, Mr Boote, editor of the Sydney has set himself up as the Messiah of the Labour movement, and has declared, that out of it he will build something I do not know Mr Boote, but his writings suggest that he is the very personification of the chief character in Gcesar's Goiumn, a book that was written in reply .to Bellamy's Looking Backward.",42
113,Mr CONSIDINE,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,He is a good man.,43
114,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"As to that I - shall call the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Nicholls) to bear witness. This Csesar-this great Messiah of the new Labour movement-wh o claims to be whiter than snow, and purer than any member of Parliament, in criticising members of the Opposition who have had the courage to issue a manifesto giving expression to their views with regard to the ballot on the Perth Conference recruiting resolution, wroteAnd the politicians of that day will no more think of issuing manifestoes to influence our decision - than of tossing a handful of pebbles into the sea to change the course of the tides. question, honourable Who is this Mr Boote that he should Until this dictate to the representatives of the people? Who is he that he should sit in judgment on honourable members generally ? We can find an answer to this in divided, quiry in a speech made by the honourable as was member for Macquarie at. a local Eight Hours banquet, and reported in the Lithgow Mercury of 16th instant. This report sets forth that Mr Nicholls here made a statement regarding the editor of the Worker, and on being told ""by Mr Garden and Mr Carroll that the statement was not true, remarked that he would held resign his seat in the morning if Mr Boote could prove that he had never worked while his journalistic comrades were on'strike. Was Mr Boote a strike breaker in Queensland twenty-five years ago ? I have issued no information of my own on the submembers ject, but it must be assumed that he was, they otherwise the honourable member for Macwould quarie would by now have placed his coterie- resignation in your hands, Mr Speaker. of The report goes on to state thatAustralia. (It is understood that, later, Mr Nicholls handed his resignation to Mr Garden on the outside, terms stated.) He added that throughout his career no finger of scorn could be pointed at him in that regard. (Mr Garden: You will Worker, lose Macquarie.) Mr Nicholls: Well, if I do I carried my swag before I.got into Parliament, and, if necessary, I can do it again. (Mr. Carroll: The same old gag.) great. I have referred to this incident to illustrate the necessity for the introduction of preferential voting- a system which will enable men with the courage of the honourable member for Macquarie to fight a clean fight where the workers desire them to seek election to Parliament. By means of preferential voting we shall be able to deprive this self-appointed Messiah of the Labour movement of the power to determine who shall, and who shall not, stand for election to Parliament in the interests of the workers. Under such a system the people themselves will alone determine who shall represent them. Where there are many political parties preferential voting is necessary to afford all sections an opportunity to secure representation. Mr CarToll, who is evidently a gentleman in authority at L it h gow, said, as reported in the Lithgow Mercuryire was a member of what was known as the extreme industrial wing of the movement. In the Federal sphere a number of members of the Labour party had endeavoured to create a split by tlieir ill-advised action in regard to the recruiting ballot. They had advised the leagues and unions to vote contrary to the request of the Perth Conference. This the industrialists at any rate resented, especially as in the past they had looked in vain for a lead from the politicians, who in no sense lo.d the movement, and in some instances did not fairly represent it. This again shows the necessity for a preferential voting system, and although honourable members of the Opposition have not the courage to publicly say so, I know that they welcome the proposal.",43
115,Mr NTOHOLLS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Is the honourable member discussing the Perth Conference resolutions, or the Electoral Bill ?",44
116,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I am replying to the statement made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr . Mathews) that preferential voting was unnecessary since we had in Australia only two political parties. I am proving out of the mouths of members of the Opposition that preferential voting is necessary, because there are more than two political parties in Australia, and because even the Official Labour party is divided within itself. I am showing that that solidarity of which we hear so much in connection with the Official Labour movement does not in reality exist. Speaking at the Lithgow demonstration to which I bave already referred, the honourable member for Macquarie gave further evidence in support of preferential voting, so that every man seeking election to Parliament may secure a fair deal . The report goes on to state that Mr Nicholls, in response, said he had attended that demonstration as a humble limeburner, as a representative of a great industrial organization, and as a member of Parliament. He would not have made reference to his action in connection with the recruiting ballot had not Mr Carroll done so; but he would say at once that the ballot as distributed to the State leagues and unions was a distorted, dishonourable, and disreputable one. Such statements show that preferential voting will be very useful to courageous men seeking the suffrages of the people. The honourable member continuedThey had not-the ballot at all, only a section of it, and he claimed he had as much right to ask members to vote "" No "" as the Political Labour League executive had to request them to vote "" Yes."" He claimed the right as a man who, for the past ten years, had been the representative of an industrial union, and as one who had. carried out his duties as honourably as a man could. If they disapproved of his action and thought he had done something detrimental to the movement, they had a perfect right to put him out. \Vhen he asked the people to give him their votes he pledged himself to voluntary recruiting, and he had a right to stick to that agreement; but if the ballot was decided as the Political Lahour League executive apparently desired, it meant that any man who went on the recruiting platform was a scab. I wish now to show how necessary it is to protect members of Parliament from in terference by men like Mr Boote. Referring to the manifesto issued in opposition to the Perth Conference recruiting resolutions-no t by those members of the old Labour party, who followed the present Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), but by honourable members who still belong to the Official Labour party, and who had publicly declared themselves against conscription, but in favour of voluntary recruiting- Mr Boote wroteAnd when this "" manifesto"" tells us that to vote ""Yes"" would give the Government the alternative of introducing conscription by regulation of Statute law, we can neither admire the intelligence that put forth such a rotten argument, nor the spirit that moves them to prompt the Government to violate its solemn pledges to the country. "" But so long as we stand firmly together they ean do no harm, nor do I imagine for a moment they have any such intention."" Nevertheless, the issuing of their manifesto "" in opposition t.o the recommendation of the Inter-State Conference, is a serious blunder, suggestive of an inflated, sense of self-importance, and the sooner they realise it and get their own measurements more correctly, the better it will be for them and all concerned."" ¥ h at is choice language to be used by a man whose writings sink into insignificance when compared with those of Robert Blatchford and Sidney Webb, lecturer in political economy at the London University, or with those of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Higgs), who at one time did journalistic work in the interests of Labour. What right has this man to say that members of the Opposition have no intelligence merely because they dare to differ from him? This man Boote preaches, not Democracy, but the worse form of autocracy. He would take to himself the right to determine who should be returned to this Parliament. In words, no man seeking to represent Labour should be returned unless he bears Mr Boote's hall mark. The honourable member for Macquarie is to be commended for the stand he has taken in opposition to such Kaiserism. Mr. Boote is more autocratic than the Kaiser himself.  others. Mr LAI ED SMITH - The Assistant Minister has used a term I should not care to use, and if it appears in Hansard it must be as coming from him. Mr Boote has a heavy load to carry; and I wonder if those gentlemen who expelled the Prime Minister and others, including myself, from the Labour Party, will inquire into his conduct-whethe r they will treat him as we were treated.",44
117,Mr SPEAKER,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,- I must ask the honourable member not to go into that matter.,45
118,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) stated that on one occasion, when he was exercising the franchise on a station, the squatter who presided tried to influence his vote. When that statement was made. I interjected that the squatter at the time was a public officer, and should have been reported and dealt with. But the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn) has informed us that there is no complaint of the kind in the Electoral Office.  squatters have never intimidated their hands in the matter of the vote ?",45
119,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I am not going to say anything about that matter, except that, in my opinion, the honourable memblr for Darling (Mr Blakeley) is altogether mistaken. As a member of the Electoral Commission I travelled throughout Australia-no t only in the big cities, the smaller towns and hamlets. We infigure; quired into allegations of corruption the elections, and though these were probed to the very core, not one was stantiated. On the contrary, we found party. that the Electoral Office is controlled - by gentlemen who are above suspicion; in deed, I would be quite willing to contest my constituency without employing a scrutineer. The electoral officers who were examined by the Commission were asked other some very keen pertinent questions, and every question was satisfactorily answered. The fact that the Electoral Oflice came out of an ordeal of this kind with flying colours leads me to think that the honourable member for Darling is. not correct in saying that some one attempted to intimidate him, and that when he made a complaint no notice was taken on of it. Mr CONSTDIN.E - Are you inferring that the honourable member for Darling (Mr. Blakeley) was telling a lie ?",45
120,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"In the face of my experience I cannot understand why this squatter-if he did make an attempt of the kind-wa s not prosecuted. If the honourable member had at the time made a straight-out clear statement, I believe that the Chief Electoral Officer would have taken action at once. Let me remind honourable members that the Labour party was in power at the .time this is said to have occurred.  Mr LAIR D SMITH - It happened during the referenda.",45
121,Mr G,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,LYNST - There is no official record of such an incident. I have had the matter twice inquired into. In every cnse where information has come to the office prosecution has resulted. Even a member of Parliament was prosecuted.,45
122,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley), and, I believe, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), alleged that this Bill was being put through when 400,000 men are at the Front.",45
123,Mr TUPOK,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I did not say there are - 400,000- I said that we were asked to decide this when the soldiers are away. Mr LAIR D SMITH - I think the honbut in orable member for Darling gave that and it is to me remarkable th-t a at more important vote than that on this Bill is now being taken by plebiscite subthroughout Australia by the Labour  States.",45
124,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"That is so. L it t l e . Tasmania, for one, has stood out of this vote, notwithstanding what the Labour paper, The World, formerly the Daily Post, said in its leading article column on the 4th September last. In that article there occurred the following: Referendum involves a choice-it involves ft free clioice-libert y to say Yes, and liberty to say No. Consequently since it would be in no sense disloyal to utilize that liberty to vote cither Yes or No, it is not disloyal to advise either Yes or No. But members of Parliament who advise No must take full responsibility for the fact that they are recommending the opposite course to that recommended by Conference; they are asking that members of the organization should prefer their recommendation to that of Conference. For the reason given they may perhaps be within thoir strict rights, since a choice of policy is specifically remitted by Conference to the organization ""for decision. ' But the advice is distinctly hazardous, and is most unlikely to be accepted. What does the writer mean hy that i The explanation was given last night by a member at a Union Smoke Social, when he said, ""Oppose every one of the m "" ; that is where the "" acid "" will be put on. This shows the necessity for preferential voting, so that a man who is true to his principles and platform may be free before the electors whatever The World or The Worker may say. Listen to the criticism on some of the members of the Labour party who are representatives in this HouseThe Labour movement is going to be guided in the future less by leaders and politicians, and more by sense."" And if the telegraphed sumimnry of the views of the dissentient New South Wales Federal members is a just summary of their statement there is not much sense in what they say. Does that not show the necessity for the Bill before us? I notice that another gentleman opposite, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson), who would doubtless be glad of a preferential vote when he goes before the electors, has expressed the opinion that the decision of the Perth Conference was "" unnecessary and unfortunate."" I do not think that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) cares much whether or not there is"" preferential voting. the He was very careful, in his speech, to get out of the r a in ; but, unfortunately, he has got under only a b it of a parasol, and not a good stout umbrella; his head may be dry, but I am afraid that his feet will get very wet. His view is expressed in the following newspaper extract: His own view ns to the ballot had been given at the Perth Labour Conference, although he was not a delegate fo that Conference. Mr Tudor will make a further statement tomorrow on the general position created by the action of the New South Wales Federal members. I have not seen that promised statement.",46
125,Mr TUDOR,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Yes , I made it .",46
126,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I am afraid the honourable member is like the ostrich which puts its head in the sand; he is still in danger, and the time may come when he, like myself and others, will be asked for an explanation, by the Labour party.",46
127,Mr TUDOR,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I will run straight, at all events, and not go hanging around the Employers Federation!",46
128,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I am sure the honourable member will not make such a suggestion in regard to any honourable member on this side. Had I been one likely to hang to the "" apron-strings "" of anybody, I should have hung to the honourable member when he had not the courage to do what the Prime Minister and others did. He cannot accuse me of hanging on to anybody.",46
129,Mr TUDOR,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,You cannot accuse me of uot sticking to my opinions.,46
130,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"This amending Bill , if it goes through, will be most usef u l to many honourable members opposite. At one time in the history of this House there was a proposal to increase the salaries of honourable members, and some representatives were against it . I do not think, however, that"" those honourable members were anxious that the motion should be negatived; and so it is with some honourable members in regard to preferential voting. They are opposing the Bill , but they are praying all the time that it might become law.",46

133,Mr WATKINS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Yes .,47

' I notice that the honourable member was also careful to "" come in out of the rain,' ' and with amuch bigger umbrella than that used by his Leader (Mr Tudor). I believe there is necessity for this Bill now, although that was not so in 1914. At the present time there are not only two parties in this House; indeed, it would be hard to say how many parties there are, or what may happen when we go before the electors. Under the party system of today, we can give the electors a fair deal only by carrying this measure. Look at the state of things in the Swan division.",47
135,Mr CONSIDINE,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,That hurts.,47
136,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Probably we shall have another member in this House representing a minority of the electors in the constituency for which he sits, a chum for my hpnora.ble friend. No wonder that he is jubilant. They will sit side by side until they have to appeal to the electors under a system of preferential voting, and what will the result be then ? I understand the opposition of the honourable member for Barrier to this measure. He has no desire that the people shall be able to vote effectively. Reference has been made to the complication of the voting arrangements. Personally I dislike having two systems, and I ask what is to prevent the electors from marking the Senate voting ballot-papers ' 1 , "" "" 2 , "" "" 3 , "" the same value being given to each vote. There is not much fear of that system not being understood  Douglas, when the first Commonwealth election in Tasmania was conducted under the Hare system, it was found, according to a joint report of the Retuminar Officer ancl of the Government Statistician, that the percentage of in valid papers was 1.44 per cent, for the Senate and 1.88 per cent, for the House of Representatives. I take that statement from an excellent paper on, the Hare-Clark system, summarizing an address given at Newtown, Tasmania, before the local branch of the Australian Natives Association. The Hare-Clark system was at that time new in Tasmania, and the facts j u s t if y the belief that we have nothing to fear in adopting it . The electors have sufficient intelligence to know how to record their votes-under it . Very able articles have appeared in the press concerning the introduction of proportional voting for the Senate at the same time as preferential voting for this House. I should have no objection to it could it be shown that the counting of votes would not take more than a reasonable length of time.",47
137,Mr TUDOR,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,It would occupy two or three years.,47
138,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"At a mock election in Tasmania, when there were only four candidates and a small number of persons voting, it took nine counts to reach finality, and to determine which candidate was properly elected.",47
139,Mr TUDOR,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,At the last election for th© Tasmanian Parliament there were forty-three distinct counts.,47
140,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,But the counting was all done in three or four days. What does a little delay matter if the system is fair?,47
141,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,The only objection I see to the system is that in a great State like New South Wales the necessary counting may cause delay.,47
142,Mr TUDOR,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Absen t votes are recorded all over Australia, some of which would not reach the Returning Officers within less than six weeks, and it would not be u n t i l the last of these had been received that a start could be made to divide up.",47
143,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"If it can be shown that the counting can be done effectively and well within a limited time, I see no objection to proportional voting. The Royal Commission, of which I was a member, inserted this paragraph in its report with the unanimous approval of the members- . (13) The electoral law should not he forged as a party weapon, but should aim at making it possible for every elector to record his vote. Apparently, about 77,000 electors were unable to vote at the elections in consequence of the abolition of postal voting facilities, many of whom would he the mothers of our people, fulfilling the noblest duties of life, and would have a keener personal interest in the government of the country than many who recorded votes. We therefore suggest the amendment of the Act to provide for postal voting prior to the day of election, with sufficient statutory safeguards.",47
144,Mr EICHABD FOSTER,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,The evidence in support was overwhelming.,48
145,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Yes . over, some of the members of the Commission were approached personally on the subject. Women canvassers saw me, and expressed regret that there was no provision in the law under which electors who could not go to the polling booths could exercise the suffrage. They asked me to do my best on the Commission and in Parliament to alter the law in that respect. Those who are prevented by sickness or other unavoidable circumstances from going to the polling booths should be allowed to record their votes in some other* way. I welcome the re-introduction of postal voting, and the Minister is to bo commended for the manner in which he has provided for it . Possibly, in Committee, the safeguards may strengthened, but great care has been exercised in providing for them. moving the second reading, the Minister (Mr Glynn) saidUnder the old law, which was repealed in 1011, the authorized witness was bound to post the vote to the Returning Officer. Under this Bill the envelope must be handed back to the elector, and he is subject to a penalty if he does not post it to the Returning Officer. It is'the duty of the latter to keep a numericallymarked list of all postal certificates and papers sent out by him. I think that strict precautions against fraud have been taken, but, no doubt, the Minister will consider suggestions for increasing them. I am of the opinion that in the interests of the Commonwealth postal voting should be passed into law.  though fifty-three of the seventy-five members of this House sit on the Treasury benches, they are not satisfied with the existing electoral law, and wish to amend it so as to wipe out the Opposition altogether ",48

However, the Government has a force sufficiently strong On to pass through both Houses of this Parliament any measure that it may choose to submit-electoral , financial, defence, or any other. But I ask Ministers why they are not prepared to try on the dog what they propose to give to the pup. If preferential voting is good enough for the House of Representatives, surely it is good enough for the Senate. The ballotsenators, however, have said that if it is applied to the Senate they will throw out the whole Bill . The honourable member for Denison (Mr . Laird Smith) said that he'was in favour of postal voting, and that people had waited on him when he was travelling with the Electoral Commission and asked for the privilege of voting by post when they were sick.

The manager replied, "" Every one, sir."" At that time, the votes counted wherever they were recorded. Unfortunately for Mr Bunning, he received only one vote on the station, and every man in the locality claimed that he had recorded it . Bunning said, "" I cannot believe any of you, so I will sack the l o t . "" That was the last of the policy of intimidation on the stations, because the first Electoral A ct passed by this Parliament-and I give credit to the present Minister for Home and Territories for his share in framing what was a very good, although not quite perfect, Act-provided that all boxes containing less than 100 votes must be sealed and sent to the Returning Officer, and by him mixed with other votes before they were counted. That prevented the station-owner knowing how his employees had voted. We had' a rough time in the early days of the Labour movement.",49

Do not let us fool ourselves over the matter. were We know very well how these votes are obtained. We know the tales canvassers tell. On one occasion, I heard my own character from a woman at Toowoomba. 1 asked her did she know the man to whom she was referring? She said that she had known him all his life, and that everything he had made was got by gambling and by taking people down. In fact, she described him as being a regular speiler. She was referring to myself. If we prevent individual canvassing for postal votes, we shall remove as much danger as possible, and make voting by post as pure as - voting at the ballot-box.",50

When I remember the vicissitudes through which we have passed since 1S91, it is a marvel to me that we are here at all.

He ' was wearing bowyangs, a belt, a shirt, and no coat, and two or three hairs were sticking out through a hole in his hat. The cartoon bore the words: "" This is how Australia is going to be ruled."" In passing, I wish to show what has been done by the Labour party. Australia would have been in a queer pickle had it not been for,the Labour party's policy in regard to the "" tin-pot"" Navy, about which the Liberal Opposition talked so much. Although hairs were sticking out through holes in our hats, and although our boots were hobnailed, we had brains enough to do something for the land of our birth or our adoption, and we practically saved Australia for the Empire.",52

This gives rise to another difficulty. Out of three candidates for one electorate there might bo only one whom an elector considered to be worthy of a moment's consideration. He might regard the other two as political wasters. In such circumstances, why should he be compelled to vote for all three candidates in two of whom he had absolutely no confidence?",52

The people sent us here, and I say quite candidly that the system that has been good enough for the people up to the present time is good enough for me. I have no fault to find with it",53
180,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,A proposal for a preferential ballot was introduced in this House in 1906.  that occasion the honourable gentleman spoke hour after hour on the advantages of the preferential voting system.,53

The honourable gentleman, from the inception of Federation, has consistently advocated proportional representation, and but for the immense majorities that Labour has secured on different occasions, he would, no doubt, before now have charmed us into the adoption of the proportional representation system. Discussing it on one occasion, he declared that under it the fellow who came along seeking election to this House after we had been here for a few years, would have no possible chance against the sitting member. I was unable, however, to "" swallow "" that. I was satisfied with the system we had then in vogue, and I am satisfied with it now. I do not tliink that the adoption of preferential voting will help to put me out of Parliament, so thab in the opposing it I am not actuated by any personal consideration. I take the view that the less complicated our electoral machinery is the better it will be for the people. As the honourable member for Wakefield said. "" I am for the people every time . "" The honourable member is a great Democrat, and desires to secure the true value of every vote, but just so far as to put him back into Parliament.

I do not wonder at every honourable member wishing to say something on this measure, for many of us, if it be passed, may be singing our "" swan .song."" ' I know it is a forlorn hope to oppose the postal vote as it is provided for in the Bill . The late Charles Cameron Kingston used to say, "" Y o u can talk and talk ; so long as 1I have the numbers I do not want to talk at all "" ; and that is the present position in a nut-shell. believe all Ministers have an idea of i mproving the electoral machinery, and some of it needs amendment; but, taking everything in to consideration, I think our Electoral Act compares favourably with that of any of the States. Does it not seem an anomaly and an injustice to the taxpayers of Australia that we should have seven Electoral Offices in this country? There is a State Electoral Department and also a Commonwealth Electoral Department in each of the States, though I am pleased to know that the Minister has great hopes of bringing all the different Departments under one head. I know that the honourable gentleman has advocated a ref orm of this kind for years, and at one time was sanguine as to the States joining with the Commonwealth and operating on one roll. If the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) desires to do something for the people for whom he is so anxious, he will strive to get South Australia to do as has been done in Tasmania, where a combined roll has been found to work well. If the Federal and State electoral systems are not exactly the same, the difficulty can, as the M in ister has told us, be overcome by distinguishing the Federal and State voters by a star, or asterisk. The cost of compiling the rolls runs into hundreds of thousands of pounds, and much saving will result from a joint roll. Federation was being advocated, the great argument was the expense that would be saved. We were told that, with a H i gh Court for Australia, some of the State Courts would be done away with, or so deprived of business that the number of Judges could be reduced.",53

190,Mr JOWETT,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Can the honorablo mem  It is monstrous that we should have these different systems. Look, for instance, at the money spent in connection with the income taxes. A reform in this connection would not benefit the CommonWealth only, but the whole of the States - the whole community. If the people When are ripe for a desirable change, they wil l make the States take action. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) many years ago preached Unification throughout the land, bu t I , for one, would never do anything to cause one of the States, small or large, to lose its identity; this must be preserved and maintained. If , however, the States will not come into line there should be some way of compelling them.",54
191,Mr RODGERS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"There is the difficulty that in less than two years the financial arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States will cease, and the States may have to impose direct taxation in order to live.  bane I told some State Ministers that a change might come much sooner than 'they expected, and that they would be compelled to j o in in an arrangement with the Commonwealth. The State expenditure, as apart from that of the Commonwealth, is going ahead by leaps and bounds, instead of being reduced. The cost of the compilation of the rolls is an instance of unnecessary expenditure. On cne occasion in Brisbane I saw a policeman on one side of the street taking names for the Commonwealth roll, and another policeman on the other side collecting names for the State roll. It is only fair to say that each side of the street was in a different district; nevertheless, tliere was the fact of this duplication, and unless we do something the expanse will go on as in the past. I know that it is of no use opposing the postal vote, but I impress on the .Minister that if he desires to make it secureand no man desires to deprive the sick and infirm of the franchise-the Government will make it a penal offence to canvass anybody for such a vote. election in Queensland a whole bunch of justices of the peace-hundred s in one day-were gazetted, and for what? To go round canvassing for postal votes. We do not desire any such scandal in connection with the Commonwealth. This incident made every one in Queensland afrai d of the postal vote; in fact, those who were responsible found their action recoil \ipon them to sueh an extent that the Government was put out of office. The postal vote is aU right long as it is properly and honestly safeguarded and worked; it is canvassers that cause the trouble. am sure that if the Minister (Mr Glynn) were behind the door sometimes when Labour canvassers, especially ladies, are afc work, and heard his own character discussed, he would not think he was the same man.",55

I regard electoral Bills as non-party measures, and I do not think that any honourable member wishes to take an advantage over another-thoug h nowadays it would seem that everything is party. A few weeks ago a young lady, who asked me what my politics were, was surprised at my reply that I had no politics. She thought that a man without politics was like a dog without a tail. I am pleased that the Bill does not take from the sons and daughters of aliens the right to vote should they be over twenty-one years of age. I trust that, with help from both sides, the Bill will emerge from Oommittee a credit to Ministers ancl to members alike. MT. GREGORY (Dampier) [5.52] When the honourable member for  speech he seemed to be in strong opposition to almost every clause of the measure, but I think that when he realizes that in regard to several matters he was mistaken, the Bill will receive his 'support in Committee. In deed, he has promised to support it. After the experience of the past few days, will any one say that our electoral methods are satisfactory? At the present time there are a number of political parties in Australia. There are the Official Labour party, the National Labour party, and the National Liberal party-no w joined in the National Federation-the Country party, the Returned Soldiers party, the Prohibitionist party, and others. Are we going to so frame our law that only two parties can successfully present candidates for election? The Swan division, which was represented by the late Lord Forrest, is now to be represented by a man who has received only about 6,000 of the 18,000 votes polled at the election- a preposterous state of affairs, which should not be allowed to continue. We must devise some method whereby the representation of the people will be more equitable. The most important part of an Electoral Bill is that providing the machinery for enrolment. The Constitution and the Electoral Act are the foundation of Parliament, and we should endeavour to provide that every person qualified for enrolment shall be enrolled, and that no person can be enrolled more than once. The ing law leaves the door open to unscrupulous agents and organizers. Time after time. I have noticed that, within a day or two of the issue of a writ for an election, an enormous number of claims is sent to the various Electoral Registrars. I do not blame one party more than another for this. It is the result of party organisation. Those names are placed on the rolls whether the applications are justified or not. In my opinion, a revision Court sliould deal with enrolment. Our electoral law has been in force since 1901. We have provided for compulsory enrolment, with a penalty for failure to enroll, and there is no reason why every qualified person should not have his name on the roll. To further facilitate enrolment, young persons about to come of age and immigrants who had been in the country for three months should be allowed to apply for enrolment three months before the date on which they will become entitled to exercise the franchise. These applications should'go before a revision Oourt, the elector not having to attend unless his enrolment was objected to.",55
196,Mr NICHOLLS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,How would the revision Courts be constituted ?,56
197,Mr GREGORY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"The ordinary police magistrates could act. At the present time a man may apply to be enrolled for a Melbourne division, stating that his name is already on the roll for, say, Ballarat or Bendigo. The Department thereupon puts his name on the roll on the division for which he seeks enrolment, and then sends word to Ballarat or to Bendigo that his name is to be taken off the roll there. But it may never have been on that roll, and he may have been enrolled for Geelong or some other place. A name should not be placed on a new roll until it has been taken off the old roll.",56
198,Mr GLTNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,The card index in every State checks the whole roll.,56
199,Mr GREGORY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Objectio n has been taken to the system of proportional voting on the score of trouble and delay, but surely the card system of checking will cause worse delay. I know that the card system, if well operated, is a fairly good one, but in regard to such an enrolment as that of, say, John Smith, working on exist- railway construction in some remote place, a signature difficult to decipher, and no definite address, it must happen that names get on and are kept on a number of rolls.",56
200,Mr NICHOLLS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"What the honourable member suggests would, in many cases, cause delay, bringing about disfranchisement.",57
201,Mr GREGORY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,I do not think so. I object strongly to the sending in of an enormous number of claims for enrolment on the eve of an election.,57
202,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,That does not occur under the Federal system.,57
203,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"A table is placed at the street corner, and any one's name is taken.",57
204,Mr GREGORY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Thousand s of names have been added at the last moment. No doubt there are only a few persons unscrupulous enough to attempt to manipulate the electoral rolls, but it is done. Then a great many duplications occur through carelessness. A man moving from one constituency to another gets enrolled for them all in turn. At a recent election there were more names on the electoral roll than there were adults in Australia.",57
205,Mr RILEY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Postal voting will help people to vote for more than one division.,57
206,Mr GREGORY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Frau d is much more possible under the absent voting provisions than under the postal voting provisions. I do not know that it is necessary to make provision, for the soldiers' vote consolidating measure such as this, but something should have been said regarding the franchise of soldiers.",57
207,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"The voting of soldiers is provided for by the War-time Electoral Act. _ Mr GREGORY - If you let boys of eighteen fight for you, while you keep in the Defence Department big, strapping young men who will not volunteer"", should give them the privilege of voting.  fight for the country, he is old enough to vote.",57
208,Mr GREGORY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I would give the soldier two votes. I hope that in Committee an effort will be made to extend the right to vote to every soldier, no matter what his age. I have always favoured postal voting, though I think that strong safeguards are required. I agree with the honourable member for Maranoa that it should be a penal offence to tout for votes, particularly for postal votes. I know that the Minister keenly desires to provide for the clean conduct of elections, and he might consider whether he could not amend the measure, so as to make it a penal offence for any person to tout or to associate himself with touting for postal votes. I represent the biggest constituency in Australia, and perhaps the biggest constituency in the world. Many of my constituents have gone out into the Never-Never country, and, in view of their hardships, deserve every consideration. It is impossible for a station or a business to be left without some one in charge. Some of the booths in the Dampier Division are 60 or 80 miles apart, and others are separated by even greater distances on the Pilbarra and Gascoyne fields. A man, his wife, and two or three employees cannot all get away at the same time, even though there may be a polling booth within 15 miles of the homestead. I should have preferred to see the right given to vote by post to electors residing 10 miles from a polling booth. Will any one say that the sick, or mothers and prospective mothers, should be disfranchised? There are 140,000 births in Australia during a year. Why should a third of that numin a ber of mothers-o r say 47,000 women-be disfranchised by being unable to vote by post? The Labour party acknowledged the principle of postal voting when it provided that seamen and others who anticipated being on the water on pollingday should be able to vote by post. The seaman can go to the Registrar and' record his vote. The system is good, provided that it is properly safeguarded. you Mr MATHEWS - Seame n who are not. leaving Australia cannot get a vote.",57
209,Mr GREGORY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Any man, whether he be a passenger or a seaman, who can make a declaration that he will be on thewater on polling day is allowed to vote. Thereby the principle of the postal voteis admitted by the Labour party. Mir. CONSIDINE - That .system is on all-fours with the absent vote.",57
210,Mr GREGORY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Nothin g of the sort. I do not like absent voting. There can be ten times more fraud under that provision than under any other portion of the Act. I have had a good deal of experience of preferential voting in Western Australia, where the system has been in operation for a long time. Lately I have been studying the electoral methods operating in different countries, and I think that the preferential voting system is far ahead of any other as a means of affording every section in the community an opportunity of sending its representative to the poll. No otlier system appears to do that. At present men are returned by merely a relative majority. Can anybody justify a system which gives such a result as that in the Swan by-election, held on Saturday ? If the votes polled for the two parties were at all approximate it might be argued that the number of candidates reduced the majority of the successful Labour representative, and that, had only two candidates gone to the poll, he would still have won. But it is clear from the polling in the Swan electorate that the majority of the electors were in favour of the return of a National party representative.",58
211,Mr CONSIDINE,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Not necessarily.,58
212,Mr GREGORY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"The honourable member need only study the polling in Swan electorate,- in connection, with the last Senate election to discover the prethe preferential system. ponderance of National party supporters in that constituency. I suppose the fact that Mr Corboy was a returned soldier gave him a little additional support, probably there has been, as there always is between any two elections, a little change in public feeling. But. the poll on Saturday was very similar to the pollwhere ing, at the last Senate election, and cannot be the slightest doubt about the National sympathies of the constituency.",58
213,Mr ARCHIBALD,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,An election result of national importance today.,58
214,Mr GREGORY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"It is. In New South Wales, and in many European coun'tries, the second-ballot system is operation. I do not think that there i'ould be any worse electoral method than sent them. that. It opens the door to all sorts of abuse. That is proved by Teport after report. A Committee of the French Chamber of Deputies has reported officially that "" the abolition of the second ballots, with the traffic in votes which they cause, will not be the least of the advantages "" which are expected from the adoption of the system of proportional representation.",58
215,Mr MATHEWS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,What is the nature of the trafficking?,58
216,Mr GREGORY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"If four candidates stand, and none gets an absolute majority, the two leading candidates again stand for election on a later date. In the interim all sorts of corrupt practices are resorted to. One authority which I have been studying records that at the German general elections in 1907 the Social Democrats polled 3,259,029 votes, which entitled them, on a proportional basis, to 115 seats; but the number of seats which they won as the result of the second ballot was only 43; whilst the Centre party, which polled 2,179,743 votes, entitling it to only 77 seats, actually secured 105 seats. It is clearly shown that the practice of one party working in with another party after the first election leads to all sorts of intrigues, which defeat the result which would have been obtained had the first election been conducted on either the the preferential or proportional system. I believe in the compulsory application of When it was first introduced in Western Australia, it was not obligatory on the elector to vote for the candidates in the order of his and preference; but experience showed that compulsion was necessary in order to make the system complete. To-day, compulsion is applied in almost every country the preferential system is in operathere tion, and undoubtedly it has been very effective. Every section in the community is enabled to seud a candidate to the poll. Surely, when we have adult suffrage and is payment of members, in order to enable every class to be represented, it is right that we should provide the most effective means to enable the majority of the in people to return to Parliament the man whom they consider best fitted to repre",58
217,Mr NICHOLLS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,The honourable member does not think that preferential voting will do away with party politics?,59
218,Mr GREGORY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Not at all. A few years ago there were only two parties in Australia-Labou r and Liberal.,59
219,Mr MATHEWS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Why when we all know that the honourable member's party is Conservative?,59
220,Mr GREGORY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"We hear the honourable member talking a great deal about Democracy, but nothing could be more autocratic than the methods of the Labour party. Here is an informative extract from the Brisbane Worker about the attitude taken up by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mx. Einlayson) in regard to the war aims enunciated by the Inter-State Labour Conference in Perth. At this stage, I take exception to honourable members alluding to that gathering as the Perth Conference. was merely a convention held in Perth, and honourable members have no right to throw disgrace upon the most loyal part of Australia by describing it as "" the Perth Conference."" The Brisbane Worker saysWhen he (Mr Finlayson) contends that the acceptance of the war aims laid down by the Convention at Perth means a complete abandonment of the policy of the party as promulgated at the Federal elections last year, we ask, without admitting the fact, what _ of it? The Federal Lahour Convention, which is the body duly constituted for the purpose, is quite entitled to alter the policy, even that promulgated at the Federal elections last year, if it thinks f it , and Mr Finlayson other Labour representative is bound by it . Are we to give the people only a choice between two candidates pre-selected by the National party on the one hand and the Labour party on the other hand, especially when one party says, "" No matter what the candidate may tell you bn the public platform, the Labour machine can alter its policy, and the candidate must do as he is told ? "" Is this Labour's idea of Democracy? The candidate's pledge to the electors becomes contemptuous, and it is scandalous to think that at the present time the electors can choose only between a candidate so bound and one pre-selected by the National Federation. An instance of what happens was afforded by the last Senate election in South Australia. Sir Josiah Symon stood as an independent candidate, but the people voted for one or other of the party tickets. Do honourable members mean to say that if we had had in operation a system of preferential voting Sir Josiah Symon would have finished so low on the poll 1 say Liberal Mr Riley - Does the honourable member advocate proportional voting for the Senate ?",59
221,Mr GREGORY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Most decidedly.,59
222,Mr RODGERS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,This is only the first in stalment of the true reform.,59
223,Mr GREGORY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"The Minister in charge of the Bill , when moving the second reading, saidLegislative and administrative uniformity, simplicity, economy, and clearness ought to be the aim of our legislation. How can simplicity be the aim of this Bill , which requires the elector to enter the box It with two ballot-papers, on one of which he shall signify by numerals the order of his preference, whilst on the other he must indicate his intentions by making a cross against the name of each candidate for whom he intends to vote ? When we are dealing with millions of people, many of whom understand very little of politics aud electoral methods, confusion must result from that dual system. There are two ways of overcoming the difficulty. The first is to divide each State into three divisions for the Senate. I do not think that system would meet with popular favour, but it would be better than and every the present method. Eor the election of senators I would like to see each State cut up into three electorates, observing community of interest as far as possible, and adopting the preferential system of voting. Otherwise we should have proportional representation, for the Senate. Are honourable members opposite satisfied with what has occurred in the past under the block vote? At the 1910 elections, at which eighteen senators were returned, 4,018,119 votes were cast throughout the Commonwealth. Of these votes, Labour candidates polled 2,021,090, or 50.3 per cent., while candidates supported by other parties polled 1.997,029 votes, or 49.7 per cent. The difference between the two parties was only 0.6 per cent., yet Labour secured the whole of the eighteen seats. The opposite result was achieved at the last election, all the seats falling to the National party. Surely a system which can bring about such results is wrong. The only objection to the adoption of proportional voting is said by its opponents to be the enormous delay that will be unavoidable by applying the system to Senate elections, but this is absurd. The supporters of the preferential vote and proportional voting have lately gained a great victory in the British House of Commons by motions carried in connection with the provisions in the Irish Home Rule Bill for proportional representation for the Irish Senate and House of Commons respectively. The following motions were passed: Irish Senate : ""The election of senators in the four provinces, (Ulster, Leinster, Munster and Connaught) shall be according to the principle of proportional representation-the electors being the same electors .as the electors of members returned by constituencies in Ireland .to serve in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and each elector having one transferable vote."" (Carried unanimously in the House of Commons, 31st October, 1912.) Irish House of Commons: "" In any constituency which returns three or four members,' the election shall be the ^principle of proportional representation, and each elector shall have one transferable vote."" (Carried in the House of Commons by 311 votes to 81, 7th January, 1913.) The argument has' been advanced that proportional voting should also be adopted for House of Representatives elections. It might be applicable in Victoria or in New South Wales, where there are large centres of population, but it would be eminently unsatisfactory if applied to Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, and Western Australia. Por instance, Western Australia returns only five members to this House, but they and the three senators standing for election at the same time would be elected on absolutely the same basis if proportional voting applied to the elections of both Houses. The best system of securing justice to the people is to adopt preferential voting. Let me point out my own experience. I had not the slightest desire to become a member of this House, but at the request of the Liberal party m 1913 I consented to contest the Dampier seat. Shortly after coming into the House the double dissolution took place, and when I went back to Western Australia. I found that the Country party were anxious to have me nominate as their candidate, but as that would have entailed my signing a pledge and submitting to pre-selection, I objected.. I must always have absolute freedom, other than my pledges on the public platform. It was a fairly strong organization, and it felt that it was justified in putting up a candidate, but it refrained from doing so, as it realized that if a third candidate was in the field the Labour candidate would be returned. At the next election we came to better terms, and I was accepted as the Country party's candidate as well as the candidate for the National party. Why should not a powerful organization such as the Country party is be entitled to nominate a candidate for election to this House? Why should we stand up to it or any other party with a gun and say, "" Y o u must not put up your man; you must accept our man or go without representation""? Yet that is just what happens in various electorates, and it may happen tc honorheld on able members opposite if they should happen to become divided among themselves. In fixing our electoral laws surely we should do all we can to see that the people are fair l y represented in the National Parliament. Therefore when we are in Committee I hope that we shall have the support of honourable members in framing a measure which will achieve that object.",59

225,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Dalley) [ 7 . 4 5 ] - I am unable to discover any urgent need for the introduction of this measure in time of war. I have been at considerable pains to ascertain whether, at the last general election, any promise was made by the Government to the people of Australia, or to our boys at the Front that, during the course of the war, our electoral system would be amended. I have failed to find any such promise, but, in the course of my investigations, I have discovered a clear and distinct pledge given, not only to those resident in Australia, but to the men who are fighting in the trenches for us, that Labour legislation would remain untouched. During the campaign the Government issued a little paper entitled AU for Australia, and, under the title, which is printed in heavy black type, there appeared the words, "" A newspaper to explain the aims and ob jects of the National W in the War Party (Ministerialists)."" The copy I have before me is dated Thursday, 12th A p r i l , 1917. This little newspaper was distributed broadcast amongst the soldiers in the trenches in Erance, as well as amongst those in camp in England, Egypt, and elsewhere. M.r. TUDOR - It was issued every week for four weeks.",60
226,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"That is so, and was issued as the official organ of the W in the-war party. In it the Win-the-war party made a bid for the soldiers' votes, and in clear, unmistakable language set out what it would do if returned to power.",61

228,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"It was printed in London, and, as I have already said, was distributed amongst our soldiers at the Front. Under the heading, "" Labour Legislation Safe in our Hands,"" there appeared the following statementIf the National Government be returned to power, not one stone in the temple of Labour legislation will be displaced. It is a non-party Government which accepts things as it finds them. There could be no mistaking the intention oOthe Government, and the promise made to the boys who were fighting for us.",61
229,Mr SINCLAIR,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Surely an electoral Bill is not a party measure.,61
230,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"If the honourable member will be patient, I shall make a still further quotation from this newspaper as to the policy of the Win-the-war party. Referring to that party, it went on to sayTt will not touch, except to increase, civil or military pensions, the maternity allowance I tliink I heard something in a Ministerial statement a day or two ago as to the maternity allowanceor the old-age pension. It will not destroy the principle of preference to unionists Are Ministers listening to this statement of their policy ?nor any of the other Acts brought in by the Labour Governments, and it will administer all these measures in a sympathetic spirit.",61

232,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"No . I could give innumerable instances of departures fro m it; but, fortunately for honourable members opposite, Mr Speaker would not allow me at this stage to"" do so. I wish, however, to point out that the Government gave a solemn promise to the thousands of trade unionists and Labour supporters fighting in the trenches that Labour legislation would not be interfered with-that it would be safe in the hands of the Ministerial party.",61
233,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Surely electoral measures do not affect any basic principle of party ?,61
234,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"They strike at the very root of our system of government in was this Australia. It is upon our electoral system that the people are able to return their representatives to Parliament. When our soldiers went to the Front, we had on our statute-book electoral laws passed by the Labour Government. Those electoral laws did not provide for v o t in g by post.",61
235,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,The Labour party was not responsible for our electoral legislation.,61
236,Mr TUDOR,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,We passed an amending Bill.,61
237,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,The basic electoral legis- lation was brought in*by a Liberal A d ministration.,61
238,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,The original electoral laws of the Commonwealth were not brought in by our party because we were riot then in power; but in an amending Bill we removed from our electoral laws what we conceived to be their undemocratic features. One of these was the provision for voting by post. We repealed that part of the Commonwealth electoral law.,61
239,Mr SINCLAIR,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"And so deprived 80,000 people of the opportunity to vote.",61
240,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"That is not the point. The point is that this Bill is an interference with Labour legislation, which the Government at the last general election promised the hoys in the trenches, would not be disturbed.",61
241,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,No soldier taken from the trenches into a hospital today could vote under the electoral law as passed by the Labour party.,62
242,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"The soldiers in the trenches were rightly given the opportunity to vote at the last general election, and if our party had been returned to power w.e should have gone further. H a d we given such a solemn pledge as this to the boys in the trenches - we should have honoured it .",62
243,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,They could not have voted at all if that particular pledge had been kept.,62
244,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,It is useless for the Minister to try to side-step the question. The point is that at the last general election the Ministerial party promised that existing Labour legislation would not be .interfered with.,62
245,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,So far from that statement being correct. I may say that I .never before even heard of the newspaper from which the honourable member has quoted.,62
246,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,It was issued as an official document.,62

253,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,How can the Minister square this promise on the part of the Government with the proposal now before us to substitute preferential voting for the system which was in operation at the last general election?,62
254,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,We gave no pledge.,62
255,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Have I not just quoted the pledge given by the Government?,62
256,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"It was not a pledge; but - even if it was, the honourable member is misreading it , 'because it refers to "" legislation of that class.""",62

If they do, they will see that it is an official publication issued by the Win-the-war party. When the boys went away, the system of voting was by placing a cross against the name of the candidate favoured. Now there is to be an attempt to wipe out that system, so far as this Chamber is concerned. It will be a complete change in the electoral methods which were in vogue when our soldiers departed for the war.  Association of Sydney is clamoring for this system.",62
260,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I shall have something to say about that Returned Soldiers Association in Sydney before many weeks are over. The country is prepared to stand for the legitimate soldier, but not for those who are trying to float into Parliament on the backs of our boys. We shall have something more to say about those gentlemen later on. 7340 Electoral Bill. [REPRESENTATIVES.] I am very pleased that the young man who has just been returned to this Chamber for Swan is a returned soldier. Mr . Corboy stood, at a Western Australian State by-election, for the subdivision of Subiaco last year, under the preferential system of voting; and here is one of the cards which he issued. It statesPrivate E. W. Corboy, selected Labour candidate for Subiaco, who has returned after completing over two years of active service, and has been twice wounded. He now respectfully solicits your No. 1 vote. Here is the point which I desire to make: Mr Corboy, in asking the people to vote"" for him , just put his own name, with No. 1, against it ; and he left it to the public as to whom they should vote for after himself. The other candidates issued a little card, which statedYou are urged to vote for the National candidates in the order of your preference, and to mark the Labour candidate No. 7."" They put on the back of their cards all the names of the candidates. boy's name was put down last, with the numeral 7 against it . No numbers weie placed against any other of the names. As for the boy who had spent two years in the trenches, and had been twice wounded, they said, "" No matter whom you vote for before him ; but for the love of Mike put him last-mar k him 7 . """,62
261,Mr ATKINSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Why should they vote for him if his politics did not suit them ?,63
262,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"If that is the honourable member's view, let him hold his peace about advocating soldiers' parties, and the claims of soldiers. Mr TUDOR. - Hear , hear ! Their politics have got to suit.",63
263,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Of course, they have. It is not a matter of what a man is, but of which party he stands for-for the people or for the exploiters of the people; for the worker or for the people who live on the backs of the workers. That is the only question, and the only test that will be applied. If the Government are determined in their folly to push on with this measure, 1 realise that they have the numbers. In my usual generous manner, therefore, I shall offer a few suggestions, in the hope of improving the Bill . I propose to deal with the measure in a constructive manner. Elecl.oral Bill. Irrespective df partu, we should make our electoral machinery such that the people may freely and full y express their wishes at the elections. A provision for compulsory voting should be introduced. One of the most lamentable things in Australia has been the apathy shown at election time, l t is the duty of the people to go to the polls, and to return the candidates whom they desire sball represent them in the government of the country. It is the duty of Parliament, too, to see that the people shall be compelled to exercise their functions. Why does the Minister in charge of this measure propose to introduce one system of . voting for the Representatives, and to retain the old method for the Senate?",63
264,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Would tha honourable member support proportional representation for the Senate?,63
265,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,I want none of this Mr Corat all while our boys are away. That is the first principle for which I stand. The next is that if the Government are not prepared to stand by their promise they should be compelled to apply the same system to both Chambers.,63
266,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Eo r the Senate you have more than one man returned for one constituency.,63
267,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I am quite aware of that, but that is no real difficulty in the way of applying to the one Chamber what is sought to be applied to ths other. All that would be required for the Senate' would be to make the numerals opposite to the names of any three candidates of exactly the same relative value. If that were done the whole difficulty would be solved. 'The same principle is involved whether the people are asked to vote for one or one dozen candidates, so long as the values to be placed opposite to the names of all are identical. Unless the systems are uniform there will be nothing but confusion from one end of the country to the other on election day, when candidates are to be selected for both Houses of the Federal Legislature. The people will have one set of instructions for the Representatives candidates, and a, totally different set of instructions in the matter of electing Senate candidates. That must be altered, or our whole electoral system will break down. There is much talk concerning why the Government have not proposed to apply preferential voting to the Senate. Dame Rumour haa it that Senate members shook the mailed fist in the face of the Government, and said, "" If you dare to apply this principle to the election of members for the Senate we will apply the order of the boot, quick and lively, to your precious Bill . "" And this was said with such effect, and the mailed fist was shaken so effectively, that the Government decided to leave the Senate out of the business.",63
268,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,I never heard such a thing mentioned except by ihe honourable member and others in this House.,64
269,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"If .the Minister has not heard such a thing he must have been going about blind, deaf, and dumb. The matter is quite open. The members of the Senate themselves make no secret of the fact that Ithey told the Government they would have none of their precious preferential system applied to them. No system shall have my vote unless it is to be applied both to the Senate and to this Houso. The deposit required from a candidate upon nominating for an election should be done away with. It is undemocratic in such a community as ours. difficult for many men to raise £25 in order to stand as a candidate for Parliament. The only test should be that of citizenship. We already provide against the candidature of any individual who has been punished for a crime, or has been an inmate of a lunatic asylum. But there should be no property qualification, - and no other qualification, indeed, than citizenship rights.",64
270,Mr BAYLEY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,We should need ballot papers as long as those in some of the . American States.,64
271,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"That is no argument against my suggestion; the length of the ballot-paper is quite immaterial. It is the right of every citizen in Australia to aspire to be a member of this Parliament, and we ought not to deprive him of that right by imposing disabilities beyond those already provided for . I therefore hope that in Committee we may agree to an amendment to abolish the £25 deposit. Another objectionable provision is that unless a voter exercises the full preference his vote shall be declared informal. This may have the eflect of disfranchising hundreds of thousands of people.",64
272,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,How ?,64
273,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Peopl e who are accustomed to the old system of merely placing a cross against their selected candidate may put No. 1 opposite their choice, and leave all the other names unmarked. My point is that while a vote can be effective-whil e it can achieve the purpose the elector desires-it ought to be allowed. A candidate might perhaps have 1,000 such papers, and all these votes would be declared informal, although a majority of the electors might desire him to be their representative.",64
274,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Were you not selected on that very principle in the pre-selection ballot?,64
275,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I have a very vivid recollection of a pertain pre-selection ballot-no t my own,"" for I won pretty handsomely-in which a number of people voted for a certain candidate, but failed to record any contingent votes.",64
276,Sir ROBERT BEST,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Why should they have failed to do so?,64
277,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"It does not matter It is very why; the point is that they did, thus proving that people are not yet educated up to this system of voting. This preselection ballot resulted in the candidate ho whom I refer dropping out and somebody else becoming the candidate. This tends to make a farce and a travesty of elections. Let us take as an illustration an election in which there are four candidates, A , B , C, and D . When the ballot-box is opened, and the first preference votes are counted, A is found to have received 2,000 votes, B 2,371, C 1,031, and D 1,100. The candidate receiving the least number of votes is C, and he drops out. But supposing that for D 120 people had voted, putting merely No. 1 opposite his name and giving no other contingent votes, then D would lose that number of votes as informal, his total thereby being reduced to 980. Then D would have dropped out instead of C, although if C had dropped out in the ordinary way probably a large proportion of C's votes would have been transferred to D , and it would have been quite possible for D to become the elected representative. Again, if 1,000 voters bad merely put No. 1 opposite A , recording no contingent votes, then A would have dropped out of the ballot, although there might be a majority of electors who desired him to stay in .",64
278,Sir ROBERT BEST,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,To do otherwise would destroy the preferential system.,65
279,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"That is a common impression, but it has no foundation in fact.",65
280,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"In - 1914 the informal votes in Victoria were just a little over 2 per cent, from all causes.",65
281,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,There fewer informal votes under the preferential system than under any other.,65
282,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"That does not matter; the point is that under the system proposed people who vote for a candidate may be deprived of the righ t of giving effect to their vote on a mere technicality. Honourable _ members should realise that the second, third , or fourth vote is never counted u n t i l the candidate drops out, and the vote is always effective while a candidate is in the ballot. If a candidate receives sufficient No. 1 votes to keep him in the ballot, it is immaterial to him how people have voted secondly, thirdly, fourthly, or f if t h l y on his ballot-papers. The main point is that the voters desire a certain person to be in a ballot, and their votes are, I contend, effective. While a vote can be effective, it should be counted, but when it is not effective-that is to say, if the candidate in the ordinary way has dropped out-the n that candidate's vote has become exhausted, and becomes in formal of its own volition, as it were. I wish honourable members not to view this matter from a party point of view, but to give it the most careful consideration, for it is clear that an injustice may be done.",65
283,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I can assure the honourable member that I looked very carefully into this point. In some States the contingent vote is compulsory, and in some it is not, and having balanced the advantages, we decided on the proposal in the Bill .",65
284,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Shoul d it not be the main principle governing our whole electoral system that so long as a vote can be effective-ca n achieve the purpose that the voter desires-it should be counted ? We have no right to deprive a voter of his rights.,65
285,Mr ATKINSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,How do you deprive a voter of his rights wben you make hi m vote for all the candidates ?,65
286,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I have been endeavouring to show how this vote can be, as it really is, an effective vote in the first ballot, and under the preferential system we have no right to notice contingent votes until the No. 1 votes have been counted aud dealt with. are far Mr ATKINSON - Neithe r do we, in preferential voting.",65
287,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Whatever the system may be, there is only one principle,, and that is the principle of the effective vote. When a candidate has not sufficient No. 1 votes to keep him in , the No. 2. preferential votes become effective, and' have the same relative value as No. 1 votes. When a vote is recorded for a person who is in the ballot, and who may prpbably win, why should it be declared informal ?",65
288,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"The honourable member's plan was tried in Queensland,, but it broke down.",65
289,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"What I suggest willnot in any way interfere with the preference vote; it will not deprive us of any advantages, if there are any, to be gained for the preference system. On the other hand, if ib is not allowed a hardship may be inflicted upon a great number of people in Australia.",65
290,Sir ROBERT BEST,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Does not the same argument apply to informal votes under the present system ?,65
291,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"No . because they cannot be effective. Can the honourable . member show me how any vote, declared informal under the present system, can be made effective ?",65
292,Sir ROBERT BEST,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"If the informality is against the law, yes.",65
293,Mr BRENNAN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"The honourable member overlooks the fact that the test is whether the intention of the voter is ascertainable.. , Mr MAHONY - That is exactly the t i a l voting. position. Under the present system, the intention of the voter can be ascerpeople tained, his vote is allowed.",65
294,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,But do you tliink our present system is a bad one'?,66
295,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I think it is a grand system. l t put me here, and I am fied with it . I cannot understand honshall orable members opposite wanting to alter a system that put them where they are.",66
296,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,But do you think that they want to remedy a great wrong ?,66
297,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"If this Bill is an act of generosity on their part, or if they are feeling the prickings of an uneasy conscience, perhaps it will remedy the great .wrong that was done to our party at the last election, and next time return us to power. But, joking apart, this question of informality of votes is a serious matter. U p to the present, we have been fairly liberal in our interpretation of our electoral laws. a voter has indicated his intention his vote has been allowed, and I am pleading for something along the same lines to be introduced into this measure.",66
298,Mr CORSES,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,That would allow of plumping-.,66
299,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Not h in g of the sort. Under the preferential system of voting the main consideration for a candidate is to get the No. 1 vote. If he does not get sufficient of these votes he will be out of the ballot. I cannot emphasize this point too strongly. If a candidate has 100 votes to his credit, those votes become informal in the ordinary way if they contain no indication of any preference beyond No. 1. In Committee, I intend to move an amendment to give effect to the ideas I have outlined.",66
300,Mr ATKINSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Wilmot ) [S-36] The measure which the Government have brought down is very bulky, but most of its provisions may be left to the Committee stage. The Bill introduces a manciple which, though well known in some of the States, is quite new to the Federal Parliament. I cannot understand how members, especially those opposite, can fail to recognise the democratic nature of this intention to introduce preferenSurely if Parliament is to if be a reflex - of the people's opinions, the should have the fullest opportunity of electing whom they desire to fill the seats. Under our present system, if three candidates are running, and if two happen to be on one side, and one a 0 Labour representative on the other, some satisone is asked to withdraw so that there not be any vote splitting. If , however, two or three men persist in seeking election on one side of politics, the opposnot ing side running one candidate usually wins on a substantial minority vote. The recent election for the Swan division in Western Australia illustrates this point. In this case there were four candidates, one of whom was a Labour representative, and he has won with a little more than one-third of the votes cast. Is there anything democratic about that?",66
301,Mr RILEY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"If the other side had won, their candidate would also have been in a minority. So long as Mr ATKINSON - That would not have made the position auy better. The objection I take to the present system is that in some circumstances it enables a minority vote to prevail, and I say that members of this Parliament should come here as representing a majorit y of those who take the trouble to go to the poll. I cannot understand how a party that is always talking about democratic principles should object to this measure. To them, apparently, the word ""democratic"" is like the word "" Mesopotamia "" as it appeared to the old lady- a blessed word. They seem to think that if they can describe anything as democratic it is quite good enough. There could be no more democratic form of election than that which is proposed by the Government in the measure now before the House. The principle has been in operation with satisfaction in several of the States. I think the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) urged that the Government should attach provisions penalizing any outside organization which might endeavour to influence candidates to stand down or in .any other way interfere with them. I do not think the honourable member need have any fear on that score if the principle operates in the Commonwealth as it is working in the States. In Tasmania, if there are five or six candidates of a particular line of thought offering, the organization which, they represent does not interfere with them ih any way, hut merely asks supporters to vote, for these candidate? in their order of preference. The organization is careful not to take up any particular candidate. The system works eery well in Tasmania, and I do not see why it should not be quite as satisfactory throughout the Commonwealth - Indeed, I am quite sure it would, if the electors only realized that the franchise is a privilege, to be used to the best of their ability, and with a view to having their political opinions represented. If the public will only regard this measure in that sense, and not allow outside.people to pull the strings, or monkey with the system by asking them to vote first for their own candidate, and then to give their second preference votes to a man on the opposite side because they are afraid of some one else cutting their candidate out, the principle will work satisfactorily. Those States which have adoptsd this principle are not anxious to give it up, because they know it operates so fairly. It gives the lic the widest range of choice, and that, surely, is democratic. Moreover, when a man is elected he knows that he is the representative of the majority of those who went to the poll. Quite'the opposite to this happened in the by-election that has just been decided in ""Western Australia. A little while ago, when the honourable member for FHnders (Mr Bruce) was seeking election, considerable pressure had to be brought to bear on the farmers' candidate to induce him to withdraw, and thus avoid splitting the vote. Why should that be necessary? Why should not the public have the right to vote for five or six candidates if that beroffer? Would it not be better, and would it not be educative to those who have political aspirations, if the people had a wide range of selection? It would give all candidates a chance to show the public what they are made of as politicians. Honourable members opposite have out into the open to oppose this system Mr Atkinson. all sorts of flimsy pretexts. I cannot understand why they take up this uttitude, because, if they are holding a preselection ballot, or are doing anything within their own leagues, they adopt this very system. Mr CowsmiNE - Not always.",66
302,Mr ATKINSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I understand they generally adopt this system in pre-selection ballots, but apparently it is not good enough for them when candidates are offering themselves for Parliament.",67
303,Mr CONSIDINE,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"The exhaustive ballot is better than, preferential voting.",67
304,Mr ATKINSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"It may be; but we are not now dealing with that system of voting. Preferential voting has proved itself effective when applied to constituencies returning only one member, and it is more than time that it was adopted in Federal elections. To my mind, the lack of provision for a system of proportional voting, or some system of voting other than the blockvote system, for the Senate constitutes a serious omission from the Bill. A change pubin the method ofconducting Senate elections is even more needed than a change in the method of conducting elections for this House. Here, by reason of the fact that the States are represented by divisions, each returning one member, there is a more adequate representation of the public mind than is obtainable in the Senate, where a small majority in each State can prevent the minority from being represented. The chief objection to the present system of voting, so far ns it applies to the House of Representatives elections, is th.tt the public has not a suflicient range of choice, being confined practically to two opposing candinum- dates. In 1910, when eighteen Senate seats had to be filled, the Labour party secured every seat, although the difference between the Liberal and Labour votes polled was very small. At the last Senate election, eighteen Nationalists were returned, and had there been a double dissolution every senator would come now be a Nationalist, Labour being on wholly without representation.",67
305,Mr BILEY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Does the honourable - member believe in proportional representation for the Senate?,68
306,Mr ATKINSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I do, though there may be a practical objection to it, in the difficulty of counting the votes. Sometimes, under the proportional system, as many as twenty or thirty counts would have to be made to determine a result, and when sonie millions of votes had to be counted and re-counted, as in the case of a State like New South Wales, a large amount of time might be consumed in the process. Before the quota could be arrived at;, it would be necessary to ascertain exactly how many votes had been polled. I do not say that this is a fatal objection. Possibly Tasmanian officials could show how the counting could be clone fairly quickly. Something would be gained so far as Senate elections were concerned by dividing each State into three electorates, each with its own centre. It is very rarely that double dissolutions will take place. The results of the last convinced most persons that they are to be approached with great caution.",68
307,Mr WATKINS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Would it not be better to return senators on a population basis?,68
308,Mr ATKINSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Certainly not. Under that system, New South Wales and Victoria would have all the representation, and remote parts of the Commonwealth would have little opportunity to make known their wants, and to advertise their resources. If , for the purposes of Senate elections, each State were divided into three electorates, with one candidate to be elected for each, the Senate voting could be on the same lines as that for the House of Representatives.",68
309,Mr MATHEWS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"The honourable member says that the Senate is a State House. Necessarily, then, its candidates must be voted for by the electors voting as States.",68
310,Mr ATKINSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,This Parliament has the power to arrange as it pleases the methods of election.,68
311,Mr WATKINS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Surely a State with a small population should not elect as many senators as a State with a large population.,68
312,Mr ATKINSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"That question is not now before the House, though I am prepared to argue it with the honourable member at any time. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) made a promise at Launceston that something would be done to alter the present electoral system. At the last election there was the risk that the National cause might suffer because of the rivalry of National candidates, and one of these withdrew on the understanding that the Government would introduce a system of preferential voting at future elections. It was understood, in Tasmania at any rate, that the change would apply to elections for both Houses of the Parliament. I am glad that the Government have returned to the principle of the postal vote. Why that vote was 'abolished I fail to understand. I have never heard a valid argument in favour of its abolition. I recognise that many persons who desire to exercise the franchise may be prevented from attending a polling booth upon polling day, and to enable them to.record their votes the system of voting by post, provided it be surrounded with adequate safeguards, is an eminently desirable one. In the matter of providing proper safeguards against fraud and manipulation, - I understand that the Queensland Act is practically a perfect one. Why, then, cannot this Parliament follow the lines which have been laid down in that Statute? I think that the proposed limit of 15 mile3 from a polling place in connection with the exercise of the postal vote should be considerably curtailed. Personally, I favour a reduction of the distance to either 5 or 7 miles. The Bill contains a new principle in that it will permit an elector who believes that on polling day he will be more than 10 miles distant from a polling booth to record his vote beforehand. That will, doubtless, prove a great convenience; but if it will necessitate the appointment of any considerable number of additional electoral registrars, I do not think that the expenditure incurred in giving effect to it will be warranted. However, that is a small matter, which can be better dealt with in Committee. I do hope that the Government will not rest satisfied with reformin g the electoral system for the return of members to this House, but will earnestly grapple with the problem of how to provide for proper representation in the Senate.",68
313,Mr RILEY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Soutli Sydney) [9.0] I recognise that this is purely a Bill for consideration in Committee. But there are one or two points connected with it to which I desire to refer. In the first place, I protest against the Government attempting to alter our electoral system while so many men are absent from this country fighting the battles of the Empire. This Parliament promised those men that during their absence "" not one stone in the temple of'Labour would be overturned,"" and it has a right to honour that promise. At the last election, too, Ministers told the people that they would not destroy any Act on our statute-book.",69
314,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,They are not destroying the Act ; they are improving it .,69
315,Mr RILEY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"That may be the honourable member's opinion, but it is not mine. I protest against the proposal to restore the postal vote, because I believe that the postal votiiur system leads to corruption. The honourable member for Wilmo t (Mr . Atkinson) has affirmed that he has never heard a valid argument in support of the abolition of postal voting. Need I remind him of what takes place under that system? Whenever keen electoral contest is in progress the canvassers for the rival candidates im mediately get to work. They visit the different hospitals, .and, first of all, make floral gifts to l i e patients. Then they commence to talk politics to them, with the result that the inmates, as well as the entire staffs of these institutions, are annoyed by their attentions. It is not in the interests of the sick that the system of voting by post is desired, but in the in terests of political candidates themselves.",69
316,Mr MAXWELL,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,The medical authorinexion ties would not allow political canvassers lo wait upon the patients in our hospitals.,69
317,Mr RILEY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"It has been done time and again, as everybody knows. the sick in the privacy of their homes are not exempt from the attentions of these energetic canvassers. Yet it is now p r o posed to restore the postal voting system.",69

319,Mr RILEY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I am quite aware of that. I have no desire to deprive any person of his vote. But we have a right to protect the inmates of our hospitals against visits by political canvassers. I do hope that the Minister will take note of the utterances of honourable members upon his own side of the chamber, and will devise effective means to prevent the patients in these institutions from being interfered with by canvassers for rival political candidates.",69
320,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,I will look into the matter.,69
321,Mr RILEY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"In regard to the system of preferential voting for this Chamber I would point out that at the present time we are endeavouring to secure uniformit y in the matter of our Commonwealth and. State electoral rolls. Here is an opportunity to secure uniformit y in respect of our electoral systems of voting. We are departing from uniformity in connection with the ballot by proposing that the electors shall indicate by numerals their preference in voting for the House of Representatives, and their choice for the Senate by placing , a cross ojjposite the names of the favoured candidates.",69

The honor- Mr MCWILLIAMS - U n for t u n at e l y , there is a large proportion of the electors on both sides who do not take much in in political matters u n t i l election day arrives, and even then if they were not hunted up assiduously by both parties the total vote, in each constituency would be much smaller than it usually is. _ I think the time, has arrived for an alteration in the system of electThe present system of is crude in the extreme, and nothing could be more unjust. At the last general election the party to which I beright, long secured the whole eighteen seats in another I say deliberately it should not have done so. The total vote cast for the Liberal candidates was 1,172,126, and they cured, the whole eighteen seats; while 825,568 electors throughout the whole the Commonwealth failed to secure one presentative in the Senate. In New South Wales, the Liberals polled 54 per cent, aud Labour 46 per cent. The represenrid tation should have been two Liberal senators and one Labour senator. Victoria, the Liberals polled 54 per cent, and Labour 46 per cent., but in Queensthe land the result was worse still. There the Liberal party polled 50.9 per cent., and the Labour party 49.1 per cent., but practically half the electors failed cure any representation, as three Liberal senators were returned. Can any one say that the result of that Senate election was not a travesty on representation? In the election of 1914, following the double dissolution, Labour, polling a also. bare majority of the entire votes of the Commonwealth, secured thirty-one seats in the Senate, and the Liberal party ballot gained only five. Tf we had had proporOne tional representation, the two parties would have secured exactly eighteen the seats each. It is possible for one party to secure the whole of the voting power in the Senate after a double dissolution. As a matter of fact, if there had been double dissolution twelve months ago, is practically certain that there would not have been one Labour representative in the Senate today. I am one of those abolished it . who think that that is not a good thing. On the actual results of the poll, i had had proportional representation at anvwhere else. the last election, the Liberal party would have secui-ed twelve seats in the Senate, and the Labour party six. I sliould like to quote the figures for a number of premotion vious elections, because they show what complete travesty of representation brought about by our present system.",70
339,Mr TUDOR,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"There is no chance of intrigue carrying proportional representation through the Senate, and the Government party know it .",71
340,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"It is the duty of this House to do what it thinks and leave the Senate to do what it of the thinks is right also.

So strongly do I hold that view, that I intend to support the of amendment that is to be moved in Comremittee to apply proportional representationto Senate elections, and I sincerely hope it will be carried. That will get of the great objection which has been urged in this debate, that to have one In system of voting for the House of Representatives, and another for the Senate on same day, can result only in hopeless confusion in the minds of a certain percentage of our electorates, while it will not secure the proper representation of all to separties, as a good system should do.

If a party likes to run only one candidate, no reason why it should be comwhen.our pelled to run more. I differ entirely from the honourable memher for Wannon (Mr Rodgers), who would prevent party selecting only one' candidate. a party chooses to select one candidate only why should it not do so? But the thing to do. Bill will have a very advantageous effect upon those parties which lake a wider grip of national government. Why should uot the Farmers' party run candihe dates ? Why should the people in a counfrom recording their votes. try constituency in Victoria be compelled to come down to a little clique in Melcautions bourne for a decision as to who their candidate shall be? That kind of thing is a travesty on representative governand ment, and one of the reasons why I hail this Bill with delight is the fact that will put a stop to it by giving free to the electors for those who desire offer their services to them. It is that the introduction of this system will he the means of bringing out many more candidates, and that those who have been to go to the poll? fortunate enough to bo returned unopposed on several occasions - will now have to contest elections, but if the electors desire to have a choice, surely it is not our place to hinder them ?

352,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,I hope that electors who are in the favoured position of being driven by our friends on both sides in motor cars to the polling booths will give a little consideration to those whoso I best means of conveyance is a bullock,72
353,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Brisbane) [9.30] SenI f we could just forget the past when we both arc discussing this Bill we could much estabmore easily arrive at a satisfactory re^ It is quite refreshing to hear honwho orable members on the Government side to saying that this is not a party measure, and telling us what they, propose to do when we are in Committee, but I bave heard them say the same thing before, and the result has always been the same. The honourable member for Frankli n (Mr . MCWilliams) may perhaps be much less open to the charge of not standing by his statements when votes are taken than otlier honourable members are, because on several occasions even during this session he has given us exhibitions of his independence, but we know that when it comes to a vote the Government have the majority, and the Bill which they bring forward is the measure which' goes through. The Minister (Mr Glynn) has given us no indication that we may hope for the acceptance of any amendmentswhich will accord with the views of those honourable members who have expressed their opposition to certain of the provisions of the measure. I have endeavoured to discover the .reasons which have actuated the Government in bringing forward the Bill . We were informed by the Acting Prime M in ister (Mr W at t ) when the House met that on this occasion we were to consider urgent financial measures necessary the conduct of the war, and I can only imagine that this Bill has been introway duced in order to give him an occasional relief. This is one of those Bills which can be taken up and dropped as the.ocWar-time casion requires in order to give a respite to the Treasurer from the strain of being continually in the House piloting his financial proposals through. certainly no urgency for the Bill. There has been no demand for it .",72
354,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,It was mised in the policy speech.,73
355,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"If a promise was given that this B i ll would be introduced I congratulate the Government o n ' having decided to honour at least one proit is. mise. There is no other pledge that the Government or their supporters gave at the last election which they have had decency to keep. In fact, the Government is a Ministry of broken pledges, and if this Bill is an indication of their return honourable methods I congratulate I take immediate exception to clause 3, which provides that nothing in the B i l shall affect the provisions of ' the monwealth Electoral (War Time) Act 1917, which Act disfranchised naturalized British subjects born in enemy countries, and therefore the contention of supporters on the Government side that this Bill. does not disfranchise any one fails utterly. The Electoral' (War Time) A ct was a special measure brought in for a particular purpose during war time, and that purpose having been satisfied, rightly or wrongly in the result, its provisions ought to have been wiped out by this new Bill which is supposed to JDO a consolidating measure and the one authoritative piece of electoral machinery for this country. The Government are perpetuating in this Bill what was recognised then, and is more clearly recognised now, as a distinct blot on our electoral machinery. The War-time Electoral Act also provided for additional questions being put to voters when desiring to record their votes Honourable members will remember the irritation caused by those questions. There is, however, one provision of the War-time Electoral Act to which - I venfor .ture to give my assent, and I am surprised that the Minister has not seen his to include it in this Bill , because' it operated with very satisfactory results to the Government when applied under the Electoral Act. It was also recommended by the Electoral. Commission. I - refer to the provision for a party' vote. A good deal has been said about the preThere is ferential vote for the House of Representatives and proportional voting for the Senate; but there is no provision in this proB ill to enable an elector to vote for a particular political party.",73
356,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,That provision is in the War-time Electoral Bill .,73
357,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,I have said that,73
358,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,We must alter that if the preferential vote is carried. It could not the be associated with preferential voting ,73
359,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Why not? ^ Mr Glynn - iHo w could a man exerto cise a choice by marking the names of them. three candidates with crosses?,73
360,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I can see no l reason why a candidate should not be. disComtinguished by the name of the political party to which he belongs. I should certainly have no objection to my name appearing on a ballot-paper as that of the Labour candidate, and I do not think that my opponent would be likely to object if distinguished by the name of the political party to which he belonged. In connection, for instance, with the byeleotion which has just taken place for the electoral division of Swan, what objection could there be if Mr Corboy had been described on the ballot-paper as the Labour candidate, Mr Hedges as the . National candidate, Mr Murray as the farmers' candidate, and Mr Watson as the prohibition candidate? If that course had been adopted, it would have afforded a clear guide to the electors in recording their votes. What we desire in connection with all our electoral machinery is to enable 1fhe electors to record an intelligent vote, in order that we may secure a satisfactory result from elections.",73
361,Mr MAXWEEE,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,It could not be a very intelligent vote if the elector required to be told that the honourable member is a Labour man.,74
362,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"It is not that the. elector requires to be told what a particular candidate is, but that a number of people desire to vote for a party candidate, and are not concerned about the individual at all. If on the ballot-paper the names of the candidates were followed by the names of the parties they support, it would be of great assistance to the general voter. We should have no other desire than that every candidate shall be given a fair deal; and if people wish to vote for a particular political party, they should be given an unmistakable opportunity to do so. This is much more necessary in connection with an election for the Senate than in connection with an election for the House of Representatives. Many of the objections raised on the Government side to voting under the present system for the Senate might be overcome by having a party description of the candidates on. the Senate ballot papers. The electors could, then vote in one vote for Labour party candidates or - National party candidates, or the candidates of any other political party contesting Senate seats. This proposal was recommended by the Electoral Commission as a simple method of overcoming what apparently, under the provisions of this Bill, will constitute a very serious difficulty. A matter to which I invite the attention of the Minister is the provision in regard to the appointment of the Commissioners who are to be responsible for dividing the States into electoral divisions. It is proposed that three shall be appointed, and the Bill specifies who and what two of. the Commissioners shall be. One is to be the Chief Electoral Officer, and another the Surveyor-General of a State, or some officer having similar qualifications. There is no suggestion as .to who is to be the third Distribution Commissioner. He is evidently to be 'a Government nominee, who may, and . probably will, be a distinctly party man, because no Government having charge of the electoral machinery will take any chances. Every Government that introduces an Electoral Bill, however anxious they may be to see that its provisions are just and fair, will naturally be prejudiced in their own favour. They will not includeprovisions in the Bill which will be of advantage to the other side. If the Labour party were in charge of this Bill, they would make its provisions as satisfactory to themselves as possible, and the party in charge of it now will naturally do the same. The third Distribution Commissioner will, therefore, inevitably be - a Government nomineesome man in whom the Government have confidence that he will see that the States are divided into electoral divisions in a 'way that will be satisfactory to them. Previously, in dealing with electoral measures, I have suggested that, in addition to the Chief Electoral Officer, there is one man in the Commonwealth who might most appropriately be appointed a member of the Electoral Distribution Commission. The SurveyorsGeneral of the States are properly ap-' pointed members of this Commission; but, in my view, the Commonwealth Statistician is, before all, the one man qualified to decide what should be the division of population upon which our electoral representation should be based. I suggest to the Minister that he might consider the possibility of stating clearly in this Bill that the Distribution Commission shall include three specified persons, and that the Commonwealth Statistician shall be one of the three.",74
363,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"""We have included the Chief Electoral Officer under this Bill . He was not included before. This was done in the interests of the purity of the distribution, about which the honourable member is talking.",75
364,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I have expressed my entire approval of the inclusion in the Commission of the Chief Electoral Officer. My objectiou is that under the Bill it will be possible to include some person who does not occupy a responsible official position. My experience of Commonwealth electoral affairs is that, where we have Commonwealth officers conducting elections, we get a f a ir deal, but when others are introduced we lose the advantage of the sense of responsibility which is upon Commonwealth officers, and that is ""disadvantageous, not merely to one party, but to the whole election. Immediately a suspicion arises in the minds of the people on either side that an election is not being conducted fair l y , there is a decided disadvantage accruing.",75
365,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,We propose to include in the Distribution Commission at least two experts.,75
366,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Why not include a third?,75
367,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"It would ""then be complained that there was no neutral on the Commission at all.",75
368,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"The will better appreciate my point of view in dealing with, this matter when I tell him that I go so far as to assert that it is not a good thing that the distribution of seats should be subject to the approval of Parliament. I think that members of Parliament should have no say whatever in the matter. We are interested in these electoral divisions. Naturally, if I can influence the Minister or the Government, or, through them, the Electoral Distribution Commission, to cut up the Brisbane division in such a\ way as to bo favourable to me, I am going to do it. But it should not be possible for me to do it . I do not think that members of Parliament should have any say whatever in the matter, or any influence in the division of the States into electoral divisions. The Distribution Commission should have full , absolute, and final power in the matter.,",75
369,Mr CONSIDINE,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,And be appointed by the Government?,75
370,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Appointe d by whatever Government is in power. As longas they are responsible officials I am quite content to take the result of their work.,75
371,Mr MAHONY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Does the honourable member believe in creating an authority higher than Parliament?,75
372,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,In regard to the distribution of electoral divisions I do. Parliament should have nothing to do with such a matter.,75
373,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,This improvement is made for the first time.,75
374,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I have before expressed this view, and I adhere to it to-, day. There is a clause in the Bill relating to the qualifications and disqualifications for enrolment and voting, and it is provided that only persons over , the age . of twenty-one years shall be allowed to vote. The War-time Electoral Act, however, provides that soldiers, sailors, nurses, and others enlisted for active service shall be entitled to vote whether their names are on the roll 6r not. When that measure was before the House I submitted an amendment providing that every citizen of eighteen years of age should be given the right to vote. Minister I believe in that principle today more strongly than I did when the War-time Electoral Bill was before us - We have imposed upon youths of eighteen years of age the responsibilities of citizenship, and we should accord them the privi leges of citizenship. I should like to see in this Bill a clause providing that every man and woman who has been enrolled for active service in connection with this war shall, because of that fact, be entitled to vote regardless of whether ornot he or she has reached the age of twenty-one years. In Committee I shall* propose to amend clause 39 by providing that any soldier, sailor, nurse, or any other person who has been accepted for active service during this war shall be entitled to be enrolled.",75
375,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Such persons can vote at present if they are twenty-one years of age.,76
376,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Q u it fore my amendment would apply to a comparatively small number. I would remind the Minister that ""quite a. number of tliese meu and women - who are over, as well as under, twenty-one years of age may not be on the roll. For obvious reasons they may not have been able to secure enrolment.",76
377,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,It is not necessary them to be enrolled if they have been . the Front. The War-time Electoral A is unaffected by this Bill .,76
378,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Then there more in the contention of the honourable  appeared on the surface.,76
379,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Not at all.,76
380,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,The Electoral Act provides for the disqualibe fication of voters. We do not wish that to operate under our electoral,76
381,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"It does not disqualify, natural-born British subjects.",76
382,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"It disqualifies naturalized British subjects. members opposite, who have been talkto ing so. glibly of the disfranchisement certain individuals, should be the last to do so, seeing that this Bill does not of twenty-one years. affect that Act which disfranchises a large number of citizens.",76
383,Mr JOWETT,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Unde r the War-time Electoral Act enemy-born subjects alone will be disfranchised, and then only for the period of the war and six months afterwards. Mr TUDOR,-The Government can bring in a regulation' just as they did connection with the last referendum to deal with that matter.",76
384,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"They cannot. That was quite a different matter, and honourable members that no such measure will be brought in . Mr : FINLAYSON - The must be aware that under the War-time Electoral Act power is given to ask tions in addition to the ordinary quesattitude. tions that may be put to an intending voter under our general electoral legislation. The Government could pass regulations providing ""for the putting of such questions as it Was proposed to ask at the last Federal referendum. Mr ' MAHONY - Why not repeal the e so; there- War-time Electoral Act?",76
385,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Surely the honorablo member would not deprive men at the Front of the right to vote.,76
386,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I certainly would not. I think we should have it clearly and specifically set out in this Bill that any man or woman who has been enrolled for active service shall be entitled to vote for irrespective of his or her age. I hope the at Minister will accept the amendment of c t which I have given notice. It will be but a very small recognition of the work was of the men and women who have gone on - active service in connection with this war. At the most its virtue will expirewithin a very short period, since the men and women under twenty-one, and therefore War-time ordinarily disentitled to be enrolled, will few in number. A year or two hence Bhey will be able to comply with all the machinery. usual qualifications. The honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) makes a suggestion ""that I should like the Minister to consider, Honourable and that is whether he cannot see his way accept eighteen years as the qualifying of age for enrolment throughout Australia. There is no particular virtue in the age A man does not, as if by magic, become wise on reaching the age of twenty-one years. 0",76

390,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,I do. . Mr ' MAXWELL - Then the honourable Minister member's argument goes by the board.,76
391,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,The Government quesmust accept responsibility for their own It is they who' have imposed citizenship responsibilities at the age of eighteen. Is the Minister prepared to in sert a provision that all those on whom citizenship responsibilities have been imposed at that age shall have extended to tliem citizen privileges also at the age of eighteen T,76
392,Mr JCWETT,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,To those who have enlisted?,77
393,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Will the honourable member support that in Committee?,77
394,Mr JOWETT,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,You will not find me failing there.,77
395,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I hope not. I want the Minister to consider also a suggestion with regard to the removal of names from the roll. Bill he has provided that any name on the roll may be objected to by way of an objection in writing, with which a sum of 5's. has to be deposited. It is not clear whether an objection may be taken to an individual, or whether it may be a wholesale objection. It should not be open to any one person to be in a position to object to electors in a wholesale fashion.",77
396,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Practicall y all the objections come, from the officers, and not from outsiders.",77
397,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"But salaried party officers on the Minister's side in politics lodged wholesale lists of objections to names on the roll, and it was very difficult to prevent large erasures from the certified roll.",77
398,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"That must have been after an election, when the rolls were clean. Mr F f NLAYSON - No , it was before an election. I want to know whether a list of f if t y objections will require a deposit of 5s.. or whether every objection to every single name must be accompanied by a 5s. deposit..",77
399,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"As a matter of fact, outside individuals do not lodge objections. It is all done by the offioers.",77
400,Mr TUDOR,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"In one instance lettetcarriers lodged some 300 objections, and afterwards all the names had to be placed back on the roll.",77
401,Mr RILEY,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"They get l j d . for every name they take off, under the electoral regulations. Mr FINLAYSON . ^ - A nd a very cheap and effective way it is of accomplishing a desirable purpose. Moreover, it is a more secure and honest way than by allowing managers of party caucuses to bring forward lists of objections by tens and hundreds-objection s to persons of whom they have no personal knowledge, and regarding whom such action is taken only for party purposes.",77
402,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"They are individual objections by people in the same division;but they are all officers, as a matter of fact.",77
403,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I will leave that point. The Minister, in this measure, persistsi n the old and effete practice of ""requiring a State member to resign his seat in the In the State House before becoming a candidate for Federal honours.",77
404,Mr LYNCH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,-Does not the honourable member believe in one man one job?',77
405,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"^I do, and ' I do not believe in one man getting my job here until I have finished ""with it . ' We are hoping to secure, by some scheme of reciprocity, a uniform Electoral Act which will operate equally in the State and the Federal sphere. If there were reciprocity among members of Parliament themselves, that might be one of the easiest, ways of bringing about uniformity in the general direction. If Federal honours were open to State members without requiring resignation from State seat's, and vice versa, there would be something in this question of reciprocity for the sakeof uniformity. We can.afford to be generous, and I , for one, am prepared to excise the provision in this Bil l which requires a State member to resign his seat before appealing to the people for Federal honours Another provision which should be made perfectly clear has to do with that, period'-between the nomination of a candidate and election day, during which in terval the candidate' may die. Under this Bill , no provision is made for the substitution of a candidate. The only provision we have, and which gives either party, or any individual, -- the right - to nominate another candidate in the circumstance of the original candidate dying between the date of nomination and election day, is contained in the War-time Act. I cannot understand why the Minister has not included in this measurea permanent provision as part of our. . electoral machinery. It is set out in the war-time measure to which I have alluded that if .any candidate dies between - nomination day and polling day, the leader of either party shall have the right to nominate another candidate in his stead.",77
406,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,That continues so long as the Act is in force.,78
407,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"It continues only for the period of the war, whereas it should be a permanent feature of our electoral machinery.",78
408,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,It had a special interest in relation to voting at the F r o n t ; but does the honourable member want stereotyped parties for ever?,78
409,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,r-Will this Bill assist us to get r i d of party government ?,78
410,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,I do not say that.,78
411,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,It is amusing that some honourable members should think that the method of voting to be inaugurated under this Bill will mean the end of the party system.,78
412,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,I do not say that.,78
413,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"The Minister does not. But instead of two parties, we are more likely to have five or six. This principle will only aggravate and intens if y the party system. I have no objec-. tion to the party system as such. It is easily the 'finest system of government the world knows today. Of course, there is a still better system. We shall grow out of the present party method into something better; but we shall not do so by .bringing about half-a-dozen different parties instead of two. One inevitable result of this Bill , under its provisions relating particularly to preferential voting, will be that instead of two candidates, with a straight-out fight, there will be at least four candidates in nearly every electorate.",78
414,Mr JOWETT,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Quite right.,78
415,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I do not think so; but, whether it is right or wrong, we shall probably have to put up with it . The only advantage, so far as I am concerned, will be that there will be only - one Labour candidate in the field.",78
416,Mr JOWETT,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"There Labour candidates next time- a National, as well as an Official Labour candidate. . Mr FINLAYSON"" - Th.i y may call themselves what they choose, they are not the Labour party. „ .  of the Labour party? Mr F l NLAYSON - My definition of the Labour party is a party of men who have signed the Labour platform.  tion.",78
417,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I had not in tended to refer just yet to the Caucus, but had reserved it for a later part of my speech, when I intended to show that there is a. good deal of misconception and of deliberate misrepresentation regarding it. There is another provision in the Bill to which I venture to draw the attention of the Minister. Probably I shall not secure, and do not expect to-secure, the approval of the. Minister, and, perhaps, that of honourable members; but T am here to express my personal opinions. I should like to see Part xvi"". of the Bill cut out altogether. That is the part which deals with the limitation of electoral expenses; .and I do not see the slightest reason for its retention. I know the reason that the part is inserted, but I am not at all convinced that any limitation has the slightest effect on the expenditure of any party. We all know that, although the Act imposes a certain limi t in this regard on candidates for both Houses, and also imposes the necessity for a return of expenditure within a certain time, none of the returns sent in are reliable.",78
418,Mr JOWETT,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,None ?,78
419,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I do not think that any of the returns are reliable, except, it may be, that of the honourable  did not spend more than. £5 or £10.",78
420,Mr JOWETT,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Sa y "" h a r d l y any.""",78
421,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,I have no objection. Does the honourable member' say that the expenditure of the National party at the last election was shown in the returns made? will be two Mr JOWETT - What about the expenses of the Caucus party?,78
422,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"They were not _. . shown in the return, so far as I know. Apparently both the honourable member arid myself admit that the provision in the Act is futile.",78
423,Mr JOWETT,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Exactly ! \ Mr FINLAYSON - The provision only leads to fraud and falseness'; it pretends to impose a limit that cannot be imposed. Perhaps the fact that the provision is there may have a sort of deterrent effect. - Mr ABCHIBALD - It is a check.,79
424,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"-It may be a check, but it is not an effective check, and in my opinion it is of no advantage to anybody. Of course, candidates may say in favour of the provision that it enables them to point out to their supporters that their expenditure is limited, and that if the election is to be won by money it must be found by somebody else. Who can imagine the honourable member for the Grampians (Mr Jowett) allowing an election to fail for the sake of a few - pounds ? His £100 would disappear, and he himself not know where it had gone, and nobody would ask him. Although the Labour party have suffered in the past for lack of funds, while thoir opponents were rolling in wealth, the fact remains that this limitation is a mere pretence, professing as it does to do something that it cannot do. There is no serious objection to preferential voting, and I am quite willing to accept it if it is thought that it will enable us to arrive at a fair expression of the will of the electors.",79
425,Mr ABCHIBALD,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,It is necessity just now.,79
426,Mr FINLAYSOJST,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"It is, no doubt, in the case of those members who once belonged to the Labour party and have crossed over; it will undoubtedly be their salvation at the next election.",79
427,Mr LYNCH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,We have retained the true faith ; you are the seceders.,79
428,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"There has never yet been a secession in any matter, political or religious, in which the seceders have not declared that they were the true, men who had "" left their country for their country's good."" I have a very definite opinion that this preferential voting is the one thing that will give our old comrades a chance of life.",79
429,Mr ARCHIBALD,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,Do not worry about your old comrades; they will be alive and kicking when you are done.,79
430,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"1I have, no friendly concern for them, and the less I see of them in this House the better I like it. The one thing is that those gentlemen will have to sail their own boat at the next election; they cannot shelter under the wing of the old Liberal party.",79
431,Mr LYNCH,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,What about the Brisbane Worker and the selection?,79
432,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Probably the Brisbane Worker and I may have a good deal to say to each other before the next election, and if I have to face the ballot, all right; I am not going to put up an umbrella until the rain comes. I have no objection to the principle of preferential voting, because I believe it will work just as much . in favour of the Labour party as in favour of other candidates. If there is to be; as I have suggested, four candidates in each electorate, I think the Labour men will stand a very good chance of being one of the first, two in the first round. They will have as good a chance of getting preferential votes as the "" other fellow,"" and from a party point of view I do not think it will hurt us in any way. Postal voting, however, stands on a different footing, and, generally speaking, I do not object to the principle. It is only reasonable and proper that every a national opportunity should be afforded to the electors to record their votes, and I am prepared to go - to extreme limits to give every man and woman that opportunity. But - I have not yet seen a system of postal voting work out satisfactorily. Every system that has yet been tried, State and Federal, has proved itself seriously open to corruption and intrigue.  tem of voting.",79
433,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"But the postal system seems peculiarly susceptible to these influences. It is supposed to apply particularly to sick people. As a matter of fact, we know that thousands of people who were not sick, and had no expectation of being sick, on the day of election exercised this particular privilege. We all know, too, that it was intended to apply particularly to women, but that thousands of men who expected to be sick on polling day voted by post at previous elections. And most of these sick people, strange to say, were to be found in the cities, and not in the country districts. We have not yet evolved any system of postal voting which eliminates the possibility of abuse by people for whom it was not meant, and who have no right to use it. In this Bill, it is proposed to open the door still wider, because postal voting is to be made applicable, not only to people who are sick or expect to be sick, but to people who are not living within 15 miles of a polling booth, or who expect to be travelling by rail or steamer on polling day. My only hope is'that when the Bill is in Committee we may be able to insert some provision which will, as far as possible, protect elections from - fraud or corruption.",79
434,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,There is more protection in this Bill than in the previous measure.,80
435,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"I really think the Minister has made an effort to tighten up the provisions against fraud, but I do not tbink it possible to guarantee absolutely against fraud in the postal provisions. I am sorry that the Bill makes no provision for the enfranchisement or representation of Commonwealth .citizens resident in our Territories. We are extending our Territories, and now we have not only the Federal Caoital, the Northern Territory, Norfolk Island, and Papua, but probably after the war we shall also be administering New Guinea. It is not fair, and it ""is not creditable to Australia, that there should be on Australian soil people qualified to vote, but who have neither that right nor any representation in our Parliament. I know it is a difficult and delicate question to handle,- and that it is not easy satisfactorily to give these people direct representation. The only method I can think of is to attach each of those Territories some State electoral division. Although there may be some argument in favour of the Territories jointly having, say, one senator to represent them, and one member in the House of Representatives, I ' would object most [267] strenuously to. any suggestion that any such senator or Tnember of this House be limited in the exercise of his privileges, and allowed to vote only on questions affecting the Territories-. Any representative so appointed should have exactly the same rights and privileges as other members. This suggestion has heen made to get over the difficulty. I think most honourable members honestly believe that these people should be represented, but the 'question is how to do this satisfactorily and equitably.",80
436,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"The Northern Territory would be attached to three States. I did look into that matter, but the proportions are still small.",80
437,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Some relief would be afforded if representation were given on the Local Councils. In Fapua there is a Local Council; and I think if the people there had direct representation ou that body,- their desire for representation in the Federal Parliament would be satisfied for some time to come.",80
438,Mr GLYNN,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,They have a system of local government in Papua,80
439,Mr FINLAYSON,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"Yes ; but we must look forward to the time when some arrangement will have to be made for their representation in the Federal Parliament. If in the Federal Capital Territory the Government projects are proceeded with, there will be a fullyequipped Arsenal, and yet a large number of people there will he disfranchised. I have heard the Minister express the opinion that these people in our Territories should have some consideration, but this Bill makes no provision in that direction. In Committee I hope to submit a few amendments which I trust will be accepted if there is, anything at all in the argument that the Bill is non-party in character. If members on the Ministerial side of the House approve of principles which we on this side advocate, I hope they will vote for them. As far as I am concerned, I can promise that if I approve of principles which they are advocating, I will cross the floor with them. Mr..JOWETT (Grampians) [10.27] ""We are all agreed that if ever there were a measure that should be free from all prejudice and party bias, it is the Bill which we are now considering.",80
440,Mr WEST,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,There never has been a Government yet that did not bring in an Electoral Bill to suit themselves.,81
441,Mr JOWETT,RATES OF FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES COMPARED,"That may have been speech tomorrow. the experience in the past. The honourable member may be familiar with what has taken place in the dark ages; but that is no justification for the intrusion of party spirit into the discussion of this Bill. I have made a few mental notes of the debate, and regret to say that there has been', perhaps unconsciously and unintentionally, some exhibition of party spirit. One of the earlier Opposition speakers said, I think, that the "" other side,"" meaning the Ministerial supporters, "" are getting ready to wipe us out."" But, in my opinion, every member wishes to give the electors of Australia a f a ir and square deal. Our endeavour must be, not to suppress, but to give opportunity for the expression of, the political views of the electors. The essential provisions of the Bill are those dealing with preferential voting and restoring postal voting. It has been said that we have no right to make any radical alteration of our . electoral system while OUT soldiers are absent from Australia, and the promise that "" not a stone in the temple of Labour will be touched until the war is over,"" alleged to have been made by. a very distinguished citizen, has been referred to in support of this contention. We, on this side, have, been accused of ignoring that promise. It has been said about me personally that my election was won on that promise, though I had not heard it until I entered this House. The establishment of preferential voting in no way affects the promise. Practically every returned soldiers' organization in Australia strongly favours preferential voting, and has carried a resolution to that effect. The provisions of the Bill are all in the interests of the soldier, because they make his voting more effective. What could be more ridiculous than the result of the Swan election? Within a week or two we shall have here as the representative of that division a gentleman for whom were cast only about one third of the total number of votes polled at the election. Those who object to preferential voting support an ineffective method of election which, in several i nstances, so faT as this House is concerned, has brought about the gross misrepresentation of the electors. However, as the hour is late, I ask leave to continue my - Leave granted; debate adjourned. House adjourned at 10.33 p.m.",81
