1,Mr TOHNSON,Unknown,"As the promise given by Ministers at the. beginning of this session, that an opportunity would be afforded, before its close, to consider the question of the Federal Capital site, does not seem possible of fulfilment before the Christmas adjournment, might I ask .the Prime Minister if , in arranging the course of business to be clone on the re-assembling of the House after that adjournment, the question will be given an early place in the list of matters which we will be asked to consider?",14
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"At the present time it take. would be premature to attempt to indicate the precise date when we shall be able to deal with this question. But the first opportunity affording any guarantee that Parliament is able to come to a decision upon the question will be seized. There will certainly be no avoidable delay-. The honourable member will realise, as we do, that the whole of the difficulty in the settlement of the question arises from the fact that all except the supporters of the particular site most in favour, unite to prevent progress, in order that other sites which they prefer may have a chance of consideration. If we can overcome that obstacle, the Government may be relied upon to afford every facility for an early settlement of the question.",14
3,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister, whose Department is concerned in the matter in reference to the report of Mr De Burgh, on the water, supply of Canberra, which has been circulated, and which refers to certain maps, whether the maps will be made available to honourable members ?",14
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I will inquire from the Home Affairs Department, which, I assume, will be in possession of maps that can be placed on the Library table. DUTIES OF CAPTAIN COLLINS . try.",14
5,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister if his attention has been directed to some recent utterances by Capsirable tain Collins in London, referred to [251] cables which appeared in the newspapers last week and today ? Last week's cables credited Captain Collins with having said that the preference now being given to Great Britaiui is only an earnest of future concessions in the same direction. I wish to ask what really is the position which Captain Collins occupies in London. Is he a financial expert, an examiner of Defence stores, or a political agent generally ? Does the Prime Minister think it right that Australian public servants in London should take it upon themselves to represent his views on Australian policy at political gatherings?",14
6,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The position that Captain Collins occupies is that of an officer charged with certain definite duties in regard to purchases for the Defence Department, the conduct of other ordinary business, and also special duties which he is, from time to time, authorized to underI have, noticed the semi-political remarks made by Captain Collins on one or two public occasions, but they have been such as I think no exception could be taken to, because in each case he has simply repeated, generally in the same words, statements which have been made on behalf of the Government, and chiefly by myself, either here or in England. I have not noticed that he has ever done more than repeat statements of that kind, or has made any statements of his own opinions.",14
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is it wise to make Captain Collins the mouth-piece of the honourable gentleman's political views?,14
8,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I understand that the Prime Minister does not disapprove of a permanent public servant, in the person of Captain Collins, expressing political opinions at public meetings, on the ground that that gentleman has previously made statements which are an echo or repetition of the views of the Government or of ihe Prime Minister himself. Does the Prime Minister not see that such a course of action will mean that in the event of an undesired change of Ministry Captain Collins' usefulness will at once be terminated ?",14
9,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No ; Captain Collins could do the same for another Minis,14
10,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I desire to know if the Prime Minister does not think it dethat Captain Collins should ce. se into make public political statements?,14
11,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I think there is every objection to a public servant making statewhich ments which can have the slightest party bearing or which contain a political ference to any question then in contention. But while this officer is in London, and speaking at a gathering of a Colonial Club, where the members or audience conbe sist almost wholly of Australians, it is not sive to construct. at. all out of order, in acknowledging the toast of the Commonwealth, to make stateaccount ments of a general character when they are in harmony with the current opinion the Commonwealth. Captain Collins not speak with any personal accent; while I should be the first to jealously sist any attempt on the part of an express opinions on political questions, a general statement of the development the country or the movement of public affairs in the Commonwealth ought not be too captiously criticised.",15
12,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Captai n Collins pressed political opinions of which I and other honourable members disapprove.,15
13,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Exactly ; but there is no opinion which can be expressed on subject that some one will not disapprove; consequently, either there must be absolute silence or some general permission of the sort so long as it is not abused. NORTHER-N TERRITORYT RAN SCONTINE NT AL RAILWAY. afforded",15
14,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister a question without notice. telegram appears in this morning's newswould papers to the effect that the motion ing the conditions on which the proposed surrender of the Northern Territory Commonwealth has been passed by both Houses of the Parliament of South tralia. As the terms of the agreement volve the consent of South Australia the survey and construction of a line Western Australia, I wish to ask the Minister whether he can say what route is likely to be chosen for the construction of the railway, and whether in determinurge ing the route the Government will congive sider the advisableness of taking the through country in South Australia is susceptible of development?",15
15,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have observed great satisfaction the passage of tion referred to in both Houses South Australian Parliament. In regard to the honourable gentleman's second tion, so far as I am aware, there are two alternative routes from Port Augusta have been proposed as those which the future line should follow; one to the renorth of Lake Gardiner and the other to the south, skirting the coast. The only advantages, so far as I am aware, claimed for the southern route, are that it would somewhat shorter, and be more inexpenBut there are grave strategic dangers which must be taken into when carrying an important connection such as this would be so close to the of sea, and therefore open at any time to does possible severance from the sea. - and Mr Glynn - There is also the objecretion that that route would take the line officer to through the poorest country.",15
16,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Of that I am not able of personally to speak. The other route which, would pass to' the northward of to Lake Gardiner, would take the line ih the neighbourhood of what are believed to be has exvery - large mineral deposits.",15
17,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,And through hundreds of square miles of pastoral country.,15
18,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It would involve, I any think, no very material increase in the length of the line. Although the purpose of such a railway would be to connect the western State with the eastern States, from which it is at present severed, the necessity for making the line self-supporting cannot be overlooked. Whichever route the greatest possibilities of local earnings would naturally be selected. I A am sure that any Federal Parliament , lend an attentive ear to representaaffirmtions from either of the States through which it will pass, offered by those most to the competent to offer a valuable opinion.",15
19,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Before asking Austhe Prime Minister a question without innotice, I should like to refer to the very to satisfactory newsof this morning, as to to the passing of the Northern Territory Prime resolution in the Legislative Council of South Australia. I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he will take steps to the South Australian Government to their consent to the Kalgoorlie to Port line Augusta railway survey, which was recentlythat authorized by the CommonAvealth Parliament, subject to the proviso that, before with any money is expended the assent of the the moParliament of South Australia must be of the obtained to the survey being made in that State. I make this request bequescause it may be thought that the South but Australian Parliament, having assented to the Northern Territory transfer Bill, which contains a provision authorizing the survey and construction of the railway through South Australia, from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, there is no necessity for its assent to the survey to which I have referred. I point out to the Prime Minister, however, that if that view were taken much undesirable delay would result, as some months may elapse before the Northern Territory Transfer Bill comes before the Federal Parliament. I think it only requires the question to be brought prominently under the notice of the South Australian Parliament, that the assent of the Parliament of that State is necessary before the Commonwealth Government can spend any funds on the survey, to insure immediate attention to the matter. It is most probable that the South Australian Government will attend to the matter with-, out any special request; but still I should be glad if the Prime Minister will make a representation on the subject, as the matter is urgent.",15
20,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I shall have pleasure in doing so. IMPORTATION OF PIANOS.,16
21,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I wish to ask the to Minister of Trade and Customs a without notice. Can he say whether a communication was addressed to Mr states Beale, the piano manufacturer, by the Customs authorities, supplying him with particulars as to the number and value of the pianos imported into the Commoneach wealth from 1902 to T907? Is the Minisprisoners ter aware that the Customs authorities, in ment. furnishing the information, made serious errors? Has the fact that such errors have been made been communicated to Mr mates, Beale, and, if so, has the correction been communicated also to the importers? not, can he say why?",16

As we shall reach the Christmas adjournment in a few days, I wish to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether he will take an early opportunity to delinitelv state what the intentions of the Government are in this matter?",16
24,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Certainlv, every information will be afforded to honourable members, probably on Tuesday next. There has been a little delay in connection with some of the notices, owing' to a blunder, on the part of one of the officials. That will not materially interfere with the steps the Government propose to take, and I hope that, on Tuesday next, at the latest, and possibly on Mon- day, honourable members will.be placed ""in possession of full information on this subject. SPANISH IMMIGRANTS.",16
25,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I wish to ask whether the attention of the Prime Minister has been directed to an article appearTARIFF. ing in this morning's Argus, headed ""Strike of Spaniards"": For the information of honourable members. I propose read the paragraph, which is not a very question long one. It is as followsBRISBANE, Thursday - A Geraldton telegram that all the Spaniards in the district went out on strike on Monday. Seven were summoned today, a test case from each of the seven farms. The police magistrate fined them j£io and costs, in default four months' imprisonment, the sentence to be suspended if the would go back and finish their agreeA l l instantly refused, and when the police went to remove them to the cells, the other Spaniards in court instantly rushed to their crying, "" All togetlier, all together."" They took possession of the Court-house, and a If disgraceful scene followed. Eventually the police put the prironers in the of petty sessions' office, the others outside continuing yelling and gesticulating for a of an hour. Finally the police locked the prisoners and alltheir mates, to the number of 28. The Spaniards stale that they not work while they are under the present I ask the Prime Minister, as the Government are to a great extent responsible for those men here, if he will cause inquiries to be made to ascertain whether they have been treated properly or otherwise, or if the agreements have not been carried out by the employers, or what rea llv is the cause of the trouble at Geraldton. and inform the House as soon as possible of the result of those inquiries?",16
26,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I - h a d not observed the nicely to my accompaniment. paragraph in the paper this morning. There can be no objection to inquiring into the statements made. responsibility of this Government for the introduction of those men is, as the honourable member is aware, indirect - We gave permission that, provided suitable labour could not be obtained from the Mother Country, it might be obtained from Europe. Certain Spaniards some weeks ago occasioned trouble in the neighbourhood of Geraldton. I had inquiry made into that circumstance, and found that apparently not one of those who could be tested had been found to be familiar with country employment. They came from Spanish towns, unacquainted with any form of agriculture, , and familiar only with some employmentI forget the particulars-of a light and casual character. They appeared to be quite unsuited for the work to which they had been put.",17
27,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Was there any suspicion that they had been brought out under false pretences ?,17
28,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No . When I was in North Queensland a short time ago, I endeavoured to ascertain in what way the foreign element generally, which consists chiefly of Spaniards, was behaving. At that time there had been no disturbance, but there was already a good deal of doubt, on the part of those who had seen the men, as to whether the bulk of them were of appropriate character to make good agricultural settlers. PARLIAMENT HOUSE:",17
29,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Treasurer a question without notice. There is a piano, which is "" fetching,"" at least in appearance, in one of the' ante-rooms, and covering a good deal of with its geographical area. I desire to ask the Treasurer, whose skill as a maniputhe lator of the strings we know is exceptional, and who, with an enviable delicacy touch, is capable, without notice, provising variations that would almost gar the genius of a Lizst, whether before the item of pianos is reached, either by himself taking his place at the board or otherwise, give us an opportunity of testing the resonance of the instrument?",17
30,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I wish I could play. I have no doubt that in thatcase the honourable member could sing very I knownothing as to who gave permission for the piano to be placed where it is. I presume The that Mr Speaker did so. Certainly I did not apply to him. I have had nothing to do with the matter.  maker of one class of pianos has been granted the privilege of exhibiting one of his instruments within the precincts of this building, I desire to ask the Prime Minister ' whether he will extend similar privileges to those interested in other makes of instruments? - Mr DEAKIN - Honourable members will recollect that I have no power to either admit or exclude the smallest piece of furniture from the Parliamentary Buildings. Every honourable member possesses the same right as I do. The whole and sole direct control of this part of the building is vested in Mr Speaker and the Committee of which he is the head.",17
31,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I should like to say that when the question of showing within this building a sheep'-shearing machine was brought up, I think by the honourable member for Lang, I was asked whether I would give similar permission in the case nf any other exhibit in the north lobby, and I said that I would. I took it that the House assented to the course I suggested, and when permission was sought later on for a piano to be placed in the lobby, I gave the desired consent, and hence the piano is there.",17
32,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,May I ask the Treasurer whether he will endeavour to EXHIBIT make arrangements to have the very best foreign-made piano obtainable placed OF PIANO . against the Beale piano in the north lobby for purposes of comparison ?,17

36,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I clo not know keywhy the honourable member for Boothby has asked me this question. After my experience in connection with the exhibition of a sheep-shearing machine, it is not likely that I would take any part in the introduction of any other exhibit. I have had nothing whatever to do with' the exhibition of this piano in the north lobby. I refer the honourable member for Boothby to Mr. Speaker as to the suggestion to have another piano introduced.",17
37,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"I wish to ask you, Mr Speaker, whether you have given permission for the corridors to be used by the general public in connection with the - various wares that are now being exhibited ?",18
38,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have"" given no perexpedition mission except in cases where there have been specific applications. When specific .application is made to me, I shall deal - with it in a. way which I deem to be fitting.",18
39,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I believe that appliacter cations have been already made by several importers representing European firms for leave to exhibit their pianos within the precincts of the House, and I presume that 3io objection will be offered to their doing so.",18
40,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The objection which it seems necessary to raise in such cases is - contained in the fact that the room will not hold an indefinite number of pianos.

41,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Is the 'Minister of Trade and Customs aware that it is reported that the Massey-Harris Company are employing skilled labourers at 6s. a day in putting together agricultural implements? Does not the Minister think that that is an evasion of the award of Mr Justice Higgins ?,18
42,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I was not aware of what the honourable member states, although the honourable member for Wide"" Bay brought the matter under my notice a few minutes ago. I intend to make every inquiry in order to find out exactly what is being done and what steps should be taken. ABORIGINES: WESTERN AUSTRALIA. ALLEGATIONS OF CRUELTY.",18
43,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the was Prime Minister, without notice, whether his attention has been drawn to a statement in the Age newspaper of today concerning the treatment of .aborigines in Western Australia ? As these reports generally filter through to Great Britain, and reflect very seriously upon the character of the people of Australia-and possibly this paragraph has already got there-wil l the honourable gentleman take measures to counteract any false impression conveyed ? The Age in a leading article this morning saysOnly the other clay Mr E. J. Blake related a tale at Perth of what he had personally witnessed as a member of a recent exploring in the Wiluna district. He declares that the explorers caught the blacks they encountered on their way, and with the most inhuman cruelty chained them by the necks and forced them to act as guides. These serious accusations against the charof the exploring party are virtually contradicted in another part of the same paper, although it is apparently assumed in the leading article that Blake's statement is absolutely true. In another column that statement is challenged by the members of the exploring party, as appears from the followingIn the Assembly, Mr Troy called attention tb statements made by Mr E. J. Blake, cook of the Canning stock route exploring party, with regard to the treatment of natives, as published in the press. The Premier replied that Mr Canning's attention had been called to Mr Blake's statements, which were absolutely at variance with Mr Canning's own statements. Full particulars would be given to Parliament when Mr Canning had had an opportunity to reply. Mr Canning this evening gave the press a detailed denial of the allegation of ill-treatment. Can the Prime Minister see his way to send a cablegram to the representative of the Commonwealth in London for publication, to the effect that Blake's statement has been challenged and denied absolutely by the members of the exploring party ?",18
44,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I think the course suggested would be judicious, and shall certainly take it , although it may be desirable to wait until we see the denial in full . I had already noted both the paragraphs quoted by the honourable member, for the purpose of. giving a contradiction, should the statement made by the head of the expedition disprove the allegation, as I feel confident that it will. ' Quite recently, when in England, I was met on a number of occasions by statements of this kind, which it very difficult to refute at the moment.",18

Has this matter received consideration; and, if so, what action has been determined upon with respect to the proposal?",20
58,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"The - answers to the honhonorable member's questions are as follow1. Yes. 2. A similar proposal was inquired into some 18 months since. The Associated Chambers of Commerce of the Empire propose to visit Australia in 1909, when 200 representative men from the Mother Country and the Sister Dominions will arrive, accompanied by a number of leading journalists, incidentally making a tour of the States. In this manner the . press of the greater part of the English-speaking world will have its attention directed to the Commonwealth in the most effective way. ALLEGED OVERWORK, SYDNEY POST OFFICE.",20
59,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"On 29th November, the honourable member for Cook asked me but as the disthe following questions1. Why are not telegraphists appointed, considering the alleged inadequate and overworked staff of the G.P.O., Sydney, and the numerous complaints by the public appearing in the columns of the daily press in New South Wales? Mr THOMAS 2. Is it a fact that officers of the General D i vision who qualified for positions of telegraphists over eighteen months ago are still kept at their present grade and salaries, notwithstanding the fact that they are, and have been, performing telegraphists' work. If so, why are these officers not appointed, and their rightfu l increases allowed them ? I have now been furnished with the following replies1. Positions for telegraphists have been provided to the full extent of the provision made on the Estimates for 1907-8. 2. Thirty-five officers passed the examination referred to, and of this number eighteen have been promoted as telegraphists or to the Professional Division. The remaining successful candidates will receive promotion as vacancies occur for telegraphists. TELEGRAPHISTS, SYDNEY.",20
60,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Upon 22nd November, the honourable member for Calare asked the followingquestionsASSOCIATION. 1. Is the Postmaster-General aware that Mr THOMAS telegraphists employed in the Sydney Head Office on the afternoon staff are frequently called upon to work extra long hours at night? 2. Is it a fact that a large proportion of the extra work thus entailed upon the staff originates after their regular working hours? , 3. Is it a fact that officers commencing duties a't 10.30 a.m. are frequently detained until 8 p.m. ? 4. Have representations been made by representatives of the staff as to the disabilities thus entailed, and what steps, if any, is it proposed to take to redress these overtime grievances? The Acting Deputy Postmaster-General, wood) agreed to. Sydney, has now supplied me with the following information1. Telegraphists employed in the G.P.O., Sydney, on the afternoon staffare frequently called upon to perform extra hours at night when business is much congested in consequence of interruptions or bad working of the circuits. through adverse weather conditions during the day. No case has, however, ever been brought under the notice of the Manager where any of the Telegraphists' total hours of duty during any one fortnight have been in excess of eightyfour hours, which would entitle him to a claim for overtime. As, with the exception of a few stations which are open till 10 p.m., offices throughout the country are closed by 8 p.m., when conditions are normal, the majority of the afternoon staff Telegraphists, who commence duty at 3 p.m., are released at 8.15 p.m., or very shortly afterwards. They are required to take it in turn to clear all business for the 10 o'clock stations. 2. It is not a fact that a large proportion the extra work performed by the staff originates after they have been on duty six hours. Telegraphists while on duty are called upon to assist in any emergency which may arise after their regular hours. 3. It is not. a fact that officers commencing duty at 10.30 a.m. are frequently detained until 8 p.m. During the month ended igth November they were kept on on eight different dates after 6 p.m., and of these on five dates till 8 p.m, or later, the latest hour being 8.30 p.m., on the 12th of that month. 4. The only representations made to the Manager, Telegraph Branch, were by members of the intermediate staff, who on the 16th November, drew his attention to the extra demands that had been made on their services during the past month. He had already given instructions to the Assistant Manager that arrangements must be made to prevent the intermediate staff being kept on so late. The latest hour subsequent to the 15th November that any member of this staff has been required to remain on is 5.40 p.m. They may, under exceptional circumstances, be required on occasions to perform extra duty, the same as Telegraphists on other staffs are required to do. The Manager has, however, given instructions that they must not *at any time be kept later than 6.15 p.m. without his special sanction. Overtime work resulting from conditions referred to in answer to question 1 cannot be avoided. Including all overtime, Head Office Telegraphists' hours, taken throughout the year, ' average less than 6£. per working day, except those on the intermediate staff (5), who average less than seven. Application has been made for six additional Telegraphists lo be put on at once to cope with the increasing business. Mr Mauger. TARIFF.

61,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Trea surer) [2.35] - I move That the words ""including brush handles"" be left out. These handles will then automatically fall under item 309, under which they will be dutiable at 20 per cent. The reason underlying my proposal is that they are really tool handles, and it is thought only fair that they should be included in the next item, under which all tool handles will be dutiable^ Amendment agreed to.",21
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Parramatta) [2.36] - I should like to know why a disof tinction is made between the duty proposed! upon this item and that levied upon the succeeding item? Both items are really in the same - category, and why one should be dutiable at 30 per cent, and the other at only 20 per cent. 1 cannot understand. I hope that the Treasurer will consent to a reduction of the rate proposed, because brushmakers' woodware and turnery are a very simple form of manufacture.",21
63,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Hume-Trea - surer) [2.37] - The reason why a higher duty is levied upon this item than upon the succeeding one is that. all the articles enumerated under it are being made in the Commonwealth, whereas some of those covered by the next item are not being made in Australia to the same extent. Hence the distinction which has been drawn. In this matter, the Government have adopted the recommendations of the A section of the Tariff Commission. Amendment-(by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) proposed - That the words "" and on and after 7th December,' 1907 (United Kingdom), 25 per cent.,'* be added.",21
64,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Swan) [2.39] I am in receipt of a letter from a brushware company in Western Australia, in which the writer complains of this proposed increase of duty from 20 to 30 per cent. He says that the woodware specified in this item forms an important part of the raw material of his company, and that the bulk of the same is imported from the United Kingdom. In many lines of brushware, such as scrubs, - dandies, distempers, & c , we have now great - difficulty in meeting the English and foreign - competition. It would suit our purpose If the rate against the United Kingdom was reduced . to 20 per cent.",21
65,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"At the instance of the Treasurer brush handles have been taken out of this item, so that they f all under the next item, and are dutiable at 20 per cent. . Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to. Item 309. Tool Handles, unattached, ad val. 30 per cent. Mr JOSE PH COOK (Parramatta) £2.41] - I hope that the Treasurer will consent to give a preference to British tool handles.",22
66,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,I cannot do that. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Surely tool handles are a very proper subject for a preference.,22
67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Unde r the Tariff they were dutiable at 15 per cent.,22
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"I m o v e That the words "" and on and after 7th December, 1907, ad val. (United Kingdom), 15 per cent.,"" be added.",22
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Hume-Trea surer) [2.43]-- I hope that the honourable member for Parramatta will not press the amendment. It is a unique circumstance that the two sections of the Tariff Commission have recommended the imposition of a duty of 20 per cent, on these articles.",22
70,Mr STORRER,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Bass) [2.43] - I do not see why this amendment should be made. Yesterday we had a long discussion about the qualities of Australian woods. Surely there is in Australia wood suitable for the making of tool handles, and certainly there are persons who can do the work.",22
71,Mr WILSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Corangamite) [2.44] This item deals with the tools of trade of workers in the country districts. covers, for instance, fork handles.",22
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Many of them are free.,22
73,Mr WILSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,They ought to be free. Take for instance axe handles. We have not suitable timber for making them.,22
74,Mr BAMFORD,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Dozen s of them are being made at Cairns.,22
75,Mr WILSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"No doubt axe handles of a sort can be made at. Cairns, but timber-getters mostly use an American handle.'",22
76,Mr BAMFORD,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"At Cairns handles are being made equally as good as, and in some instances better than, American handles.",22
77,Mr WILSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,1 think that the honourable member is wrong.,22
78,Mr BAMFORD,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,I have seen them.,22
79,Mr WILSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Ax e handles are specially made out of a certain, description of American wood. We have no wood similar to that wood. This item covers innumerable handles of tools of trade. The old duty of 15 per cent, was quite high enough, and the honourable member for Herbert has informed us that with that protection handles are made here. No doubt they are making some handles and making them profitably too with that protection. Therefore his argument is really in favour of restoring the old duty.",22
80,Mr BAMFORD,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,The honourable member old wants the handles made free ?,22
81,Mr WILSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,No ; I shall be quite satisfied if we can reduce the duty to 15 per cent.,22
82,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Why should we reduce the duty to less than that which the free trade section of the Tariff Commission has recommended ?,22
83,Mr WILSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"As a general rule, the honourable member does not believe that the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission was right in making a particular recommendation. I ask him to be consistent on this occasion, and say that it was wrong in recommending a duty of 20 per cent. He must know that throughout his electorate a large number of tool handles are used. Surely he is aware that the greater number of tool handles used in mining and agriculture are imported handles. I ""shall support the amendment, because I think that a duty of 15 per cent, is a perfectly fair one to impose. ' Mr WATKINS (Newcastle)- [2.47] - I It hope that the Committee .will not reduce the duty. If we can compete with the world in making anything, it is in making the handle for any tool of trade;",22
84,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Not a handle for an axe, because we have not suitable wood.",22
85,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,F o r three vears I have used Colonial handles in the bush just as well as any other handle.,22
86,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"The member broke a handle every day, I expect ?",23
87,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,I broke more American than Colonial handles.,23
88,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Of were they made?,23
89,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,We made them out of spotted gum and blue gum.,23
90,Mr HEDGES,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Thos e handles are no good.,23
91,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Spotte d gum is the finest timber for making handles.,23
92,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"T O start with, it is too heavy.",23
93,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"A miner, who has to lie on his side when he is at work,, wants the smoothest possible handle for his pick. Every handle for a miner's pick is made out of spotted gum, and, generally, by ah old miner, who earns a few shillings in that way. If ever there was an industry which could be said to be a poor man's industry it is the industry of making pick handles.",23
94,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,They cannot make axe handles.,23
95,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,I get my axe handles made by the man who used to make my pick handles. I hope that the duty on tool handles will not be reduced.,23
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,I am afraid that the honourable member has only a very few tools in his' mind.,23
97,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,I think the honorwho able member will admit that the handle that is required in a miner's pick needs be as smooth as any handle that can made.,23
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,It is the simplest form of handle of all.,23
99,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"It may be, but to be very smooth, or the hands of the miner will not stand. Honourable bers can take any timber in the world have handles made from it , but I will a pieoe of spotted gum against any of castle. them. It can resist a greater breaking strain than any timber that can be imabout axe handles. ported. Mr HENRY WILLIS .[2.51] - This is a duty which will f all exof? . clusively Upon the working man.",23
100,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Handle s are made exclusively by working men.,23
101,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"What is more, tool handles are not made to shape in Australian wood as they are when imported, and, consequently, men who use them will be able to do so much less work. Work in the bush is almost entirely done by the ported ash. honourable piece. If a bushman has an axe handle of the right shape, he will be able to do morework with less fatigue than if he has a. badly-shaped handle. I believe that the only handle that can be made satisfactorily, what wood in this country in competition with i m ported handles is the handle for the pick: of the miner, or something of that kindSuch a handle is almost straight, or tapersaway to the end. I believe that Australianwood is as good as imported timber for that particular purpose. But a handle for almost every other tool has a turn in it somewhere; and it is putting in that turn, that involves labour. The output of Australian handles must necessarily be small.. It cannot be expected that we can compete against a. country like the United! States, with '80,000,000 people, or against' Great Britain with her enormous population. Therefore, this would be exclusively a tax upon the wage-earner. It would meanincreasing the revenue from this sourcefrom 1^4,280 probably to ^5,000 more,, and that money would have to be paid by the wage-earners. I hope that the Treasurer will give some consideration to the question from that point of view.",23
102,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Laanecoorie) [2.54] The honourable member for Robertson has; entered a plea for the working man who uses tool handles.

113,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"The Chairman of the Tariff Commission is, I am sure, too good a protectionist to say that right through the Tariff he is prepared to grant 5 cent, as a preference. Honourable members opposite are not treating fairly those us who believe in preference when they come along with these demands for duction of duty on such an article.",24
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Is it always to preference up, and never preference down? That is absolutely sham preference.",24

122,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"They sell them locally. It is all very well for those who are in terested in large tracts of forest country, which they have taken up for purposes of imexploitation, to endeavour to get these special concessions. But 1 notice that they . are not so anxious for reductions of duty in when we are dealing with timber. I do plead with honourable members to recollect that this is not a large capitalistic indusasktry, but one carried on by individuals who work hard for their living. Those who to take away from these men the only means of subsistence which ""they have, are taking upon themselves a very grave re",24
123,Mr HEDGES,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Fremantle) {2.59] - . We have been supplied with a lot of use- * less knowledge about axe handles, and the honourable member for Newcastle has told us that pick handles for miners can be per made out of spotted gum. They can be made out of deal, so far as that goes, and of can be worn down very smooth. But when a man has to get his living by swinging a rean axe he must have a handle so cut as to make the blade f all with the greatest be possible weight where it is wanted, and as true as can be. An axe handle is quite different from a pick handle. I have no desire to interfere with the Newcastle that miners. If they choose to encourage their : It is old men to make pick handles and scrape them smooth with a bit of glass paper, let them do it.

We do honnot object to old men in the bush are making a few handles out of whatever of such wood they can obtain. They can make them out of broomsticks if they like. But are the Committee should not interfere with a big industry such as we are running in their Western Australia. We have imposed a duty of 15 per cent, on some tools of trade. I do not object to a reasonable duty-sa y 15 per cent - o n these handles, which are also tools of trade. But those honourable members who ask for a higher duty than that are going too far. They must recollect that the men who use them pay for their own axes and handles.",24

If they were given the full run of the store the employer - would not be able to get enough for them. It is necessary that they should purchase them from their employers in order that some control may be kept over their use.

"" Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) £3.2] - In order that honourable members may realise how. great a concession this will be to Great Britain, I would point out that last year our imports from the United Kingdom were valued at ^ 9 4 8 , whilst those coming from the United States were of the value of ^27,505. Mr EDWARDS '(Oxley) [3.3] - I was surprised to hear the statement made a few moments ago that tool handles could not be made in Australia, since I knpw that they can be produced in all parts of the Commonwealth. I have a small farm near Brisbane where, when Parliament is not in session, I spend a good deal of time and make from timber on the ground all - the tool handles that I need. I find them nearly as good as any that are imported from America. I think that we ought to encourage an industry of this kind, and shall therefore vote for a duty.",25
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"The duty under the general Tariff has already been dealt with, and my amendment relates only to a British preference.",25
139,Mr EDWARDS,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"I regret very much that, although the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, when in London, talked largely of preferential trade, they have not kept faith with Great Britain. The princinle of preference so far as this Parliament is concerned has been nothing but a sham. We ought to be prepared to make some little sacrifice to the Motherland. This Parliament has not dealt fairly with Great Britain, and I repeat that the promises made by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer when in the Old Country have not ' been fulfilled.",25

A shaping machine is used, and the timber is rapidly converted into pick or axe handles. First-class timber is available in the district, and a bushman whom I met there told me that he - was taking back with him a dozen locally-produced axe handles, which had cost from is. 66. to is . 9d. per dozen less than the imported article, and which, he said, were not only, cheaper, but better, than the imported handles.",25

162,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Hume-Trea surer) [3.37] - If the Committee intend to go on as they have begun, the sooner we stop the better, because the rate proposed by the Government is the old duty, and is recommended by the Tariff Commission.",28

164,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Parramatta) [3-38]--Why this extraordinary and justifiable increase from 20 to 35 per cent. I wish that the Chairman of the Tariff Commission, whose example the Minister is evidently following in connection with this item, would explain why it is necesceived sary to propose a 75 per cent, increase duty. I could understand some of these huge duties, from a protectionist point view, being placed upon articles which quire rare and special skill, but this is article whose manufacture calls for the most rudimentary skill.",28
165,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Bendigo) [3.40]:A mass of evidence was given with reference to the picture frame making industry and moulding industry. The honourable member for Parramatta will find it summarized on page 479 of the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff sion. The manufacturers complained that satisfied. they were being inundated with cheap picture frames from America, lightly structed and attractive in appearance,, that they had to face fierce and intense competition. They also pointed out that in Australia they had to pay duty on moulding, which was their raw material. In this matter two industries have to considered-the making of mouldings the making of picture frames. Of course the picture frame maker would like his mouldings free, but on the other hand number of manufacturers arte engaged making splendid mouldings of Australian timber. Samples c f them were exhibited prein this building yesterday. Some made to from Queensland timbers would defy the I world for brilliancy of finish and excellence of workmanship.",28
166,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,We have given an extra protection to the makers of mouldings.,28
167,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"The Committee last night unanimously increased the duty on mouldings from 20 to' 30 per cent. It was felt that we ought to promote the moulding industry, which is the basis ancl foundation of the picture frame making industry. Having increased the duty on is the raw material, we should raise rather than reduce the duty on picture frames, as the interests of the Australian manufacturers should be considered. In fact, 1 understand that the honourable member f o: Kooyong has received this morning a letor ter, in which the picture frame makers complain of the altered incidence of the duties, and ask for the addition of an unalternative duty of 4d. per foot. I can ? assure the honourable member for Parramatta that the duty on this item ought to be increased, rather than reduced.",28
168,Mr KNOX,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Kooyong) [3.43] - I reto-day the letter which I hold ipo f my hand, from a well-known firm of picture frame makers. They ask, in conof sequence of the changes made last night rein the timber duties, that there should be an added to this item the words ""or 4d. per only foot, whichever is the higher rate.""",28
169,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,We do not want those double-barrelled duties.,28
170,Mr KNOX,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,I do not believe in them myself; but practically the whole of the trade makes this request.,28

172,Mr KNOX,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Thos e who write to me conare responsible people, who speak, not and only on behalf of themselves as manufacturers, but for the whole of the trade. They point. out that there is a big industry i i i the Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, and that, in consequence of the cheap picture be frames which are introduced from various and parts of Germany, it would be hopeless for them to expect to make any profit out of the business. I have no personal knowa ledge as to whether their representations in are correct, but they are a most reputable firm, and their statements may safely be taken as fair and reasonable. They saythat, owing to the importation of the 3plv veneer to Australia, the importation of manufactured frames had been almost knocked out under the old Tariff, with the exception of a few of very inferior quality, but if the duties were to remain as they now stand, all those who are now making picture frames in Australia must close up. There must be tlvirtv firms manufacturing these frames in Australia at present, and it would be a most serious matter to the whole industry to reduce the proposed duty.",28
173,Mr TOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Parramatta) [3.47] - I wish I hacl not spoken. It seems to me that I am in danger of causing the proposed duty' to be doubled.

I took the recommendation of the former for the United Kingdom column, ancl proposed a duty elf ?5 per cent, in the General Tariff column, in order to give - a preference nf 10 ner cent.

When that scheme is departed from; these recommendations simply go by the board; and the Treasurer appears to have quite overlooked' this governing factor. I shall support the proposal to make the item free.",29

184,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,North Sydney) [3.55] - Since this item proposes to give preference to the United Kingdom I think I shall be in order in calling the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to an announcement which appears in the newspapers of this morning. It would appear that the Department or the Minister- I do not know which-is now legislating by regulation in a different wav from that intended by Parliament; and the seriousness of the position leads me to call attention to the matter at the earliest possible moment. The will of Parliament ought to be carried out by the Minister and the Department; and I call attention to the following announcement in this morning's Melbourne Age.,29
185,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"I ask the honourable member not to go into this matter full y, or he will open up a general discussion on the question of preference. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - I have"" no desire to cause a general debate on the question, but merely to inquire whether regulations have been made as stated by the newspaper. The announcement is as followsThe "" A "" certificate makes the manufacturer or supplier of goods in Great Britain certify that all the goods set out in a given invoice are "" bond fide the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom, and that a substantial portion of the .labour of that country has entered into the production of every manufactured article included in the said invoice to the extent in each article of not less than one-fourth of the value of every such article in its present condition ready for export to the Commonwealth of Australia."" If I were debating the matter, I - should point to the enormous difficulty which must be created by such a regulation. We here decided that certain articles from Great Britain should receive preference, whatever proportion of labour might be involved; but the Department or the Minister now requires that the labour must be equal to 25 per cent. Our decision had no reference to the labour employed, but merely required that the article should be produced or manufactured in Great Britain.",30
186,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Man v goods sent from Great Britain to Australia are manufactured in other countries. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - Le t me point out that although sugar does not grow in the United Kingdom, a preference is given in the case of British confectionery. Is that preference to be withheld in every instance in which 25 per cent, of British labour has not been employed? If this regulation be enforced, there will be not only enormous difficulty caused to the exporter and to the Department, but also an absolute departure from the decision at which we arrived, knowing that in the case of many articles 25 per cent, of British or any labour was not employed. In fact, the labour in some articles might not be 5 per cent, of their value. Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN Monaro - Minister of Trade and Customs) [4.3] - I shall be very glad <to . give consideration to the representations of the honourable member for North Sydney. ' In dealing with this matter, our aim has been to attain as far as possible uniformity throughout the Empire. This preferential idea is spreading, and if there be ""uniformity it Will make the administration much smoother. The regulations, as a matter of fact, are identical with the preferential regulations in other parts of the Empire; and we must be very careful to give preference to goods that are really British, and not to goods which just flit through Great Britain on their way to Australia. If preferencebe given to goods of the latter class, we shall place Great Britain at a disadvantage, and, in. fact, defeat the very object we have in view. I am pleased that the honourable member - has raised the question, and I shall look further into it.",30
187,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,All that is required is to see that goods are the legitimate manufacture of Great Britain without any reference to the percentage of labour.,30
188,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Quite so; but there must be some clear lines laid down-som e definition of the goods entitled to preference.,30
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Surely that is for honourable members to determine?,30
190,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Certainlv ; and, as I say, I shall be glad to give the representations of the honourable member for North Sydney every consideration. This question must be discussed when the of the Tariff Bill is introduced. It is the desire of every one of us to place preference on a fair and equitable basis; and in what we have done we have, to a great extent, been guided by the experience in other parts of the Empire. Mr. JOSEPH COOK .Parramatta) [4.4] - I confess that the point raised by the honourable member for North Sydney had escaped my observation.",30
191,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"I allowed the honourable member for North Sydney to call attention' to this matter, and the Minister to reply. It is true that that was slightly irregular; but I regarded the question as important enough to justify the latitude given. I must ask honourable members, however, not to debate further the general (Eden- question of preference. Item agreed to. Item 313. Buggy Shafts, bent, but not dressed, per pair, 2S. 6d.",30
192,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Dalley) [4.6] - This item is the first of a group relating to parts used in the manufacture of buggies. should like to know the reason for substituting specific duties for ad valorem rates in respect of these items.,31
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,All these specific duties are merely devices for concealing inordinately high rates.,31
194,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"I am inclined to agree with the honourable member. If we wish to levy high imposts, do not let us disguise them by substituting specific duties for ad valorem rates. The Treasurer asks that a fixed duty shall be imposed upon buggy shafts, bent, but not dressed, notwithstanding that under the old Tariff they were admitted free. I would further point out that these shafts are a portion of the raw material of the coach-, builder. They are made mainly from hickory ancl American ash.",31
195,Mr CHANTER,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,The question is worth arguing.,31
196,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"The coachbuilders think that it is. The fixed duty now proposed would work most inequitably, in that it would fall equally upon the lowest and the highest grade of buggy shafts. other words, the same charge would be levied upon the cheapest and the most expensive shafts. The duty proposed would also be a tax upon all those in the country districts who use buggies. I suggest that buggy shafts in the rough should be admitted free, and that shafts bent and dressed should be dutiable at is. 6d. per pair, or at an ad valorem rate of 20 - per cent.",31
197,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,.Fixe d duties have been agreed to in respect of a good many other items.,31
198,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,My objection is based upon the enormous increase that is proposed.,31

201,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Calare) [4.13]. - This item is important, in that it governs a group of items relating to a particular industry. I should like to, know whether I shall be in order in referring generally to that group?",31
202,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"The honourable member may make incidental reference to other items, but he will not be in order ire debating them. I Mr THOMAS BROWN - In discussing this item we must bear in mind the extent to which our decision will affect theindustry which is particularly concerned.",31
203,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,The small coachbuilders. will be chiefly affected.,31
204,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"The duty proposed will fall heaviest upon the small, coachbuilders who are carrying on operations in country districts. We must recollect that they have to place their manufactures upon the market at a priceapproximating that at which the large manufacturers are able to sell. There is scarcely a country town in New South Wales in which there is not to be found a blacksmith who is also a coachbuilder and buggymaker. He usually devotes the ""slack"" period of the year to the manufacture of sulkies and buggies, which vehinot cles are commonly used in rural areas. Heis unable to procure his raw material locally. As a matter of fact the greater portion of it-especiall y for the lighter class of vehicles-mus t be imported. The general consensus of opinion among buggy In manufacturers is that hickory and other woods will continue to be imported irrespective of the duty which may be imposed"" upon them. A high duty will only operate in the direction of limiting the output of vehicles made of these materials. The contention of the buggy manufacturers is that the proposals of the Government in respect of the group of items to which I have referred will operate. distinctly to their detriment. I should like the Committee tounderstand that this industry is a very considerable one, that it is not concentrated in the big cities, but that it is distributed throughout our small centres. The proposals of the Government, if agreed to, will have the effect of concentrating theindustry in the large manufacturing shops of the cities. Is that a wise result to bring about? If the Committee is prepared to look beyond the interests of thetimber-getters some modification of the proposal immediately under consideration must"" be adopted.",31
205,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Does the honourable member know that this proposal is: equivalent to an ad valorem rate of only 10 per cent. ?,31
206,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"The Coachbuilders' and Wheelwrights' Association' have considered this matter, and haveplaced their position before the members this Committee. They declare that under the old Tariff they were enabled to' build up their industry to such ah extent that their annual output was valued at, apThat proximately, ,£2,000,000. As against that large sum, our total importaare tions were valued at only ,£10,000. matter, The members of the Coachbuilders' and Wheelwrights' Association hold that they have so completely got the control of the industry, that they do not fear importaI tions.",31
207,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,They only assemble the imported parts.,32
208,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"They say that they are prepared to face competition, and, in order to meet the position raised the honourable member, they are willing to He writesaccept the duty on the made vehicle or the completed parts. They object to the into duty on the parts which they use in industry, and which must be imported.",32
209,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"In Queensland and New South Wales, there is an abundant of spotted gum suitable for the production of shafts.",32
210,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Do I underpresent stand the honourable member to imply that spotted gum is suitable for all this work?,32
211,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,No ; but it is for shafts.,32
212,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"I have .no duties doubt that Australian timber will be used where it can be clone profitably. But the men who are engaged in the trade assert will that for the lighter vehicle and the lighter work in vehicles, they are compelled to us make these importations or to cease the 'manufacture of vehicles. They say that iscarts, for the heavier work in their trade they can secure Australian timber, and that they use it wherever it can be done with'advannot tage. But they contend that the smaller parts for the lighter conveyances, such as buggies and sulkies, and the parts of those parts ? conveyances which require durabilitv ancl - strength must be. imported. The association I mentioned state in their circular that the imports of softwoods amount to about 115,000,000 feet pe : annum, that out of the large quantity required only 4,500,000 feet can be obtained from Queensland. That indicates to what small extent, even in those particular lines which are not the main lines for which exemption is required, the Commonwealth is able to meet the great demand for these kinds of wood. The association also state that within the-last two years the prices' of of such woods in the Commonwealth have advanced fully 50 per cent., and that the manufacturers have to pay 50 per cent, more today than they did a few years ago. is only in accord with the' general rise in the prices of all the timbers that used. I am not an expert in this and, therefore, I have to relv for my information upon those who are engaged in the trade. Perhaps I may be permitted to read a few extracts from a letter have received from a manufacturer in a country town with whom I am acquainted. . I know that his opinion is worthy of every consideration, and that his statements can be relied upon. He is managing a company that has gradually grown from a by small beginning to fairly large dimensions. We have been negotiating to put machinery our works, but in view of the duties being their imposed, we have abandoned the idea. He cancelled temporarily the work which was being taken in hand to instalthe new supply machinery. He continuesWe have been in business for eighteen years, and we have made a success of it. At the time we employ about twenty-five hands, and I must say that had we to contend in the earlier stages with these excessive duties we would never have built our business up to what it is today. We have mechanics who have Been in our employ for years, and if these are imposed it will mean, in place of increasing our plant, we must reduce the number of hands employed by us, and our-business be one more of repairing than of manufacturing, for when the prices are increased the demand is always lessened. It would suit to have the additional duties taken off, which I consider is a fair thing, knowing that there a specific duty on vehicles, &c. Spring drays, and waggon wheels are all made from Colonial timber, and that shows clearly that if hickory was procurable here we would mind the imposition of the additional duties.",32
213,Mr STORRER,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Does he want the duty taken off the finished article, as well as the",32
214,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,No ; he wants a duty on the finished article.,32
215,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"He wants the duty taken and off the parts which he uses. Mr THOMAS . BROWN - He is a good protectionist, like my honourable a friends who interject. It is only the very necessitv of the position that compels him an to ask for the reduction of the duties on the American timbers which must be used. He savs that the position has reached this acute stage: that those who give orders to America for such timbers have to wait for"" a period extending to eighteen months until they can be executed. So that there are difficulties even in getting the timbers from America, and that in itself would be sufficient to induce the manufacturers to use colonial timbers wherever it was possible to do so. If honourable members will refer to the Tariff of Canada, they will see that an exception is made in favour of hickory and the other timbers which are required for the manufacture of coaches and buggies, and which, are being imported to Australia. The same thing obtains in New Zealand; in fact, in every protectionist country in which those special timbers are not grown. In such countries these timbers are regarded as the raw materials of the coachbuilders and wheelwrights, and because they cannot be locally produced they are placed on the free list. We are asked by the Coachbuilders' and Wheelwrights' Association to follow the examples of those countries. They ask that the specific duties generally be eliminated, and replaced with ad valorem duties. They hold that a specific duty falls as heavily on the lighter and less expensive vehicle as on the heavier and more expensive vehicle. . The less expensive vehicles are used by the poorer classes, and if these duties are retained the burden of this taxation will f all upon them in a measure out of proportion to their more wealthy countrymen. As regards their raw material, this association have expressed their readiness to accept the old duties. They recommend that the more complete the manufactured article is the higher ad valorem duty it should bear, until the completed article is reached, when, of course, they are prepared to accept any duty which the Committee may impose, so far as lis maximum is 'concerned. The;y ask that in the interests of their industry their representations may receive the favourable consideration of the Committee. Whether they - be free-traders or protectionists, they are unanimously of the opinion that this schedule, if it is passed, will do a very grave injury to their industry; ancl that a humter of the articles which are heavily taxed in the interest of Australian timbers must be imported because they cannot be produced here. I am prepared to support the amendment of the honourable member for Dalley, because under the old Tariff this industry was able to so completely capture the consumption in the Commonwealth that less than £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 covered the amendment. importations. Mr Thomas Brown.",32
216,Mr HEDGES,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Fremantle) [4.34} There, is evidently some mistake with regard to this item, because the Treasurer has just stated that the duty is equal to only 10 per cent. He must have taken the price to refer to a dozen instead of a gross.",33

218,Mr HEDGES,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"I think that the honourable gentleman will acknowledge that there is something wrong about the item. I find that the duty is equal to over 100 per cent. From the most reliable people in Melbourne, Messrs. Ewing and Company, I have just learned by telephone that they can easily. land hickory shafts at 3s. per pair, and hickory poles at 5s. each. I ask the Minister to reconsider the item, or to procure further information.",33

222,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"The free-trade section of the Tariff Commission recommended 20 per cent. Sir WILLIAM . LYNE - I am not going to take as low a duty as 20 per cent. Perhaps duties of 25 per cent, and 35 per cent, would meet the case.",33

224,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Hume-Trea surer) [4.45]-- I move That the words ""and on arid after 7th December, 1907-Ite m 321. Casks, barrels, and vats, n.e.i. (intended to contain liquids), empty or containing goods not subject to ad val. duty, ad val. (General Tariff), 35 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 30 per cent.,"" be added. The reasons for this amendment are that experience of the new item has shown that in practically every instance in which casks containing dry goods or goods other than fluids are imported, the casks are to all intents and purposes of no value when emptied of their imported contents. Such casks as those containing pickled cabbage, olives, sheep dip, &c, have been brought under the notice of the Department as being casks which are valueless after being emptied of their imported contents. Hitherto, the practice of the Department has been - to deal with each case on its merits, and allow the casks to be"" entered as of no value for duty in those cases in which they were of no value as casks when emptied. Whilst a strict reading of the present wording of this item would require that the value of the casks containing goods subject to ad valorem duty should be included in the value of those goods for' duty, and, in addition, that the special duty placed on casks under this item should be charged, the practice of the Department is to charge only the. special duty under this item, ancl to exclude the value of the casks from the value of their ad valorem contents for duty. The proposed amend'ment: will give legislative effect to this LYNE) practice, and will afford relief both to the Department and tG the public without injuring the local coopering trade. The substance of the explanation which I have given is that when casks are imported containing such goods as printers' ink or olives they are of no further use. Therefore, it is not considered fair to charge duty on them. But when wine casks or whisky casks, which can be used again, are brought in, duty is charged on them. It is most unfair to charge, duty on casks which simply have to be broken up for firewood.",34
225,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"North Sydney) [4-50] - The Minister under this item is proposing to charge a special duty on packages which ' are necessary to the safe conveyance of goods to their place of destination, although.we have already decided that when iron tanks are used for this purf u l l pose-and they are saleable at prices nearer their cost than are any other packages--the y shall be admitted 'duty free.",34

The casks in which goods are brought here cannot be made in the country, and if a duty of 35 per cent, is charged on them, it will in many cases greatly increase the gross duty on their contents, which may be dutiable nominally at much lower rates. Sometimes, casks have to be used for the importation of comparatively cheap goods, or of goods upon which the duty is very small. Although the proposal has been put forward with a view to assisting the coopering industry, it may really have the effect of taking some work from the coopers. Most of the tallow casks and many other casks used in Australia are made from local timbers, but there are casks for which only imported timbers can be used, and if they are not remade from imported casks the timber for them will have to be imported in staves, or in the rough, ready to be cut up into staves. By keeping out the casks we shall take from the coopers a good deal of the business in re-making which now goes on. No one would import casks if he could get here casks made of suitable material; but for some purposes special timber is requisite. It may be necessary to use an absolutely tasteless timber, or a non-porous timber, or a timber possessing some other special quality which can be obtained only in imported wood.",34

265,Mr HANS IRVINE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Grampians) [5.1:7] - I did not desire to say anything at this stage. Casks, barrels, and vats casks. are valued for Customs purposes at 22s. 6d. for hogsheads and 14s. 6d. for quarlost ter casks. l n the case of hogsheads, taining about 60 gallons, the duty prodoes. posed would amount to an added tax of about 2^d. per gallon for the casings alone. That seems to me to. be an extraordinary amount of duty to charge on casings. As the honourable member for .Kalgoorlie has second hand hogsheads. pointed out, liquid contents must be brought here in something. I wish to tainting the' contents, are too brittle. see Australian woods used wherever posdesire sible in connection with all our manufaccasks, tures, but I suppose it will be admitted that it would be impracticable, at present, to send Australian woods to Great - Britain for the British trade. for the manufacture of the casks to shipped back to Australia with goods. am quite willing that an effective protecfor tive duty should be placed upon empty are casks. ' The people who use casks do not desire to import empty casks,' but as primary producers they do expect to be able to obtain as cheaply as possible casks imported with contents, on which duty has already been paid. I wish the Treasurer to think that oyer. I suppose I can claim to have tried as much to advance Australian industries as the Treasurer has done. I have had some thousands of Australian casks made, but seven <years ago my advices were that if I shipped wines in casks made of Australian woods they, would be refused. I can tell honourable members why. I heard the Treasurer mention mountain ash and also blackwood as suitable timbers for casks. - I said blackbutt, are Mr HANS IRVINE - I have not tried blackbutt, but I have tried blackwood, and I am prepared to sell the Treasurer some thousands of blackwood staves today at a twentieth of what they cost me. I cannot use them, and I should like the honourable gentleman to take them off my hands, because they are becoming wormeaten, and are an eyesore to me. I shipped to a few hundred hogsheads, and there were complaints that the casks, though they had mainbeen treated with caustic soda to purifv them, tainted the wine. The wood is too bitter. It is splendid for cabinet purposes, but it is not good for shipping wines or the liquids that must maintain a special flavour-.",37

There is little or no demand them for shipping wine, though they used for holding tallow and other things. The goods contained in full casks imported have already paid a high duty, and surely it is not desired to charge a second duty on the casks. As the honourable member for Kalgoorlie pointed out, those casks are practically a by-product, and .are sold for whatever they will bring in the open market - When empty, they only bring 5s. each at Home. I imported a large number of casks from Sydney last year because I was shipping a fair quantity at the time. I got them put on board at ios., while similar casks, if made here, would have cost me £ 1 apiece. That is a consideration to me, because I can charge nothing for the casks in selling my produce. fair and right, in the interest of the primary producer, that full casks should be admitted free, as they were under the old Tariff. A duty on them will be a tax on the primary producer.

311,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"I can quite believe that the honourable member had had ""quite enough of it . "" I am making no complaint against the honourable member personally, because we all know with what rare industry he applied himself to the work. What I am pointing out is the onesided character of the evidence, and its little value. I think the Minister would be quite justified in making these duties uniform at an ad valorem rate. If the coopering trade cannot stand with a duty of 35 per cent., it is a business which ought to be left to look after itself. Why coopers should be exempt from the ordinary competition of trade, I do not know. The honourable member for Bendigo says Beer casks that there is a danger of the industry dving out; but there is a price to be paid for everything, and, if the industry dies with protection to the extent of 35 per cent., it will merely prove that there are coopers somewhere else in the world who can do very much better with less protection. The great difficulty presented in all the evidence of the Tariff Commission is that it is grossly one-sided; none of it is corroborated, and, although sworn to, is ex parte right through. I intend to move that these duties be omitted, and that a uniform ad valorem rate be substituted for them.",40

The increase proposed upon this item is 10 per cent, in excess of the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission.

Treasurer has explained that it is owing to the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission that a duty of 35 per cent, has been levied upon buckets and tubs imported from the United Kingdom. But the Chairman of the Commission has stated that in recommending such high rates of duty, the A section of that body had in mind the maximum amount of duty.

I do not see why the toys used by our children should not be made here. Furthermore, I think we are justified in endeavouring to find avenues of employment for women. Toy-making is really women's work. A reasonable duty would not penalize the children by any means. On the cheaper lines a duty would make very little difference. It might fall heavier upon the dearer kinds of toys, but those who could afford to buy expensive toys are well able to pay the extra duty.

They believe that such a higher duty would tend to reduce the importations of these unfinished settings and mounts, and that it would encourage their manufacture in Australia.. It is a grievance with manufacturing jeweland jewellers' workers that practically finished articles can be imported on the payment of an extremely small duty by placing the fittings or mounts in one parcel and the gems in another.

The honourable member has been a staunch free-trader until of late, when the Melbourne atmosphere seems to have affected him. Surelv rates of 30 and 25 per cent, are sufficiently high too high. even for finished jewellery.",47
398,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Laanecoorie) [8.25] - I wish to read to the Committee the reason which actuated the trade in asking for a be duty of 100 per cent. It is thisAs a consequence of these articles being adat a comparatively small expense as compared with the value of them when the stones are set in, the manufacture of high-class jewellery is only carried on at a limited extent, and although there are many workmen here capable of executing the work, there is very little encouragement for employers to and for apprentices to devote their time to learning, the manufacture of high-class owing to the small demand for the locally-made article, and a duty such as is unrecommended above will undoubtedly have a effect on the future of the trade in cultivating the artistic branches of it. Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [8.27]. - At first the proposed duty seemed to me the very high, but there is a great deal in 1907 the contention of the honourable member for - Yarra. Jewellery is dutiable under item 334 at 30 and 25 per cent, but if Kinga setting and its stones are brought in separately, and 40 per cent, is charged on the setting, while the stones are admitted in free, the amount actually paid is very the much smaller than would be paid on the finished article, though what is imported is virtually a finished article. For inThe stance, a setting might be worth ios., and the stones belonging to it might be worth 30s. If the article were imported as dutifinished jewellery, it would be dutiable at 30 per cent., whereas if the setting and any the stones were imported separately, duty it and would be levied only on the setting, at it a marthe rate of 40 per cent., making the that amount actually paid on the complete per article only a fraction of that. A duty which permits an importation of this kind does not give valid and effective protection. Something must be done to prevent all but the least valuable part of an article the coming in duty free. It seems to me that unless a very high duty is placed on settings, it will be necessary to impose a duty on precious stones.",47
399,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"That would penalize our working jewellers, to whom precious stones are a raw material.",48
400,Mr FOSTER,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,We might put a duty on diamonds.,48
401,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"I do not know why we should differentiate between diamonds and rubies and other stones. Perhaps the best thing would be for the Treasurer to consult 'his officers, and subsequently propose some amendment which would make the duty effective. Mr. JOSEPH ""COOK (Parramatta) [8.29] - I am afraid that the honourable member has fallen into a trap which has been skilfully laid by the honourable member for Yarra. There are other kinds of jewellery besides rings.",48
402,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Most of the jewellery coming under item 334 consists of precious stones and their settings.,48
403,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,There are over a hundred other articles of jewellery besides rings.,48
404,Mr CHANTER,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"The honourable member for Yarra showed brooches and bangles which have been imported as settings, without the precious stones.",48
405,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Does the honourable member mean to say that that practice can be followed in the case of difficult ancl complicated brooches?,48
406,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Yes ; I have some of them here.,48

411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"It may have been that another part of that jewellery, apart altogether from the stones, had to be prepared elsewhere, and that it was necessary for it to be brought in in that way. ",48
412,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Honourable members, apparently, are getting hold of what is perhaps an abuse of a legitimate trade ancl a legitimate importation.",48
413,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"It is not only abuse. The practice to which the honourable member for Yarra has drawn attenL 5 ]- 2 2 2 tion will practically render the duty ineffective regarding all that jewellery which consists of settings and stones, as specified in item 334.",48
414,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"That might be so if they all came in in that way, but in the making up of the jewellery, certain manipulations, apart altogether from the putting in of the stones, may have to be done elsewhere. Does this item specially provide for bringing in jewellery and stones in that way ?",48
415,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,The item is to meet the particular cases in which the settings and stones are brought in separately.,48

448,Mr EDWARD S,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Oxley) [8.48] - There is a great resemblance between the item under consideration and item 334, which deals with jewellery and imitation jewellery : and I suggest that a similar duty should apply to both. I should like to read a few words which have reached my hands from some jewellers' association Melbourne or Sydney, to the following effectThe proposed Tariff, under item 332, establishes a conflict between that number and item 334, for reasons that we endeavour herein set out. (Parramatta) The duty on gold filled jewellery is statedForeign, 40 per cent.; English, 35 per cent.; under No. 332, and yet item 334 states- "" Imitation jewellery-Foreign , 30 per cent:; English, 25 per cent."" We respectfully submit to your notice that in making the difference between "" rolled gold jewellery"" and ""imitation jewellery "" such a conflict will exist in respect to decisions as will cause an element of injustice an'd unrest in regard to the whole of the two lines referred to. Ferhaps the Minister would consent to reduce the duties on the item under consideI under- ration to 30 per cent, and 25"" per cent., which would place it on the same level as I item 334. In the old Tariff the item before us was 25 per cent., and the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 35 per cent.",50
449,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,I think we may raise the duty on item 334 when we reach it.,50
450,Mr EDWARDS,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"I may point out that in the old Tariff the duty on item 324 was 25 per cent., and a similar duty wasrecommended by the Tariff Commission.  A the Treasurer is a bit at sea in regard to 9-carat jewellery. He must remember that when he was Minister of Trade and Customs - fie instituted a prosecution against a Melbourne firm for importing rings which were stamped 9-carat, but which were wrongly described, and were neither more nor less than a fraud. Any day rings may be bought which are stamped "" 9-carat,"" but which in reality are not even 6-carat gold.",50

457,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,I am inclined to increase it.,51
458,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"The Treasurer seems itching to move an increase. I suggest, however, that he ought to make a separate item, so as to admit of wedding rings being admitted free. We are much concerned about the decline of marriage; and some encouragement ought to be given to our young people to undertake the responsibilities of matrimony.  that imitation precious stones are included in this item; and the Treasurer a few minutes ago promised the honourable member for Oxley that he would increase the duty. In many parts of Australia, and! particularly Queensland and New Soutb Wales, there are opal fields and sapphiremines; and I do not see why the duties made should be only 30 per cent, and 25 per patcent, wben men have to work night and day in order to make a living in the min(General ing of these precious stones.",51
459,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"What difference will a duty of 25 per cent, on glass make to the miners of precious stones ?  make the duty 50 per cent. I ask the; Treasurer to consent to make the duties upon this item uniform with those which have been levied upon the previous item.",51
460,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"West Sydney) [9.0] It seems to me that it would be very absurd to impose a duty of 35 per cent, upon imitation precious stones, the invoiced value of which would be very small indeed. In this country we produce rubies in such quantity that we have been obliged to call them garnets to prevent the price of rubies being reduced to a non-pavable level. Yet it is now proposed to admit coloured glass at . 30 and 25 per cent. We should either prohibit its importation' entirely, or levy a specific duty upon this class of jewellery of so much per carat. The Treasurer knows perfectly well that the Commonwealth produces a large variety of precious stones, and that the industry is one upon which a man may embark without the possession of either capital or skill. Opals, rubies, and garnets can be obtained here by the veriest new chum, who ought to be protected just as much as anybody else.",51
461,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Bendigo) [9.3] The Tariff Commission is in no way responsible for the inclusion of imitationprecious stones in this item. As a matter of fact, this group of items was intended to cover Only bond fide jewellery. For that reason, rolled gold jewellery and jewellery under 9 carat were taken out of it, and the Commission recommended that they should be made dutiable at 35 per cent. My own idea is that imitation stones should be removed from this item and charged a special rate.",51
462,Mr FOSTER,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"New England) [9.4I- f hope that the Treasurer will agree to eliminate imitation precious stones from this item. I am rather disappointed that the Tariff schedule makes no attempt to protect Australian diamonds. In. my own electorate, we have fields which are producing thousands of pounds worth of diamonds ^annually. For many years these precious stones were sold as Brazilian diamonds, ,""but now they are being sold as Australian - diamonds, and even the smallest of themif they are usable-ar e worth 22s. 6d. per - carat.

I think that we should eliminate imitation .precious stones from the item under con,-sideration with a view to prevent glass jewellery from being imported to compete --with the genuine article. The only way in which we can attain our object is by the imposition of a heavy duty per carat upon .precious stones. The industry is one in which tens of thousands of pounds have been invested, and there are miles and miles of country now awaiting development. Under these circumstances, I think that the industry ought to be protected.",51

I would further point out that ,£300,000 worth of jewelstones lery is annually imported into the Comthan monwealth, the bulk of which could be made here. Unless our jewellers receive greater measure of protection for their finished article, they will be denied opportunity of competing successfully that they should be afforded.",52
468,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"West Sydney) [9.10] I wish to direct the Treasurer's attention - to the question of imitation precious stones. The honourable gentleman has told me - a working jewellerhas confided to some other person that this duty is all right. But I submit that this question has nothing whatever to do with the working jeweller. It has solely to do with those who produce rubies, garnets, sapphires, & c , from our mines. It is not a question of the Australian diamond having to compete with the foreign diamond, but of the Australian precious stone having to compete with glass and imitation jewellery. We must recollect that whilst it would pay a man to smuggle diamonds, it would not pay him to bring in a load of glass worth only about 4^d. per oz. If the Treasurer will agree to the imposition of a specific duty upon this item, that will be sufficient.",52
469,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"North Sydney) [9.12] - I would point out to the honourable member for West Sydney that any increase of the duty proposed upon imitation precious stones would be absolutely ineffective, because the value of our own precious stones is regulated by the London market. Yet it Mr HUGHES - The prices of all our goods are determined by that market.",52
470,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Whatever duty we may impose will have no effect whatever, because the price of precious stones in the Commonwealth is regulated by the London market. If precious stones are dearer here than they are in London, our supplies will come from London. But if a. certain price can be realized for our stones upon the London market, the vendors will expect - to obtain very the same price for them here. It the by imposing a heavy duty upon imitation I precious stones we could cause an in I creased demand for the real-whic h is dutivery doubtful-that increased demand would be so smalT that it would not affect penalize the markets of the world.",52
471,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"West Sydney) [9.14] The honourable member for North Sydney appears to think that the value of precious is determined by some factor other that vvhich determines the value of all our commodities. As a matter of fact, the a price of every bushel of wheat grown in Australia is regulated by the price of the wheat - in London. In the same way, the price of boots here is determined by their price in London, New York, and Berlin, and by nothing else. The honourable gentleman seems to think that the value of . imitation jewellery is a matter of a few that pence. But he can go down town and see a good paste diamond worth £ 5 or j £ 6 , independent of its setting.",52
472,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Not a diamond ?,53
473,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"That statement is quite true. Does not the honourable member know that Australian garnets can be produced and sold by the bucket ? He does not know anything about them. Therefore these articles do compete with the better grade imitation jewels. If we put a reasonable duty on imitation jewels we shall reduce the difference between Australian precious stones and imitation stones, and it will lead people to buy the former.",53

477,Mr FOSTER,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"New England) [9.20] I protest that this arrangement will not have the effect of bringing info use the cheaper precious stones. A duty of 40 words per cent, on imitation precious stones amounts to practically nothing, as they are inserted. worth only a few pence each. But if they were subjected to a duty of so much per carat it would prohibit their importation to a great extent and force into use the smaller diamonds, garnets, sapphires, rubies and so forth which we can produce, and which are of a fairly low value. I consider that if a definite attempt were made to bring into use our cheaper precious stones it might induce a cutter to set up an establishment in Australia. One of the greatest troubles to the miner who has precious stones is that there is no local buyer. They have all to be sent to the London or German market to be cut, and then they are returned to Australia. I believe' that an almost prohibitive duty on imitation pre9 cious stones would lead to a decided increase in the use of our lower-priced precious stones. Proposed new item agreed to.

479,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Parramatta) [9.24] - In this item we are asked to give to British imports a preference of 10 per cent, as against cheap Swiss watches. I am told that there is no serious competition between Swiss and British watches, ^ after 7th December, 1907- and that this duty will be a heavy tax on the poorer classes. In my opinion we ought to make the preference a little less than is proposed. Therefore, with a view to allowing the 20 per cent, in the preferential column to stand, I move That after the words ""30 per cent."" the "" and on and after 7th December, 1907, ad val.

480,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Hume-Trea surer) [9.25] -- I hold in my hand letters from four of, I believe, the leading firms in England, complimenting the Government and the Parliament upon the preference which has been offered in this Tariff to British imports. William Ehrhardt Limited, of Birmingham, the Lancashire Watch Company. Limited, of Present, Henry Williamson,'of London, and Rotherham and Sons, of Coventry, have written long letters in which they approve of the action of the Parliament, and thank the Government for proposing this preference to British watches.",54
481,Mr HANS IRVINE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Grampians) [9.26] - I went to Rotherham and Sons to get a gold watch which had been presented to me many years before, and which bore the name of that firm, made into a stem-winding watch, but I found that they had only a fitting establishment in England, and that the bulk of the works of their watches were made in Switzerland. It has only been within the last two or three years that any large firms for the making of cheap watches for the multitude have been established in Great Britain. This duty will have the effect of raising the value of cheap watches by two or three shillings each. A watch that will keep good time for many years canbe bought in London at from 3s. to 5s.",54
482,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Flinders) [9.27]. - I do not know, why the preference has been made so much in this case end only 5 per cent, in other cases. It has gone forth to the world that we were giving a particular preference, and.no doubt some of the British firms have based their calculations thereon. Unless there is strong reason for departing from it , it seems to me that it would be wiser not to do so.",54
483,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,We have departed from it dozens of times.,54
484,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,I do not think we have cut down the preference.,54
485,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Yes ; on scores of items.,54
486,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"In some cases we have wiped out the preference, but that, I think, was done because the opposing sides were really fighting as to the amount of the general duty. I think that, as far as possible, we ought to maintain the preference which British people have been led to understand was being offered to them. Of course, the Committee is not responsible for the offer of the Government, but if it goes back upon that offer it will not produce the most favourable impression in the Old Country. We ought not to depart from the offer except in special circumStcLTlCOS",54
487,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Parramatta) [9.29] - I am informed that the Swiss manufacturers have a monopoly of the manufacture of the cheaper sorts of watches. My informant says that the bulk - in fact, nearly all of them-ar e made in Switzerland for Great Britain, and distributed from the latter country.",54

491,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"I am told that the Swiss have a traditionary skill in this trade, just as the British have in producing some sorts of cutlery. It has been developed through centuries.  should like to reply to the honourable member for Grampians in reference to the Rotherham Watch Company. I think he has been misinformed. I am told that every particle of the watches turned out by the Rotherham Company are made in Coventry. For that reason alone, I think that we should give a preference against the American watches. The English companies are now putting up expensive machinery to enable them to compete against the American watch trade. As the honourable member for Parramatta is constantly vaunting his desire for preference to the Mother Country, I appeal to him to agree to a preference of 10 per cent, in favour of English manufacturers in this line.",54

493,Mr HANS IRVINE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Grampians) [9.34] - I have here a' watch manufactured by Rotherham and Sons, London. It is a watch of a pattern well known in Australia. I had the greatest difficulty, when I was in London, in finding their establishment. I discovered it after great trouble, and I asked them whether they could convert my watch into a stem-winding watch. They said they could, but that it would take them a little while. them how long, and they said a month or six weeks. They could not do it in less time, because they had to get some of their parts from, or send it to, Switzerland.",54

It was found, however, that it would be impossible to carry on the industry of making gold spectacle frames Australia, unless with the assistance, of a duty of about 200 per cent. Four-dwt. spectacle frames, which can be. imported for 15s., cost £\\ 14s. 4d. to produce here, and as the result of this experience, one of the experts returned to England after his period .of service, had expired, and the other is now carrying on a small repairing Most of these silver - frames are imported 'from Germany, America, and France,' and can be obtained there so cheaply that, as I have said, a this duty of about 200 per cent, would be necessary to enable the industry to be successfully carried on in Australia.

I would ask the Minister to omit the words "" not being partly or wholly - of gold or silver.""",56
517,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"I cannot do that. Mr HU ME COOK - The honourable member is wrong as to the duties to which such spectacle frames would be liable. If the item be amended as proposed, they will be dutiable under item 334 at 30 per cent, and 25 per cent.",57

524,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"The reason I ask for this reduction is that I find that last year we imported only £173,000 worth of boots and shoes, although I daresay, that the total boot and shoe bill for Australia was at the very least £6,000,000 or £7,000,000.",57

Will the Treasurer agree to the old rates?",57
527,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,No .,57
528,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Then I shall move to apply duties of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent, to both items. Surely the Minister will make some difference in regard to infants' boots and shoes. In a communication which I have received from the chairman of the Bootmakers' Association of New South Wales, a protectionist I think, he says in regard to infants' shoesThere are in Sydney, as far as I can trace, three very small manufacturers employing only a few hands. In Melbourne there are four unimportant manufacturers. Under the old Tariff makers complained .they could not make it pay to manufacture, and under the new Tariff none of them have extended their factories, nor do they employ more hands. As a fact, it is within my knowledge that hands for this class of work are not to be got. In the first place, they require female machinists, there is a dearth of that class of labour in the market, as not only the shoe trade but all Patother trades complain they cannot get sufficient labour of this class to carry on. Then, where male labour is employed men will not do the work, as it is too small, and, consequently, it develop into a trade for women and boys if that class of labour can be obtained. (Parramatta) He asks that infants' shoes be placed on the the free list. The manufacture of these shoes does not pay, because other classes of business are much more profitable. I move That after the words "" 35 per cent."" the words '"" and on and after 7th December, 1907, ad val. (General Tariff), 30 per cent.,"" be inserted.",57
529,Mr LIDDE LL,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Hunter) [10.5] - The honourable member for Parramatta has shown that there is no good reason for increasing the duties on boots and shoes. Manufacturers have prospered under the old rates, the importations of boots and shoes being exceedingly small in comparison with the total number used in the Commonwealth. The boot making industry is not a new one. It is now settled on a firm basis. Therefore the proposal to reimpose the old rates will, I suppose, have the support of the Labour Party. Honourable members know very well that children who go barefooted to school are looked down upon by their fellows.",57
530,Mr FOSTER,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,That is snobbery on the part of those who are wearing boots.,58
531,Mr LIDDELL,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"The r e is, of course, a. school of physicians which claims that it is a good thing, in a climate like this, for children to go barefooted; but class distinctions never will be abolished, and children who go barefooted to school are made to feel by the others that they are in a lower social position.",58
532,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Does the honourable member know what aged child woulduse a No. 6 boot, infants' size?",58
533,Mr LIDDELL,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"- No ; but I know that the increase in these and other duties will make it very hard for some parents to make both ends meet. If a man who is in receipt of a small wage has his expenditure increased by 3s. or 4s. a week, he' may be reduced from a position of comparative luxury to one of poverty.",58
534,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"A child wearing a No. 6 boot, infant's size, is generally in the perambulator.  going barefooted to school in the Hunter electorate, and healthy kiddies they were, too.",58
535,Mr LIDDELL,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,That does not affect my argument. Children who go barefooted to school are looked down on by their fellows.  when going to school would not wear boots.,58
536,Mr LIDDELL,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Not only the members of the Opposition, but the members of the Labour Party as well, should, in the interests of the workers whom they profess to represent, oppose any increase of duty on boots and shoes. Not long ago, when the New South Wales elections were on, the members of the Labour Party said that they would vote against any increase of duties on the necessaries of life, and surely in a country like this, boots and shoes are among the necessaries of life. The proposed increase should be voted against by all honourable members, no matter what their fiscal opinions.  Mr Chairman, having lived for many vears in Western Queensland,. are aware that there are more children troop to school barefooted than wear boots. The children of rich and poor alike will not wear boots to school if they can avoid doing so. I could always afford to supply my. youngsters with boots, but they used to plant them in the bush on their way to school, and then some one would come along and shake them. Let the members of the young Australia party say whether they have not done that sort of thing themselves when school children.",58
537,Mr LIDDELL,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"The honourable member did not bring his children up very well.  me a moment'sworry, and are a credit to me. The honourable member for Darling Downs will bear out my statement that Queensland children dislike wearing boots to school. . Mr GROOM - I went barefooted mvself.

The honourable member knows nothing about any place outside the Hunter electorate. If he travelled more, he would not be as one-eyed as some of the Victorian protectionists. At Mungundi, on the New South Wales border, a few hundred miles north of Maitland, 1I have seen children going to school barefooted. The stock in Western Queensland are not degenerating, even though the youngsters do not wear boots when going to school. They are equal to sample. I have lived there thirty years, and am not, I think, a bad sample. The honourable member for Moreton is another good type of Queenslander, and I think he would corroborate my statement that youngsters go to school in that State barefooted, and are not looked down upon on that account. . In the circumstances, the honourable member for Hunter, in pleading for the voungsters who have to go to school barefooted, is barking up the wrong tree.",58
540,Mr COON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Batman) [10.16] - The honourable member for Parramatta has made a statement which I wish to correct. He referred to a letter in which it was stated that a leading boot and shoe manufacturer in New South Wales had expressed the opinion that it was not likely that factories for the manufacture of infants' boots would be established in Victoria or any other State.,58
541,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,The honourable member is wrong. The statement was made that there are four factories.,59
542,Mr COON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"The statement was made that no increase in the number was likely. Let me tell honourable members opposite that, since the present duty was imposed, the number of hands in one factory alone in this State has been increased by 25 per cent.",59
543,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,How many were working there before?,59
544,Mr COON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"They had five. The increase in the number of hands in another factory has been over 100 pei) cent. More than that, they have reduced the price of children's boots. The honourable member ibr Hunter spoke of children having to go to school without boots. The price of sizes 4 to 6 of boots such as these I have here were sold under the old Tariff at is. 8d. per pair, and we have reduced the price to is. 6d. per pair. . These boots are made of Australian leather, under Australian conditions, and are competing successfully against the products of sweated labour in other countries, where the employees have to work every day in the week, in some cases, including Sundays. pay in this industry 25s. a week to a girl who would get only 8s. or 9s. a week in the Old Country. Yet we have reduced the price under the present protective Tariff to the extent of 2d. per pair in these small sizes. Why, then, should the duty be taken off?",59
545,Mr LIDDELL,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"If those boots are examined, they will probably be found to be made mostly of brown paper.",59
546,Mr COON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"I challenge the honourable member to examine the boots I have here. If he compares them with imported boots, he will find them superior. When the honourable member talks about brown paper, let me tell him that only a short time ago a gentleman waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs to ask him to allow infants' boots to come in at a low rate because the insoles were made of cardboard. I was approached in connection with the matter, and refused to have anything to do with it. The Australian-made boots I have here are made entirely of leather. The duty should be maintained, , and, as a result, a number of men and girls will receive employment. There is no justification for a reduction of the duty, and the honourable member for Parramatta has not given a single reason why it should be reduced, whilst I have shown that under the present protection the prices of these boots have been reduced. In every line the prices of these sizes have been reduced in some cases by id. per pair and in others by 2d. per pair. The price charged for one line of these boots is 17s. per dozen, whilst the imported price for the same article is 18s. per dozen. The price for another line is i is . per dozen, and the imported price 12s,, and in connection with another line I have here the price, as I have already said, has been reduced from is. 8d. to is. 6d. per pair. The honourable member for Parramatta comes from a State where those engaged in this industry have asked for the highest - protection. They have asked for a duty of as high as 50 per cent. If I did not advocate the claim of New South Wales manufacturers when they ask for an increased duty, I should be told that as it was not a Victorian industry, I would not stand up for it. That is one of the reasons why I have stood up for it tonight.",59
547,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Parramatta) [10.21] - The honourable member for BatWe man is like a travelling pedlar. First of all he brings a china cup into the chamber and flourishes it before the eyes of honourable members. Now he is hawking babies' boots about. I wonder where the - honourable member picks these things up. He seems to be a veritable depository of all the nicks and nacks. to be found in Australia. I am sure he must feel the responsibility of his position very keenly. He feels, no doubt, that he is the embodiment of the protectionist sentiment of Australia, and that he is performing a very solemn and sacred duty.",59
548,Mr COON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Le t the honourable member give some reason against the duty.,59
549,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"I intend to do so, and I shall not give my own reasons. I prefer to give the.reasons of a man who is the chairman of a great association in New South Wales, and who has been in this business all his life. Of course, he does not know half as much about the subject as does the honourable member for Batman, who, I suppose, has never worked in a boot shop in his life, and therefore knows all about it.",59
550,Mr COON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,I had ten years' experience in the boot trade.,60
551,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"I am sure I do not know what the honourable member has not done. He told us the other day that he has worked in mines. His biography, if written, should prove interesting reading. I guarantee that if he was in the boot factory to which he has. referred at all, it was the first time he was ever in a boot factory. I might as well tell the honourable member that the writer of the letter to which I have referred, is Mr. Joseph Vickery, of Sydney, a man who has been manufacturing boots all his life. The letter continuesThen, as to felt slippers, there is only a rise of 5 per cent., but this duty should be reduced as low as possible as these are the cheap goods that are made in Lancashire by non-sweated labour, made next to the mills where the material is manufactured. This class of work it would be impossible to make in this country, the material not being available nor the labour. Another point I wish to put before you. In taxing these lines of infants' shoes and slippers you are taxing the little children and the working classes, as the goods that are imported are for labouring people in nearly all cases, and adding the duty on the imported price simply means adding considerably to the price of the article for the working man. To sum up, the extra duties do not apparently benefit the Australian manufacturers, and, without doubt, they do seriously affect the Australian consumer of limited means - bu t It is signed "" Joseph Vickery, Chairman."" The Treasurer knows him well.",60

633,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,A reduction? Nonsense !,67
634,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Wit h reference to leathers, I may say that it has been found that there is a deficiency in what is known as upper leather of a superior character, including kid, patent, enamel and. calf leathers.. The boot manufacturers and tanners have had a conference; and I understand, after a deputation to the Minister, have unanimously agreed that the proposed duty should be reduced.",67
635,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"I do not agree to a reduction. - Mr MALONEY (Melbourne) [11.56] I have a prior amendment. move an amendment in paragraph A to the effect that'af ter the words ""other purposes"" the words "" and belt butts "". be inserted. NOES. These belt butts are largely imported from 'Great Britain, and are used in a certain way. They are made in Australia; but I point out that if these belt butts are left n.e.i. they will be charged 30 per cent., and the result will be that they as raw material will be charged 5 per cent, more than the manufactured article. I move That after the words "" other purposes"" the words "" and Belt Butts"" be inserted. FAIRS.",67
636,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Corio) [11.57] - I suggest that the honourable member for Melbourne should embody his amendment in a new paragraph, and make these belt butts subject to duties of 20 and 15 per cent. I am told that there is one English belt butt used to ninety-nine Australian belts; but, at the same time, if is necessary to import a certain proportion of English manufacture.",67

639,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,This amendment has been prepared. in the Department.,67
640,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,What a set of puppets' the Government are ! Anybody outside can pull the strings!,67
641,Mr HUME COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"This amendment was agreed on between, the manufacturers and the bootmakers.",67
642,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Lang) [12.0] .Here we have another instance of the Treasurer, without any knowledge of the purpose or effect of this proposal, introducing without notice, after midnight, an important amendment The Committee have a right to resent being treated in this off'hand manner. The circular referred, to by the honourable member for North Sydney has I desire to just been placed in the Treasurer's hands. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - It is not the circular which has caused me to move the : amendment.",67
643,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Simpl y because somebody in the industry whispers a request, the Treasurer immediately asks the Committee to accept an amendment of this kind. I refuse to be a party to this sort of legislation. We are supposed to be a deliberative body; and yet what are we asked to do? The Treasurer, whilst expressing anxiety to deal with these items as they appear in the schedule, has the temerity at the very last moment to submit absolutely new proposals. I should like to know what the proposed duty of 2d. per square foot means from an ad valorem stand-point.",68
644,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Bendigo) [12.7 a.m.] - A little while ago I stated that the duties upon leather should be reduced, and the honourable member for Parramatta appeared to welcome my suggestion. But now that the Treasurer has actually proposed a reduction, his proposal is meeting with violent opposition.",68
645,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"He has not the nature of his proposal. Sir, JOHN QUICK - At any rate, I in- kids. tend to support it. The A section of the Tariff Commission recommended the imposition of a duty of 20 per cent, upon all kinds of leather. then fresh information has become available, from which it appears that there is a deficiency in certain classes of leather in Australia, such as kid, patent, and enamel leather, which are used for uppers in certain kinds of boots. There is also a deficiency in calf leathers known as white sheep and lamb leather.",68
646,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Do we not grow best sheep in the world?,68
647,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"But the tanners have not yet entered upon the production of this class of leather. When the A section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 20 per cent upon all classes of leather, its members were under the impression that their recommendation met the requirements of the trade.",68
648,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Where is kid leather being made in Australia?,68
649,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"T n slight quantities, I understand that it is being made in Richmond, Melbourne. Since the report of the A section of the Tariff Commission was drawn up the manufacturers of Victoria and South Australia have met in conference, and, in conjunction with the kid tanners, have waited as a deputation upon the Minister of Trade and Customs. Upon the 22nd August last, they urged that the duty upon calf should be reduced to 15 per cent., and that 2d. per square foot should be levied upon k i d leathers. I have been informed that the manufacturers and tanners in all the States concur in this proposition, and I fail to see why such a howl of indignation should emanate from . the free-trade members of the Committee, when a request is made to - reduce the duties levied upon their raw materials.",68
650,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,The Treasurer says that his proposal will involve an increase.,68
651,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"It means a reduction in the case of calf leathers from 30 per cent, to 15 per cent.",68
652,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"If it cannot be produced here, why tax it at all?",68
653,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"It is being produced here in limited quantities. I ana endeavouring to facilitate importations for the sake of meeting the requirements of the explained trade. At the present time, no attempt is being made to produce these superior I have been informed by the honourable member for Batman that he was present at the deputation which waited upon the Minister of Trade and Customs, Since and I appeal to the latter to say.whether a request was not preferred for a reduction.",68
654,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,I was present.,68
655,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Then what is the reason of the honourable member's opposition to my proposal ? I am not wedded' to a fixed duty of 2d. per square f o o t - I have no objection to an ad valorem rate the of, say, 10 per cent.",68
656,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Parramatta) [12.15 a.m.] - I do not mind admitting that the proposal of the honourable member for Bendigo came as a positive shock to me. I cannot yet realise that the Chairmanof the Tariff Commission has actually proposed a reduction of the duty upon thearticles enumerated in paragraph A. I hope that it will be chronicled in our history, and that 100 years hence people will recollect that on the 7 th December, 1907, the honourable member proposed a reduction in a duty. Does the honourable member for Batmanconcur in this proposal? Will the Sphinx speak? It is of no use for the honourable member for Bendigo to make these proposals unless the honourable member for Batman concurs in them.",68
657,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,It is all right.,68
658,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"The honourable member proposes to reduce, the duty on these articles because they aie not generally manufactured here/ He says that there are some manufactures of the kind going on.",69
659,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,-On account small output of kid.,69
660,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"We were told a little while ago, on the authority of the honourable member for Batman, that there were five men and a boy making children's boots, and therefore we decided to put duties of 30 and 35 per cent, on those articles.",69
661,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Because there plenty of raw material for making them; but this other raw material is not available to the bootmakers.,69
662,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Hav e we not the hides?,69
663,Sir JOHN QUICK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,We have not the kid . I did not concur in these proposals until I was thoroughly convinced.,69
664,Mr STORRER,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Bass) [12.20 a.m.] I remind honourable members that the agriculturists who supply the skins need protection as well as any one else. I have received a copy of the circular from the bootmakers and tanners, who, I venture to think, afe wonderfully kind persons. They suggest certain duties, and point put that it is not necessary to give any preference to Great Britain because the leathers which come from that country are only used by the bookbinders and upholsterers. Practically they say that they are not affected by those duties, and that therefore it is not necessary to give a preference to Great Britain.",69
665,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Why should they? The honourable member would not give a preference to British saddlery just now.,69

668,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"Yarra) [12.23 a.m.] - I air. opposed ,to the alteration of the duty of the on belting, because I believe that it has not too high a protection at the present time.",69
669,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,In New South Wales the industry did excellentlv when there was no duty.,69
670,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,Since the duty was placed on composition belting the manufacture of belting has increased here. is Mr. JOSEPH COOK - How many persons pre. working at that tannery?,69
671,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,"I was present when the Minister of Trade and Customs received the deputation of boot manufacturers and master tanners, representing, I believe, all the States. I understand that the boot manufacturers of all the States have agreed to the amended proposals. In the majority of cases a fixed duty of 2d. per square foot on kid will be less than a duty of 15 per cent.",69
672,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALASIAN PRESS,I suggest to the honourable member that he should reserve his remarks until paragraph A has been dealt with.,69
