1,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I desire to. make a personal explanation. In the Argus of Wednesday last, in a statement regarding the Government Preference Prohibition Bill , there is a reference to me in the following termsMr Fisher and Mr Hughes had welcomed the question for the purpose of a test before the electors and profess to be assured that it will ring the political death knell of their opponents. That is quite inaccurate. I have looked through the Hansard report of my speech, and I find there nothing to warrant the statement. The article continuesHe and other members of his party have asserted that it is an insidious and deadly blow at the whole principle of unionism. That, too, is inaccurate, there being nothing in my speech to warrant it . In today's Argus, in a leading article dealing with the motion of no confidence moved by the Leader of the Opposition, the following statement occursIn the first place, the Ministry adjourned the House of Representatives and gave Mr Fisher an opportunity to state his no-confidence case. He was.followed by the Rupert of debate, Mr. Hughes; but it was then found that nothing new was alleged, but that stale charges already repeated ad nauseam had been put up like dummies, so that the Ministry might again slay the slain and assist the Opposition to further obstruct business. Therefore the Ministry, in the exercise of its rights under the Standing Orders, placed the bogus motion at the bottom of the notice-paper. That, again, is inaccurate. It was not after I had spoken, but while I was speaking, and before I had formulated any charges, that the debate was interrupted. "" HANSARD REPRINTS. HEAD - LIN ES IN SPEECHES.",12
2,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I desire to address a question, through you, Mr Speaker, to the Treasurer, and to those who have control of the publication of Hansard. In a reprint of a speech delivered by the Treasurer on the second reading of the Loan Bill , a speech which we were good enough to allow him to read",12
3,Sir JOHN PORREST,Unknown,The able member always read his speeches.,13
4,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I did not. never introduced' a Loan Bill .,13
5,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The right honourable member always read his Budget speeches.,13
6,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Certainly . In the reprint to which I refer, the various parts of the speech are preceded by headings, among whioh I find the followingKalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway-Railwa y - in the Northern Territory-Railwa y in PapuaLand for Postmaster-General's Department-Lan d for Defence Department-Conduit s and Undergrounding of Wire-Machinery , &c, Cockatoo Island-Londo n Offices-How the Money is to be Raised-Repl y to the Criticism of the Budget by the ex-Treasurer-Programm e for the Future - Conclusion . * I understand that when other honourable members have asked permission to . do what the Treasurer has done in this respect, permission has been refused by him, and I wish, therefore, to know whether 'Ministers, in this matter, have privileges other than those enjoyed by private members of the House ? I understand that members are prepared to pay the ordinary rates for the reprinting of their speeches, and to agree to their publication under the same conditions as those under which the Treasurer's speech has been re-issued in pamplilet form .",13
7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Lookin g through my notes, I find the following memorandum regarding the reprinting of the speohes of honourable membersThe House of Representatives on the 25th August, 1909, considered the question of the introduction of head-lines in the reprints of the Hansard reports of honourable members' speeches on the motion of Mr Deakin (volume L., page *>93) :That the Printing Committee, in conjunction with the Printing Committee of the Senate, have power to draw up rules in regard to the headings in reprints of speeches from Hansard supplied to honourable members at their own expense. Various amendments were proposed and negatived, .ind the following substituted motion was finally agreed to :That the only reprints permitted be an exact reproduction of Hansard, but speeches already ordered by members, with cross headings, shall be printed and delivered. Although the determination of the House related exclusively to the reprints of members' speeches, it was suggested in the course of the debate that, subject to certain regulations, honourable members should be permitted to introduce head-lines into their speeches when revising their proofs. No action, however, was taken in the matter of introducing head-lines into the Hansard report, although permission was given to members to break up their speeches into paragraphs. right honor- Mr FISHER - I ask. you, sir, whether you will give the House your views on' the I have question I put to you last, that is, as tb whether in this regard Ministers have any privileges other than those enjoyed by ordinary members of the House? I ask for the same privileges for ordinary members as have been exercised by the Treasurer.",13
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"So . far as I am aware, there are no privileges belonging to Ministers in this regard which are denied to other members.",13
9,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I wonld remind you, Mr Speaker, that Ministers have privileges which other honourable members have not.",13
10,Mr FISHER,Unknown,In regard to Hansard?,13
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No , but in regard to many other things"". The question was an open one. I would remind my right honourable friend that he had, for instance, a motor car which was not available to every other member of the House.",13
12,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I ask you, Mr. Speaker, whether you consider that the conduct of the Prime Minister' in referring to the motor car which is available to, and used by, him is in keeping with his position ancl the dignity of the House 1",13
13,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Unfortunately , I cannot know beforehand what a member who rises is going to say. I see no relation between privileges in regard to the reprinting of speeches and the Ministerial use of motor cars. Such remarks are not in keeping with the dignity of the House or with the reputation of honourable members.",13
14,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"May I make an explanation ? I am aware of the decision of the House which you, sir, have read, though I have not seen it for a year or two. I believe that it has been complied with ; it was certainly complied with so far as my own speeches were concerned when I was a private member. I submit, too, that the action that I have taken as Treasurer is not in any way contrary to it . The decision relates to reprints of speeches from Hansard by the Government Printer at the expense of the members concerned. In regard to the two speeches that have been printed for the Treasury",13
15,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,And sent all over Australia.,13
16,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Onl y a few hundred have been printed.,14
17,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Are they reprinted at the expense' of the Treasury?,14
18,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"They have been printed at the request of the Treasury, and paid' for by the Treasury. Every 1 lonorable member has received one or more copies, and I think that they have proved a convenience to them.",14
19,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Were these reprints paid for by the Treasury?,14
20,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Yes . printing of the speeches on the Budgetand Loan Appropriations does not come within the resolution passed by the House, nor were they paid for from the parliamentary vote. It is a proposition to me that it should be held that the Government Printer, who is under the direction of the Treasurer in regard to all printing not ordered by the House, cannot execute printing for the purposes of the Treasury. If that were so, then the only alternative would be to have such speeches printed by some private firm. I do not think that I am accustomed to offend by incurring unnecessary expense, but I do think that an important statement like the Budget aud Loan Bill speeches should be printed in a form most convenient for Treasury purposes and for those who wish to read it . I am sure that the printing of these financial statements in separate pamphlets has proved of some convenience to honourable members, and has enabled them to readily turn up every subject dealt with. I , personally, never objected to the introduction of headlines in reprints from Hansard. I think they are very convenient, and the old system would not have been altered if it had not been abused. I consider that I have not in fringed the resolution of the House dealing with this matter, nor have I in any way interfered with it .",14
21,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Wide Bay) [2.42] - I ask the leave of the House to make a statement. Leave granted.,14
22,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I have no feeling in this matter, but I think that the Treasurer is in error in suggesting that no speech, save the Budget statement, has been reprinted and distributed by the Treasury, or. any other Department, at the expense of that Department. The speech made by the Treasurer in introducing the Loan Bil l has been reprinted in this way. If that can be done, then a speech made by a Minister in introducing any other Bill may be reprinted in the same way. If Ministers can do this while private members cannot, then an anomaly arises. Private members will be compelled to have the Hansard reports of their speches reprinted by private firms, while Ministers may have reprints sent out, according to the Treasurer, by .the Government Printer, at the public expense, and in any form they desire. The Sir JOHN FORREST - That could not be done with all speeches.",14
23,Mr FISHER,Unknown,All that I ask on behalf of the Opposition is that they may have the same rights and privileges in this regard as are enjoyed by the Treasurer himself. The right honourable gentleman today issued an instruction that the privilege enjoyed by him in this respect should not be extended to a member of the Opposition.,14
24,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I gave no instruction in the matter. I said that I would have nothing to do with it-that it was a question for the House.,14
25,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member to whom I refer is prepared to pay for the reprint and for the additional cost involved by the introduction of headings, which he is quite willing should be approved, if desired, by the Government Printer and the Treasurer.",14
26,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Alte r the rule.,14
27,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The Government can do this sort of thing for themselves. Why cannot others do it? They are a lovely lot, carrying on in that way.",14
28,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I ask for honourable members on this side of the House neither more nor less than is enjoyed by honourable members opposite in regard to this matter, and in order to support what I have said in regard to reprints of the Treasurer's speeches,. I ask you, Mr . Speaker, to accept this copy of the reprint from Hansard of a speech made by the right honourable gentleman.",14
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home A f fairs) [2.45] - I should like, with the permission of the House, to say a word or two on this matter. Leave granted.",14
30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I confess that I have a good deal of sympathy with my right honourable friend in this matter. While I do not agree that Ministers should not do in these matters what a private member of the House may not do, I think that on the whole it is a good and salutary rule that there ought to be no preference in respect of reprints of speeches from Hansard, so long as they relate to the ordinary business of the House. The Leader of the Opposition, however, will be aware that there are special privileges appertaining to Ministers in this regard. For instance, it is the 'custom, I understand, for the substance of a Budget speech to be cabled Home at the expense of the Commonwealth. That is a privilege which obviously could not be extended to every member.",14
31,Mr FISHEE,Unknown,I did not ask for that.,15
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Quite so, but I am merely establishing, first of all, the point that there are some things as to which there is not an equal privilege in the House except in this way",15
33,Mr FISHER,Unknown,As a Ministerial act?,15
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes . Matters relating to the general finances of the country are supposed to be representative of the opinions of every honourable member, so long as they are not of a party colour. This is only another instance of the way that we destroy our own privileges. Time was when any honourable member could introduce head-lines into reprints from Hansard of speeches delivered by him, but abuses crept in , and we found honourable members- I shall not particularize them; every one who was here at the time knows that what I say is correct-actuall y beginning to make their head-lines abusive personalities. It was that which led to the curtailment of this privilege.",15
35,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,That could be covered by regulation.,15
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The House wisely-o r unwisely-decide d to regulate it by abolishing the privilege. The speech delivered by the Treasurer on the Loan Bill , the reprint of which has been referred to by the Leader of the Opposition, is only a part of the financial proposals of the Government, and in its broad aspect is more or less non-party. Anything relating to the general finances of the country is considered to stand in a category of its own. I submit, therefore, that, in this case, the Treasurer had a right, if he thought fit so to do, to head-line that reprint, as long as the head-lines had no party significance:",15
37,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Is there any objection to honourable members generally doing likewise ?,15
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I candidly confess that I can see none; but everything depends ou'the use, as distinguished from the abuse, of the privilege.",15
39,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I agree with that.  printed at the expense of the country, instead of at the expense of the honourable member concerned?",15
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No . I think that, in ordinary circumstances, there should be two conditions. First of all, the head-lines should .have no party significance",15
41,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,And should not be personalities.,15
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"And should not consist of personalities. I refer to headlines merely intended to indicate the whereabouts of certain statements, and for the purpose of handy reference.",15
43,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Who is going to supervise in order to insure this ?,15
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am now merely stating the facts. I do not think that those speeches should be printed at the expense of the Government, but at the expense of honourable members who desire them. Mr FISHER. Hear, bear! That is what I am after.",15
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The rest seems a matter of regulation; and I am afraid we cannot frame one just at present, though we can think over the matter.",15
46,Mr FISHEK,Unknown,But this speech with the head-lines has been printed in Hansard.,15
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I have pointed out that this speech stands in a category all its own.,15
48,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The Budget speech? I agree with that.,15
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And I say that the loan proposals are part of the Budget speech.,15
50,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"No , no.",15
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I think so. I do not see how they can be separated; they are part and parcel of the general financial proposals of the Government; and there is hardly a fact stated in the Loan Bill speech that was not stated beforehand in the Budget speech.,15
52,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister say whether he thinks it wise to allow the Treasurer to do this kind of thing, and not allow an ordinary member to do it?",16
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There is a distinction in regard to matters which stand in a category of their own, but as to ordinary matters I think there should be no distinction. Ministers are_not entitled, .1 take it , to any privileges that are not common to the House.",16
54,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,What about a critical speech on the Loan Bill?,16
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In regard to that I see no objection, so long as the head-lines are proper and not personal; but that will have to be a matter to be regulated.",16
56,Mr EISHER,Unknown,Does the Prime Minister think that the matter should be decided by the Treasurer or by the Speaker?,16
57,Sir JOHN EORREST,Unknown,It is not decided by the Treasurer; I have given no directions.,16
58,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I am told by the Government Printer that the Treasurer has done su.,16
59,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The Leader of the Opposition will believe what I say, I suppose ?",16
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am told that all the Treasurer did was to direct attention to the rule laid down by the House. In any case, I see no head-lines in the speech referred to. Mr TunoH - Yes ; for instance, "" Public Debts,"" on page 1789.",16
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I should like to point out that those head-lines were on the papers and"" were put in as part of the speech.",16
62,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Why were they taken out of the permanent Hansard?,16
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not know.,16
64,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"It was a mistake, I supposn.",16
65,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It is an admission that the Treasurer has done wrong.,16
66,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Le t us deal with the future ; what are we going to do?,16
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I cannot do anything for the future. The House has put an embargo on head-lines, and only the House can remove the embargo.",16
68,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,But the Treasurer is using head-lines in spite of the House.,16
69,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Not,16
70,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Yes .,16
71,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"It was in error, I think. They are not in the permanent Hansard, though they may have been in the proof issue. Mr J. H. CATTS - Can any honourable member have the same privilege as the Treasurer t",16
72,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! Will honourable members remain silent?,16
73,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"As usual, honourable members are trying to apply the "" g g "" *° ^ e Prime Minister, and the a present is, perhaps, as effectual a way as any. As I say, I do not think there ought to be any distinction in regard to ordinary speeches; but, as to matters affecting the finances of the country, immemorial custom and usage have always differentiated between Ministers and others, not only in this House, but, I should say, in every British Parliament throughout the Dominions. For my part, I should not object in the slightest if the system of head-lines were reverted to, care being taken by some regulative process to provide that they are not used as an opportunity for personal abuse and vilification. I have just had put into my hands a suggestion made by Mr Deakin when this matter was under discussion. That gentleman proposed that the Printing Committee of the House, in conjunction with the Printing Committee of the Senate, should have power to draw up rules in regard to headings in reprints of speeches from Hansard supplied to honourable members at their own expense. I do not know whether any such regulations are operative now.",16
74,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"No. """,16
75,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"As a matter of fact, when this matter was under discussion the House was in an excited' and incensed mood, and, as often happens under such circumstances, cold reason was lest sight of.",16
76,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I think that the honourable gentleman was in power at the time. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I do not know that that affects the fact. The regulation suggested by the then Government was rejected; and I think we might very well now restore some such regulation, and thus get over the difficulty.",16
77,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I may say that my attention was drawn by the Hansard in Hansard. staff to head-lines in a proof issue, and I gave instructions that these were not to appear in the revise, and that, in accordance with the decision of the House, the only reprints that could be permitted should be exact reproductions from Hansard. I instructed the Hamsard staff, for the information of the Government Printer, who deals with the matter, that the terms of the motion passed by the House should stand until the House otherwise ordered.",16
78,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I understand, Mr Speaker, that you have given instructions with regard to reprints for . w h i c h applications are now made. liowever, that head-lines have appeared in two reprinted speeches of the Treasurer, and I wish to know whether every member of the House will be able to exercise the same right as that exercised by the right honourable gentleman in the case of his Budget speech and his speech on the Loan Bill ?",17
79,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"So far as concerns the reprints of speeches published at the expense of honourable members, I do not see that I can have any control; all I am concerned about is what appears in Hansard. The previous decision of the House regarding reprints will be adhered to until otherwise ordered.",17
80,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister now, with the leave of the House; submit a niotion referring the whole matter to the Printing Committee? Mr JOSE PH COOK - I shall take the matter into consideration-perhap s by tomorrow. MATERNITY ALLOWANCE.",17
81,Colonel RYRIE,Unknown,"Is the Prime M in ister aware that the Deputy Commissioner for the Maternity Allowance in New South Wales is refusing applications which are late, regardless of satisfactory explanation or reasonable excuse offered by the applicants. A case which came under my notice this morning is that of a woman' who was given to understand by a nurse that she could not make the application u n t i l the expiration of three months. At the end of that period she made the application, and she then found that a certificate of the birth had to be obtained from the registrar of births, deaths, and marriages, and attached to the application. The husband went to the registrar, who failed to make the certificate out within the time. was his fault, but the Deputy Commissioner for Maternity Allowances said he regretted very much that as the claim was not presented within the three months he must reject it . Is no discretionary power allowed to the Commissioners, or has the Act to he enforced to the very letter ?",17
82,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The Act provides definitely that unless the allowance is applied for within three months it cannot be paid, but a few cases have been brought under my notice in which the time has elapsed, and the applicants have It appears, asked for consideration, making some good excuse for not applying in time. I think that in the cases that have come before me I have been able to approve of the payment, but the money has to be paid out of the Treasurer's Advance. It cannot be charged ,to the Maternity Allowance Act , because the A ct is quite definite on the point. I would advise the honourable member to make an application, and state the facts. He may depend upon it that I will carefully consider any genuine case.",17
83,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"In connection with a very deserving case which I submitted to the Treasurer for consideration recently under the Maternity Allowance Act, the child having died about three hours after birth , and the allowance having been refused, I desire to ask the Treasurer if he will give the matter favourable consideration on the same terms as he offered to the honourable member for North Sydney. Will he consider the advisability of making a grant from the Treasurer's Advance ?",17
84,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I am not prepared to say that; but I would remind the honourable member that, although I am the head of the Department, I have not the decision in regard to the payment of the allowances, as the Commissioner's decision is final.",17
85,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,That is all you do; you send me back to the man who gave the decision.,17
86,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I do not see all the cases that go to the Commissioner, but if the honourable member will bring the matter specially under my notice, I shall be glad to look into it - It was, I believe, a question as to whether the child was viable or not.",17
87,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The child lived for three hours. It Sir JOHN FORREST - I think it was decided that it was not a case under the law. As I informed the honourable member, the decision does not rest with me. COTTON-GROWING.",17
88,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"H as the Minister of External Affairs yet received a report of the meeting of the British Cotton Growers Association held recently, and can he tell the House what decision has been arrived at, particularly with regard to the offer of £50 0 by the Commonwealth Government tc secure the visit or an expert to Australia ?",18
89,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I think £500 was set aside some time ago towards the expenses of an expert from the British Cottongrowers Association to visit Queensland and the Northern Territory, and report upon the possibility of growing high grade long staple cotton there. On 22nd October, a conference was held at the Colonial Office, and then decided that no good could come by sending out an expert for the purpose mentioned, it would be of great advantage if a specialist were sent out and attached to the Queensland Department of A g r i culture at a salary of, say, £500 a year, which the British cotton-growers said they would supplement to the extent of £100 a year, and that that expert might be nsed for the purpose of advising and making experiments so as to help the growers. The matter was referred to the Department of Trade and Customs, who, I think, agreed with the suggestion, which was subsequently communicated by me to the High Commissioner. SMALL - P OX OUTBREAK .",18
90,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Hav e the Government taken any action upon the report received from the Conference of Inter-State health officers, which has just been sitting in connection with the small-pox outbreak in New South Wales? Have the Government removed the embargo, and what action have they taken to protect the other States of the Commonwealth ?",18
91,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"We received the reports yesterday, and they have now been despatched to the different States. matter is receiving the attention of the Administration, but nothing definite has been done. ELECTOR AL ROYAL COMMISSION .",18
92,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"A f t e r the recent elections many statements were made regarding impersonation and other abuses of the Electoral Act , and several weeks ago - the House agreed to the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into these - alleged irregularities. Has any action been taken to appoint that body? It seems to me that unless action is taken quickly, those interested might forget important incidents. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I hope the Commission will be appointed shortly. I do not know why there should be so much keenness on this point on the part of honourable members on the other side, since their party have already taken steps to appoint a tribunal of their own for the same purpose. it was STEAMER FOR PAPUA .",18
93,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"A statement has appeared in the press cables that the but that Government are invitin g tenders for the construction of a steamer in England. Will the Minister of External Affairs say if that statement"" is correct ?",18
94,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I have not seen the matter ih 'the press. It may be a steamer for service' in Papua that is intended. Plans were drawn up some time ago for such a"" steamer, and I think tenders have been called for by this time.",18
95,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I ask the Minister of External Affairs if he does not think it would be better that a boat of that capacity, especially for the tropics, should be built of wood, and could be more cheaply built in Australia ?",18
96,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Not having seen the newspaper paragraph, I cannot say whether it is correct, but about five months ago plans and specifications for a steamer were drawn up in Sydney by, I think , a naval architect. When the inatter came before me, I thought it best to have tenders called for in England as well as in Australia, in order to check the estimates of cost, but it has not been determined to order a steamer in England. The advantages of building a The vessel in Australia will, other things being equal, be taken into consideration. As to the suggestion that the vessel should be constructed of wood, that is a matter for experts. I have also considered the possibility of buying locally. Only this morning I had the offer of a steamer, and that offer is now under consideration. AMMUNITION WAGGONS.",18
97,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence if it is a fact that the Defence Department is importing sixteen ammunition waggons, notwithstanding that these vehicles have been made here in the past?",19
98,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am not aware, but I Parliament. shall endeavour to give the honourable member an answer tomorrow. STATUTO RY RULES .",19
99,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,I ask the permission of the House to make a brief statement upon a matter which I am not able approach in any other way. Leave granted.,19
100,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Las t week I put a question to the Prime Minister about a tape. matter which he promised to consider, giving me a reply to the question this week. As I have not had a reply, him again what is the position of a memof the country. ber who challenges a regulation that has been laid on the table. The honourable gentleman was ungenerous enough to when replying to my former question, that the challenging of regulations was another method devised for the holding of the business of the House. that I cannot be charged with attempting to do that, and I do not think that he ing regulations. intended his words to apply to me - May I put the converse position ? If the vernment of the day, when a regulation challenged, refuses to give opportunity for the discussion of the motion which given. challenges it , or takes action to prevent the discussion of that motion, does it not make it possible for the business of country to be conducted by regulation? I wish to know whether the fact that have challenged a certain regulation vents it from becoming law. be a very serious position if a Government, should it so desire, could prevent the cussion of motions for the disallowance of regulations, and thus rule the country by whole matter. regulation, without hindrance. I ask the Prime Minister what decision he has come to in this matter.",19
101,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have no deterests cision to communicate to the House, and must confess that I overlooked the matter. The consideration that weighs in my mind is this: If regulations are to be challenged, and the motions of challenge 'to be discussed in every case, it may the paralyzing of the business of Parliareport ment.",19
102,Mr FISHER,Unknown,No ; because the motions could be brought on and dealt with.,19
103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes , but as new regulations are pouring out from the printing office every day, there could be motions of challenge every day, and their discussion would paralyze the business of My recollection is that the regulation which the honourable member for Herbert has challenged is one framed by the Public Service Commissioner, providing that when a postal official is on holidays, away on sick leave, or absent for any other cause, the Deputy Postmasto ter-General of a State may transfer an officer to the vacancy caused by his absence without reference to head-quarters. That regulation really cuts off so much redI ask whether a small matter of internal administration of that kind should occupy time and attention, and I ask elbow out the important public business",19
104,Mr ARTHUR,Unknown,"But the regulation chalsay, lenged might be an important one.",19
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If a motion challenging any regulation, important or up unimportant, had priority, there would I am sure be no more easy way of hanging up the business of Parliament than by challeng",19
106,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,The honourable member Gomerely asks that the regulation shall is not be enforced until an opportunity for its consideration by the House has been,19
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"As I pointed the out the other day, if a regulation may not be enforced until it has received the 1 ratification of the House by motion or preotherwise, the Public Service would It would be held up by these challenges. The question has only been newly raised, disand I hope that the honourable member for Herbert will give us time to look into the If we find thaij it is the law that these regulations cannot be enforced, if challenged, until the challenge has been disposed of, the law must be altered at the earliest moment in the in of the business of the country. TARIFF ANOMALIES.",19
108,Mr KENDELL,Unknown,Can the Minister of are Trade and Customs inform the House mean when he is likely to receive a progress from the Inter-State Commission respecting Tariff anomalies?,19
109,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am not in a position to say. The Inter-State Commission has published a list of items submitted to it in regard to which it has invited public attention, but it has not yet taken evidence about them. I understand from an in terview that I have had with the Commissioners that they will proceed to deal with these matters as soon as they can. POST OFFICES, SYDNEY.",20
110,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Some time ago, I brought under the notice of the Postmaster General the state of certain post-offices in Sydney-the General Post Office, and the office in Oxford-street, and he promised that he would visit Sydney as soon as the quarantine embargo was removed.

In such circumstances they come to the conclusion that their the early notions regarding land reform, and the establishment of the millennium, must to have been wrong, and they are disposed in their old age to revert to Conservatism.

Look at the dreadful misery that prevails in England, Scotland, and Wales owing to land monopoly-to the ownership of land individuals. In urging that we this land for the Crown, or for the monwealth, as I would prefer to our proposal, I do not suggest moment that land-owners should be robbed of their holdings, although know that there are some honourable members on the Ministerial side who take that view If I asked a man to up his land to the Commonwealth, I would justly compensate him. That, I is a fair proposal. I do not want able members opposite to say at election to the uttermost. time that, because we proposed to retain this land in the possession of the Comment. monwealth for the benefit of the whole the people, we wished to repudiate obligations to individuals in the comupon it . munity, or that we desired to rob them of their land. I do not desire thing, but there are some Ministerialists who hold such views. ",22
129,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Lang is one of them. I happened to be present at a meeting at which the of member made a certain proposal, which is reported in these termsMr W. E.

If term he does, we may have some hope of for one carrying this amendment.",22
130,Mr WEST,Unknown,What are the Prime I Minister's views on this question !,22
131,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"- I have not time this up afternoon to quote the many observations give of the Prime Minister on the question of the ownership of land, but I know that think, he has referred to private land-owners honoras land-grabbers, who ought to be taxed The Minister of External Affairs ought to accept the amendI understand that this is a nonof contentious measure, and that is one our reason why I am having something to say  such a amendment has been introduced.",22
132,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Evidentl y there is plenty of time. The Goverument are not seriously anxipus to do much just now. They have passed through this House two of their electioneering measures, , and I suppose it will be very much a go-as-you-please with them until the middle of next month. I hope that the Minister of External Affairs will accept the amendment. It may be a long time before we convert the people of the Commonwealth to the view that, in their own interests, it would be well if the State or the municipalities owned and controlled the lands of the cities, and an object lesson in Norfolk Island might do a great deal of good. There is no doubt that private ownership in land is chiefly responsible for the dreadf u l slums in Richmond, Brunswick, Collingwood, Carlton, aud elsewhere, not to mention other places equally bad in Sydney and other cities. A land-owner, before settlement becomes thick, may be quite prepared to - place only one cottage on a 40-ft. frontage, but, as soon as a demand springs up, he proceeds to erecttwo or more. If the lands of Norfolk Island are sold, it is possible we may see repeated what was done in Willoughby, New South Wales, where, as soon as Sydney began to be over-populated by the. immigrants brought out to reduce wages and raise rents, the municipality repealed a by-law which provided that every dwelling should have not less than 40-ft. frontage, thus allowing the owners of. land to erect as many cottages as they chose on the space. The Minister of External Affairs knows that what I am saying is perfectly true, but he, apparently, is a man who is prepared to accept what he regards as the inevitable.",22
133,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"If member wants to see huddling together, let him look at land let on building lease",23
134,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"But private individuals own the building leases, and there is a great deal of difference between private land thus let for ninety-nine years, as was the land of the late Sir Daniel Cooper, and land let by the Crown. If the lands of Norfolk Island are parted with, some land monopolist may be placed in the position to interfere with proper settlement - In Australia millions of acres are held by private individuals who are waiting, for a rise in values, and on those lands are neither cattle, sheep, nor dwellings.",23
135,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,"On l y 5 per cent, of the total land of Australia is freehold today.",23
136,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Grampians is very conservative in his notions, and, if he had his way, would not give the people even a vote. He knows, however, that the lands to which he refers are all alongside the railway lines, which were built with borrowed money that will have to be repaid. I sympathize with the pioneers who go out into the back country, and, by dint of a life of hard work, acquire property which may in the long run yield a fortune to be spent by their successors; but what we are suffering from today is the aggregation of capital and the aggregation of land in the hands of capitalists, which lands are in idleness alongside our railway, lines, waiting for the public demand necessary to raise the price. This is the sort of thing that I do not wish to happen in Norfolk Island, where, I think, there are about 3,000 acres of Crown lands.",23
137,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"There are only 1,311 acres.",23
138,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,But this amendment affirms a great principle.,23
139,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I regret to say it , but it is time we woke up to the tactics of the Minister of ExternalAffairs. Some three or four weeks ago-o r it may have been years-whe n speaking on, the question, he said there were some 3,000 acres in the hands of the Crown. Has he been selling land since ?",23
140,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The difference is made up by reserves, which, of course, belong to the public, and will not be sold.",23
141,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Then why not add the the honourable 1,311 acres, and make all Crown land? I may say that I am not a Single-taxer, because I believe it would be a great mistake to raise all our revenue from such a source; but, if I have the chance, I am going to tax the surplus incomes of such gentlemen as the honourable member for Grampians, with a very fair exemption. I could defend this amendment on any public platform. The area of land in question is not a large one, and I suggest that the amendment be accepted, so that we may have uniformity of practice in regard to lands under our jurisdiction. Since Federation the principle of Crown leasehold has been established in Papua, the Northern Territory, and the Federal Territory. This shows the necessity there is, in such matters, for expressing our ideas, even at the risk of the closure. By continually hammering away at this principle of Crown ownership, wherever possible, we, the other day, heard the Prime Minister of the Liberal party-wh o are said to be individualists and anti-Socialists-tellin g the House that it was expected that the Crown ownership would make the Federal Capital self-supporting.",23
142,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member cannot discuss that question.,24
143,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"It is possible that, in Norfolk Island, at some future period, there may be a capital, or pleasure resort, visited by the millionaires of Australia; and I mention the Prime Minister's remarks because, with Crown ownership, it would be possible to make Norfolk Island self-supporting.",24
144,Mr STUMM,Unknown,"Lilley) [3.55] - When the amendment was submitted, I was in clined to support it . The area of land in question is so small that it seemed to be scarcely worthwhile to have a great fight over the question of leasehold versus freehold. Honourable members opposite, however, have raised the whole question, and desire, as stated by the honourable member for Capricornia, ^o secure continuity or uniformity of policy. against land monopoly, but I am a firm believer in private ownership and freehold. The most backward races on earth are those who do not believe in the private ownership of land. Neither the aborigines of Australia nor the Maoris believed in private ownership; and we see the progress New Zealand has made since the Europeans took possession of the Dominion. I am strengthened in my belief by the experience in my own State. There the perpetual lease system was legalized, primarily on the motion of the gentleman who is now Director of Land Settlement in the Nortliern Territory. The result has been to show that the supporters of honourable members opposite do not believe in the perpetual leasehold principle at all. The figures show that in tliree years there have been only forty-five applications for perpetual leases in Queensland, and in the same period there have been 5,496 applicants for agricultural farms. Is not that convincing evidence that the supporters of honourable members opposite do not believe in the leasehold principle? I can mention another chance which they once had of proving their f a it h in the principle. In 1893 they obtained a free grant of the site on which their Trades H all now stands. There was the chance for them to say to the State, "" We do not believe infreehold ; we will accept a lease. show you that a perpetual lease is from our point of view as good as, or better than, freehold."" They did nothing of the sort, but grabbed the freehold grant at once, and the next tiling they did was to ask Parliament for authority to raise money on mortgage to erect a building on the land. Thus, in two cases they showed that they did not believe in leasehold, and did not believe in their non-borrowing policy. Take, again, the case of Ireland. Millions upon millions have been rightly spent there in sweeping away monopoly in land, but it is not proposed to set up a tenant system. The land has been cut up and subdivided, and provision is made to enable the tenant farmers to become the freeholders of their land. That is the proposal in England now also. Everything shows that the tendency is to foster private ownership, which tends to make a man feel that he and his family get the benefit of his industry, and foresight, and expenditure in improving his property. I am astonished that honourable I am members in discussing this matter have made the claim that if they establish a perpetual leasehold system under the Crown there would be no monopoly and no slums. That is quite opposed to our experience. The leasehold system will not prevent monopoly. 1 grant that it will enable the Crown at stated intervals to revise the rent, but, on the other hand, if you establish the freehold principle, you can, and do, make the land-owner contribute to the needs of the State by land taxation. The best way to promote progress is to give people the deeds of their land. As a man put it to me during my campaign, "" I like to have my own b it of parchment in my home for my l and . "" I do not believe in land monopoly. I came from a district where we felt the evils of it , but, on the other hand, I have never yet heard an argument that has satisfied me that the correct thing to do would be to establish the leasehold principle in place of freeholds.",24
145,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,Brisbane) [4.0] It is most remarkable that all the advocates of private ownership in land have slways to find excuses or furnish an apology before they finish their speech.,24
146,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,The honourable member did not hear any apology from the last speaker.,24
147,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"The honourable We will member for Lilley concluded his speech with an apology, stating that he did not believe in land monopoly. Where there is private ownership in land, there is in evitably monopoly in land. I quite agree with the honourable member that it is a most laudable desire on the part of individuals, as civilization is at present constituted, to aspire to own their own piece of land with the rest, but what is wrong with the principle is that it just as in evitably creates a desire in the minds of individuals to have more and more land. It is because of the tendency of private ownership of land, necessarily and continuously, to become a monopoly in land that we object to it . I am a private owner of land myself. I happen to have a little piece of property, and I am not free from the general desire to get the piece alongside. There is that tendency in human nature, but it is a wrong tendency. I am sorry the honourable member for Robertson is not here, because he has been posing as an authority on ancient history. The oldest land laws in the world began with this first principle-the land, shall not be sold for ever, and it was only when the Jewish nation departed from that first principle that tliey got into trouble as a nation. If you look through the later parts of the history of the Jews you will find that the teaching of their prophets and legislators was, "" W o e unto them that add house to house and land to land until there is no room left . "" Throughout the minor prophets one can read the reasons for the decline and fall of the Jewish nation.  has not referred to the jubilee.",24
148,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"T h a argument that I can get. So f ar from a man being able to be robbed of his land by any purchaser or perpetual lessee, it went back to him in the jubilee year absolutely free, without any encumbrance whatever. ",25
149,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"It was not. The land belonged to the people. If the honourable member takes at r ip to Papua, he will find the principle of national ownership of property in actual visible operation. On the outskirts of any Papuan village you will find gardens. villager has his particular part of the garden to look after, but it is all one big garden, belonging to the village. The consequence is that, while the land is still attended to in each individual part by the man responsible for it , the whole village has a direct interest in that particular part of the country, and reaps the reward of the industry put into it . If we could extend that principle to Australia, we should avoid all this speculation and land monopoly that is the direct result of private ownership. People buy land today purely for speculative purposes. When a man has secured enough laud to satisfy his absolute needs-and it is wonderful how little is sufficient to satisfy the real needs of the ordinary man-h e begins to get more land for purely speculative purposes. If honourable members opposite will tell us some way whereby they are going to have private ownership of land in such a way as to prevent the aggregation of estates and the development of land monopoly, they will have answered our arguments in favour of leasehold, which are based entirely on the economic principle that the land belongs to the people; that individuals must ha^e the use of it , because land is no good unless it is used, but that the benefits resulting from the use and development of it should belong ' to all, and not to a few individuals. What does the history of the world teach us in that matter? There is no need for honourable members opposite to plead' ignorance, nor is there need for us to try to exaggerate the position, because, in every country in the world where you have the private ownership principle in operation, you have a monopoly, the land being in the hands of the few to the detriment of the many. One peculiar result that always follows is that the man who holds his land in fee simple is the very man who t is the best sub-lets his land.  the ones that object to the leasehold principle most of all .",25
150,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"In that case, you will find that the people accept the leasehold simply because they are unable, in the first place, to find the capital to buy the freehold. They must have the use of the land, and are compelled to submit to the conditions imposed on them by the owner of the freehold.  freehold if they could ?' Each Mr FINLAYSON - Undoubtedly; but the main point is that, as soon as you have private ownership in land, yott immediately add a fictitious and speculative value to it , which is considerably in excess of the actual value; and, therefore, yon restrict the operations of the bond fide occupiers of the land, because, if a man has to put down most of his capital in buying land in the first place, instead of having the money available to buy implements and develop his property, he is prevented from becoming a private owner, and the leasehold is, therefore, forced upon him. The honourable member for Lilley referred to the operation of the leasehold principle in Queensland, saying that there had been only a few applications for leases, and that this proved the failure of the leasehold principle. That is a very strained argument indeed. As a matter of fact, very much the larger proportion of Queensland and other States in the Commonwealth today is held under the leasehold principle. The States have most wisely conserved their rights in that regard; but, unfortunately, some of them are very much concerned about transferring the leaseholds into freeholds as fast as they can, and as soon as a leasehold falls in it is converted into a freehold. Our contention is that leaseholds under the Crown promote closer settlement. They give the genuine bond fide occupier a better chance to get on to the land and to develop it . We contend that a leasehold under the Crown is the proper method of dealing with laud, because, under that system, the Crown does not lose its first interest in and control of the land. Further, we contend that if land is held under lease from the Crown the community is guaranteed the whole of the unearned increment which inevitably arises from the application of labour to land. Our honourable friends opposite have said that the leasehold system does not prevent the creation of slums, but I may say that the biggest slums in the cities of the world today are in places where freeholds have been leased at excessive rents under building and other leases. There we have the concentration of population because the people must make the very best and most complete use of the whole of the area available. If there were not freeholds in the first case in such places the leaseholds would not bring about slum conditions. We must not forget that slums are not created, but developed purely and simply because of the pressure of the private, monopolist in land.",25
151,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,There is an article today's Argus about the exorbitant of hovels in Port Melbourne.,26
152,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"That is so; and honourable members have only to read the evidence given before a Commission recently sitting in Sydney to discover the exorbitant rents which people have to pay for the hovels in which they are compelled to live. They are obliged to live in rat-holes in common with the vermin they have to put up with , simply because of the effects of private monopoly i u land. The Minister of External Affairs, in his second-reading speech on this Bill , which was, as usual with the honourable gentleman, a treat to listen to and a treat to read, said he wished that the loss of the freehold of land in Norfolk Island had not occurred. The only argument which the Government have put forward in opposition to the acceptance of the leasehold principle - incorporated in the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier is that there is so little of Crown lands left in Norfolk Island that it is not of much use bothering about it . I do not think that the Minister of External Affairs can be serious in an argument of that kind. The fact that we have only 3,128 acres remaining under Government control out of 8,528 acres can scarcely be held as a good argument for not doing now what should have been done earlier. If the leasehold principle, as applied to the lands of Norfolk Island, be good, and the Minister of External Affairs admits that it is when he says that the freeholds should not have been parted w it l i , let us save what we can, and give the people of the island some guarantee of protection against possible later developments, if the whole of the land be granted in freehold. There are 8,528 acres in Norfolk Island, 5,400 acres have been alienated, - the Crown has still under control 3,311 acres, and 850 acres have been leased. The leases of this land will f all in at some time, and unless the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier be accepted, the land may later be sold as freehold. There is an area of 967 acres of reserves, but what form these reserves take I cannot quite discover. There is always a temptation to Governments to interfere with reserves. I happen to know from my own experience that the provision generally made for these necessary open spaces, even amongst the most advanced in - communities, is altogether too small. rents The Government may be tempted, if a demand for land should set in , to sell the 967 acres of reserves in Norfolk Island as freeholds, and the community will thus part with their reserves for ever. wish to prevent that, and to secure, so far as we can, that the lands of Norfolk Island shall be retained for the benefit of the islanders, than whom no one has a better right to them. I was consulting Mr Knibbs' Year-Book a few moments ago, and I find that, referring to Norfolk Island, he says The first colonization, in 1788, was by tenant King, who, in the HMS . Sirius, established a small penal station as a branch tlement of that at Port Jackson. He goes on to state how the island was handed over to its present inhabitants. He says The decendants of the Bounty mutineers, having become too numerous to subsist nn Pitcairn Island, were removed thence to Norfolk Island, in 1856. The new community numbered 193, 94 males and 99 females, and were the descendants of British sailors and Tahitian women. These people were brought to Norfolk Island because there was. no room for them on Pitcairn Island, and room was available for them on Norfolk Island. This Bill endangers the very idea and purpose for which these people were brought from the one place to the other. No condemnation can be too severe for a proposal to rob these people of their rights to their own land. They were brought to Norfolk Island because there was room there for their expansion. The population of the island has increased until it is now something like 985-56 8 males and 417 females, which, as the Minister has suggested, gives an unfair advantage to the ladies.",26
153,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Considerin g their natural handicap against us, I think it does.",27
154,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"The people of Norfolk Island were settled there under a direct or implied promise that the island was going to be theirs. Whether the area already alienated, 5,400 acres, was alienated with or without their consent, I do not know, but I am anxious that no further alienation shall take place, and that the people shall be protected in the possession of the land which they were given to understand would be theirs. I was amazed to learn that in 1859, the land was parcelled out in areas of 50 acres each, and that at the present time there are only some 400 acres under agriculture. The Minister of External Affairs gave us a most glowing description of the possibilities of agriculture in the island. According to the honourable gentleman, it is most fertile. Coco-nut trees grow there splendidly, and any one We who knows anything about them must be aware that, as a product of agriculture, the coco-nut tree will become more and more important as the years go by. No substitute has yet been discovered by chemists for the vegetable oil, which is so valuable a product of the coco-nut tree, which has been well called the "" consols of the Pacific."" If we in AusLieutralia could utilize Norfolk Island as a coco-nut plantation, it would be worth set- our while to retain' it for that purpose alone, because of the increasing value of coco-nut oil and copra in the world's markets. Honourable members are aware that the Norfolk Island pine is famous as a beautiful timber all over the world. I noticed only in yesterday's newspapers a report of statements made by Sir Rider Haggard, which were almost a repetition of statements whioh he made while in Australia, as to the criminal waste of splendid timbers that is going on in the Commonwealth Some day we shall wake up to discover how foolish we have been in the destruction of our valuable timbers. Very little effort is being made in the different States in the way of re-afforestation, or of preserving existing valuable timbers. Here is a chance for the Commonwealth to step in and, by securing Norfolk Island, to provide for years to come abundant supplies of the valuable Norfolk Island pine. Norfolk Island does not produce only coco-nut trees and the Norfolk Island pine. The Minister of External Affairs told us, in his second-reading speech, thatiThey can grow anything in any quantityoranges, lemons, guavas, pineapples, yams, kumeras, potatoes (three or four crops a year), strawberries, bananas, coffee, maize, wheatanything-bu t what's the use? It costs 4s. per case to send oranges to Sydney, and 2s. a case duty."" The duty will be removed by the operation of this Bill ; but the point I wish to make, is, that the Government are proposing to alienate these-fertile and f r u it f u l lands, and so lock them up against the very people who have a riglit to demand that we should protect them in their possession of them The Norfolk Islanders demand our special and most careful consideration. They seem, by all accounts, to be a very well-behaved and useful class of people. The fact that they have not developed their agriculture, as might have been expected, may be due more to the want of means of communision cation with the outside world than to any lack of adaptability on their part. Commonwealth will inevitably take over the island, and we shall find it necessary to give these people some means of munication. We shall have to take a direct interest in them. If the developDepartment ment of the agricultural possibilities the island is to be left to people interest it will be to make money out of Norfolk Island, and not to develop it the interests of the people who are there, siderable danger. very serious consequences will arise in future. We have here a class of people means ""the Minister "" ? who are not exactly of our own race, and who, perhaps, d.0 no+i hold all our ideas civilization, but they are a community who have shown their ability to develop and progress. They have shown that they can be depended upon to keep the island the intact, so far as their power will allow them to do so. Their development has been hindered because of the lack of means of communication with other parts of the world. It is our business to vide that means of communication them, and, by opening our markets to them, give them encouragement for the development of the agricultural resources of their island. It cially our business to secure to them Resident Official as now. the undisputed possession of their lands. The honourable member for Barrier has already moved an amendment. At present the clause provides that the GovernorThere General, or any person authorized by him, may make grants of land. I should like the people. to move to leave out the words "" or any person authorized by him , "" strengthened in this desire, because under present conditions the dealing with Crown lands in Norfolk Island is left entirely in he omit the words "" make grants?"" the hands of the Governor. 1244 of this year's Hansard the Minister of External Affairs told us that a sort Constitution was established by the Order in Council of 1897, and that clause nical term. 2 providedProvided that power of alienating, leasing, or authorizing the occupation or use ot wjste of the Crown shall be exercised by the Governor alone. The addition of the words "" or any peroriginally son authorized by him "" seems to open dangerous door, and provide opportunity for some officious under-official to give away a grant of land. An y system giving away grants of land that should held legitimately for the use and possesisland. of the people on Norfolk Island is most vicious - But I object to grants of The land altogether.",27
155,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"It really will be ""the Governor General."" The words to which comthe honourable member objects simply authorize the Minister or the head of a by law to act for the Goverof nor-General, just as the Administrator whose acts in the Northern Territory.",28

163,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"No amendment on the lines suggested by the honourable ber can be moved unless first the amendIreland ment submitted by the honourable memland ber for Barrier is withdrawn.  honourable member has said that there on Norfolk Island an extent of country which is good land capable of growing coco-nut trees and cocoa, coffee, and all kinds of tropical plants of tion, but if he had any experience of such matters he would know that land must cidedly not. be of the very best quality to grow these plants. It is impossible to embark in the industry, and at the same time pay the rates for labour vailing in Australia.

No one could expect to embark"" upon them on Norfolk Island without the employment of coloured labour. I am informed that 80 per * cent, of the land is hilly and rough country, utterly incapable of being put to the use the honourable member suggests. The honourable member has also referred to the leasehold and freehold principle. He has pointed out that because a man owning land leases it to leaseholders, shows that the freeholder believes in the leasehold system. That is a ridiculous statement. Certainly, the freeholder beproperty lieves in the freehold principle, and, ing that the leaseholders believe in that principle just as strongly as the holder, if they had the opportunity getting the freehold title to the land would take it tomorrow. That case right through the piece. The honourable member for Lilley referred the example of Ireland, where the British Government have spent millions in buybhat ing up huge estates, and have allowed lessees on those estates to purchase their holdings by instalments. I venture say that step has helped Ireland consideralso ably. The same principle is to be adopted in Scotland.",29

Why did they clamour for the freehold ? Why were there petitions to the Britisli is Government asking for the cancellation of the leases and the granting of freeholds in lieu ?

That conwould mean that I would have all my where capital to work the land.  who went through New South Wales three years ago proclaiming the merits of freehold as against leasehold, are and actually held 640 acres of free",29
167,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable member cannot discuss Mr N i e l sen.  for Brisbane related a lot of ancient history. He went back to the period of the children of Israel. All the land was equally divided among the children of Israel, and the law was that no man could it divest himself of his property. He could lease rt, or sell the lease of it for a period, but every fifty years, at the jubilee, all so leased - reverted to its former showowner. Jubilee is derived from the Hebrew word "" Y o be l "" meaning the sound of a freehorn. The horn was sounded throughout of the length and breadth of the land during they the jubilee period, and all property reis the verted to its former owners.",29
168,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Are you prepared to go to in for a law of that kind now 1  the Israelites adopted the freehold the principle, though the honourable member for Brisbane tried to prove that the leaseto hold system was instituted by Moses. I wish to show that the word ""jubilee, "" if it means anything-and it is a word which is familiar throughout the British Empire-mean s the celebrating of the freehold title. It is said by our friends that if we grant freehold it will lead to a monopoly. I would draw the attention of honourable members to the Closer Settlement Act and the Closer Settlement Promotion A ct of New South Wales, under the provisions of which applicants are permitted to purchase their farms by instalment, up to forty years. Dpon the completion of their payments they get the freehold title to their land, but they are limited by conditions of their grant so that they cannot transfer their land except to a person who has not a living area. How can there be aggregation of land with a provision like that? A man cannot sell to a squatter or any one who seeks to get a monopoly. In the same way the difficulty in Norfolk Island can be overcome. I think Australia has gone completely mad on the question of giving people leaseholds. Nowhere in the civilized world does the leasehold system prevail. As honourable members are aware, Germany, at the close of the war with Prance, demanded an indemnity of £200,000,000, which had to be paid within a certain time. France had innumerable freeholders, many of them small men, possessing 10, 15, and 20-acre blocks. This t h r if t y population had saved up money, not in the banks, but in stockings, kettles, and hiding places in the ground, and, when appealed to on the score of patriotism, it flocked to Paris, bringing its money with it , and the in demnity was paid. H a d the land been held in leasehold, the tenants, would have said, "" This property belongs to the State,"" and they would have taken their wealth elsewhere, leaying the country to the Germans. But. holding their farms in freehold, they were prepared to sacrifice their wealth to save France. marck said, on one occasion, that the one thing that helped him to combat Socialism was the division of Germany into as many freeholdings as possible. The more freeholds there are, the less the chance for Socialism. A great deal has been said about the increase of rents in Sydney. We have been told that tenants are being charged high rents for places no better than rat-holes.",29
169,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I cannot allow the honourable gentleman to go into this matter in detail. He may refer to it only incidentally.  form the Committee that there is. a property in Sydney in which office rents have been raised from 5s. to 7s. 6d., to 10s., 15s., 17s., and, finally, 25s. per week, although the property is exempt from taxatio.n its owners being the trustees of t the Trades H all . We hear about the capitalists raising rents, but the very persons who are finding f a u l t with the capitalists are themselves responsible for the same thing. If the Labour party would drop its ridiculous fad, and f all into line with all civilized nations in regard to the holding'of land, it would'tend to progress. The possession of freehold gives men an incentive to improve their property. As a case in point, I might mention that, in my district, a property of 1,600 acres was divided between a son and a daughter. The daughter went to live in Sydney, and leased her portion to a tenant, but the son remained on his estate and worked it . To-day there are no briars on the son's estate, the fences are good, there is a substantial house, and everything betokens prosperity; but the rented land is full of briars, the fences have been made by pulling a few logs together, and the house itself is patched with bags. The tenant, who pays, perhaps, £ 1 5 0 a year in rent, is trying to get as much as he can from the land with as little expenditure as possible, but the freeholder is doing all that he can to improve his land. From the point of view of the working classes, it is better to have the country occupied by men who improve the land, and give employment, than by men who spend as little as possible on improvements. I shall not support the attempt to amend the clause.",30
170,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Denison) [4.48J. - I hope that the Minister will agree to adopt the leasehold principle in regard to Bisthe unalienated land in Norfolk Island. The area concerned may be only small, but the principle at stake is a big one. The honourable member for Calare referred to the condition of affairs in Ireland, but, from inquiries that I made on the spot, I found that the British Government purchased Irish land at very high prices, parcelling it out among persons who have become as autocratic as the former absentee landlords ever were, to the great disadvantage of the unfortunate labourers.  have sixty-eight years in which to pay",30
171,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Yes ; but a body of autocrats has been created.,30
172,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,A body of independent cultivators.,30
173,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"They are not independent; they have a burden to carry, and only think that they own the laud; but they have become autocratic because they think that they own it . I believe in land nationalization, and object to theprivate owning of l and; but I am beginning to wonder"" whether it is worthwhile to bother about altering the present system, seeing that the time is fast approaching when no person will really own land. This is evidenced by the statements in the following cablegram, which was published in the Melbourne Herald on the 15th in s t FEDERAL LANDTAX . COMPANY COMPLAINS, FREEHOLDS TO BE SOLD. (Published in The Times this morning.) At the annual meeting of the Scottish, Australian Investment Company L t d . , yesterday, Mr John Varley, one of the directors of pany stated that £20,818 was paid in the year ended June 30 last for colonial taxation of the properties of the company. The bulk of this sum, Mr Varley continued, was for payment of the Federal land tax, and the amount so paid was equal to a dividend of 4 per cent, on the ordinary capital of the company. The tax was levied on all freehold properties, whether reproductive or not. This taxation exceeded anything that could be termed reasonable. Serious remonstrances made to the Federal Government had been unavailing. Only one course remained for the directors to adopt, added Mr Varley, and - that was to sell the freehold upon which the Federal land tax was levied. This policy would take time. They would then find other outlets for their capital in Australia, because Australia, with its faults of Government was a great country with a future before it. The State having power to impose a big tax on land, the freeholder can no longer be said to own that land. Speaking in Tasmania, I said to a number of landowners, "" Who owns your land? In my opinion, you do not own any l and . "" A gentleman afterwards questioned my right to say that. My reply was, "" What land tax do you pay?"" He said, "" £ 1 0 a year."" Then, I returned, ""There is a mortgage of £200 a year on your land imposed by the Government."" Some time ago, when a member of the Opposition in Tasmania said that the State was deeply mortgaged, the national debt being so great that the interest charges were a heavy burden on the people, a Ministerial member replied that the debt was not so great when the assets were taken into consideration. He said- I give the figures from memory- "" Our assets are worth £31,000,000. "" That statement bears out what I have said. Land is the asset for our national debt. We must get revenue from some source, and as the proportion of enlightened individuals in Parliament has increased, taxation is placed on the land. As to the Prench land system, I am sorry that my small knowledge of French prevented me from making as searching inquiries on the subject in the country itself as I should have liked to make. In France, the holdings are as small as anywhere in the world, the law requiring the division of property between all children. As the result of this continual division and subdivision, the holdings have become, in many cases, very small indeed, so small that one man told me that they had no dividing fencesLondon, Saturday morning. divisional lines being marked ' by white stones-becaus e they could not spare the land that the fences would occupy. In the comdeed, the holdings are so small that it is often impossible to make a living off them, and they are consequently mortgaged, so that the holders really do not own them at all. It is easy to discuss land matters with the French farmers, because, instead of living on their land, as in Australia, they live in villages, going out to the land to work on it . Consequently, when travelling along one of the well-made roads which Napoleon laid down all over France to enable him to move his armies rapidly, you have only to draw up at a village to find men with a ll whom to talk over these matters. France is as well served with, good roads as any country in the old world.  an indemnity of £200,000,000.",31
174,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"It could not do so again today; there is no more poverty stricken country at the present time than France, so far as the rural workers are concerned. I have seen the women there working in the fields like slaves. We do not see that sort of thing in Australia, and I hope that we never shall.  poverty.",31
175,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Does the honourable member seriously suggest that, because of custom, a woman is prepared to slave in the fields, and spoil her beautif u l complexion? I saw women working in the fields both in France and Switzerland, where the freehold system prevails. These poor people think they own the freehold, but they do not; it is owned really by the mortgagees. I have been reminded by the honourable member for Barrier that the Israelites already hold a lot of the land in England. A little while ago I perused certain documents in one of the States, and was surprised to find what a lot of farmers had mortgaged their lands to a certain gentleman. Who owns that land ? It is owned, uot by the farmers, who are legitimately working it , but by the mortgagee every time. Under the leasehold system, it is possible for a man with a little capital to find immediate use for it in working an area leased from the Crown. A friend of mine has to find £700 by March next to pay off part of a mortgage on his holding. He is doing his best to scrape up the money, and when this amount has been paid off, there will still remain a balance of £1,100, on which he will have to pay interest. The interest is going iuto the coffers of the landlord, which is a company. If the State retained the ownership of the land, and leased it to legitimate land workers, those workers would be-able to devote the whole of their capital to its development and improvement. could sell the improvements at any time, and the State would participate in the unearned increment. A friend of mine, working in a trade here, purchased a piece of land some eight years ago for £ 1 6 8 . Since then the country has been opened up by a railway, and settlement has progressed in the district, with the result that today he can obtain £400 for his property. He is reaping the benefit of the unearned increment, which has accrued from the settlement of people in the neighbourhood. Every additional settler who goes on the land enhances the value of land in that locality. I hope that the Minister will accept this amendment, and so continue the splendid system introduced, I think, by the Deakin Government, and which it is the desire of the Labour party shall be adopted throughout Australia. The honourable member for Maribyrnong has told us of a block of land in Swanston-street, Melbourne, the rents from which amount to, I think, about £60,000 a year.",31
176,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The buildings block have been put up by lessees, and the owners have not had to pay a penny.",32
177,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"That huge sum is going out of Australia. If that particular block were owned by the Government, they would be prepared to lease it at a reduced rental. If the leasehold system were generally applied, the State would be satisfied with lower rentals, and no taxation would be necessary. We should have lower rentals, and, perhaps, free railways, as advocated by the honourable member for Barrier. I hope that honourable members will not be influenced by the eloquence of the honourable member for Calare.",32
178,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The ex-bank manager.,32
179,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Quite so. Bank managers and lawyers would be doomed if all the land were owned by the State. 1 trust that the amendment will be accepted.  not been for the startling character of some of the remarks made by.the honourable member for Denison-remark s which must convince any one who knows anything at all about land, of his utter ignorance of the subject- I should not have attempted to rise at this stage. But for the honour of the House, and so that we may not be a laughing-'stock for the whole farming community of Australia, I feel They it incumbent upon me to offer a few observations. On a previous occasion I pointed out that this was certainly not the time to raise the question of freehold versus leasehold; and, in view of the fact that ouly some 1,300 acres in Norfolk Island remain unalienated, I certainly thought that the Opposition would allow this Bill to pass without offering any objection to the innocent powers which it gives to the Government to deal with that small area. The Opposition, however, have elected not to do so. I stand absolutely convinced from my own personal experience that the leasehold system is a snare and a delusion. I speak as a practical farmer, who for the last sixteen years has been getting his living off the land. In my spare time. I travel a good deal in various parts of Australia, and can assure honourable members that I see conditions under all tenures that convince me more and more of the stability of the freehold title. The amazing way in which red herrings are drawn across the trail by members of this House, in order to on the cloud the issue under discussion, leaves me marvelling at the fertilit y of the imagination of my honourable friends opposite.",32
180,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Do not be so wordy. Get to the point.  information that honourable members opposite do not want to hear. place, they do not like a practical man to speak of what he knows, but they indulge in all sorts of wild romancing concerning subjects of which they are ignorant, and try to convince us that they are the only known advocates of certain principles. I say without fear of .contradiction that in New South Wales there has never been an aggregation, of land in large estates to equal that which has taken place under the leasehold tenure in the Western divisiou of that State. When Mr Crick brought in his Land Bill to divide New South Wales into three portions and to place the Western Division under a Lands Commission, with power only to lease the land, there were 1,500,000 acres occupied in small holdings in that part of New South Wales. are not 500,000 acres in small holdings; the balance, comprising over 1,000,000 acres, has been absorbed under the leasehold principle by existing large holders. Any one that understands the land laws of that State knows perfectly well that the genius of leasehold lies in its periodic re-appraisement of rentals. the re-appraisement of rentals-which , in my experience, have always an upward and never a downward tendency-and I am a leaseholder.",32
181,Mr LAIKDSMITH,Unknown,"And a monopolist.  leasehold system, with a re-appraisement of rentals at certain periods-and I put this to my practical friends who know something about the land-the older or the more worn-out the land becomes the higher the rental. T am speaking of land as land, and not of methods of cultivation.",33
182,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Who wears it out-the bad or the good farmer?  where is that the older the land gets the higher the rentals become under the leasehold tenure with its re-appraisement periods. If that were not so there would be no point in re-appraising the rentals. No State Act provides for leasehold without the re-appraisement of rents at some period or other. The Land Act of New South Wales at one time provided for a re-appraisement every fifteen years, but the period has been extended to twenty years. The fact remains that, whether the re-appraisement is made once or three times in a decade, the rent goes up at some time or other. That is not a reasonable proI n the first posal to make in respect of a little place like Norfolk Island. I hope that the Government will not accept the amendment. I give honourable members opposite credit for believing in a principle and fighting for it , but I think they are generous enough to admit that there are in this House men equally as honest in their belief in another principle, and just as determined to see that that principle is not sacrified to the fad, as we claim it to be, of leasehold, as promulgated by such gentlemen as the honourable member for Denison.",33
183,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [5.9] It is surprising how the utterances of one honourable member will induce another to speak. I*was glad to hear the admission coming from a noted farmers' advocate To-day there that if the re-appraisement of rentals under the leasehold system were once removed he would immediately become an advocate of the leasehold system. Honourable members who argue in that strain profess to be capable business men. The honourable member, along with others in the corner where he sits, claims to be Take away a practical business man, and I should like to put a case to him. If the New South Wales Government, for instance, subdivided a certain area of land under leasehold, they would naturally do their level best to see that the produce of their tenants was conveyed by rail to the nearest market or p o r t ; and I ask the honourable member whether he wishes the House to believe that, with the railway facilities thus provided, that land, after twenty years, would not be worth more than the original rental ?  fore the tenants, or are the tenants there before the railroad?",33
184,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Le t us suppose that the men are there before the railroad, so that the honourable member may have the full benefit of his argument. We know that Crown tenants are continual supplicants for greater facilities for marketing their produce; and I am sure that the honourable member, with his business in stincts, will admit that, in order to get railway communication, the tenants would gladly submit to a re-appraisement and increase in rent. It is unreasonable for the honourable member to say that he would be a whole-hearted leaseholder if there were no re-appraisement.  Zealand, was a whole-hearted leaseholder without re-appraisement.",33
185,Mr FENTON,Unknown,That may be; and I know that Mr Balance is one of the finest statesmen that we ever had in Australasia.,34
186,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"If there is to be no reappraisement of the leaseholds, there ought to be no land tax on the freehold.",34
187,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Quite a number of facts might be enumerated to show how land increases in value. The honourable member told us that the older the land gets the higher the rent becomes; and, if he is the great agriculturist he would have the Committee to believe, he must admit that, after perhaps twenty-five years' cultivation and improvement, his land, whether - leasehold or freehold, is > worth more than when he orginally set foot on it . What would the honourable member say if , after such a period of cultivation of iand for which he might have paid anything from 10s. to £ 1 an acre, I were to come to him, and, on the contention that the best had been taken out of the land, suggest that he should sell it to me for something like the original price? Again, is the honourable member prepared to say that land from year to year deteriorates  some places that the cultivators have had to take out one set of crops and put in another.",34
188,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"If the honourable member is an agricultural expert, he will know that that is what ought to be done all the time. I cannot understand a practical man talking as the honourable member does, seeing that it is rotation of crops that increases the fertility of land.",34
189,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,He is not farmer!,34
190,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I think the honourable member for Hume has himself demonstrated that fact.  ing about.,34
191,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The Minister of External Affairs, in what I may describe as a poetic speech, with that fine range of language of which he is capable, described Norfolk Island as a beautiful spot of wonderful f e r t i l it y; and I say at once - that, as soon as this Bill is passed, and it becomes known that the Commonwealth has taken over the island, the land will 'be considerably enhanced in value. We [123] of New shall find the speculator-and the man of ease and cash-anxiou s to secure a patch; and there is no doubt that, with the regular steam-ship service we may expect, the land will become even more valuable. We know that in these remote places there are sometimes men of undesirable type; and who is to say that we may not on Norfolk Island find those of the character at present in Tasmania and elsewhere ready and eager to turn the place into a veritable Monte Carlo ? In Victoria, we have a striking example of what may happen if land is permitted to get beyond the control of the Crown. At one time the foreshore of Hobson's Bay for a certain distance back was reserved, the Crown refusing any title to a purchaser. However, influence was brought to bear on the Government of the day, and the foreshore, especially at Sorrento and other places, has been purchased by private in dividuals righ t down to the water's edge when the tide is out. As a result, the business people of the district, and visitors, find that a great wrong has been done to the community generally. I understand that on Norfolk Island there are 1,311 acres unsold, while there are reserves making up the total area to something like 3,128 acres; and, Under the circumstances, the Minister would be well advised to retain all the land for the people. If , as we believe, this land on Norfolk Island is going to increase in value, as it is brought more under the observation of the people on the mainland, it would be a most profitable course on the part of the Government to restrict themselves to leasehold. It has been mentioned by the honourable member for Brisbane"" that only about 400 acres are under cultivation; and this fact is somewhat a practical depressing in view of the wonderful fert i l i ty of the soil.",34
192,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"That statement is about correct, but cultivation was kept back by a good many causes which we hope will be removed.",34
193,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"That will only make the remaining land more valuable; and, under leaseholds, the rents would mean a considerable revenue which could be devoted to meeting the annual expenditure of the island. 1 hope that the Minister will not allow present-day surroundings to influence him, but that he will be guided by his true feelings and real sentiments in regard to land. I believe if he consulted his own feelings he' would gladly meet us. If he were to he the perpetual occupant of the External Affair s office we might safely entrust these lands to him, because I believe that rather than sell them he would lease them; but some !day, perhaps, even the present Treasurer might occupy the position of Minister of External Affairs, and we know that he has said, "" I believe in selling every b it of land I can, especially near at o w n . "" I hope the Minister will take into serious consideration the representations that have been made ou this side of the House, aud that we shall retain this land as Commonwealth property, as we have done in the Northern Territory, Papua, and the Federal territory, more particularly in the last-named. The Prime Minister has indicated the policy in regard to that area, because he says that in a few years' time, if properly managed, it will bring in a good revenue to the Commonwealth.",34
194,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,It will be all rabbits if you do not give the freehold to somebody soon.,35
195,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I know there is a good number of rabbits there, but when things are fairly going, the land will be occupied under leasehold, and the pest will decrease.",35
196,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Barrier) [5.30] - I should not have spoken again but for the speech delivered by the Minister of Trade and Customs, when in charge of the Bill , in the absence of the Minister of External Affairs. I quite recognise, as some members say, that only about 1,300 acres can be dealt with under my amendment, but we have a perfect right in this House to deal with principles, irrespective of the area involved. The Government recently introduced the Public Service Preference Prohibition Bill , which does not affect a large number of people, but which they say embodies principle. In the same way we have a perfect right to fight for the great principle of the non-alienation of land in this case. It is not the first time in this Parliament that that principle has been embodied in legislation. In the first Parliament, when Mr Barton was Prime Minister, it was applied to the Federal Territory by means of an amendment, which the then Government accepted. When the Constitution Bill was being considered at the Federal Convention, the present Minister of External Affairs, who was one of the delegates for South Australia, endeavoured, in conjunction with Mr B . R. Wise, to embody in the Constitution the same great principle, but they were unable to succeed, because the Convention thought the Constitution was not the proper place to put it. Some of the delegates, who were in favour of the principle, said that it was a matter in which the Commonwealth Parliament' should be allowed a free hand. It cannot be said that our advocacy of leasehold is a fad when the Minister of External Affairs himself has so ably and eloquently advocated it .",35
197,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I advocated the p r in -. ciple, on that occasion, in relation to a specific case-the Federal Territory, where we had an absolutely clean sheet.",35
198,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I have no desire to , be unfair to the honourable member. I simply say that he advocated the principle. When we were dealing with Papua in this Parliament, Mr Deakin being Prime Minister, the same principle was advocated, and was practically unanimously adopted. One or two members who voted for it have said, since this discussion took place, that they advocated it in the case of Papua because ' that country was in the hands of the natives, and it was advisable to see that the white men did not exploit them, but that what applied to the natives of Papua should not necessarily apply to parts of Australia. Later on, when another Government was in office, the Northern Territory had to be taken over, and again the same principle was adopted, and I have taken this very amendment word for word from the Northern Territory Acceptance Act . The Minister of Trade and Customs, when he last spoke, said that the principle was put in that Act because the Labour party were in office, and had a great a majority, and that they had to take the full responsibility for putting it in , because the Opposition did not sanction it in any way. I admit that we, as a Government, took full and complete responsibility; but it is a fair thing to ask honourable members to look up Hansard to see the character of the opposition that was offered to the principle by the then Opposition. When the clause was being dealt with, only one member of the Opposition opposed it . That was ibhe present Prime Minister, who expressed the view that if we introduced leasehold instead of freehold in the Northern Territory, we should not he able to develop it , and said that he wanted to call for a division. No other member of the Opposition raised any protest. There was no division on the clause, and it passed on the voices. The attitude of Ministerialists on this occasion seems very strange in' those circumstances.",35
199,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I suppose the honourable member admits that, at that time, a division on the question would have been hopelessly carried against us.",36
200,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,We have had divi- also. sions in this House lately that have been hopelesly carried against us. Am I to understand that men who believe in great principles are not prepared to vote for them because they are in a minority 1,36
201,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Surely you do not call for a division on every subject as you go along'! *,36
202,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,We do not.,36
203,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Immediatel y you brought the Ordinance down, strong protest was raised against it .",36
204,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I was coming to that point. If a division had been taken at that time, I believe the Government would have won by ten or twelve votes at least, but every member of the Opposition could have voted against it . I do not think that any member who voted against the Government at that time would have been suspended for the rest of the session. We had such a majority in those days that it was not necessary to suspend members to get a majority.",36
205,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Do I understand the honourable member to say that because an honourable member voted against the Government he was suspended ?,36
206,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I did not say such a thing. The Minister of Trade and Customs said they did not vote against the principle on that occasion because they thought they would be defeated by an overwhelming majority, and I replied that if it was a great principle they could have dared to vote againsti t , and would not have been penalized by being suspended for the rest of the session for doing so. When I introduced the Land Ordinance, as Minister in charge of the Territory, I admit that a protest was raised against it by' the honourable member for I l l a warra; but I ask honourable members to read the discussion on his motion, especially the speech of the Minister of External Affairs- a very able speech, for [123]- 2 which I thanked him afterwards. There was not a word against the leasehold principle in it . The debate was not limited to the question of leasehold or freehold. There were a dozen things on which honourable members spoke. There were even some of our own party who objected to some parte of the Ordinance.",36
207,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable ' member for Illawarra, who introduced the motion, made the question of freehold or leasehold a strong dividing principle, and many others who followed him did so",36
208,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I do not say that they did not, but all the members of the Opposition did not. The Minister of External A f fair s did not. In fact, most of those who spoke at that time based their main objection to the Ordinance on the largo size of the areas of the perpetual leases that I proposed to grant. The history of the Commonwealth, therefore, shows that, three different Governments- a Conservative Government, a Liberal Government* and a Labour Government-hav e accepted in this - House the great principle)of leasehold as against freehold. There is no doubt that the land question is the great question that is troubling every? country. The honourable member for ' Capricornia said today that the alienation of land has created a great deal of poverty and destitution in England, Germany, and America. That is true. I should like to quote from Saturday's Argus an intensely interesting article taken from the Fortnightly Beview on the unrest in Mexico. I had the pleasure of spending some years in Mexico, and that is the reason I take a keen interest in what takes place there. Honourable members are aware that the Fortnightly Beview is not a Socialist or Labour periodical. The article to which I refer  know whether he is the Mr Marti n who has written a book upon Mexico, which is of very great interest, and can be found in our Library, but if . he is he is not a Labour man, because he gives expression to some very Conservative views. He states in the article to which I refer that the social unrest at present evident in Mexico is due to the land question. It is an economic question. He says that the reason why there is such trouble and misery there today is be-, cause all the best lands in the country are in the hands of a few people. Some honourable members have said that the development of the country can be better secured under a freehold than under a leasehold system. . Some have gone back to the history of many years past to support the principle of freehold against that of leasehold. The honourable member for Brisbane went back into quite ancient history to prove his case, which he did very well, in favour of the nonalienation of land. I may be permitted to read an extract from a report which appeared in the Kalgoorlie Miner a few years ago, which was written by Mr. Staniforth Smith, who was at one time a member of the Senate. He did not belong, as honourable members are aware, to the Lahour party. He was a member of the Liberal party, and is today one of our administrators in Papua. He had been on a visit to the Malay States, and in the article to which I refer he says The Federal Malay States are a group of native Malay districts, amalgamated about thirty years ago under a British Administrator on the Crown Colony plan, and occupying the southern portion of the Malay Peninsula, just across the Malacca Straits from Sumatra. about the size of Tasmania. Three years ago these States were practically unexplored jungle, inhabited by half-savage tribes. States have 1,586 miles of metalled roads, 1,000 miles of cleared tracks and bridle paths, 421 miles of metre-gauge railway, with a subsidised motor-car service to outlying places, and 1,231 miles of telegraph and telephone lines. They have 248 State schools, -?i free hospitals, and 2 savings banks. They have rest houses (practically State hotels) at every railway station. They have a State medical service, a military force of 842 men, and a fine body of police, numbering 2,651 men.' Incredible as it may :seem, they have no public debt; but have, on the - contrary, millions of dollars of surplus revenue invested in interest-bearing securities. They are at present building 152 miles of railway out of revenue. Lastly, they have magnificent public buildings, also paid for out of revenue. But how is it done? It is done neither by scientific tection or a revenue tariff, for this astounding Federation imposes no import duties, except on spirits and opium. It is done by taxation on the unimproved value of land. The States have not parted with the fee-simple of one acre of their territory. These States are booming.",36
209,Sir JOHN FOKREST,Unknown,"There is not much humanitarian legislation there, I suppose?",37
210,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"That may be so. I am indebted to some one in Western Australia for a reference to a discussion that took place in the Parliament of that State some years ago, when the right honourable member for Swan was the "" Emperor of the West."" A Mr Leake, who was a Queen's Counsel and a very prominent politician of Western Australia, and who, so far as I know, was never associated with the Labour party, though he may have held some of their views, moved in the early days of Western AustraliaThat, in the opinion of this House, it would be to the advantage of the country to restrict the .grant of freeholds in and near towns established upon the various gold-fields, and to substitute a system of leasing for a short term of years. He gave some very good reasons for his motion, and in the course of his speech he said If persons will rent land from a ground landlord-the freeholder as we know him, who has obtained his land from the Crown-wh y should they not do so from the Crown itself ? . . . All I contend for is that the State is entitled to all increase in the value of the land-that increase which is represented by what is known as the unearned increment. . . . That unearned increment is not due to any inherent quality in the land itself, but is the outcome of development, which development may be either gradual or sudden. Jn our own particular case this development, I am happy to say, has been as sudden as it has been startling. I . am referring to the development of our mines, which has given to land in the locality of the mines an increased The area is and increasing value. It is those increasing values that we seek to attach. Shall we take advantage of the immediate enhanced valueNow these that is, the actual freehold value at the present time-and shall we not take advantage of the annually increasing value of this land? Surely it is better that we should have a regular and gradually increasing income rather than be content with the present actual value of the land, which is practically a nominal value, and nothing more. . . We know the practice. here is to sell the Crown land by public auction to the highest bidder, at upset price. Individuals, no doubt, are more far-seeing than the Government ; and the individual land speculator-or , as I sometimes like to call him, the land grabber - step s in, and with a full knowledge that the land will increase in value as the Colony is developed, the individual reaps the advantage, and not the State. Whatever he puts in his propocket by reason ofhis foresight is not to the advantage of the State, though certainly it is to' the advantage of - the individual speculator. . . . But if this system of land nationalization, or the retention by the State of the freehold of land had been recognised in the past, there would have been no necessitv for the Government to have come down at this late hour and ask this House to vote thousands of pounds for the re-purchase of land. Mr Leake pointed out in that speech that a Loan Bill, which the present honourable member for Swan. had submitted to the Western Australian Parliament, would not have been necessary if this principle of land nationalization had been adopted in the early history of Western Australia.",37
211,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,He was not very experienced.,37
212,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,He was quit© correct in this matter. He pointed out that a Loan Bill which the right honourable gentleman had submitted had been submitted to enable the Government actually to re-purchase at an enhanced price land which had previously been sold to certain people. Sir JOHN FORRE.ST - It was purchased very cheaply.,38
213,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"That may be so, but it was sold in the first place to the people from whom it was purchased .at a lower price than they received for it from the Government.",38
214,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,Mr Leake continued the same policy after he became Premier of Western Australia.,38
215,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth does not advocate today what he did a few years ago. He is always ready to adjust his convictions to suit his ambitions, but it does not follow that he is quite correct in doing so. Mr (now Sir Walter) James supported the motion moved by Mr . Leake. He was not a member of the Labour party, but he saidFor f if ty years after the establishment of the Mother Colony, New South Wales, no freeholds Were granted, - I admit that that was news to m© until I read this statement by Sir Walter James. He went on to saythe only tenure under which land was granted by the Crown being a leasehold tenure on more or less short terms.",38
216,Sir JOHN PORREST,Unknown,But no progress was made then.,38
217,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"How much progress Was there made, in Western Australia, with all the alleged advantages of the freehold system, before the mines were started there?",38
218,Sir JOHN PORREST,Unknown,A good deal.,38
219,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"On e could bought the whole of Western Australia for a few pounds before the mines were opened up. The State had all the alleged been resumed by the Government. advantages of the freehold system, the advantage of the statesmanship of the right honourable member for Swan as well. I admit that the right honourable gentlewe man has many things to be proud of.",38
220,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I wonder, if land could be bought so cheaply in WesAffairs tern Australia, that it was not all bought up.",38
221,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I suppose that a man at that time could have bought for 1,000 acres in Western Australia which he would have to pay millions for today. What was Western Australia u n t i l a few Victorian miners went over there, and discovered gold ? Sir Walter James went on to sayI think it is rather to be regretted that, having started with that good principle, they should, in later days, have departed from it . But the experience of New South Wales, I suppose, was the experience of the rest of the woild. When those who had obtained these leasehold areas became a power in the land, when the old official days were departing, and early influences were waning, these land-holders were in a position to demand freehold ownership in their land, and, having the power, they got that right. That is the experience of m a n y places besides New South Wales. When people who have been granted leaseholds get upon their feet, they seek to turn them into freeholds. It is not because they are personally any better off with a freehold than with a leasehold, but that if therehappens to be any rise in the value of the land, they get it if they possess the freehold. The honourable 'member f o i Calare referred to the action of the British Government in spending millions of money to enable the tenant farmers .of Ireland to buy out their landlords. By interjection, I reminded the honourable member that though it was a Conservative, and not - a Labour, Government that introduced that measure, one of its <? provisions was that the tenant farmer should not have complete hold of the land, but that the value of one-tenth of it should for all time remain owing to the . Government, so that th© State might be in a position to deal with the land. A British Conservative Government realized that when land is divided, it may be only a few years' time under a freehold system when if will again be aggregated in large estates. A few years ago, I spent a Sunday with the late lamented Mr Batchelor have and his brother in the hills near Adelaide. We were walking over some land there, and he informed me that it had It and was sold to a number of settlers, and within five years it was all back, in the hands of the first landlord. 1 feel that are justified in making a fight for the leasehold principle. It is not a f a d . W© have in support of it the expressions of opinion of the Minister of External and of the present Prime Minister, who has spoken very strongly in times past against the alienation of land. ls. . I could quote many people who do not belong to. our party who have advocated the leasehold principle as against the alienation of Crown lands. therefore, justified in taking the stand we do. The Minister of External Affairs would be quite ready to admit that there are many people outside our party who advocate the noh-alienation of Crown lands. It will be pleasing to hear him give his reasons and his arguments why, at this particular moment, he is not prepared to accept tha principle for which, in the past, he has fought so ably and so nobly, and supported more eloquently than many other members are able to do.",38
222,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas-Minister of External Affairs) [5.56] - I think honourable members opposite will recognise that we have now had a fairl y ample debate upon this question, and I think I am expressing the feelings of honourable members on the Government side of the chamber in saying that the debate has been conducted in a reasonable spirit up to the point of ""the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Barrier. But, now that we are getting on happily towards the gracious time of Christmas, when our hours for debate are limited, and seeing that this matter has now debated on two afternoons, I ask the co-operation of members of the Opposition in trying to get this Bill-whic h we all regard as a 'non-party one-place d upon the statute-book. ""The Governor of New South Wales, who is now invested with the responsibility for the control of Norfolk Island, is anxious that the matter should be settled at once; and I am sure that, the sooner this Bill on to the Senate and placed on the statute-book the better it will be for the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales, which is at present charged the responsibility of controlling the Island. A great deal has been said on this and on other occasions upon the question of leasing Crown lands, but I have always regarded principles in politics as being in capable of being divorced from expediency. We are not dealing with mere ethics. I consider that it would be a misuse of legislation if we put on the statute-book the affirmation of a principle which is in harmony with our beliefs, but utterly out of place in relation to the facts we are dealing with . do not think the question ' of leasehold or freehold as a principle' We are, legitimately arises in connection w it b this Bill . I agree with a great deal that has been said about the possibility of monopoly arising under the freehold system, but since reference has been made to France, I may point out that the population of France is not migratory, but is practically settled, the result being that the freehold system has lasted there; that is to say, thero has been no aggregation of land. There has been to a great extent subdivision beyond what economic principles will justify, which has partly come about through the law of Napoleon, providing that only part of the land can be alienated by the testator, the rest having to go to the other members of the family in proportion. In the same way it will be found that where population is comparatively stationary, or where the habits of the people are not migratory, aggregation and dual ownership do not arise, and the freehold system will last. There are ten or eleven million freeholders in - France, though they are confined to a comparatively small area, and the proportion to . the total population has been practically the same for the last fifty years. I been believe there are about 2,500,000 freeholders in Belguim, and this number has honourable practically stood for twenty years. In Ireland, on the other hand, we have a migratory population. When I left Home there was a stream of emigration amounting to 40,000 annually, there was a good deal of shifting of population, and there was the possible danger, through clearances and sales, of aggregation. In 1881, the Ashbourne Act .we - get recognised that if the freehold was granted absolutely, there might in one or two generations be aggregation, and the legislation then proposed was directed to combat it . It was thought desirable with that there should be a percentage of purchase money by way of charge to the Crown u n t i l the whole of the purchase money had been paid back, on which the interchange of property between the landlords and the tenants took place over a period of fortynine years. I think they called it about 8 per cent, of - the total price of the land which was to be considered as part of the purchase money to be passed over to the Government. However, for reasons into which I need not enter, that pro1 posal was abandoned. Take Australia. If the principle of leasehold is to be tested, surely it should be considered in relation to the facts. I quite understood the question being raised in regard to th© Northern Territory, because there we have practically a clean sheet to deal with . There is not as much settlement there as we would like to have, and there is still a large area which has not been parted with . Again, in the Federal Capital Territory we had. the whole of the land to deal with . We were to get a g if t of the Crown lands, and were to purchase the freeholds already - existence, and it was competent for the Commonwealth, having purchased freeholds, to deal with them as it chose. When these came into the ownership of the Commonwealth we had to deal practically with a territory not one acre of which had been parted with either under leasehold or freehold, and the capital had still to be built , so that there was no question of present unearned increment; it was all a matter of the future. Starting thus with a clean sheet we considered we were free to apply, as a matter of substance, the policy of leasehold as opposed to freehold. I thought so at the time, and I still believe it to be the better principle for the Commonwealth in the circumstances. Most of the territory will be really city land, and the land outside which may be considered fairly spacious to be connected with the central Seat of Government is merely appurtenant to the city. In the case of Washington, Congress has to bear the burden of about onet h i r d of the expenditure, and it seemed to me to be a fair principle for us to apply the leasehold system to our area, to which the whole of the resulting rent on the full taxation basis could be applied at once, without injustice to any one. To-day, however, we are discussing Norfolk Island, and about 1,300 acres of land, 80 per cent, of which is described as hilly, though not bad. Since 1856, the land on Norfolk Island, when it was subdivided, in the time of Governor Denison, of New South Wales, has practically remained in the same ownership. other words, there has been no shifting of ownership so as to lead to aggregation.",39
223,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Do you not anticipate great change in that islaud 1,40
224,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I do not think so. My last words in moving the second reading were that I hoped there would be no exploitation of the people on Norfolk Island. They were shifted from Pitcairn Island on the understanding, as they thought, that they were really to be possessors of Norfolk Island; and it would not do for us to introduce our opinions of commercialism, which really, at the bottom, do not lead to happiness. It would not do for us to allow these people to be exploited by our mistaken notions of economic development from outside. What we can do is to encourage them to make the best use of the country they have some reason, at all events, to conin sider their peculiar domain. We find that the land has remained according to the the original intention for the last fifty years. I have had a list made out of the various holdings on the island. There are very few that run up to 50 acres. At the top there is one holding of 46 acres, next there is a holding of 52 acres, and then there is a whole run of holdings of 10 acres and 4 - acres. I do not know what the average is, but I should guess that it cannot be more than the area allowed to be granted under the law to each person, that is, about 25 acres. That has been practically the position for the last fifty years.",40
225,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"An islander can take up 25 acres if he marries a daughter of the island, but if he marries an outsider he can only get half that area.",40
226,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I do not think there is any provision of thatnature at present. The position is that these lands have been sold, and their sale has not led to aggregation. It is in countries like America and Australia that the freehold system, unchecked, may lead to aggregation, because, when men make a certain amount of money, they sell off, and holdings thus in crease in size. It is against this that a policy of subdivision is directed. But this has not occurred in Norfolk Island, and I do not think it is likely to occur. I do not wish to go deeply into th© quesIn tion. I do not consider this is a legitimate occasion on which to raise it . I prefer to deal with leasehold against freehold on matters of substance, and not on mere abstract theories and prin a ciples.",40
227,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,You could make out a stronger case for freehold if you had not made out a case for leasehold in the past.,40
228,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I have not altered one iota in my views. Granted a field f the operation of the leasehold system, such as is presented by the Federal Terrishould tory, there is a good deal to be said f the leasehold system, and in that case I would give my individual preference Island. for it against the freehold. however, remind my honourable friend that he can gain the end he has in view amendment)-put . by a legitimate system of taxation. The divided. greatest opponent of the abuse of the land system- I refer to Henry Georgedid not believe in leasing. He thought it was a fatuous thing to try to direct from some State Department the conditions ' on which land was to be. held on leasehold tenure. He maintained that Archibald, W. O. we could not in that way prescribe the Arthur, areas or the methods of cultivation, and Burchell, R. J. that we should part with the land Charlton, M . in freehold, and see that the State got Dankel, G. its rights by the imposition of a legiFenton, timate tax. If we do that the bounds of reasonableness, the differFrazer, C. E. ence, having regard to the end in view, is Hannan, J.

I do not wish Groom, L . E. to delay the Committee on this point. Irvine, I ask honourable members to help me to Johnson, W.

Catts, J. H . In addition to that, the measure has Howe, R. really been approved of, after some interWebster, change of correspondence by the Governor Anstey, F . of New South Wales and the Imperial Jensen, J. A.

I do not say that this is likely, but I would - be omitting a duty, as Minister, if I d id not point out that it is possible. Therefore, ask the co-operation of the ' honourable member for Barrier in getting division at once, and I ask this considerao r tion from the point of view that the question of leasing as against freehold not be raised in a matter where o r there is so little substance represented, as is the case in connection with Norfolk I would, Question-That the words proposed to be added be so added (Mr THOMAS' The Committee Ayes ... ... ... 25 Noes ... ... ... 27 Majority AVES.

It is not to be supposed that the free admission of the manufactures of Norfolk Island would ever seriously affect Australia, and, personally, I have no objection to Pree Trade between the Commonwealth and Norfolk Tsland; but can Norfolk Island impose duties against the Commonwealth ?",42

234,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"This Bill , if it became law, could be amended by a later measure.",42
235,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"But I have been in formed that the people of Norfolk Island were not in favour of the transfer of the island to the authority of the Commonwealth, except under the guarantee that they should be free to send their maize and other produce or manufactures to Australia without having to pay duty upon them. The Bill embodies the conditions of an agreement between two parties, the people of the Commonwealth and the people of Norfolk. Island, one of the conditions on which the latter have insisted being that there shall be Free Trade, so far as exportations from the island to Australia are concerned. Consequently, in amending this provision, Parliament would, it seems to me, be guilty of a breach of faith . I would like the opinion of the Minister on the point. Mr ' GLYNN (Angas-Minister of External Affairs) [6.24] - I think it was when the honourable member for Barrier was Minister of External Affairs that the Imperial Government suggested that there should be put into the Acceptance Bill a provision guaranteeing the freedom of exportations from Norfolk Island to Australia, upon which negotiations were suspended for a period of sixteen or seventeen months. I understand that the honourable member was willing to insert the provision in a separate measure, but did not wish to put it into this Bill . That would have been a solution of the difficulty if it had really existed. I think that the Imperial Government were under a misapprehension. I pointed out that we could not insert a provision such as those in our Constitution which bind the people for all time, but that we could accomplish all that was desired if we inserted this clause in the Bill . They asked that it should be put in here, and I put it in ; but it does not bind us, inasmuch as it is not part of an agreement. If it were part of an agreement and had been made a schedule to an AcIn ceptance Bill , as this is, then it would be a contract binding upon us, just as some of the conditions of the acceptance of"" the Northern Territory are binding on the Commonwealth for the reason that they are included in the agreement with South Australia, which is in a schedule to the Northern Territory Acceptance Act. But this is simply a statutory provision by this Parliament, and is capable of being amended by this Parliament.",42
236,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"The honourable member says that if this provision had been made a schedule to the Bill it would have been binding"" upon us?",42
237,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Yes , assuming that the schedule was an agreement expressing the conditions under which the transfer was to take place. But there has been no agreement. The Imperial Government Iiave power to hand over Norfolk Island to us by Order in Council, and the arrangement when we federated was .that instead of the Governor of New South Wales being charged with the administra tion of the island, that charge should be transferred to the Commonwealth, so that all that is necessary is that an Order in but the Government Council shall be issued at Some vesting this island in the Commonwealth. We say in this Bill that we are prepared accept the island, but we are not bound by any clause in it to grant for all time freedom to imports of this class. provision is inserted in the Bill as a ciple that ought to be applied, but not as part of any contract.",42
238,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It will be binding on us. Bill was under consideration.,43
239,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"No . By way of illusof tration, let me point out that in the ral Constitution there are provisions this Parliament can alter. sions declare that "" Until the Parliament otherwise provides,"" such-and-such athing shall be done. All the others are, in effect, contractual provisions between the States and the Commonwealth. But in the Bill before us we have simply acceptance measure, and as soon as the Order in Council is issued at Home^ shall have to proclaim the Act . We beyond that, however, and make certain legislative provisions which we can alter at any time. One of these is that particular products of Norfolk Island, ferred to in this clause, shall be free duty, and they will be free from duty u n t i l we choose to alter that policy.",43
240,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That would mean an think amendment of the Act. The policy could a number of Acts. not be altered by a Tariff Bill 1,43
241,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"It could be. I rose explain this matter, because I know that the honourable member for Barrier, when Minister of External Affairs, was trying very properly, to induce the Imperial vernment not to insist upon this provision being inserted in the Acceptance Bill . Australia. They did not necessarily ask that we should be bound to this for all time; but there was at the time an opinion that it were embodied in the Bill it would have the efficacy of a provision in a Constituof the large native population. tion. That view was not correct. pointed that out and, I think, my con360,000 tention Has been accepted.",43

244,Unknown,Unknown,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.£5 p.m. This Mr TUDOR - I recognise that it prinwould be possible under a Tariff Bill to amend this provision, but it is quitepossible that the existence of this provision might be overlooked when a Tariff By way illustration, I would point - out that Fedeabout the year 1906 the Commonwealth which entered into a preferential agreement Those proviwith South A f r i c a , under which certain preferences were given to goods comingfrom that part of the Empire as against imports from other countries. This,, liowever, was overlooked in the Tariff Bill introduced by the late Sir Willia m Lyne in 1907-8, with the result that ceran tain preferences granted to goods the product of Great Britain are less than we are the preferences granted toproducts go of South Africa . The preference granted to South Africa under the Act introduced by Sir Willia m Lyne distinctly the provided for a percentage reduction on rethe 1902 Tariff, whereas the preferences from granted to the United Kingdom were not provided for until 1907-8. This is a fact that is not generally known. I do not it wise to spread Tariff items over The Minister has assured the Committee that this clause can be altered by any Tariff Bill , and I to bow to his superior legal knowledge; but I doubt whether it would be right to go back upon such a provision by means of , a Tariff Act . The Bill providing for Go the taking over of Papua did not deal with imports from that Territory into",43
245,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"In that case, there, if was the black labour difficulty.",43
246,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"And also the question It is I estimated that there are something like natives in that Territory, and it is quite possible that Papua may produce some of the very products that I think it right that we should give this but in dealing with Tariff matters we must always keep in view the unindustrial conditions prevailing in the in respect of whose products any The community of Norfolk Island is a very small one, and is not engaged in any manufacturing industry. For that reason apparently it (is proposed to grant them a special privilege, but I doubt whether paragraph b, which provides for the free admission of goods ""shipped direct from Norfolk Island to Australia,"" is a wise one. seems to me that such a provision might exclude goods brought to Australia in a vessel which had called at another island on the voyage to this country. Some of the island traders do not follow the direct route. Some may call at Norfolk Tsland on the way out, and not on the return voyage, with the result that goods shipped by such vessels might not be eligible to come in free of duty.",43
247,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,There is no fear in that regard. What would be considered would be the first port of call and the port of destination.,44
248,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The question would not be affected by the vessel calling at intermediate ports?,44
249,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,No ; that point has been decided by the H i gh Court.,44
250,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Anothe r point is that many vessels engaged in the island trade are manned exclusively by black labour, so that it might be said hereafter that, whilst under the Navigation Act we have treated Papua as a Territory outside the Commonwealth altogether, and have excluded it from the advantages that we ex-, tended by that Act to the Northern Territory, we are giving a special privi lege to Norfolk Island, and allowing goods to come in free, although carried in ships manned exclusively by black labour. I doubt the wisdom of this clause. The Minister has not told us of the extent of the trade between Norfolk Island and Australia, nor has he stated whether that trade is likely to increase; but I do not think it is very great. This clause may complicate future Tariff legislation. It would be better to set out plainly in a Tariff schedule the countries to whose products we intend to give a preference. If the Parliament decided, in dealing with such a schedule, that all goods coming from New Zealand, Canada, South Africa , Great Britain , and Norfolk Island should be granted a preference, well and good. But I hope we shall not render it necessary for any one who wishes to ascertain the position in regard to goods coming from Norfolk Island or other places to Australia to have to look up half-a-dozen Acts in order to determine what preferences, if any, - have been granted. I shall be compelled to vote against the clause as it stands.",44
251,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas-Minister of External Affairs) [7.55] - This clause was really accepted by the previous GovernIt ment, and the only question then was whether it should constitute a separate Bill or be placed in this Bill .",44
252,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I prefer to deal with Tariff matters in a Tariff Bill .,44
253,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"As a matter of fact, the only question in the negotiations which were carried on by the late Government was, as I say, whether the clause should form a separate B i ll or be in cluded in this Bill . "" Mr MATHEWS - I thought the question was whether there should be Free Trade in perpetuity or not.",44
254,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The question I have in dicated was the only one on the point discussed in the correspondence. There seemed to be some misapprehension of the effect of putting the clause in this Bill , as it was thought it would fix Free Trade for ever as part of some contract. It does not make the slightest difference, however, whether the clause is put in this Bill or in a separate Bill , because it is not part of the contract under which Norfolk Island is handed over, but is simply a legislative provision made by us as to the conditions under which imports shall be admitted from the island into the Commonwealth. We are actually carrying out what the late Government decided. But on the 13th June, this year, in a despatch from , I think, the Governor of New South Wales, a desire was expressed on behalf of the Imperial Government that we should establish Free Trade-the phrase "" F r e e T r a d e "" was used-wit h Norfolk Island, and in that desire we have concurred, as the late Government would have done, by placing this provision in the Bill . I cannot see how, in framing a new Tariff, there could be any possible embarrassment.",44
255,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,This practically provides for Free Trade in perpetuity.,44
256,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"No; . it does'not do that. The Constitution contains provisions, some of which are fixed u n t i l they are altered by the people and the Parliament, and the reason is that there is no other method; we cannot alter the Constitution except in the way prescribed. This, however, is not a constitutional Act, but merely a legislative Act, and it can be altered by any Tariff . provisions we may make. Por instance, Dicey, in his Law and Constitution, says that if by an error in the Dentist Act the provisions of the Act of Union between Scotland and Great Britain, or between Great Britain and Ireland, were incidentally affected, the repeal would be efficacious, although there was no direct reference to the Dentist Act in the Act of Union. Similarly, if a Tariff Bill is introduced which is inconsistent with the provision in the Bill before us, then the latter, to that extent, is modified; and I hope that the honourable member for Yarra will see that there is really no danger of this matter being affected by the passage of a Tariff Bill. As a matter of fact, there are provisions in all Bills that more or less declare principles; but the method of indexing guides the draftsman as to what provisions he has to have regard toin framing future measures. I hope the clause will be accepted. I am sure that the words "" direct from Norfolk Island "" mean that, although there may be ports of call, the goods must have a clearance from the island to the Commonwealth. If the goods were landed at another port, became mixed up with other goods, and were transhipped, it would be very difficult to identify them, and they would Ipse their character of island imports. It is merely as a precautionary measure that paragraph 6 is inserted.",44
257,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [8.0] Do I understand the Minister of External Affairs to say that this clause absolutely protects Australia from Norfolk Island being made the dumping-ground for goods from other parts of the world, and the transhipment of those goods to our ports?",45
258,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Yes; that is the object of paragraph b.,45
259,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Wilmot) [8.1] Does the Minister of External Affairs say that if we pass this clause, and the Tariff Bill is passed later, this clause may be practically annulled? If so, I do not see that there is any guarantee to the people of Norfolk Island of Pree Trade with the Commonwealth; and I am afraid that the Bill will prove rather a deception. Personally, I am in favour of absolute Free Trade-of encouraging the people of the Territories that we take over, to as much as possible trade with us, and find their markets here. As a matter of fact, I think it would pay Australia if we went a little further, and cultivated friendly relations with more of the islands of the Pacific, not only for our personal benefit, but for the ultimate benefit of the Empire. I should like the Minister to tell ua whether I have understood him aright.",45
260,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Barrier) [8.2] - The explanation of the Minister sounds a little strange to me. I am not questioning the honourable gentleman's interpretation of the clause, but, if it be correct, I cannot understand why, when I , as Minister, was negotiating with the representative of the Imperial authorities, he did not accept this solution. The late Government would have been prepared to bring in this same Bill without clause 15, but, at the same time, we undertook to submit to this House a Bill providing for Free Trade with Norfolk Island. The representative of the Imperial Government, however, did not regard that as sufficient, but desired a clause in this particular Bill, which would then be practically an arrangement entered into between the Norfolk Island people and the Commonwealth, and it could not be altered without the consent of the former.",45
261,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"This is a matter of good faith, and not a matter .of constitutional power.",45
262,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I told honourable members what the technical effect of the clause will be.,45
263,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"During the life of the late Government, there were some authorities who were anxious that we should take over Norfolk Island; and I went to Sydney to discuss the matter with Lord Chelmsford, the Governor of New South Wales, who was representing the Imperial Government and the people of the island. The objection raised to my suggestion, which I have indicated, was that a succeeding Parliament might reverse our policy, and establish Protection as regards Australia; and the people of the island wished to be definitely assured that they would have Pree Trade with Australia for all time- a result whichthey claimed' would be attained by inserting a provision in the Bill. That is why the negotiations failed. It is unfortunate that, during those negotiations,, the view now presented was not set forth r because the Bill could have been introduced into the last Parliament and carried. Lord Chelmsford told me that unless he could assure the people of Norfolk Island that they would have Free Trade for all time, he doubted whether they would be ready or willing to be associated with Australia; and, as I say, if the position, as presented now, had been presented at that time, the Bill could have been introduced months ago. Mr W . H . IRVINE (Flinders-At torney-General) [ 8 . 7 ] - I have no doubt that what the honourable member for Barrier says is quite correct, namely, that Lord Chelmsford objected to Norfolk Island being taken over unless there was, in the most distinct way, recorded in our Statutes the determination that there should be Free Trade. But this is only an obligation of good f a it h , to which we are giving the most solemn record that Parliament can give, namely, in an Act . As I understood him, the Minister of External Affairs meant, in speaking of our constitutional power, vey that this Bill stands on the same basis as any other Bill we may pass. Constitutionally, we might, by a similar B i ll tomorrow, or next session, directly repeal the provision in this Bill , or we might indirectly repeal it by a Tariff Bill . But, of course, it is anticipated that Parliament will not do anything that will be a deliberate breach of an arrangement entered into; to which the Government of New South Wales and the Imperial Government are virtually parties. There are only two ways in which you can give some bond that would prevent this Parliament from doing it . One is, if the transaction were carried through by an Act of the Imperial Parliament, which, of course, we could not alter; another, if it was in some way interpreted by an amendment of our own Constitution, which we could only alter, subject to the particular regulations for amendment; but the other parties, including the I m perial Parliament, have trusted to o.ur good faith as a Commonwealth not to alter the vital terms of an agreement entered into. No Australian Government would think of doing so, and, therefore, the matter might be allowed to pass. There are many other obligations which find their only record in a statutory Act of Parliament, which might technically or constitutionally be repealed the next time, but there is no real fear of anything of the kind happening.",45
264,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [8.12] - There is an element of doubt in the minds of the Committee as to whether the rights of the Norfolk Islanders will be maintained in the event of' this Bill becoming an Act . As far' as I understand the position, it amounts to this: that an agreement has been made with the sanction of the Imperial Government, by which the Norfolk Islanders come under the authority of the Federal Parliament, and to guarantee their rights the last clause in the Bill is inserted. I understand also that if Parliament early next session revised the Tariff, and forgot to put in a clause similar to this, guaranteeing freedom of trade with Norfolk Island, this Act would not be worth the paper it is written on, so far as any guarantee is concerned. I do not think this Parliament can leave the rights of the Norfolk Islanders in such an uncertain position. to con- Mr W . H . IRVINE - Can you suggest anything more that we can do ?",46
265,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"The r e is no shadow of doubt that tliere will be no possibility of the Federal Parliament, whatever' party happens to be on the Treasury bench, failing to honour arrangements that have been made by our predecessors. We know that in the revision of a Tariff feeling runs pretty high. Mr W . H . IRVINE - The only way in which this clause could be overridden would be by an express provision in the Tariff.",46
266,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"If the Attorney General gives me that assurance I shall be satisfied. My experience as a publio man is that, although members have every intention and desire to act honourably, sometimes the ' officers of a Department will alter something, and it escapes the notice of the Minister. It may escape the notice of the Cabinet, and may even pass through Parliament; but if the Attorney-General thinks there is no danger, I am quite satisfied.",46
267,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [8.14] - I should like to hear the Minister of External Affairs again on this matter. He said distinctly that even though this clause remained in the. Bill we could, by the Tariff Act, make the goods of Norfolk Island dutiable. Mr W. H. IRVINE - Yes , if we expressly did so.",46
268,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Would it be a breach of faith? Mr W . H . IBVINE - Absolutely .,47
269,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It would be a breach of f a it h if we did it ; but it is a mistake to mix up Tariff matters in this way, because if we do we shall have exactly the same trouble as we had a few years ago, when in reviewing the T a r if f in .1907-8 we omitted to deal with South A f r i c a , and the preference with that try agreed to in 1906 was not altered. doubt whether half-a-dozen members are aware today that we have two or more distinct Tariff Acts. That is a mistake. We should deal with the question altogether. If we decided to give this concession to any Territor y of the Commonwealth, we should define it definitely in the Tariff Act, and we should then know what we were doing, instead of making provision in this Bill ; because when the Tariff is under consideration, this clause might be overridden. Some persons, might say that it would not matter much, as the population of Norfolk Island is only about 1,000, but it would matter if it were the case of Papua. Mr W . H . IBVINE - Assuming ' that you are right, that is no argument for leaving that clause out of this Bill , though it may be an argument for the inclusion of a similar provision in the Tariff Act.",47
270,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I object to cutting up our Tariff, and having to look for Tariff matters in a number of different Acts. In accepting this island the clause could be left in , but it can only remain there until we have amended the Tariff. Our hands are tied at the present time. do not know how much say the Norfolk Islanders have had in this matter, but I presume that the representative of the Imperial Government in New South Wales has dealt witli this point on their behalf. Tliere is no doubt that the Norfolk Islanders will have just as good treatment fro m the Commonwealth as they had from New South Wales; but we should know what we are committing ourselves to.",47
271,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Angas-Minister of External Affairs) [8.16] - This is simply a legislative provision which we can alter.,47
272,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"If we were to alter it , it would be a breach of f a it h.",47
273,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I have referred to correspondence that took place with the Colonial Secretary regarding Free Trade for the products of Norfolk Island. In order to accord them Free Trade, this method was arranged. At the same time it was my duty to point out to the House, and to those responsible for the transfer, that, this being merely a legislative provision, it was obligatory only on the conscience of Parliament, and that we could at any time afterwards alter it : Honourable members opposite want to accomcounplish this purpose in a way not asked I for by the Imperial Government, by means of a separate Bill , so as to emphasize the power and indicate the probability of altering it afterwards.",47
274,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Any Parliament in the future could do so without a breach of faith.,47
275,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The Imperial Government haye asked for it in this way, so that it would have more the colour of a sort of understanding or agreement. If it were put in as a separate Bill there would be no understanding about the matter at all. We could alter it , not as a matter of technical power, but as a sort of declaration of the principle upon which we took it over, that we might at any time without any complaint make the alteration.",47
276,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Without any breach of faith ?,47
277,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"There is no breach of f a it h, except with the Imperial Government. The Norfolk Island people have not raised the question at all. It was pointed out in the report of the Commission that sat a few years ago in connection with Norfolk Island, that it was aconsiderable obstacle to the developI ment of the island that certain duties were imposed under the Australian Tariff. That obstacle, at the request of the Imperial Government, has been removed, and this Bill , with this clause in it , was submitted for approval, and has been accepted, and I ask the Committee in the circumstances, knowing exactly what the technical power is, and knowing the existence of a sort of moral understanding, to leave the clause as it stands. I cannot see how any confusion can arise in the passing of a Tariff Act from the fact that this clause is here. It restrains the hands of the Executive to some extent. It is a sort of direction by this Parliament to those responsible for framing Orders in Council that they are not to frame any Orders in Council in consistent with the provisions of this clause, that is, that no Order in Council, even though constitutional, which is in consistent with the principle of free im ports, will have any validity. Clause agreed to.",47
278,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Brisbane) [8.22]. - I move That the following new clause be inserted :"" The manufacture, importation, and sale of alcoholic liquors for beverage purposes is hibited."" Honourable members will have no difficulty in understanding the scope and intention of this proposal. It is complete, sharp, and to the point. notice that I qualify the prohibition inserting the words "" for beverage pur; to prohibit importations. poses."" That will leave importation, manufacture, and sale for medical and scientific purposes entirely free if replete quired. I am prepared to give that contions. cession to those who still hold the old belief as to the virtues of alcohol as a medicine, although it is banished as a medicine from the most advanced hosto pitals and medical institutions, and abandoned by the great bulk of the medisome cal profession. hard, and even honourable members may not be disposed to change their opinions this matter too quickly. The clause before the Committee is the most up-toPitcairn date, the only effective and the very best possible way. to secure a permanent satisfactory development of the island i the best sense. Honourable members will be_interested to know the present position. The present position was outlined by Minister of External Affairs in his speech on the second reading of the Bill i following terms2. All beer, wines, and spirits landed part of Norfolk Island shall be consigned or to the care of, the Chief Magistrate? and will , on landing, be taken possession of and will not be issued by him except in pursuance of a permit. 3. Permits may be granted either for ply of liquor to be issued by the Chief .Magisand trate on demand by the holder of the permit, for the periodical supply of liquor to be so issued in small quantities to such holder period not exceeding one month. 5. Permits to the Melanesian Mission the Cable Station will be granted only on the condition that liquor shall not be supplied any person not being a member of the mission, or permanently employed in the mission or cable station. The heads of the mission and of cable station respectively will be responsible for the observance of this regulation. 8. Permits to persons other than the Melanesian Mission or Cable Station will only be granted on and in accordance with a certificate signed by the Government Medical Officer in charge that the liquor is required for medical purposes only, in case of sickness, old'age, or other debility. The Minister said that it practically amounted to the existence of a teetotal island. Some time ago the Bight Reverend Dr Wood, Bishop of Melanesia, addressing a meeting of a Church Congress in Brisbane, referred to the same matter, proand said that at the present time Norfolk Island is practically a teetotal island. I am, therefore, at once faced with the obvious retort, "" Why are you not satisfied* short, with the existing condition of affairs 1""-"" They w i ll My proposal is not to alter the existby ing condition of affairs further thanThe manufacture is not specifically prohibited! now, but the Chief Magistrate has comcontrol in connection with imporfc'a-: But we are looking forward to considerable development in Norfolk Island. Public attention has been called 'it by the debate on this Bill in a manner which will inevitably bring about attempts to develop the resourcesStill, old beliefs die of the island. The present population is; limited to 987 people, who are mostly/ in descendants of the mutineers of the' put Bounty, who, in 1856, were removed from Island to Norfolk Island in order to provide more room for their accommoand dation. They are the descendants of n British sailors concerned in the mutiny of the Bounty and Tahitian women, and, therefore, are not exactly on a level with the ordinary Australians. Honourable members will notice that in this Bill we are n the adopting throughout a sort of paternal oversight of the Norfolk Islanders. I conon any tend that there is no way in which we to, can more certainly safeguard their in terests, and secure their best development, by him, than by protecting them against the evils of the consumption of alcoholic liquor. By the supevery law of civilization, every record every report, and every experience of or the world, drink is admitted to be the for a greatest disturbing, irritating, and degrading influence that can enter into any and to country. May I give the Committee one Dp or two illustrations. There are many illustrations which can be quoted from all parts, of the world of the satisfactory rethe sults which have followed from the prohibition of alcoholic liquors. I may particularly refer to the island of Iceland, which, because of its isolation and the fact that it is so largely self-contained, is an =apt illustration wben we are dealing with Norfolk Island. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports suggests that people cannot do without - liquor in Iceland. That is in accord with the old and exploded idea that when you are hot you should take liquor to make yourself cold, when you are cold to make yourself hot, when you are ill to make yourself well, and wheu you are well it makes you ill . Such ideas are now exploded, and in this matter the honourable member is decidedly a back number. Let me give honourable members the experience of the people of Iceland, as set out in Prohibition Advance in all Lands, by Guy Hayler, president of the International Prohibition Federation. I find that the population of Iceland in 1911 was 85,089, of whom 7,500 were located in the capital city. Some time ago a law was passed prohibiting the manufacture of intoxicating liquors. In 1905 a Bill was introduced prohibiting entirely the importation and sale of liquor. The. Committee appointed to consider the Bill made certain recommendations. The first will be found to be rather interesting-The Committee which was appointed to consider this Bill is in harmony with the idea that the use of intoxicating liquors is of no advantage to society; hut, on the other hand, causes great misery, as it is generally accompanied by squandering money, loss of work, poor health, and offences against decency and morals to a great extent when the community as a whole is considered. I do not intend to quote the whole of the particulars in connection with this matter, bift I may inform honourable members that the Bill was introduced after a plebiscite vote had been taken of the in habitants of the island. It prohibited the manufacture, importation, and sale of in toxicating liquors which contained more than 2 per cent, of alcohol. was passed I find thatA deputation was appointed to wait upon the King of Denmark to secure His Majesty's approval of the new law. It has been stated in the public press that when the Bill was presented. for his signature the King said"" Few, if any of my actions King, have given me more satisfaction than that of signing the prohibition law for Iceland, and if the Parliament Denmark will pass a similar law I be more willing yet to approve."" When prohibition became certain of being adopted, the State Minister resigned, declaring that, in his opinion"" If the law is passed it will be impossible to enforce it."" Mr Finlayson. The King accepted the resignation, and appointed a Good Templar, Mr Bjorn Jonssen, to fill the vacancy. In taking up the office of Prime Minister, Mr Jonssen declared"" I hope, that prohibition will be the first law I shall have to sign as Minister."" And it was.",48
279,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,He must be a brother of the honourable member.,49
280,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Yes , he is. Perhaps the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will be interested to know that not only in Iceland, but in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the northern European countries the movement towards prohibition is more pronounced than in any other part of Europe. Only a few weeks ago both Houses of the Swedish Parliament passed a Bill prohibiting the presence of alcoholic liquors in the Swedish Parliament House. It has been suggested that the letters I.O.G.T . should be placed over the doors of ""the Swedish Parliament House - I wish we could look forward to a similarly satisfactory state of affairs in Melbourne. This action has placed the Swedish Parliament amongst the most advanced and progressive Parliaments in the world. To come a little nearer home, I may remind honourable members that in connection with the Papua (British New Guinea) Bill , this House discussed a prohibition provision in almost identical terms with that which I have moved. In 1904, this Parliament passed a Bill for the taking over of the Territory of Papua almost in exactly the same way as we are in this Bill proposing to take over Norfolk Island. Honourable members will find at page 6518 of Hansard for 1904 that Mr Mauger, who was then member for Melbourne Ports-and here is an example for the present member-move d that the following new clause be inserted in the Papua (British New Guinea) Bill When it No intoxicants or opium shall be allowed to be imported into, or manufactured, or sold, or otherwise disposed of in the Territory, except for medicinal purposes, to be dispensed on the - order of a medical practitioner, or person duly authorized by the Lieutenant-Governor, and any Ordinance passed before the commencement of this Act providing for such introduction or sale since I became is hereby repealed. The debate on that motion is well known of to most honourable members, and I think shall I shall content myself with directing their attention to the division that took place upon it after two amendments had been disposed of.

284,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"No ; the House Representatives was in a more accommoand dating mood in those days. The Senate's amendment was accepted, and the local option provision is now the law in Territory of Papua. One matter which area. I should like to refer to in this connection is that the clause was defeated because some of those who voted against Senate were influenced by certain statements made by missionaries in Papua. Was actively interested in temperance work in Brisbane at the time, and i with feelings of pain and regret that read the accounts of the attitude taken up by the missionaries. first time. I entered into serious corresponfacts dence on public questions. I got into respondence with Bishop Stone-Wigg, was then Bishop of Papua, arid I found, my amazement, that the missionaries, almost the whole of the religious leaders roborative of statements honin Papua at the time, were against the idea of prohibition, on the antediluvian in ground that it wo aid encourage smugThat is an argument which we always hear, but Johnit is not borne out by facts.",50
285,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,It is rampant in New,50
286,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"I am glad that interjection was made, and I shall deal with it straight away. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports suggests that sly-grog selling is rampant in New Zealand. The facts are that the amount drink consumed in no licence areas is in the proportion of one to sixteen compared with the amount consumed in licensed areas. The honourable member is evidently not aware of the fact that the no-licence provisions in operation in New deal only with the retail sales. The manufacture and importation into those districts is still unaffected. HonorM . able members must admit, if they are D . willing to be fair in the matter, that, where you do not prevent importation, prohibition district can be entirely free from the consumption of alcoholic liquors. The American prohibition States are faced with exactly the same difficulty. supAlthough quite a number of them have, by local option provisions, banished the of liquor from their territories, the American Constitution-whic h is practii n cally the same as ours, and, because of that, similar results will follow here bydisand-by-place s no limitation upon liquor the passing from one State into another. Where you have no-licence or prohibition, and, running side by side, a licensed of area in which drink can be freely sold, there is no law to prohibit drink being taken from one place to the other, you can expect no other result than that the drink will be found in the prohibition",50
287,Mr WEST,Unknown,The people all leave the it in the prohibition areas.,50
288,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"That interjection I only shows a lamentable ignorance of the facts. I may give the honourable member t was for East Sydney an illustration: Some I years ago, the Queensland Government sent the senior police magistrate of BrisThat was the bane to New Zealand to find out all the in connection with no-licence and corprohibition in the Dominion, because who they had in contemplation the introduction to of a Licensing Bill in the State Parliaand ment. This statement, which was only corof others who investigated it , and has since been corroborated by others who have freely and honestly investigated it , was that in the no-licence areas population had grown, business increased, the condition of the people bettered, and crime decreased until, in some cases, the gaols stood practically empty all the year round. But how could it possibly be otherwise? The law that affects the individual is in a degree exactly the same law that affects the nation or a district. There is no man who knows anything about the effect; of alcohol on individuals but must admit that it has a damaging and deteriorating influence, and that when a man in his individual capacity becomes a prohibitionist, he immediately begins to improve in every respect. What is true of the individual is true, in a larger degree, of a community. But I am very anxious to confine my remarks to Norfolk Island, and I invite the attention of honourable members to this report on Pitcairn IslandIn 1789 the mutiny of the Bounty took place, and Fletcher Christian, a young man, who was one of the leaders, eventually settled with a and of their style of life. number of the mutineers on the Pitcairn Island. One of the first enactments adopted by this of mutineers was the following :"" No person or persons shall be allowed to get spirits of any sort from any vessel. Island it is tenantless. No intoxicating liquors whatever be allowed to be taken on shore, for medicinal purposes."" I ask for nothing more than that Parliato ment shall allow the descendants of the Pitcairn Islanders to be in exactly the same position as they were in at first. The island was visited at various times, several captains of British ships reported progress of this small community, living without the use of intoxicating liquors. One officer states"" The agility and strength of these natives prohibition inserted in the Bill. were so great that the stoutest and expert English sailors were no match them in wrestljng and boxing."" Captain Worth, who visited Pitcairn in states"" I never was so gratified as by my visit, and would rather have gone there to any part of the world. They the most interesting, contented, happy people that can be conceived. comfort, peace, strict morality, industry, excessive cleanliness and ness apparent about them, were such as I was not prepared to witness; their learning and attainments education and information are astonishing ; the men and women are a fine total abstainers. race, and their manners are of a really superior order-eve r smiling ous; but one mind and one wish seemed Mr Finlayson. to actuate them all. Crime appears to be unknown; and if there is really true happiness on earth, it is surely theirs. The island is romantic and beautiful; the soil of the richest description, yielding almost every f r u it and vegetable. In short, it is a little Paradise."" The island has been visited many times since then, and-all who go to see the descendants of the mutineers of the Bounty marvel at the order, happiness, and prosperity which abounds among the people. The fact is sometimes overlooked that for nearly 125 years Pitcairn Island has been under entire prohibition of the liquor traffic thoroughly enforced. It is on behalf of the descendants of these Pitcairn Islanders, who are now passing under' our control, and for whom we shall Fe morally responsible, that I make this proposition. It seems that they have not yet taken to the use of intoxicating beverages, arid it is our duty to protect them, and give them every opportunity to protect themselves. If honourable members will look at page 2143 of this session's Hansard, they will find a very fine description, given by the Minister of External Affairs, of the character of the inhabitants of the. island, They are practically an innocent people; they have band no open sale of liquor, and they are free from crime; if there is a gaol on Norfolk It is no mere shall coincidence, the absence of liquor and the unless absence of crime; it is one of the facts of every-day life. If we wish the island be developed on the very best lines, and if we desire to do the very best we can for these people for. whom we are making ourselves responsible, I know of no better when way than by securing for the islanders the that intoxicating liquors shall not be allowed to interfere with their well-being. I am asked why I desire to have this The most matter is at present covered by Ordinance, for and it is entirely at the option of the chief magistrate to decide what shall be 1848, imported, and what shall be done with what is imported. We may be fortunate than in having a chief magistrate who may are properly interpret the ideas of the Comand monwealth Parliament in regard to this The matter, just as we have been particularly neatand peculiarly fortunate in the men we really have in charge in Papua-Judg e Murray, the Governor, and Mr Staniforth Smith, in general the Administrator, both of whom are But there is always the possibility of the chief magistrate in and joyNorfolk Island; in the absence of any statutory limitation, abandoning the ideas in the minds of honourable members, and we might have the danger in a very active form before there is opportunity to remedy it or stop it . I am sure that honourable members on both sides of the House are anxious to do the best they can for Norfolk Island, and I suggest that the best place for this prohibition is in this Bill ; because it will give the matter permanence, and prevent any unwarrantable interference of a temporary character by a temporary official. The House willingly and cheerfully accepted responsibility, in the same respect, with regard to Papua, and the need is just as great in regard to Norfolk Island. If we had this consideration for an Inferior race in the case of Papua- I say it without disrespect; because I have a very high esteem for the character of the Papuans-ther e is greater need for the protection of the - race now inhabiting Norfolk Island.",50
289,Mr RILEY,Unknown,They have too much sense to touch liquor.,52
290,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"It is not because there have not been plenty to tempt them that they are free from this curse. say it is one of the greatest <jharges that can be laid against the British, as colonisers, that at every opportunity we have had to colonise, along with the officials, missionaries, and traders, we have sent the things that isnd to r u in and disgrace those in the colonies we seek to establish. The very ships that take the missionaries and the Bibles take the gin. In conclusion, I say that the Commonwealth should accept this responsibility in regard to Norfolk Island* We should do our best for the islanders, and take away from them any temptation to degrade themselves by the use of alcoholic liquor.",52
291,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [8.53] Though I believe in the use of all things, and the abuse of nothing; though I recognise, from much personal experience, that over-eating kills perliaps as many as over-drinking, and that the Almighty never sent a curse upon the earth per se, I support the proposed clause, because it is the abuse of what otherwise would be useful that makes it a curse, a danger, and a poison. Norfolk Island was designed by Queen Victoria, on the advice of the Colonial Office of the day, to test a new system of _ land tenure, which, though it was not as advanced as the land tenure system of Hong Kong, was sufficiently advanced. .However, it was crippled and destroyed by the in justice of the New South Wales Government, and for that reason I vote for the honourable member's proposal, though, in other cases, I may be against the principle embodied in it . It was one of the laws the Pitcairn Islanders wished to have implanted in their Constitution-the y were a patriarchal people, electing their own . patriarchs-bu t that did not suit the' governing powers, and the official authorized to control them drew a salary almost equal to the combined incomes of the whole community. These islanders are an in teresting people; they are absolutely the finest boatmen of the Southern Seas. One must have great admiration for the way in which they manipulate their boats through the coral reefs. I hope the clause will be carried, because, with Free Trade, the consumption of liquor is unpreventible when a prohibition State is near to another State where there is free sale of liquor. It is pleasing to hear these islanders talk. I Tlieir English is spoken so softly and sweetly that it rivals Italian. They take their tongue from their English fathers, and the soft vowel sounds from their South Sea mothers. Even today these people, white as we are - the tinge of the Southern Seas has almost disappeared from their skinsspeak the English tongue with a soft accent, and have also their own patois. I regret that they have not been allowed the system of land tenure originally in tended by the British Government.",52
292,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member will not be in order in going into that matter.,52
293,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"It is recognised by every authority who has investigated the subject that the progeny of a mixed parentage, coloured and white, is more prone to alcoholic excess than those of pure blood of either parent race. For that reason alone, I should like the Government-if Ministers can see their way clear to do so-to accept the amendment, and thus to render a great benefit to the inhabitants of one of the most interesting islands in the Southern Seas.",52
294,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas-Minister of External Affairs) [8.57] - The honourable member for Brisbane has put his case very fairly, but I may be excused if I repeat a few considerations which I think should operate with him in withdrawing the amendment. If there is one place in which the use of liquor is restricted, it is Norfolk Island. The honourable member spoke of the position of affairs at Pitcairn Island. There seems to have been established a perfect Eden of contentment at Pitcairn Island u n t i l , about the beginning of last century, the usual troubles arose from various causes, such as the inevitable beauty of the female, and the over-susceptibility of the male, and the consolation sought for disappointment in drink. At that time, there was no restriction on the importation of liquor, and there was distilled locally a beverage which had probably twice the intoxicating power of ordinary spirituous liquor. I , like the honourable member for Brisbane, am a teetotaller, and accept everything he said in favour of total abstinence. If one wants to be young' throughout his life, as the honourable member for Brisbane is, he should be, like him, a teetotaller.",52
295,Mr RODGEKS,Unknown,And miss f u n.,53
296,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"D r in k is the anodyne of misery with which some of us are not troubled. About 1896, special arrangements were made regarding the distribution of liquor at Norfolk Island. distribution had to be through the Chief Magistrate, and under a regulation made in 1894, and set out at length in my second-reading speech, no liquor can now be imported that is not consigned to the special magistrate. What liquor ported is not sold; it is only supplied on special terms to the Melanesian Mission, which I do not suppose consumes much.",53
297,Mr WEST,Unknown,The honourable member does not know.,53
298,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I think that I do. had the pleasure of receiving a call from some of the missionaries at my private residence; and, from what I have seen and heard, I do not think there is likely to be any abuse of the exception made in regard to the mission. Another exception is made in favour of the employees of the Pacific Cable Company at Anson Bay. These persons number about ten or eleven, and, like all officials of cable companies, are constantly being changed. I do not think that the Imperial Government would like the special exemption that is made in favour of these employees - and which has been stringently adhered to-f o be neutralized by us.",53
299,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Surely the Imperial Government is not interfering in this matter.,53
300,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"It is not. But, if we made this alteration without communicating with it on the subject, there might be some little trouble, though I do not anticipate any.",53
301,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Surely the honourable member does not put forward that argument seriously.,53
302,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I do not submit it too emphatically, but I put it seriously, because I do not want to offend the company. I have heard that it might produce some trouble if an absolute ban were placed ou all importation of liquor in connection with the settlement afc An son Bay. The people there are supplied with liquor only through the Government Resident. Permits are granted only for a month, with all sorts of restrictions against any breach of the privileges given. a lot of No liquor is sold for any other purpose than to use in case of sickness, though I agree with the honourable member for Brisbane that the old contention that liquor could do great good in sickness has been abandoned. I have read what Sir Henry Thompson wrote on the subject The twenty-six years ago. Everything that the honourable member for Brisbane desires, except so far as the Melanesian Mission - and the Cable Station are concerned, is already .accomplished; and there is no sale of is i m - liquor in Norfolk Island. There may be manufacture; and, if there is any merit at all in this proposal, and it relates only to that, I am afraid that were the amendment agreed to, it might give an implied permission to sell. It provides that there I shall be no sale for beverage purposes, which implies permission to sell for other purposes. But once a man gets a bottle in his hand, I do not think he is particular about what he does with it . The consumption of liquor is not dealt with , so that if a man can get liquor for other than beverage purposes there wil l be nothing to prevent him from drinking it . I suggest that we should leave well alone. Norfolk Island is practically teetotal already, and there is no manufacture of liquor there. But, should there be danger of that, we can prevent it. I suggest that this matter should be considered in connection with a Bill for the administration of the island, which must be introduced in due course, and we can then deal with it in the light of experience. I cannot see strong reason for objecting to the prohibition of the manufacture of liquor if there should be a possibility of liquor being manufactured to defeat the prohibition directed against its importation. Norfolk Island is not the place to apply the provisions which are incorporated in the Papuan legislation. In Papua there are between 300,000 and 400,000 natives. There provision has been made for local option. were licences and permits existing when Papua was transferred to the Commonwealth, and we provided that, except as regards them, no licences should be granted except under the lpcal option provisions. In Norfolk Island there are no natives; no members of a subject or subordinate race. I trust that these distinctions will be recognised, and that the amendment will be withdrawn. I promise that, should it be in my power, and should there be a danger of manufacture defeating the practical prohibition and importation of liquor,' I shall introduce legislation dealing with the subject.",53

304,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,The member would not trust a Labour substitute.,54
305,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"- I would, if he were to be the honourable member for* Brisbane. Whenever a proposal of this kind is made, we are told' that the time for it is not opportune. I remember the debate on the liquor question in regard to Papua. Prohibition was moved for, and carried, the honourable member for Pranklin and myself successfully taking a hand in the matter; but the remarkable thing was that those representing the temperance societies afterwards backed down on prohibition, and went for local option in - stead. They first denounced local option, and were in favour of prohibition, but when next the matter came up, they favoured local option and denounced prohibition.",54
306,Mr WEST,Unknown,The teetotallers always vote for the brewers in New South Walea.,54
307,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I do not know as to that ; but they religiously issue a manifesto .against me at each election, though that is neither here nor there. In Papua, it is true, we had between 300,000 and 350,000 natives to protect; but the missionaries were those who endeavoured to prevent! the carrying of prohibition, and were its strongest opponents. I have no reason to doubt what the Minister has said about the state of things in Norfolk Island, and if very little liquor is drunk there, that is a There good reason for agreeing to the amendment, because it will give effect to a principle without causing much inconvenience. The Minister spoke of the exemption given to the officials of the Cable Company, and suggested that we might offend the I m perial authorities by removing it . But I trust that that sort of argument will not be used in our debates, though I have heard it used before. The thing is either right or wrong. If it is right, we should not be afraid to do it , but if it is wrong, we should not do it .",54
308,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Melbourne Ports) [9.9] - It requires a good deal of courage to oppose a proposal of the kind before the Committee; but I have always considered the liquor question as one to be dealt with by those mostly concerned. The people of Norfolk Island are as civilized as we are.,54
309,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,More so; because they have very little to do with drink.,54
310,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Possibly . H a d honourable the honourable member for Brisbane attempted to insert in the Bill a provision enabling the Norfolk Islanders to pass a law dealing with the sale and distribution of liquor, I should have supported his proposal.",54
311,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Loca l option?,54
312,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Exactly . The honourable member for Brisbane talks as do a few more members of the Water L i l y Church, and I listen to him with admiration and awe when he is dealing with the liquor question. But he has. used to-night arguments that I heard more than ten years ago, and which I have used myself. The peculiarity of the. advocates of prohibition is that when you put it to them that other people have a righ t to choose their own course they will invariably reply, ""Yes, but we want to save the children."" Thevwant to save other people's children, but they would object to anybody laying down a line of conduct for their own children to follow. There may be people in Norfolk Island who, unlike the honourable member for Brisbane, are civilized, and feel that on occasions a little alcoholic liquor does them good. The residents of the island ought to be allowed to decide for themselves whether alcoholic liquor shall be sold there.",54
313,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Did not the honourable member vote a little while ago for an amendment which would have taken from the people of Norfolk Island the right to determine how the Crown lands there should be disposed of?,55
314,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"That question has nothing in common with the point now under consideration. The arguments in favour of prohibition have long since been wiped out, and I do not propose to discuss them. The point that I wish to make is, that we have no right to determine whether or not the people of Norfolk Island shall be able to obtain alcoholic drinks. They are not savages. When I visited Papua some time ago, I felt that the Parliament of Australia had conferred a benefit on the Papuans by keeping alcohol out of their reach. But whereas the Papuans are savages, the people of Norfolk Island are not. As a matter of common decency, the honourable member for Brisbane should allow them to decide for themselves whether or not prohibition shall, be enforced. The talk about our having a sort of fatherly in terest in these people is like some more of the temperance clap-trap that we 'have heard. I care not whether honourable members are abstainers or moderate drinkers-who , according to the temperance people, are the greatest enemies of humanity-o r whether they like to have a "" stick "" in the water they drink. I hold that it is not fair ""for us to arrogate to ourselves the right to determine what the people of Norfolk Island shall drink. Give them local option, so that they may decide for themselves whether prohibition shall prevail in the island or not.",55
315,Mr DANKEL,Unknown,"Boothby) [9.16] - As we have been assured by the Minister that there is practically no sale of liquor in Norfolk Island at the present time, I think that we ought to leave well alone, and refrain from inserting in the Bill this proposed new clause. I can speak from personal experience of the benefit or otherwise of alcoholic liquors. For five long and weary year3 I was a teetotaller. H a d I remained one I should not have been here today; a wooden box would have had me long ago. I am always prepared to give the people of any locality the free and unrestricted right to decide for themselves whether alcoholic liquors should or should not be sold there. I do not think it would be well for a race if strong liquor were absolutely done away with, not for a generation, but through the centuries. If it were true that the consumption of strong liquor degenerates a race, then there, would not be one of us here today. Who were heavier drinkers than the old Anglo-Saxons? They drank long, and they drank well.",55
316,Mr BUBCHELL,Unknown,And often.,55
317,Mr DANKEL,Unknown,"And often. The reason why I never have voted and never shall vote for prohibition is that I do not believe that the race would be as good as it is physically today if strong liquor were totally abolished. Prom a physical stand-point the teetotal races, wherever they may be found, cannot compare even distantly with the people of those countries where alcoholic liquors have been consumed for some time. It is all very well to speak of what a difference has been made in some of the northern European countries by the in troduction of prohibition; but the few years during which the system has been in operation offer us no criterion as to its value or otherwise. It must take a long time to establish or disestablish such a fact. I hold that the people should have an opportunity to determine this matter for themselves. If the majority of the people of Norfolk Island say they want liquor let them have it , and if the majority say that they do not want it let them do without it .",55
318,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"Fremantle) [9.20]. - I believe that the proposed new clause ought to be agreed to, in view of the fact that for the last nine years the principle of prohibition has been practically in operation in Norfolk Island. I was rather impressed by some of the arguments used by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, but it seemed to me that he could have assisted his case to a very great extent had he been in a position to say that the people of the island had revolted against the existing conditions. The - fact that, to the best of our knowledge, they have uot done so should be a sufficient in dication that they are prepared to conthe House. tinue those conditions. I feel, fore, that it would be in the best i terests of these people to protect them from the evils arising fro m the drink traffic, which we see manifested elseduced where.",55
319,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [9.22J. - I shall support the proposed new clause. If any argument were necesI sary to urge upon honourable members Brisbane on the present occasion. the wisdom of adopting this provision, it would be found in the speeches dethemselves livered by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable will member for Boothby. When Norfolk commodities.

332,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"What about the local Mr Glynn.""- I think it is inapplicable. There are now only three or four families on the - island, and they are practically all inter-related. Originally, in 1856, thero was only one survivor of the Pitcairn Islanders, and he most heroically took charge of all the children. If local option is introduced, there will be brought in the pernicious principle of some line of division amongst the people there; and I do not think that we ought, without necessity, to so interfere in the lives of a comparatively happy people. We do not prohibit the manufacture of liquor now; and it was the manufacture, 1 understand, that caused trouble on the Pitcairn Island. There is no manufacture at present, but there may be; and, in order to make the principle of the existing law complete, I will go the length of the amendment in regard to manufacture, and suggest that we should prevent it ; and also prevent, not merely the sale, but the supply, which is something different, except in accordance with the existing laws. There is no liquor sold at all, except at the Mission Station and to the few people employed by the Pacific Cable Board, and they are under stringent regulations. I suggest that there should be an amendment prohibiting the manufacture, except in accordance with the provision of the laws at present in force in Norfolk Island.",56

I ask the honourable member for - Brisbane to accept my suggestion for the present, in view of the fact that we shall have another opportunity of testing whether any liquor shall be manufactured or sold on the island. Possibly, I should be found voting for a prohibition proposal if the occasion were ripe; but I do not believe that it is at present.",57
341,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,I wish to give the people the right of ruling themselves in this matter.,57
342,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Would the honourable member attempt to sow the seeds of political discord in a family of fifteen or sixteen people? - Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta - Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [9.34] - I should'like to say A word or two on this important question, for it is important, as affecting the outlying Territories of the Commonwealth. We should recollect that this is not an enacting Bill, but really a Constitution under which the island is to be governed', and which will enable the islanders to govern themselves in the future, and make what laws they desire. The suggestion of the Minister of External A f fairs represents the only practical prohibition we can have for Norfolk Island. The honourable member for Brisbane may pass his declaratory proposal, but it will prove an empty thing when he has done so. There are no penal provisions, and he cannot guarantee that the proposed law will be carried out. Under the system suggested by the Minister of External Affairs, however, the Resident would have thrown on him the responsibility for the government of the island, and to him every drop of grog would have to be consigned. This seems to me the most effectual way of preventing the indiscriminate spread of liquor, and would certainly be much better than an empty declaration. If the honourable member for Brisbane is sincere, he will jump at the suggestion of the Minister, which, as I say, places on the Resident the obligation to see that the people do not get liquor except for medicinal purposes",57
343,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Would not the amendment of the honourable member for Brisbane place the obligation on the Resident?,57
344,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Not directly; he is mentioned specifically in the proposal of the Minister. If the honourable member for Brisbane does not go further than his amendment, we shall see that, inasmuch as there are people on the island who desire liquor, smuggling will begin. We are told by honourable members opposite that smuggling is going on in Papua in spite of the prohibition provisions; and I suggest that we should do something more practical.",57
345,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Brisbane) [9.37] I have to thank the Prime Minister for providing one of the most valid arguments that has yet been advanced in favour of my amendment. The honourable gentleman says that we cannot guarantee that the clause would be enforced, and he draws a contrast between my proposal and the suggestion of the Minister in order to support his contention. Who is to be tn charge of the enforcement of the laws on Norfolk Island? The same Chief Magistrate who has charge of one law will have charge of another, and the suggestion that he will enforce one and not the other is not an argument calculated to induce us to giv.e the Government any powers in this Bill . The Prime Minister suggests that smuggling goes on, not in spite of prohibition, but because of prohibition. Well, in the Commonwealth the introduction of opium is forbidden, and we are trying hard to establish that proper attitude that ought to have been established years ago by the civilized communities of the world. We know, however, that opium is being smuggled into Australia; but does the Prime Minister suggest, therefore, that the prohibition has failed, and that it should not be made as effective as possible?",58
346,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Nobod y has gested that it has failed.,58
347,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,It is the same argument exactly.,58
348,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Nonsense !,58
349,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"The fact that there is smuggling is no reason for the abandonment of prohibition, but is a reason for its enforcement. The failure of prohibition in regard to opium and everything else is due to maladministration rather than to any f a u l t in the law. The Minister has told us that later on we are to have an administration Bill in which we shall be able to insert provision to guarantee the prohibition; but my amendment is definite, complete, and plain, with no chance of any misunderstanding as to its intention. It would be the duty of the Chief Magistrate and of every official to see that the law was carried out, and if smuggling occurred, we should have to inquire what was wrong with the administration.",58
350,Mr AHERN,Unknown,What are the penalties?,58
351,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,They will be provided for in the administration Bill that is promised.,58
352,Mr AHERN,Unknown,Then the amendment will be ineffective until that Bill is passed?,58
353,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"No more ineffective than all the .other provisions of the Bill dealing with land, Free Trade, and so for t h. In this Bill we are laying down general principles, and I framed my amendment merely to cover the ground, without attempting to deal with details. I appreciate the evident intention of the Minister of External Affairs to meet the position, and no one .doubts his candour and sincerity. I cannot, however, accept the suggestion the honourable gentleman has offered, though, probably, as a secondbest proposal it might be very useful. But the honourable gentleman seems anxious to preserve some privileges enjoyed by the Mission and the Cable Station people, representing probably not more than a score of the residents. The difficulty I find in accepting the suggestion is that it proposes to sacrifice the best interests of 960 people for the doubtful advantage of a few. I am not at all i m pressed with the argument that the I m perial Government might take exception to the proposal. The same argument has been.used in other connexions; but having regard to the trend of the thought of the world today, and the King' s attitude sug- on the liquor question, the Imperial Parl i a m e n t would be the last place in which to expect any opposition in regard to protecting natives from the ravages of alcohol. The Minister of External Affairs has said that in the early days Pitcairn Island was a perfect Eden. I have already read an extract from a report on the island in those days, and I ask honourable members to take note of the - one fact that, whatever there was there to make it worthy of the description, was due entirely to the absolute .absence of in toxicating liquor. There was no compromise, no possible loophole; and there was no smuggling of any - kind. All I suggest is that we should insert that first principle, and repeat in Norfolk Island the happy experience they had in Pitcairn Island. The Minister also said that if the danger arose we could deal with it . That is the policy of locking the stable door after the steed is stolen. My suggestion will give present projection and future security. I am entirely with the Minister in regard to the local option proposal. If Norfolk Island was a self governing community, I should certainly be in favour of it ; but at present the people have no franchise rights. have any opinion on this question, it is that there should be prohibition by the people, because prohibition which is not based on an intelligent expression of the people's will is not very substantial; but to introduce this subject of division among those people now would be very dangerous, because local option necessarily implies continual opportunity of exercising the option. It would, therefore, be a continually bubbling, effervescing, and irritating question. The amendment asks these people to exercise the franchise on* - this one matter only.",58
354,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Because they have no voice in anything, the honourable member would give them no voice in this matter.",59
355,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"As soon as the House is prepared to give the residents of Norfolk Island some measure of self government, I am prepared immediately to give them self-government also in this matter.",59
356,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) {9.47] - The provision in the Papuan Act for local option is very explicit. I admit that licences already exist there, so that the cases are not parallel. One of the strongest arguments of the teetotal party has beenthe necessity for local option, yet, in this case, one of the most prominent advocates of teetotalism in the House will not grant local option, because he is afraid the vote may go against him. I am surprised' at any Democrat taking such a stand. The AttorneyOeneral's argument, endorsed by the honourable member for Brisbane, was that these people were so innocent - that local - option might cause a split in the happy family, and, therefore, they should not be allowed to have a vote. argument was advanced against working people and women having votes; but they would never have learnt to vote if they had not been given an opportunity. These people are not savages. I am led to understand that they are Christianized people of the highest order, and, naturally, tliey have strong opinions of their own. Why, then, should they not have the righ t to say whether they will have liquor in their Territory or not ? We have no right to impose restrictions on people who have no say in returning a member to this House. It wil l make them even more civilized than they are if they begin If I to consider the question of self-government. As the honourable member for' Batman asked, are we to deny them an opportunity to vote in this matter because at present they have no opportunity to vote upon any other matter ? I am surprised to hear an honourable member on this side taking the stand taken by the honourable member for Brisbane. I quite expect it from the crusted old Tories on the otber side. No member on this side who refuses to give these people the right to say whether they will have prohibition or not is a Democrat. He only thinks he is. Mr MCWILLIAMS .(Franklin) [9.50]. - I shall vote for giving these people local option. I was, personally, opposed to the section of the Papuan Act referred to by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I am not satisfied that the licensing system that we have in Papua is a proper one. We are taking a responsibility there which I would not. be prepared to take. I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that this is the very best thing we can make a start in towards giving the people of Norfolk Island votes. I have never been able to see any reason why, if you give people votes to deal with rights and liberties and property, you should not give them the right to say whether they shall have licensed hotels in their districts or not. That being so, there can be no sound argument against giving the people the right to say whether or not intoxicants shall be sold in Norfolk Island. In dealing with native races for which we are responsible, we ought to be very careful how far we go in allowing them to have liquor. I am in favour of total prohibition where we have natives under our control, because the whole history of native races under the A similar British flag is one that we cannot be proud of, so far as concerns their contamination and r u in through allowing liquor' to be taken into their midst. We have now taken upon ourselves the responsibility of governing Norfolk Island. I am not prepared to accept such an amendment as that moved by the Attorney-General. It is not safe. I am prepared to give every adult there the right to say whether intoxicating liquor shall be sold on the island or not. It is no argument to say that, because they have not the franchise in any other way, we should refuse to give them the franchise in this case. As a rule, you can trust the people to decide .this matter. We should insert in the Bill a provision that will give those who see the risk the right to say that that risk shall not be introduced into their comniunity. It is a responsibility which I , for one, am not prepared to accept. therefore, vote in favour of local option; but if that is not accepted by the House, rather than take the risk involved I ehall be prepared to support entire prohibition.",59
357,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [9.56]. - I think it is a matter for regret the liquor question should have been raised in connection with a Bill of character. ' I do not think that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, in the case of a very small community a whole. like the population of Norfolk Island, overcome the difficulty by providing for local option. Local options and referenda are very valuable and useful methods for as tliey possibly can. the assistance of members of Parliament who desire to dodge their responsibilities will continue to do so. and cast them upon other people. They are a type of legislation which I , f o one, have very little sympathy with. suggest that the Government have an excellent opportunity to deal with . matter effectively in Norfolk Island, taking the control of the liquor traffic into their own hands. I should like to before hoinorable members one or two ness. facts in support' of State control of liquor business, though I do not think that this Bill should be made an portunity for a field night on the liquor be considered. question.

They are more anxious that there shall be as many shocking examples as possible, that they may hold them up to the community in proof of the evil that exists.",60
358,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,That is a most unfair statement to make.,60
359,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"I do not think that it is. It applies to the honourable member for Pranklin, at any rate. If the community really desired to legislate on this question on sound principles, we should have had effective control of the liquor business, and would not have the evils with which we have to contend today.",60
360,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The honourable member is .a good old Democrat. He I shall, trusts the people only when it suits him.",60
361,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"My Democracy has not gone the length of tyrannizing over other persons, and depriving them of the freedom which I claim for myself.

Wherever State control 'of the liquor ness has been tried, it has proved a success. It is the only fundamental way of dealing with the business, unless we go in for prohibition. I am not going for prohibition at the present time, nor do I hold out any hope that my views on the matter are likely to change. If such a promise as I have suggested is made by the Minister in charge of the Bill, I shall be prepared to support the Government on this question.",60

390,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"It does not NOES matter where the power is so long as we have it . When the Bill was before us previously there was an attempt to show that this clause would interfere with the powers of the Auditor-General, but as a matter of fact the Auditor-General will have nothing whatever to do with the power given by the clause. H is powers Tudor, F. G. will remain just the same in .regard to the matter covered by this provision as they are in regard to every other matter over which he has jurisdiction. They PAIRS. will be no more and no less. Honourable members also sought to make us believe that the A u d it Act is only connected with the powers and duties of the Auditor-General, but that is not so, because in ' England the corresponding Act is called the Exchequer and A u d it Department Act , and in New Zealand it is called the Public Revenues Act . Again, there are many other things in our A u d it Act than th© powers .of the Auditor General. Por instance, the Bill deals with the powers and duties of the Treasurer; with all the powers in regard to the receipt, custody, and expenditure of money; and with everything with the nnances of the Further, many of the duties imposed by the Audit Act are in no way connected with the Auditor-General. For instance, the Treasurer may enter into with banks, he may give directions as to the divisions in which the wealth public accounts shall be kept, and he is authorized to draw Again, the Governor General the surplus of one item of appropriation to meet a deficiency in another under the same subdivision ""of the appropriation, while the Treasurer may establish trust accounts, and may moneys. These are among portant matters that are dealt with in the measure called by us the Audit It cannot be contended that under the clause before us the Auditor-General have any control in the matter of stores, except in so far as his exerting powers already given him. The powers that he now has under section 45 of the Audit Act he will have in regard to regulations under this provision which the seeks to delete. Objection has been taken both here and in another place to the fact that the Government propose to deal with the matter of stores by regulation instead of by a Statute. have some authority for adopting course. In New South Wales, Queensland, and South Australia are similar powers which are not by a Statute, but by tion. The matter is dealt with New South Wales by section 20 of the Public Service Act 1902, which authorizes the making of regulations for determining how to procure stores, and likewise regulating the business of stores. In Victoria the matter is dealt with in sections 129 and 140 of the Public Service Act. Perhaps if honourable bers had a Publio Service Bill' before them they would say that it was the wrong measure in which to place this provision, but they would have just as much reason for objecting to it as they have for objecting to the appearing in the Act which we call the Audit Act. The power set forth in this clause is to be , found in the Queensland Public Service Act, and in South Australia by the Railways Sir John Forrest. No. 414, section 57. So in all four States the matter is dealt with by regulations mad© under the powers given in an connected Act . In Western Australia and Tascountry. mania there does not appear to be any special provision relating to stores. In those States action has been taken similar to that in the four larger States. agreements I can see no reason why exception should be taken to this provision being in the Common- A u d it Act . It is the proper place for it. We have the authority of those who cheques. d r a f t these measures for including it in may use this Bill .

Durgiven, ing the time that I had the honour to regula- sit on the other side of the chamber, it in was never my good fortune to receive a. message of this conciliatory kind.

Whether this provision is a good one or not, it is certainly not in its right place. Act, Mr W. H . IBVINE - Why ?",63
392,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"For an honourable member on this side to be asked for a reason instead of being clubbed with the closure, is a revolutionary change in procedure, which I trust will continue to be followed. To'encourage it , I answer the question by saying that the provision is in its wrong place in the A u d it B i cause it invades the responsibility of the Auditor-General. It is the business of that officer to safeguard the interests of the public, and particularly to see that the accounts of the various Departments are accurate and reliable. Under his control is to be a Tender Board, to regulate the purchase, custody, control, and issue of the public stores. I have no objection to the creation of a Tender Board, or of a board with power to regulate the purchase and issue of stores; but I object to the operations of the board being controlled by the man whose duty it is to audit the accounts. I have not had an opportunity, because of the irregular way in which business is proceeded with in this Chamber, to read the reasons actuating the Senate in making the amendment; but I have no doubt that this is one of them. I hope that the Treasurer will not insist on disagreeing with the Senate's amendment; but that if he believes the creation of a Tender Board to be necessary, he will make provision for it in another measure. I shall support him in that, because I think it would be a very proper thing to do. The Tender Board should be under the Prime Minister, the Minister of Home Affairs, or some other Minister, and entirely dissociated from the Auditor-General. In New South Wales, it is not under the Auditor General, and it would be an improper thing if it. were. Mr W . H . IRVINE (Flinders-Attor ney-General) .[10.32] - We had this t r i vial, technical objection to the provision for the creation of a Tender Board debated ad nauseam when the Bill was last before us, and the Senate- I suppose to evince its desire to get on with public business-ha s made it the ground for returning the Bill to us, with what the honourable member for West Sydney calls a ""conciliatory message."" That conciliatory message is nothing more nor less than thisPage 2, clause 3. Leave out this clause. Those who support the Senate's amendment might be expected at least to read the Bill in which the clause is contained. The honourable member for West Sydney has, apparently, not taken the trouble to make himself acquainted with the provisions of the measure, or of the clause to which he takes exception. When I asked him why he objected to the clause, he was at considerable pains at first to find words l l beto express his reason, and then he said I took down the ""words he used-that he objected to the clause "" because it invades the responsibility of the Auditor-General."" A more foolish statement was never made by a responsible member. The clause does not touch the responsibility of the Auditor-General, but merely adds one more to the safeguards which he must see are complied with in connection with the expenditure of public money. The honourable member says that he does not object to a Tender Board, and apparently the Senate does not. No honourable member opposite objects to a Tender Board, we are told, but the honourable member for West Sydney voices the foolish objection which has been continu : ously and persistently urged in this House that, under this Bill , the Tender Board is to be under the control of the Auditor General. There, again, he shows his absolute ignorance of the whole of the provisions of the A ct which this Bill is designed to amend.",64

We have in the A u d Act, of which this is an amendment, a number of provisions throwing duties on the Auditor-General, not merely with gard ' to the auditing of the accounts, but in connection with the control of existing stores. We have, in addiunder tion, a number of provisions throwing duties UDon accounting officers-upo n every person who receives or expends any portion of the Government moneys. One of the essential and necessary things i immediate connection with this is that there should be some definite regulation and control of the purchase, issue, and custody of Government stores. We find this very subject referred to in section of the principal Act . One of the duties imposed on the Auditor-General under the section is toAscertain the quantity, description, and of all stores purchased on account of Majesty, and of all stores supplied for the use of every Department of the Public Service, and be more reasonable ? whether any person in the Public Service requisitioned for or obtained any stores of the reasonable requirements of his office. Then, again, he is toExamine whether the proper quantities - such stores are remaining in stock in the store or building. These duties are directly imposed on the Auditor-General as p a r t of his everyday work. Honourable members opposite seem .to think that the Auditor-General is .merely a book-keeper; that he has simply .to examine the public accounts and to see whether the Appropriation Act has been observed.",65
399,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"He does not carry out these duties himself. He must have expert officers. - Mr W . H . IRVINE - Thes e are duties - Mr W . H . IRVINE for which he is responsible, and for he is made responsible by the Act .",65
400,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"He'is not responsible under for the actual purchases. Mr W . H . IRVINE - No r does this There, provision make him responsible for pur",65
401,Mr WEST,Unknown,"If he accepts a tender for the supply of stores he must be respondoes it sible for their purchase. Mr W . H . IRVINE - If honourable ex-members would apply their minds to the question with a desire to get at the bottom it , they would very readily come to the conclusion that there is nothing whatever in this objection. What the regulation is to do is to impose certain conditions to it safeguard the purchase, control, and issue of public stores. Under the existing law, without this regulation, there is no conrestraint whatever upon the Department of the Treasury, except to see that the money for these stores has been appropriated the Appropriation Act . It is in tended, and I understood it was the desire of honourable members on. both sides, as well as the desire of the Senate, that there shall be a further safeguard with n regard to the purchase and issue of stores - namely , that there shall be a Tender Board, consisting of skilled officers whose duty it w i ll be to investigate tenders, the conditions of purchase, and the con45 ditions under which the money appropriated by Parliament shall be applied, and that they-shall give the Departments and Parliament the benefit of their skill price and experience in connection with the purHis chase of public material. Could anything Every honourable has member professes his desire to have this. in excess But unless we go further, and impose upon the Auditor-General the obligation of seeing, not merely that the money has of all been appropriated before the warrant is proper issued for the expenditure, but that the requisitions of this Tender Board, when it comes into existence, have been complied with, we shall render the Tender Board a nullity and a farce. It is for that purpose that this provision, enabling the making of a regulation which the Auditor-General must obey, if the Tender Board is to have any effiect, has been appropriately and properly put in this Bill .",65
402,Mr WEST,Unknown,"The Auditor-General wil l supervise his own acts. - He will not. I which have heard the argument repeated again and again that the Auditor-General will control the Tender Board. .On the contrary, if tliere is to be any control, the Tender Board will have the control over him.",65
403,Mr WEST,Unknown,"What would be the position of the Auditor-General after the acceptance of a tender? Mr W . H . IRVINE - At present all that the Auditor-General has to do is to see whether there is a lawful appropriation of moneys for the purchase of public stores. If a Tender Board is created, and a regulation is passed, such as it is in tended to pass, providing that the certificate of that Tender Board shall be a condition precedent to the payment of public moneys, then the Auditor-General will Iiave imposed upon him the further duty of seeing that that certificate has been issued.",66
404,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Issue d by whom? Mr W . H . IRVINE - B y the Tender Board.,66
405,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Is that any safeguard? Mr W . H . IRVINE - If it is not, then what is the object of having a Tender Board at all?",66
406,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That is what I want to know, when the honourable member talks like that. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I understood that the Opposition were agreed that a Tender Board should be created, but that it should not be under the Auditor General.",66
407,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,We say that the Auditor-General should have nothing to do with it . Mr W . H . IRVINE - What does honourable member mean?,66
408,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"We say should have nothing more to do with it than to audit the accounts in nary course of his duties under the A u d it Act, and to see that the goods are purchased. But if the Government are going to allow him to have a voice in deciding whether certain goods should be chased, and then to have a hand in auditBoard, ing the accounts relating to those chases, that is not right. Mr W . H . IRVINE - That , shows that the honourable member has not taken the trouble to read the the Act, or to read them together, or he could not fall into that mistake. Auditor-General will have nothing [124] except to see that the Board, as one of the conditions of the expenditure, has sanctioned that expenditure.",66
409,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"If that is all, there is no objection. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I explained this at full length on the previous occasion. If there is any misapprehension, I should be very sorry to evince any warmth in the endeavour to clear it away. Let us see, however, if we cannot remove any misapprehension there may be._ As to the regulation, it is true that the Auditor General will have to obey it , as he has to obey any other regulation. If it imposes on him, as it may do, the obligation to see that the Board's certificate has been obtained, he will have to obey it .",66
410,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Is it not possible to have a certificate given by the purchasing officer under the existing Act? Mr W , H . IRVINE - U n d e r the existing Act, the Auditor-General has nothing to do except to see that Parliament has provided the money. A f t e r the purchase has been made, and the stores have become Government stores, they come within the general purview of the Auditor-General, and he has to see that the public moneys are represented either by money in the Treasury or the banks, or by stores. The objection appears to have been directed mainly to the purchase of stores; but, so far as that is concerned, all the Bill does is to impose on the Auditor-General a further duty for safeguarding the expenditure, namely, to see, not merely that Parliament has appropriated the money, and that the Treasurer has directed it to be paid, but that, in every the case where he is required so to do by the regulation, the Tender Board has that he sanctioned it .",66
411,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"That is wliere the the ordimisconception seems to arise. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I am endeavouring to remove it ; and when I hear honourable members repeat over and over again that this Bill gives the AuditorpurGeneral some control over the Tender and that it invades his responsipurbility, honourable members must forgive me if I really come to the conclusion that again, they have not taken the trouble to familiarize themselves with the proviB ill or sions of the Bill .",66
412,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It does, more or less, The give him power over the action or inacto do tion of the Tender Board.",66
413,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,It gives him no power.,67
414,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Then why put the provision in the Bill 1,67
415,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Because it imposes a duty on him.,67
416,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"And , in the exercise of that duty, he could stop the proceedings of the Tender Board if he so desired. Mr W. II . IRVINE - No . Surely the honourable member must see that all fail to understand. the regulation does is to impose on Auditor-General an additional duty, to see that another safeguard has been comto plied with.",67
417,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It gives the Government power to pass any regulation they please, which has to be interpreted literally by understood his remarks. the Auditor-General, and it may or may not interfere with the Tender Board, the Government so desire. Mr W. PL IRVINE - I need not peat that the regulation does not the Tender Board.",67
418,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It will regulate the manner in which the Board may carry out duties.,67
419,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,No doubt it will regulate the conditions under which stores may be purchased. Does the honall; orable member suggest that that should thing like it. not be done by regulation ?,67
420,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"No ; but the Attorneyremarks, General is leaving a different impression when he says that this has nothing .with the Tender Board.",67
421,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I say that the Auditor-General has nothing to do with the Tender Board, except to require its sanction.",67
422,Mr FISHER,Unknown,To obey the regulation passed by the Government.,67
423,Mr W,Unknown,"H. IRVINE - The Auditortrol General cannot go and draw money out of the Treasury himself. A l to see that those who do draw the money have complied with the conditions. regulations cannot abrogate one of the existing safeguards, but they may add additional safeguard; and if they do, it Mr W. EE. IRVINE concerns the Attorney-General, inasmuch as lie will have to see that the additional safeguard is complied with. I shall not sponsibility. spend more time over the matter, because I dealt with it fully on the last occasion. I then did not hear a single answer to or refutation of my view; and I urge on honourable members that no further time ought to be wasted now. No honourable member for a moment suggested validity or effectiveness of the provision would be any better if it were in any other than this Bill. The Government, acting not merely on the advice of the officers who draft Bills, but on the advice of the Treasury officers, consider this a fit and proper Bill in which to have this provision: and why it should not be allowed to go through, seeing that it effects what, in substance, we all desire, I utterly the Mr ROBERTS (Adelaide) [10.52] - If there-is any misunderstanding, we ought do our best to clear it away; but we cannot do that if the Attorney-General makes contradictory statements, as he has done in two directions, so far as I In the first place, in reply to the honourable member if for West Sydney, the Attorney-General asserted that the Auditor-General would renot in any way be associated with the create amendment under discussion.",67
424,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Who said that?,67
425,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,That is what I its understood the honourable gentleman to say.,67
426,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"Then the honourable member misunderstood me, that is because I did not say that, or any",67
427,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Then , in his later I understood the Attorney General to say that the Auditor-General to do was associated with the proposal.",67
428,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I happened to have the words down in writing, and I said nothing like that. I disputed what the honourable member said, namely, that this proposal invades the responsibility of the Auditor-Gene'raJ, and also the statement that the Auditor-General has conover the Board. I said nothing of the kind existed. It is no use putting l he can do is words into my mouth.",67
429,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I have no desire to The do so. The Attorney-General disputes the assertion that this in any way invades an the sphere of the Auditor-General. - "" Invades the responsibility "" were the words I used.",67
430,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,It adds to his re,67
431,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Quite so.,67
432,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"It adds to the Auditor-General's work; but really we do not know what it will do, because the Ministry may make regulations, whether the ""House be in session or not, and without that the the sanction of Parliament.",67
433,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Th. 6 honourable member is conjuring up supposititious cases.,68
434,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The Prime Minister knows very well that what I say is correct-that , if the clause be passed in respect to the purchase, custody, and so forth, of the public stores, the Government can, during recess, make any regulation they please, and that that regulation will have the force of law.",68
435,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,That is the case in every Act under which regulations can be made.,68
436,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I am quite aware of that. I am merely stating, in reply the Prime Minister's interjection about conjuring up supposititious cases, that, a matter of fact, after two or three of explanation, the Attorney-General mits that my statement is quite correct, thus completely contradicting the Prime Minister. 1 do not want to conjure anycan thing up. I interjected while the At torney-General was speaking to the effect that the Supply and Tender Board would practically have its being through the making of regulations, and the Attorneyby General contradicted me with a flat and emphatic "" No.""",68
437,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,I do so again.,68
438,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"When the Bill was going through in the first place, little or no information was given to us, but we were casually informed, and subsequently the matter was. ""brought more prominency before the House that, under this regucorrectness lation, it was intended to establish Supply and Tender Board. That fact was drawn out practically by interjections the Government. from the Government side. The regulations that will be made under this clause will control the actions of the Board, so far as it deals with the purchase, cusall. tody, control, and issue of public stores. That is beyond cavil, and yet the Attorthat ney-General flatly contradicts me. Is not the Intention of the Government, when this Bill is passed, to establish Supply and Tender Board!",68
439,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Yes ; but that does not give the authority for it . It matter. merely clothes the decisions of the board with an obligation on the Auditor-Geneply ral.,68
440,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The Government the States? may, under authority, establish a board or take it upon themselves to do so as administrative act. I do not know of any honourable member on this side who [124]- 2 raises any strong objection to the establishment of a Supply and Tender Board. All we ask is that it shall be done by a separate Act, free altogether from the Audit Act. It should be done in a manner befitting its importance and dignity, and not be left, as here, merely to regulation. In the first place, we read the Bill carefully, in conjunction with the Audit Act, which it seeks to amend. No exception was taken to clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill, because they amend the ordinary provisions of the Act; but clause 3 is not in any way related to the Audit Act, nor has it any association with clauses 1 and to 2 of the Bill. Remove it, and the rest of the Bill stands unimpaired. What it as will do is to give ths Ministry power to words make regulations. They seem to love adpower under regulations; we prefer it under Act of Parliament. Legislation by regulation means that the Government do anything they like, at any time, at - their own sweet will, whether the House is in session or not. They made a regulation during recess recently, and refused to take notice, although it was challenged honourable members. That regulation permitted electoral officers to open the sealed parcels of election papers and balloting matter.",68

446,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"It does not matter an what is done in the States. Many things are done in the States which we do not do. We are not bound to follow meekly what is done in the States, because no State Parliament is as thoroughly representative of the people as this is.",68

476,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [11.19] - I wish to draw the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to what seems to be a distinct violation of the statutory arrangement made between the Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government regarding the employment of aliens in the sugar industry. It is undoubted, from the evidence that I have received-al l ex parte, I admit-that it is a growing scandal.",70
477,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Hav e you the evidence?,71
478,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is all private, but the independent evidence I have is sufficient for me' to draw the attention of the Minister to the matter. It is said that exemptions are being issued wholesale, running into hundreds, and that the conditions of exemption are not in accord with the agreement between the two Governments. It is the duty of the Minister of Trade and Customs to get his officers in touch with the matter. The Commonwealth has merely handed over the control of the industry, in that direction, to the State Government, on the clear understanding that the white labour policy is not violated. I make this statement, because there are no greater enemies to the sugar-growers, and those who have invested money in |the industry, than persons who loosely administer the Act, since it is only a matter of time when the people of Ausjfcralia, who are making great sacrifices to enable this industry to prosper on a white labour basis, must feel somewhat annoyed, to say the least, at any departure from the principle they have established. I ask the Minister to give this matter his early consideration. His officers should be in a position to give him all the information, and it is to the Customs Department that we look to get the information.",71
479,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [11.21] - Is the Minister of Trade and Customs prepared to enlighten the public' as to the true meaning of the decision in regard to the embargo on Sydney?

There is no real understanding on the matter.",71
480,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Darling Downs-Minister of Trade and Customs) [11.23] - I am sorry the honourable member for Wide Bay has not been able to supply any evidence with regard to the statement he has made. I have received no information whatever that would indicate in the slightest degree that there has been any failure on the part of the Queensland Government to carry out the agreement in regard to alien labour.,71
481,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,It is reported in the press.,71
482,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"If specific information is given, the Customs Department will institute inquiries from the Queensland Government. It is of no use an honourable member saying that he has some private information which assures him that a certain thing is being done. The proper way, if there is any such information, is to make the evidence public, or give it to me in confidence, so that the Department can make the necessary inquiries. The action of the honourable member for Wide Bay is very different from that of the honourable member for Herbert, whohanded me a telegram stating that applications were coming in, not,' as the honourable member for Wide Bay said, that they had been granted. Regulations have been made by the Queensland Government, and as far as I know there is nothing to show on their administration of the Acts that it is contrary to the spirit, of them. If a specific charge is made an inquiry can be instituted, and whenever a specific case is brought under my notice I am only too glad to make the necessaryinquiries from the Queensland authorities. I can assure honourable membersthat, as far as I know, the Administration in Queensland have the White Australia policy as much at heart as any other Government in Australia. In regard to the question submitted by the honourable member for East Sydney, it is impossible for me to give any definite statement until the whole matter has ' been considered. The Conference was one of State officials with the Commonwealth, and as a matter of courtesy it was necessary that its recommendations should be transmitted to the different State authorities. I can assure the honourable member that there has been no delay in doing this, but I am not yet in a position to make a statement as to what was done.",71
483,Mr WEST,Unknown,There is no certainty as to the regulations.,71
484,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The regulations which are proposed are clear enough, and will convey their meaning to those who have to deal with them. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.26 p.m.",71
