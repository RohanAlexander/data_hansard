2,Mr WILLIAMS,ADMINISTRA TIVE DECISIONS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill responds to the High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and, Ethnic Affairs v. Teoh (1995) 183 CLR 273, which was handed down on 7 April 1995. In that decision, the court found that, by entering into a treaty, the Australian government creates a 'legitimate expectation' in administrative law that the executive government and its agencies will act in accordance with the terms of the treaty, even where those terms have not been incorporated into Australian law. The court also said that, where a decision maker intends to act inconsistently with a treaty, procedural fairness required that the person affected by the decision be given notice and an adequate opportunity to put arguments on the point. If not, the decision could be set aside on the grounds of unfairness. The High Court made it clear that such an expectation cannot arise where there is either a statutory or executive indication to the contrary. The High Court's decision gave treaties an effect in Australian law which they did not previously have. The government is firmly of the view that this development is not consistent with the proper role of parliament in implementing treaties in Australian law. It is a long standing principle that the sions of a treaty to which Australia is a party do not form part of Australian law unless those provisions have been validly incorporated. Under the Australian Constitution, the executive government has the power to make Australia a party to a treaty. It is for Australian parliaments, however, to change Australian law to implement treaty obligations. For these reasons, on 25 February 1997 the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and I made a joint statement which set aside legitimate expectations arising out of entry into treaties. This was a clear expression by the executive government of the Commonwealth of a contrary intention referred to by the majority of the High Court in the Teoh case. The joint statement of 25 February 1997 replaced a joint statement which was made by the previous government on 10 May 1995, However, the 10 May 1995 joint statement continues to apply to decisions made between the date of that statement and 25 February 1997. On 25 February, we also announced that legislation would be introduced into the parliament to displace the legitimate expectation in administrative law which would otherwise arise out of the entry into treaties. This bill fulfils that undertaking. It is a clear statutory indication to the contrary as discussed by the High Court in the Teoh case. It gives this parliament a role in restoring the effect of treaties in Australian law to that they had prior to the High Court's decision in the Teoh case. In passing this legislation, the parliament also will be reasserting its proper role in changing Australian law to implement treaties. Indeed, the bill complements the treaty reforms this government initiated on coming into office. One of the principal aims of those reforms was to enhance the role of parliament in scrutinising treaty action by the executive government. Those reforms included the tabling of treaties in parliament prior to the government taking action to fully become a party to a treaty, the preparation and tabling of national interest analyses for each treaty to which it is proposed Australia become a party and the establishment of the Joint Standing proviCommittee on Treaties to examine treaties. These measures giving the parliament a proper role in the treaty making process could have been introduced by the previous government. However, it was too intent on keeping parliament in the dark about treaties. This veil of secrecy now has been lifted. I tum now to the terms of the bill itself. The bill will restore the situation which existed before the Teoh case. That is, if there are to be changes to procedural or substantive rights in Australian law resulting from adherence to a treaty, they will result from parliamentary and not executive action. Indeed, this proper role of Commonwealth, state and territory legislatures is emphasised in the sixth paragraph of the preamble to the bill. Clause 5 of the bill gives effect to the statement by the majority of the High Court that a legitimate expectation arising out of entry into a treaty by Australia can be displaced by executive or legislative action. Clause 5 provides that no legitimate expectation providing a basis at law for challenging an administrative decision can arise out of the fact that Australia is bound by an international instrument or the fact that an enactment produces or refers to such an instrument. The term 'international instrument' is defined in clause 4 and covers, amongst other types of instruments, treaties and conventions. To fall within the definition, the instrument must be binding at international law. The definition also covers parts of such instruments. The terms 'administrative decision' and 'enactment' are also defined in clause 4. The act will apply to administrative decisions made after it enters into force. However, the term 'administrative decision' extends to an administrative decision reviewing or determining an appeal in respect of a decision made before the commencement of the legislation. The 25 February 1997 joint statement will -:ontinue to apply to decisions made between 25 February 1997 and the date of entry into force of this bill. It is unclear from the decision of the High Court in Teoh' s case whether state and territory administrative decisions may be the subject of legitimate expectations arising out of treaties. This uncertainty could not be allowed to remain. Therefore, the bill is expressed to extend to state and territory decisions. Since ratification of a treaty is a Commonwealth executive action, it is entirely appropriate for the Commonwealth to legislate to control the effect of that action in Australian domestic law generally. The states and territories all support Commonwealth legislation on this issue. However, they differ in their views on whether the Commonwealth legislation should be applied to state and territory decisions. Therefore, clause 6 of the bill contains a roll-back provision. This excludes the operation of the bill in relation to state or territory administrative decisions where the relevant state or territory legislature passes, or has passed, legislation having the same or similar effect as this bill. This means that it will be open to a state or territory to have its own legislation of similar effect. South Australia enacted such legislation in 1995. Therefore, the bill will have no application to state administrative decisions in South Australia. Nor does the bill prevent any state which wishes to do so from passing a law or taking its own executive actions in relation to treaties accepted by Australia which might themselves create a legitimate expectation. In that case, the legitimate expectation would flow from state law and not the Commonwealth executive act of ratification. Clause 7 puts it beyond doubt that parliament is not affecting the way in which treaties may otherwise have relevance in Australian law. Let me mention a number of existing uses covered by clause 7. Firstly, this bill will not affect the operation of treaty provisions which have been incorporated into Australian law. For example, it does not affect the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations which are given the force of law by the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1967. Secondly, the bill will not affect the operation of an act which provides for the redress of grievances in respect of alleged breaches of international instruments to which Australia is a party. For example, the bill does not affect the operation of procedures available under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. Thirdly, the bill does not affect the operation of legislation which provides that compliance with an international instrument is a relevant consideration in making an administrative decision. For example, under the air navigation regulations, compliance with Australia's bilateral air services agreements is a relevant consideration in making various decisions. Fourthly, the bill does not make compliance with an international instrument an irrelevant consideration in making an administrative decision where that would otherwise be consistent with the scope and object of the particular statutory provision. Fifthly, the bill will not affect the use by courts of international law in the form of treaties in the interpretation of statutes. Finally, it will not affect their use of international law as a source of guidance for the development of the common law. This use of treaties as one source for the development of the common law is to be distinguished from the High Court's finding that treaties gave rise to legitimate expectations in administrative law. It is the legitimate expectation aspect of the Teoh decision with which this government and the previous government disagreed. That is the aspect addressed by this bill. On 25 February 1997, I stated that I looked forward to continuation of bipartisan support on this issue. The strength of feeling which the opposition, when in government, demonstrated on this issue was no more evident than in the speech given by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) to the Mason and Beyond conference in September 1995. He stated: My lack of enthusiasm for Teoh is not especially a function of my lack of appreciation of how it has narrowed the gap between international and domestic law: rather it is a function of my belief that Teoh creates a decision-making environment that is unworkable in practice, and that it goes further than the court was compelled to go by any legal principle, or should have gone, in upsetting the present balance between Executive, Legislature and Judiciary. The pre-Teoh balance was a delicate one, to be sure, but nonetheless one perfectly attractive in theory and workable in practice. There can be no doubt that those words are his own. They encapsulate the reasons why this legislation is necessary in order to restore the proper role of this parliament in the implementation of treaties. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. NA 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Williams, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
3,Mr WILLIAMS,COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The coalition went into the 1996 election with a strong policy commitment to bring about an up-to-date and workable copyright law, and specifically to legislate to recognise properly the moral rights of authors and artists. The comprehensive protection of moral rights of authors and artists is something for which Australia's creators have been agitating during the last few years. Provision for this is the single most important reform in the bill. The bill will also reform the law of ownership of copyright in the works of employed journalists and the law governing importation of goods with copyright labelling or packaging, and introduce much needed streamlining or modernising of the operation of some areas of the act. Moral rights for authors, artists and film directors and producers Under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, which is the main international convention on copyright and of which Australia and 124 other countries are members, 'moral rights' are: the right of an author or artist to be identified with his or her work-known as the right of attribution; and the right to object to alteration or other derogatory treatment of the work that would be prejudicial to the author's or artist's honour or reputation-known as the right of integrity. The rights apply to literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works and to films, but not to sound recordings. Personal honour and reputation arc already protected by the laws of defamation. The law of passing off enables professional authors and artists to prevent another person representing himself or herself as the creator of their business output, including copyright works. The provisions in the Trade Practices Act against misleading or deceptive conduct could also be invoked by authors and artists. Some provisions in the Copyright Act already protect specific aspects of moral rights-for example, the duty to refrain from falsely attributing a work. However, this fragmentary and incomplete coverage by Australian law of the Berne convention moral rights obligations has been increasingly criticised. Among other common law countries that had a similar approach to moral rights protections, the United Kingdom and Canada introduced improved moral rights legislation in 1988, and New Zealand largely adopted the UK model in 1994. The bill that I am now presenting honours this government's 1996 election policy commitment to the introduction of comprehensive moral rights and does so by reference to the international standards set by the Berne convention. It is not just fulfilling international obligations; it is also acknowledging the great importance of ensuring respect for the integrity of creative endeavour. The right of attribution will be an important advance for authors, artists and film producers and directors, because they have no comprehensive right beyond any relevant contract to require attribution. The right to take action against false attribution is essentially a consolidation of existing provisions in the act. The right of integrity will provide a more certain and uniform level of protection than the laws of defamation, which vary from state to state or territory, and will, consistently with the Berne convention, last as long as copyright in the work; that is, life of the creator plus 50 years or, in the case of films, 50 years. The government recognises the concerns of users of copyright-such as broadcasters, advertising agencies, filmmakers and newspaper publishers-that these rights will unduly hamper their existing practices. It is understandable that they fear use of moral rights by creators as an additional form of leverage to extract higher returns for the use of creators' works. However, if a user of a work respects the rights of the creator-that is, acknowledges, where reasonable, the authorship of the work and, where reasonable, avoids treatment that is prejudicial to the reputation of the authorthen the user does not owe the author anything and does not need the author's permission in making the intended use of the work. In contrast, a user of one of the copyright economic rights-such as, the right to copy, to publish, to broadcast-must always have the copyright owner's permission, express or implied, unless the use comes within a statutory exception. In determining whether non-attribution of authorship of a work is an infringement of moral rights, a court will have to consider whether the omission was reasonable in the circumstances. Reasonableness will depend on a number of relevant factors that must be taken into account; notably, the nature of the work, industry practice and whether the creator was an employee. Whether alteration of or dealing with a work infringes the right of integrity will also be subject to a similar test of reasonableness based on relevant criteria. Further, there will be no infringement of moral rights by a particular act or omission if it was consented to by the creator or if it was covered by a waiver by the creator of one or more of their rights for the work. Finally, it should be emphasised that the introduction of moral rights, in particular the right of integrity, is not intended to impede or adversely affect the time-honoured practices of parody and burlesque. The moral right of integrity is not intended to stifle satire, spoof or lampoon any more than docs the existing law of defamation. Experience in other countries suggests-and the government envisages-that enforcement of moral rights through the courts will be an exceptional occurrence. The main impact of the new legislation will, it is hoped, be to build upon good existing industry practice and, where necessary, to raise awareness in an educative way of the need to respect the creativity of authors and artists. In those exceptional cases in which a creator feels forced to take action, courts will have the discretion to order a range of remedies, including damages, injunctions, publication of apology or reversing infringing treatment of a work. Journalists' copyright A general rule under the Copyright Act is that copyright in works created in the course of employment belongs to the employer, who has engaged and paid the employees to create the works. However, there has long been an exception in the case of employed newspaper journalists in regard to use of their works other than for the purpose for which they have been employed; that is, newspaper publication. Thus, those journalists have copyright for the purpose of book publication and photocopying of their articles, pictures or cartoons. With the impact of new technology, the way that the act divides copyright between the publishers and employed journalists has become out of date. In regard to electronic uses of the employees' works-for example, selling of on-line access to the public-the government accepts that the publishers' copyright in their employees' creations should now extend to electronic rights, and the bill provides fur this. However, the book rights now held by employed journalists in their articles and pictures will stay with them. The existing right of the employed journalists to authorise photocopying of their articles, most notably in press cuttings services, will also remain with them. While the publishers have indicated that they do not oppose this, they have been concerned at the possibility that photocopying could impact on the circulation of their publications. The government is not satisfied that photocopying by press cuttings services up to now has had such an impact. Nevertheless, the government sees justification in giving publishers a right of objection to the making of photocopies of more than 15 per cent of a newspaper or magazine other than those pages containing full-page advertisements. Where the copies are being made for several or many clients, as is done by press cuttings service'. the right to object in the bill will operate il respect of anyone client, not all clients in aggregate. Copyright packaging and labelling of imported goods In 1988 a report by the Copyright Law Review Committee recommended to the then government that copyright in packaging or labelling of imported goods should not be able to be used to control distribution of the goods. Copyright control over importation of copyright items-such as CDs, books and software-is a controversial matter, and the government is currently reviewing it. However, control of importation of noncopyright items, such as bottles of liquor, by exercise of the copyright in the label is an inappropriate restraint of legitimate trade and, as recommended by the CLRC, it should be ended. This bill will implement this clearly desirable and long overdue reform. This change will not, however, relax existing controls over importation of goods with labelling or packaging that consists of copyright materials made without the consent of the copyright owner in the country of manufacture. Streamlining and rationalising other areas of the existing act The other provisions in the bill, while of a more technical machinery nature, introduce much needed streamlining or modernising of the operation of areas of the act, including: the provisions allowing governments to copy copyright material, subject to providing equitable remuneration to copyright owners; the provisions allowing institutions serving persons with print or intellectual disabilities to make special editions of works to help those persons to have access to copyright materials; the provisions allowing educational institutions to copy materials for teaching; the provisions establishing the Copyright Tribunal; the provisions governing the remedies that may be awarded by the courts for copyright infringement; and the provisions for border interception of infringing imported copyright material. The bill also makes some formal amendments such as updating the references to broadcasting legislation. This is an important bill for copyright creators because it delivers to them comprehensive moral rights which are so important in reaffirming respect for the creative role of authors, artists, film directors and producers. It is also important to copyright owners in facilitating payment to them for uses of their works under various statutory licences. The bill is, at the same time, important for large institutional users of copyright, not just governments but all the educational institutions, in streamlining the procedures for them to account to copyright owners. The bill includes important changes to ownership of copyright in works of employed journalists which recognise the impact. of new communications technology on the delIvery of newspapers and magazines. In that regard, further changes to copyright in the new communications networks are likely after the government has con-idered the new int-rna­ tional copyright treaties concluded at a dIplomatic conference in Geneva last December. This bill includes a micro-economic reform in lifting copyright control o,:er distribut-on of imported goods with copynght packagmg or labelling. All in all, this bill is a very substantial instalment of the government's commitment to bringing about an up-to-date and workable Copyright Act. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. NA (SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Abbott, and read a first time. Second Reading",15
4,Mr ABBOTT,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (9.56 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill introduces a statutory exemption for the Austudy and Abstudy schemes from the operation of the marital status discrimination provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. At present, the Austudy and Abst-dy schemes discriminate on the basis of mantal status in two key ways. Firstly, there are differences in the way legally married students are treated as compared with students in de facto relationships. Secondly, there are differences in the way legally married students are treated in comparison with single students. A number of these differences go to the broader issue of the assumptions of dependency which underpin Commonwealth allowances generally. Rates of allowance and the income and assets tests, including those applied to receipt of rent assistance, are based on the assumptions which also underpin other Commonwealth allowances that a person with a partner has access to the financial means of their partner to meet their combined costs, and a single person who is independent of parental assistance does not have the. opportunity to share costs for accommodatIOn and other living expenses. In addition to these broader issues, a numfirst ber of the problems which Austudy and Abstudy have in relation to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 are specific to the schemes. Unlike the social security situation, the recognition of de facto relationships in the Austudy context would generally result in increased eligibility for benefits. In the social secur-ty context, beneficiaries actually have a finanCIal disincentive for establishing de facto relationships as their combined eligibility is reduced as a result. In Austudy, a person who is married is considered to be independent for purposes of the scheme, and is eligible for a higher rate of Austudy than the rate payable to a student who is considered to be dependent. If de facto relationships are treated the same as marriage-that is, as a ground for independent status-there would be a financial incentive for establishing the existence of a de facto relationship so that the student is eligible for a higher rate of Austudy. This would make it difficult for the scheme administrators to verify the legitimacy of de facto relationships. Abstudy experiences similar problems under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 in relation to living allowances, income testing and eligibility for rent assistance. The Austudy and Abstudy schemes initially had a legislative exemption from the operation of those provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 proscribing discrimination on the ground of marital status. The Austudy and Abstudy schemes currently have an administrative exemption from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in relation to the marital status provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. The administrative exemption expires, however, on 31 December 1997. Non-legislative options for dealing with this issue have been explored, however, these would have serious social or financial repercussions. Failure to take the action proposed would mean that complaints could be made under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 once the existing administrative exemption has expired. It is therefore necessary that this amending legislation be in place by 1 January 1998. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. NA (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Abbott, and read a first time. Second Reading",18
5,Mr ABBOTT,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (10.00 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill provides for this government's commitment to two initiatives. The first is its commitment to lift the requirement for at least 10 per cent of enrolled students to be indigenous before a non-government non-systemic preschool, school or vocational education and training institution can be funded under the indigenous education strategic initiatives program. The amendment leaves in place the requirement for there to be a minimum of 20 students in a non-government non-systemic school and a non-government non-systemic VET institution and for there to be a minimum of five students in a non-government non-systemic preschool. These limits will avoid the administrative expense of providing small amounts of money to small numbers of scattered students. It will also avoid the situation where there will be little or no benefit to individual students from the provision of small grants. This amendment will enable institutions where there are significant numbers of Indigenous students, but these students represent less than 10 per cent of total enrolments, to qualify for funding under the act. Experience has shown that the 10 per cent requirement has excluded some institutions from receiving supplementary funding in respect of their indigenous students. The second amendment will permit the adjustment of grants under the indigenous education strategic initiatives program in line with cost increases for the period up to 30 June 2000. The appropriations for these years are in subsections 13b(4), (5), (6) and (7) in the principal act. Inclusion of a cost supplementation provision in the principal act will bring the program into line with other education programs. I commend the bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned.

6,Mr RONALDSON,A VIA TION LEGISLATION,"BallaratParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (10.03 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Introduction This bill contains several important amendments to five existing acts, the Air Navigation Act 1920, the Airports Act 1996, the Air Services Act 1995, the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 and the International Air Services Commission Act 1992. Air Navigation Act 1920 Amendments These amendments concern the security screening of passengers boarding large commercial aircraft within Australia. The amendments represent a minor change to Australia's aviation security regulatory framework based on operational reasons. Currently, arrangements under the Air Navigation Act 1920 make individual aircraft operators responsible for passenger screening for certain domestic and international aircraft operations. The responsibility for segregating passengers who have been screened from those who have not also currently rests with the airlines. In larger airport terminals around the country the favoured method for segregating screened persons before they board an aircraft is to screen into sterile areas. Sterile areas offer savings in security costs by minimising the required level of screening staff and equipment compared to screening passengers at individual gate lounges. With the increasingly commercial approach being taken by airport terminal operators to non-aeronautical revenue raising, more and more commercial activities, such as retail outlets, are being located within sterile areas, where the departing passengers tend to congregate. These activities are controlled by the operators of the passenger terminal buildings through the terminal operator leases and not by the airlines. The operation of these commercial activities, particularly the need to restock out of hours, and some of the delivery practices for goods and services do have an impact on the security of the sterile area. As a result, the government proposes to centralise the responsibility for sterile area access control and passenger screening into the one organisation. This will be achieved by making terminal operators primarily responsible for passenger screening at sterile areas. In summary, these amendments will: ensure that airlines remain responsible for what is carried on their aircraft and for passenger screening when a sterile area is not used to segregate passengers; ensure that airlines remain responsible for the segregation of their passengers between a sterile area approved under the new arrangements and their aircraft; make operators of terminals, in which sterile areas operate, responsible for access control and passenger screening, with the Department of Transport and Regional Development having the power to designate the sterile area and any conditions of operation; and ensure that these arrangements are sufficiently flexible to allow the department to designate an airline or airlines (or other persons, with their consent) to be responsible for passenger screening into a sterile area where local circumstances indicate that this would give better security outcomes. Airports Act 1996 Amendment The bill also makes a minor amendment to the Airports Act 1996 that allows fees to be levied under regulations made for the purposes of environment protection at leased airports. This will allow partial cost recovery of administrative expenses associated with processing administrative and other approvals under the regulations. Air Services Act 1995 Amendment Airservices Australia's primary function is to provide for the safe navigation of aircraft. This is essential in a large country with population centres separated by long distances. Australia's aviation industry plays an important role in providing rapid, safe and reliable communication links-it is one of Australia's key strategic industries. Airservices plays a vital role in this try, providing essential air traffic and other services to all participants. Given Airservices' special position, the government believes it has a key role to play in encouraging and promoting the overall benefits of an efficient aviation industry. Airservices will continually review the services it provides to ensure it is meeting industry's genuine needs and is not placing impediments in the way of growth in the industry. To this end, Airservices must continually strive to provide its services by the most cost effective means, at the same time structuring its pricing as far as practical to ensure industry participants are paying for the services they actually use. I need to emphasise, however, that the change to legislation will not, in the government's view, require Airservices Australia to ensure the viability of any individual operator; nor will it require that the aspirations of any particular aviation sector be met. The Airservices Australia Board will be expected to take this objective into account in their strategic planning, principally, and be writing to the chairman to this effect. Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 Amendment This amendment will ensure that de facto spouses are included among the members of a passenger's family for the purposes of being eligible for the compensation available under the act in the event of the passenger's death or injury as a result of an air accident. De facto spouses are currently excluded from compensation and this is contrary to the Commonwealth's own policy and legislation relating to discrimination on the grounds of marital status. International Air Services Commission Act 1992 Amendments Since this government came to office, capacity for international services to and from Australia has increased by 17 per cent over the accumulated capacity increases of the past 50 years. That equates to an additional 135 Boeing 747 scheduled services per week available to fly to and from Australia. Along with this massive increase in capaciindus- ty available for Australian and overseas carriers to service the Australian market, there has been a rapid increase in the sophistication with which Australian carriers have approached their operations overseas. Like many Australian businesses, the future growth of Australian international airlines can be enhanced by operating effectively and efficiently in overseas markets. As part of this development, Australian carriers will be seeking to establish networks combining overseas markets into a potentially fully integrated service. Since 1992, when multiple designation of Australia's carriers on international routes was introduced, the International Air Services Commission has been allocating Australian capacity for services between Australia and other countries in a process that has been widely acknowledged as transparent, independent and equitable. While not a major aspect of previous Australian carrier operations, the International Air Services Commission Act did however prevent the commission from allocating capacity between points outside Australia. I will available to Australian carriers under Australia's air services arrangements. The amendments in this bill will allow the commission to rightly assume responsibility for this function from the Department of Transport and Regional Development in an orderly manner. This amendment represents the final step in ensuring the complete independence of capacity allocation from capacity negotiation and will provide certainty to Australian scheduled carriers by confirming the commission's role as the single independent authority for allocating all rights available under air services arrangements. As the structural complexity of international air services increases and Australian carriers become more sophisticated in the way in which they apply allocations of capacity to particular markets, the commission will increasingly be called upon to consider the nature of any cooperation between Australian carriers or between Australian carriers and foreign carriers and how that might affect the use of the capacity that the commission allocates. The bill therefore provides additional guidance for the International Air Services Commission on what constitutes a 'joint international service' for the purpose of allocating capacity, without reducing the commission's flexibility in their determinations. This bill also makes some technical amendments, including the removal of definitions of new and shelf capacity which are now redundant, the inclusion of a provision to allow the commission to revoke a determination at the request of an Australian carrier to whom that determination relates and a new provision to ensure that the proposed amendments do not affect current operations between points outside Australia by Australian carriers. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ronaldson, and read a first time.

7,Mr RONALDSON,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA,"BallaratParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (10.12 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to implement a package of enhancements to Australia's marine cargo liability regime. The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1991, which is often referred to as the COGS A, deals with liability for loss or damage to sea cargoes. The package is the result of extensive negotiations with, and agreement by, all affected interests-shippers, cargo owners, carriers, shipowners, marine insurers and maritime lawyers. I seek leave to table the document which records the package of changes which maritime industry interests have agreed should be made to improve our marine cargo liability regime. Leave granted.",22
8,Mr RONALDSON,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA,"The COGSA operates by applying as domestic law in Australia an international convention and several protocols collectively known as the amended Hague Rules. However, the COGSA also provides for the possible future implementation of an alternative international convention commonly known as the Hamburg Rules. The bill I have introduced to amend the COGSA deals directly with two of the seven items in the industry package-the Hamburg Rules trigger now contained in the COGS A, and arbitration in Australia. The other five items in the industry package, dealing with documents, coverage of importers, deck cargo, duration of liability and liability for delays will be implemented by regulations to be made under the act. The Hamburg Rules trigger The Hamburg Rules, although a more recent convention than the amended Hague Rules, have attracted very little support from major trading nations, including Australia's major trading partners. The Hamburg Rules trigger was first due to operate on 1 November 1994. Prior to that date there had been vigorous debate between shipper interests proposing the implementation of the Hamburg Rules and carrier interests opposing this. In October 1994, both houses of parliament passed resolutions to defer consideration of the question of acceptance or repeal of the Hamburg Rules for another three years. Following this resolution an industry working group developed a compromise solution in which carriers conceded significant extensions in the protection offered to shippers in return for the removal of the automatic trigger for the Hamburg Rules. I would like to congratulate the industry interests concerned on the spirit in which this process was conducted. This bill implements that compromise solution developed by industry. At present, the automatic trigger provision will operate again on 20 October 1997 to bring the Hamburg Rules into force in the COGS A, and action is therefore needed to prevent this. This bill will remove that trigger and the requirement for a resolution of both houses of parliament. In its place, provisions are inserted for the minister to conduct a review from time to time of the desirability of bringing the Hamburg Rules into force in Australia. Provision for arbitration Industry has concerns that, under the existing legislation, arbitration has not been available as an option for resolving disputes. The act will now make it clear that arbitration in Australia does not offend section 11 of the COGSA. Regulation making provision The bill includes a power to make regulations to implement the highly technical elements of the industry-endorsed package dealing with: (a) Coverage of a wider range of contracts of carriage, including electronic documents by the COGSA; (b) Providing coverage for importers in some circumstances; (c) Coverage of cargo agreed to be carried on deck, in certain circumstances; (d) Extending COGS A coverage from the current 'hook-to-hook' coverage to 'terminal-to-terminal' coverage; and (e) Providing limited recompense for shippers' losses due to delays, except where the delays are excusable delays according to criteria well understood in the maritime industry, and which will be defined in the regulations. These changes will extend the protection which the COGS A offers to Australian shippers, particularly exporters. The concepts behind these changes can be simply expressed. However, given the nature of international conventions, the modifications to the amended Hague Rules to make these changes are technically complex and lengthy. Given the need not to overburden parliament's business agenda and recognising that the resources of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel are under pressure, it is quite appropriate that such technical matters be handled by regulation. Accordingly, the bill includes a very precise regulation making power which will enable the subsequent drafting and making of regulations to implement these changes. This might be regarded as a 'Henry VIII clause', which is a clause that permits the making of regulations which have the effect of amending the operation of an act. However, such clauses are used in Commonwealth laws regularly, and enable the expeditious passage of legislation. The regulations are, of course, subject to disallowance, and will be required by the act to be made only after consultation with relevant industry stakeholders. Financial impact Finally, while the amendments will enhance the operation of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1991, they will have no impact on Commonwealth revenues or outgoings, and no direct financial impact on the industry. I present a copy of the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. NA (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr MCGauran, for Dr Wooldridge, and read a first time. Second Reading",22
9,Mr MCGAURAN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill seeks to make an amendment to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 to ensure the effectiveness of subsection 50(20) of the act which prevents land claims over stock routes and stock reserves. The background to this matter is that the previous government entered into a memorandum of agreeLnt in 1989 with the Northern Territory concerning the granting of community liv;n(T areas ,() Aborig1l1ai pc,)ple in pastoral districts in the Northern Territory. As part of the agreement, the Commonwealth undertook to proclaim a 1987 amendment to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 preventing the making of land claims over stock routes and reserves. This amendment was made because it was never intended that stock routes and reserves should be available for claim. The amendment was proclaimed in 1990. However, it appears that it may be technically deficient. The effect of the amendment as drafted is that, while the claims cannot be heard by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner as a result of subsection 50(2D), they remain registered. This means that there is some doubt about whether the Northern Territory government can deal with the land. In 1995, the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory governments reached an arrangement that an effective amendment be made in exchange for the Northern Territory accepting Commonwealth proposals for amendments to the Northern Territory's Pastoral Land Act 1992. The aim of these amendments is to expedite the granting of community living areas to Aboriginal people, particularly those being dealt with by the Community Living Areas Tribunal. This bill, once agreed to by parliament, will conclusively eliminate stock route and stock reserve claims by removing any doubt about the effectiveness of subsection 50(2D) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. The amendments contained in this hill before the House will commence on proclamation, with a 12-month limit on the time within which the proclamation is to be made. The intended proclamation period has been provided so that, in accordance with the 1995 agreement with the Northern Territory, the amendment can commence the same time as the Northern Territory's amendments to its Pastoral Land Act 1992. There are no financial implications arising from this bill. I commend the amended bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Tanner) adjourned. NA COMMISSION SALE BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 May, on motion by Mr Sharp: That the bill be now read a second time.",23
10,Mr TANNER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"Melbourne) (10.23 a.m.)The Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill 1997 is one of the more outrageous pieces of legislation that has been put before this parliament in recent times, not merely because it seeks, contrary to the election commitment of the new government, to privatise Australian National and, incidentally, subsequently privatise the government's holding in the National Rail Corporation, not merely because it threatens large numbers of jobs and significant rail services, not merely because it is based on a gross exaggeration of the financial problems from which Australian National is currently suffering and not merely because it surrounds itself with an entirely fictitious $2 billion reform package which is almost totally comprised of existing obligations on the part of the federal government. What is particularly most outrageous about this legislation is the content of the legislation itself because in effect it empowers the two ministers named-the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport-to do whatever they like with respect to the future of the rail industry in this country. The bill empowers the two ministers to sell, by their own decision, any assets of Australian National, to set up companies that can be used as halfway houses to transfer assets to private owners, to transfer the Australian National debt to the Commonwealth, to amend or repeal any acts of this parliament or the transfer agreements between the two states involved and this parliament and to wind up the Australian National Railways Commission. In effect, the parliament is being asked to hand over all of its powers with respect to the legislation surrounding the Australian national railway system to the two ministers. It is being asked to completely abrogate any responsibility that it has for making decisions with respect to the future of the rail system without being told what the two ministers are going to do with these powers. The two ministers, and the government with them, are saying, 'Trust us. Give us the power. We intend to flog off Australian National. We may sell it in bits. We may sell it as a single unit. We cannot give you any guarantees about services. We cannot give any guarantees about jobs. We have some general propositions in place.' That is all the parliament is being told and it is now being asked to simply give carte blanche to the two ministers to do whatever they like. The opposition has a number of objections to the legislation, which I will get to later, that are contained in the second reading amendment that I will move at the end of my contribution. We also intend to move a set of amendments in the consideration in detail stage relating to the question of the future of the proposed track authority. I will deal first with the background to the situation that faces the parliament with respect to Australian National. In April last year the Chairman of Australian National, Jack Smorgon, wrote to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) indicating that the anticipated loss of Australian National for the 1995-96 year of $26 million was now anticipated to be over $100 million. Naturally, the minister sought to blame the former government and commissioned Mr John Brew to conduct an inquiry into the cause of this financial difficulty. The minister sought to make cheap political points about the number of job losses and line closures that had occurred in Australian National in the preceding 13 years-naturally failing to point out that equivalent things had occurred throughout the state systems over that period largely relating to the changes in demand, changes in the freight task and, particularly, changes in technology and productivity. In my own state of Victoria, for example, we have seen very substantial reductions in employment similar to what has occurred in the equivalent systems in places like South Australia. The losses that were anticipated were not unusual in Australian National history. If we go back to the last couple of years of the former conservative government, we see that in 1982-83 Australian N ationa! recorded a loss of $106 million. In today' s dollars that is roughly $192 million. In 1981-82, there was a loss of $73 million and in today' s dollars that is roughly $146 million. We have seen a pattern over a number of years where there has been a substantial subsidy from the Commonwealth to the operations of Australian National. It has varied from time to time, but it has generally been fairly substantial, albeit often nowhere near as substantial as rail is subsidised in other parts of the Commonwealth by the state systems and in other parts of the world. Generally speaking, direct government subsidisation to rail is the norm throughout most of the world. The effective community subsidisation that goes to roads through the direct construction of roads and the financing of roads and also through indirect costs associated with road trauma, pollution and the like is very difficult to compare to the direct subsidisation that goes to rail. If we look at the more recent figures for Australian National, we see that in 1992-93 it had a bad year because of the recession, 1993-94 was one of its best years for a long time and 1994-95 was not such a good year but not much worse than 1993-94 and certainly better than some of the years in the early 1990s. So, for the last full financial year figures that the former government had available to it, Australian National was basically doing reasonable well relative to its history. In December 1995, the chairman spoke to the former Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), who was told not that the organisation was in financial trouble but rather that there were questions with respect to the current CEO and that the board wished to deal with those matters, which could potentially include dismissal. The then transport minister indicated quite properly that the government was almost in caretaker mode, an election was pending and it would be more appropriate for such matters to be dealt with under the auspices of the incoming transport minister and transport administration. In the wake of that, the government then instigated the Brew inquiry which was essentially a very narrow accounting exercise that looked only at the balance sheets for each of Australian National's businesses. It anticipated that the loss for the 1995-96 financial year would be somewhere between $130 million and $148 million. It identified the creation of National Rail in 1991-92 as the key reason for the decline in Australian National's fortunes which, I hasten to point out-a fact that the minister does not ever mention in the House-\X1as ultimately forced on the Labor government by the states. The former government wanted to have National Rail's functions essentially as part of Australian National, but the states refused to do that. In order to create an integrated interstate rail system, which achieved massive improvements in the public sector deficit with respect to rail freight, the former government separated National Rail from Australian National. That then had an adverse consequence for the operations of Australian National because the bulk of its profitable activities were now part of an another organisation. The Brew inquiry recommended wholesale closures and sell-offs and made a range of fairly harsh recommendations based on very narrow consultations and a very narrow perspecti ve on the overall operation of Australian National and the rail industry. No consideration was given to the nature of the rail task. No consideration was given to the role of rail in the overall transport network. the interaction between rail and other modes of transport. No consideration was given to the significance of community service obligations and the current operations of things such as the passenger services or the grain lines in South Australia. No serious analysis was made of the performance of management, something which particularly sticks in the craw of many AN workers. No analysis was made of the merits of separating out all of the various components of AN's operations and setting them up as separate businesses. following a very popular management fad which we can see throughout most of the private sector in recent times and. indeed, in some parts of the public sector of separating different components of an industry, particularly on a vertical basis, and establishing them as autonomous business units with an attendant array of considerable transaction costs and complications that, in my view, mostly will cancel out or even end up as an overall negative relative to any efficiency gains that may be attained by that. As a result of Labor's return to order motion in the Senate, the Brew inquiry report was forced to be made public, albeit a slightly doctored version. In the debate that followed the minister first claimed that the Labor Party in government did nothing about Australian National's problems. Then a day later, when the report had been released and Australian National had issued a press release calling for expressions of interest for the sale of a substantial part of AN's businesses, the minister then sought to blame this on the former government. In other words, on the one hand, the former government did nothing to address AN's financial crises but, on the other hand, when it became clear that AN was already moving to sell off substantial parts of its operations this was blamed on the former government. Of course it soon became very clear when a letter leaked from the minister to the Chairman of Australian National, dated 15 August, that the actions Australian National were taking had been taken specifically at the request and instruction of the minister. The final blow to the credibility of the Brew report came in September of last year when it emerged that Mr Brew had, shortly after submitting the report, engaged himself in discussions with one of the front runners, the Great Southern Railway Corporation based on Macquarie Bank, to buy parts of Australian National with respect to possibilities that he may become a consultant. In fact, the discussions had reached a stage where Macquarie Bank and the Great Southern Railway Corporation felt it was appropriate that they could advertise their prospective running of Australian National in the future, mentioning the fact that they would have the unique expertise of John Brew on board as a consultant. Clearly, although no agreement was finalised, Mr Brew obviously had it in his mind when conducting his inquiry that at the conclusion of that inquiry there would be some substantial opportunities for people with rail expertise to make a dollar out of the membering of Australian National. As far as the opposition is concerned, that tainted the whole inquiry, and the inquiry really does not amount to a great deal in the overall perspective that we need to develop with respect to the future of the rail industry. Then we saw in November the reform package, as it has been dubbed in Orwellian language, from the minister in which the minister announced the total privatisation Australian National with respect to the main line interstate track. It was originally all the mainland track, but it is now the main line interstate track on the mainland. This could occur either as a totality or in pieces. government's ownership of its share of Nayou tional Rail would also be included, even though that was not recommended by John nation Brew and was a good illustration of the government's hypocrisy on this issue. Australwill Ian National was being sold, we are told, simply because its finances were in difficulty and it needed private ownership to get it back on an even keel and the government needed to get out of a potentially spiralling deficit nary figure. with respect to rail. Yet, on the other hand, the government's share of National Rail was also going to be sold even though National Rail was doing quite well, was roughly on target to achieve its five-year objective to a commercial breakeven point, albeit with one or two problems on the way but nonetheless doing quite well, and had, in the words of the minister's own department, improved the interstate rail transport freight deficit from $350 million in the early 1990s to $50 million in 1995-96. So the contradiction in the government's position was very strongly exposed by what it was actually doing. It was seeking to sell both, even though the NRC sale was not proposed by Brew and even though the justification for selling AN was completely irrelevant and not applicable with respect to NRC. The package that was put forward was almost totally fictitious. It included, for example, $580-odd million relating to superannuation. What did that reflect? When you actually went into it, what it reflected was dis- that for many years Australian National has been fully funding its superannuation but paying its obligations into consolidated revenue with the Commonwealth meeting its obligations from time to time. In other words, that $580 million was simply an existing obligation that the Commonwealth always had and always would have. Similarly, with respect to the debt, $790-odd million worth of debt was already a Commonwealth liability. The $50 million for the environmental of clean-up was based on an estimate put forward by Australian National with respect to of the total cost that would apply if all of its sites had to be cleaned up-in other words, in effect, if all rail operations were closed down, The which would be the circumstance in which would have an obligation for an environmental clean-up. In most cases, the contamithat this relates to is the sort of standard common-or-garden contamination you get with any form of industrial or transport activity with land-things like diesel spills and the like. That $50 million is clearly something that may never eventuate. Some of it will, but the total is essentially an imagiIn this so-called package there was no statement with respect to anticipated proceeds, a measly $20 million for regional assistance, no guarantee of jobs or services and no requirement on the buyers to keep any part of the existing AN network operating. The $20 million that was specified for regional assistance was described by the Chief Executive Officer of the Spencer Regions Development Association, Mr Rod Nettle, who I understand is a former National Party candidate for Grey, as 'a Laurel and Hardy show' and '3,000 new beach barbecue sets' as being the net impact that would have, particularly in places like the Iron Triangle and Port Augusta. This was made in submissions to the Senate rail inquiry. The minister claimed that the actual loss for Australian National was $250 million in 1995-96. First it had been anticipated to be $26 million, then AN suggested about $106 million, then Mr Brew suggested $135 million to $148 million. But-shock, horror-it had act;. ally blown out to $250 million. What he did not tell us, and what he did not teIl anybody else, was that the bulk of this $250 million was in fact one-off asset revaluations that AN had undertaken over that period which have to be put in the accounts somewhere and do have some significance, but they are quite distinct from an ongoing deficit. It is reasonable to suppose that, if have a situation where there is an operating deficit of a certain level based on current revenue and current expenditure, that will continue in the future unless something is done to change the situation, whereas an asset revaluation is a one-off exercise that will not reappear in the deficit in the following year and the year after that. But, of course, none of this was mentioned. The actual operating deficit for AN in that year ended up being $69 million, $14 million higher than the $54 million that was the operating deficit in the 1994-95 year-not a great outcome and not a fantastic result by any means. Certainly, there were issues with AN that needed to be addressed, but these have been grossly exaggerated by the minister in order to justify simply getting the Commonwealth out of rail, removing the subsidies that have been there for a long time under governments of both persuasions and simply abdicating any responsibility for the future of rail transport in this country. Since then, we have had the expressions of interest process. A number of organisations, both Australian and foreign, have expressed some form of interest in buying parts of Australian National. We have had various statements of general intention on the part of the government but very little serious detail. I would suggest that the House take one step back on this issue for a minute to consider an interesting contrast. The most recent major total privatisation that we have dealt with, certainly in the transport area, has been the airport sales legislation. When you look at that legislation, it is very thick, substantial, very detailed and it puts forward a framework with respect to the future operation of Australia's airports, the obligations of the new owners and all of the regulatory structures that apply to that in considerable detail. It covers concerns about the environment, noise and the operations of airport owners vis-a-vis the airlines-not perfectly, one or two things were not properly addressed, but certainly, overwhelmingly, all of those issues were dealt with. Yet in this instance-another transport you privatisation which is of major significance to Australia's transport system and of major significance to Australia's transport userswhat do we have? We have a very small bill, a bill that in effect says that the parliament empowers the ministers to do what they like. That amounts to an outrageous abrogation of parliamentary sovereignty, something that the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), who is at the table, would have loved to have spoken about in opposition. No doubt she has different views about it now. It means that not only the opposition but also the Independents and the minor parties in the Senate, who are entitled to represent their constituents, to be part of a debate and to be part of decisions about the future of the industry, are in effect being told, 'You have a situation where you are being asked to empower the ministers to do anything they like, simply sign off, on the future of the system. Yes, there will be a few disallowable instruments involved in that, but ultimately you're going to be in a position where your ability to make decisions with respect to detail about the future of the industry has been taken away.' Labor's specific objections to the legislation, more particularly to what it does not deal with and what it does not address, are as follows. Firstly, there is no reference at all to the establishment of the long awaited Track Authority-it has had various names; it was going to be Track Australia under the former government-and, effectively, the legislation empowers the two ministers to establish this authority without further reference to the parliament. If this legislation gets through in its current form-we will be moving amendments in consideration in detail to prevent this later on today-the proposed National Rail Infrastructure Authority, which will manage the track and which will be retained in Commonwealth ownership, will be able to be established by this government with no further reference to the parliament. Decisions about the types of access regimes that apply with respect to the use of the track, how it will be maintained, what sort of labour will be used and the types of funding arrangements will be taken out of the jurisdiction of this parliament with no further potential for the parliament-for people who represent constituencies in the parliament-to deal with those issues. It is more particularly significant that there is no reference to this proposal when we consider the recent budgetary estimates that have been applied with respect to the Track Authority. In 1995, under the then Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, the Labor government committed itself to $370 million over five years for the Track Authority. This was reduced to about $240-odd million in the budget of last year. Again this year it has been reduced to $185 million, although the minister seems to be a bit confused because he put out a press release saying it was $175 million. In an extraordinary example of how Iittle there was for transport in this year's budget, he actually sought to make a virtue out of a vice and put out a press release proclaiming how wonderful it was that the government was going to set up a track authoritysomething that the government had previously announced, something that the previous government had previously announced and something on which he was now proposing to spend less than half what the former government was going to spend. But he had so little to say and so little good news that he had to tum bad news into good news. I do not think too many people were fooled by it. The second issue on which there is great concern on the part of the opposition, and I suspect other parties in this parliament, is that there are no details in this legislation with respect to the regulatory arrangements that will apply with respect to the operations of the rail system. Clearly, there is a substantial difference, as there is in the airline industry. When you remove dominant public sector operation and replace it with private operation you have to have a different regulatory regime. There are questions of train control, operation, safety, access and all sorts of things that need to be dealt with. Again the parliament is being told, 'Don't you worry about that. Leave that up to the ministers. We'll sort all that out. You don't have any entitlement to a say.' The third issue the opposition is concerned about is that there is no guarantee with respect to services. People in western New South Wales, for example, are worried-and with good reason-about the future of the Indian Pacific, which plays a very significant role for communities such as Broken Hill, Parkes and the like as a major transport artery. Others are worried about the future of the Overland, the Ghan and, of course, things like the grain lines in South Australia, the freight lines in Tasmania, and so it goes on. We are not being told anything. No guarantees have been given about the future of these operations or the future of community service obIigations. The opposition is particularly concerned also about a number of issues that apply with respect to the work force of Australian National. There is no labour adjustment program. Undoubtedly, if privatisation proceeds, some workers wilJ get jobs with future private operators, but many will not. If those workers are in places like Port Augusta, their ability to access training to ensure they have some chance of getting future employment in alternative areas is very limited and very costly without there being a labour adjustment program, such as the program the former government put in place with respect to workers who had been retrenched from Australian National but which this government cut and now refuses to replace. There is no specific provision being made for most apprentices currently employed by Australian National, particularly people who are roughly in the middle of their apprenticeship; suddenly, they are going to be left high and dry. No guarantees have been given about their future. No guarantees have been '- iven that they will be able to complete their apprenticeship, the learning of the skills in their acquisition of the trade for which they were taken on by Australian National. There is no detail about the future shape of the industry, the future role that the industry will play with respect to the overall transport picture in the economic arrangements of Australia. There is no gu'arantee that predatory asset stripping will not occur, particularly with things like the workshops, where there are many private competitors and a significant oversupply of workshop capacity. One of the risks that this government should be guarding against, and the parliament should be concerned about, is the proposition that another owner may buy one of those workshops, strip it of its saleable or useable assets and close down. Also, in recent weeks two issues with respect to the entitlements of workers have emerged with which the government has failed to deal and which are of considerable concern. Superannuation is one. The Australian National principal scheme, which was established seven years ago, does not have full vesting entitlements for workers who are deemed to have resigned. In fact, I think it takes 15 years before you get full vesting rights to the employer contributions. That means that it is impossible for workers who are in that scheme to get their full superannuation entitlements. But they are not resigning, even though they are deemed under the scheme to be resigning; they are being retrenched-they are being compulsorily retrenched in effect. They are being denied their full superannuation entitlements, yet an amount of $4 1/2 million in surplus is anticipatgreat ed to be in the fund once all of these arrangements are completed. So we will be seeing somewhere in the vicinity of a third of the workers in Australian National being denied their full superannuation entitlements and, at the same time, the government-because it is the government who controls the decisions-effectively reaping $4V2 million out of their money. That is, money that has been put aside by their employer for them, for their superannuation, will be taken by the government. That is outrageous. It is something that the government has known about for some time and has refused to deal with. The final issue, the full detail about which I am still endeavouring to find out, relates to a small number of people who have resigned on ill-health workers compensation. After having been told that they would not get a redundancy, Australian National then apparently changed its mind and said, 'Yes, people in that situation will be included in the redundancies, but not retrospectively.' It would appear that there may be some people who. since the minister's announcement, have resigned and who are now in a position where they are being told they will not get the redundancy but that those who are in the it same situation who have not yet resigned will get the redundancy. In effect, the government is saying, 'Trust us, give us carte blanche, give the two ministers the capacity to do what they like and-don't you worry about that-they'll make the decisions about the future of the industry.' It is abundantly clear that they have no vision, no strategy, no plan for the future of rail in this country; no sense of how rail can playa substantial, continuing role in our overall transport arrangements. We disagree with the privatisation of Australian National; we do not support it. But our overall commitment, beyond that issue, is to the best available rail system with the most number of jobs, the best quality services and the greatest efficiency for the transport system in this country. It is interesting to note that the Launceston Examiner-not necessarily renowned as a supporter of the Labor Party-described our reasons for taking the response we are taking with respect to the legislation as reasonable. In fact, I quote from their editorial of 28 May: 'Labor's declared reasons for deferral sound reasonable.' I think that says it all. The unions are opposed to the sale for similar reasons. The representatives of the workers in Australian National have put forward similar justifications. However, the minister had the gall to stand up here the other day in question time and say that I did not have the guts to go to Port Augusta. I was there on Monday to talk to the workers for the second time since this issue has emerged. The minister has not been there since he became a minister. The former minister, the member for Kingsford-Smith, had the guts to front up there. He had the guts to go along when sometimes there was bad news, such as that involving more retrenchments. He had the guts to go there and talk to the workers and explain the government's position. This minister will not. There is a rumour that he might go there in JUly. That has been promised before, so we will wait and see. Mr Martin Ferguson-He'll probably use Dick Smith's helicopter.",24
11,Mr T ANNER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"That is right; he will probably get a helicopter ride from one of his mates to go up there, as the honourable member for Batman indicates. It is natural that some people in the work force want this issue resolved. They have had enough and want to go; others do not. Different people are affected differently. The opposition is concerned that further delay may damage Australian National further. But let us ask where the delay is coming from. It has taken weeks for this debate even to occur. The government has not been able to organise its own schedule to get the legislation quickly to this House-and, indeed, the same will occur with the Senate. The process of bidding, discussions and expressions of interest has been prolonged. So what is happening now is: yes, there is delay, but it is being caused by the government. Labor has put its position out into the public arena very early. It has indicated to the government that there are a number of issues that it should be addressing and is failing to address and that the current legislation is completely unacceptable. The government, as yet, has failed to respond. We are throwing down the challenge to the government to address these issues--both the broad, big picture issues with respect to the future of rail in thIS coum'y and also, importantly, the specific issues that relate to the interests of the workers. At the moment we have a fire sale. We have no plan, no vision for the future, no guarantees with respect to the future of services, no guarantees with respect to the future of jobs and no guarantees with respect to the future of those who cannot get jobs and their capacity to retrain. We have a situation where all of the other players-the unions, minor parties in the Senate and the Labor Party-are saying, 'What we need is some detail of the government's plans and the capacity to address these issues, to actually play a proper role as a parliament, as representatives of the Australian people.' At the moment all we are getting is: trust us, carte blanche, abuse from the minister, and absolute hypocrisy. This is one of the situations where the Senate and the parliament can exercise genuine accountability, can require accountability of the government. This government effectively is asking this parliament to abrogate its responsibility as a legislative body and simply hand over all power to the two ministers to make all decisions with respect to the future of the Australian rail industry without telling the parliament and without telling AN workers what it intends to do. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House declines to give the Bill a second reading until such time as: (I) the Government develops a coherent policy for the Australian rail industry; (2) the Government reaches agreement with South Australia and Tasmania on funding assistance for the development of their rail infrastructures; (3) the Government provides a Labour Market Adjustment Program for displaced Australian National Railway Commission employees and improves its Regional Adjustment Package; (4) the Government guarantees existing passenger service operations and concession arrangements; (5) the Government guarantees the employment and training of apprentices currently employed by the Australian National Railways Commission until the completion of their contracts; (6) the South Australian and Tasmanian Governments have put in place safety and regulatory arrangements for the rail industry; (7) the Australian National Railways Commission demonstrates that all employees that have left Australian National since 24 November 1996 as a result of work related illness or injury have been offered a redundancy payment; and (8) the Australian National Railways Commission alters the trust deed of the AN Principal Scheme to allow full vesting of employer contributions to all employees that have left leave Australian National after 24 November 1996 and to ensure that appropriate adjustment payments are made to those people who have already left Australian National's employment"".",31
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Martin Ferguson-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,32
13,Ms WORTH,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"It was said after the last election that Labor had lost touch with the battlers, that it was letting them down and that it had misunderstood them. What we have just heard from the shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), is a true indication of that. He has said that workers support what Labor is doing. He is wrong. He has said that unions support what Labor is doing. He is wrong. Workers, union members and non-union members have contacted me in recent weeks and have told me of the faxes they have sent to the shadow minister for transport. Mr Tanner-All three of them.",32
14,Ms WORTH,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"I can give you a lot more than that. I said, 'There is not much point sending faxes to the shadow minister for transport because I do not think he is going to let that on to anybody.' After hearing what he said this morning, it is clear that he has painted an entirely different picture. Labor wants to go on in the same old way. Losses for 1995-96 were likely to be around $150 million with debts and liabilities exceeding $1 billion. Yet Labor would like us to go on the same old way. Over the 13 years that Labor was in government, 7,000 jobs have gone. The Brew report commissioned by the government has been most useful because it has told us lots, but we did not have to rely on the Brew report; we only had to speak to the workers who have worked for AN. I have met some whose fathers and grandfathers have worked on the railways, as have other colleagues of mine. But, no, the member for Kingsford Smith (Mr Brereton) as recently as January 1996-just a few days before the election was announced-was saying at the Islington workshops in my electorate that all was well, everything was on track, there was or no need for anyone to be concerned. This was at a time when he had already signed off more jobs to the dust heap. It was a time when the election was about to be announced. Labor's record with rail is absolutely disgraceful. I think that the shadow minister for transport, who has quickly disappeared out the door, really knows this. There is no better example than the fact that there is no member of the opposition from Tasmania or South Australia speaking on this legislation this morning. That is an indication that they know they have been wrong. No member from those states that are most affected is prepared to come in here and defend Labor and defend the fact that they have said they will block this in the Senate. Senators from Tasmania or South Australia will be doing their states no good at all by blocking this sale. Rail has been on the decline; there are difficulties there. Governments just have not managed it terribly well. When this government comes along after only 15 months in office and tries to do something, they want to spoil it. They would rather stand on their hopeless record than join us in a bipartisan way to see whether something can be done to maintain a viable rail industry for Australia and viable jobs for the people suffering from the lack of them. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has been to Port Augusta too. He said on that occasion-and I was there representing the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)-that Labor would stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Port Augusta. They are hardly standing shoulder to shoulder with the people of Port Augusta over thisMr Martin Ferguson interjecting",32
15,Ms WORTH,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"I am going to refer to what other people are saying in a moment, and many are from Port Augusta and from the Islington workshops. I questioned him at the time as to whether he had been standing shoulder to shoulder with the member for Kingsford Smith when he was signing off more jobs from Port Augusta to the dust heap. Some of the comments made by the shadow minister are not too difficult to rebut. Towards the end of his speech he said that there were problems with superannuation. The government has already committed $112 million to refund redundancy payouts as well as $580 million to cover superannuation and an extra $90 million to cover unfunded contributions such as leave. Then we come in here and hear these unsubstantiated claims from the shadow minister for transport. It is an absolute disgrace. The shadow minister does not seem to want to believe this. He claims that he has the support of the unions, and this is what I find most amazing. In yesterday's Advertiser, a South Australian paper, the public transport union state secretary, Mr Rex Phillips, warned that any delay would cause 'un-needed heartache and grief for workers'. That is certainly the message that I have been getting from the workers. It might seem strange to some members on the other side that a Liberal member is hearing more stories from union membership than they are themselves. I have to say that I have enjoyed the trust which has developed through being able to represent workers from the Islington workshops over a period of years who know that when they ring my office they are going to get attention and be given assistance. It is also interesting to note the transcript of an ABC radio interview from Port Augusta in the last couple of days. The shadow minister has claimed credit for visiting Port Augusta when there are people up there who thought he should have stayed away. The newsreader stated: Rail unions say they're worse off after a meeting with the federal opposition's shadow transport minister in Port Augusta on the future of Australian National. Lindsay Tanner has met about 50 workers. The federal opposition has threatened to block the sale of AN but Len Scharenberg of the Australian Workers Union says that means no job guarantees for the workers. He says the opposition has turned its back on rail workers. This is the unions in Port Augusta. Later in the interview, when asked whether there was any point to the visit, Len Scharenberg said: Well after a fair bit of soul searching the majority of the workers in Port Augusta had agreed to a sale, we seen that as the best way of keeping the workshops viable, and then to see our own people coming out and endorsing the blocking of the sale, it sort of left us with a bit of egg on our face. When he was asked how the workers were feeling, he said: Between a rock and a hard place. He then goes on: ... we can't see any light at the end of the tunnel. I mean I must say as much as it hurts me that after Lindsay's visit we're in even worse than we were before. Len continues later in the interview: ... we're in the lap of the Gods now. Just in the lap of the Gods. So much for Labor standing up for the workers and so much for Labor standing up for the battlers; they have been let down. The workers also feel that the situation has been totally taken out of their hands. Could anyone believe a word that the shadow minister has said after we have heard him in here today claiming worker support and claiming union support after what has just been on the media record in the last couple of days. There are also the faxes that I have had. He said, as he was walking out interjecting, that he had three faxes. I am just wondering-I know he is after the leadership at some time in the future-if he has been honest enough to tell the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) about the messages he is getting. If Labor would like to change their mind and support this sale and stand up for the unions and the workers there, then I am happy to provide them with all the faxes and all the letters that I have got here.",33
16,Mr CADMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,How many are there?,33
17,Ms WORTH,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"There are over 20 or 30 there. That does not count any that have gone to my colleagues. I know that the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) has certainly had the same sort of representations. In the appropriation debate I quoted a couple of these faxes, but I might just do it again. A letter from a locomotive maintenance worker at the AN workshops states: It is my belief that Australian National should sold because we, the employees, are sick and of being in limbo. Labor started the demise of Australian National with the introduction of the National Rail Corporaworkers. tion and are now extending the agony by blocking the sale of Australian National in the Senate. I think it is unfair to prolong the uncertainty and operations urge you and your fellow ministers to do all your power to allow the sale process to continue with the sale taking place as soon as possible. believe that it is our only hope to some sort future in the industry. I think that it would be fair and equitable that Australian National employees be made redundant and the choice of employment with the purchaserls be left to the successful tenderls and the relevant individuals. Another letter from a locomotive electrical operator at Islington said: Can you ask the following questions of the opposition. because I cannot possibly see any political mileage in the non-sale of the skeletal remains Australian National. 1. Why is the Federal Labor opposition opposed the sale of Australian National when it was government that started the demise of Australian National with the introduction of the National Corporation? 2. Why doesn't the Federal opposition allow sale of Australian National so that WE, the remaining employees know where WE stand so that can plan our futures instead of being used political punching bag? That is what the workers, the union memberaccess ship. supposedly your supporters, the you have deserted, are saying. No wonder they are communicating with a Liberal membecome ber of parliament. They know they are going to get better representation. They know lines somebody will stand up in this place and put their case. If the previous minister for transport in the last government had honestly consulted with them and acted on things, then there would not have been any need for a Brew report because he would have been putting changes in action then and the taxpayers of Australia would not be funding the debts that they are now having to. The history of government ownership of railways in Australia has seen a declining work force, declining market share and spiralling debts. Government ownership has be resulted in the political intervention in the rail tired industry to the detriment of its long-term viability and, as I have already demonstrated to you this morning, to the detriment of the It has allowed government owned rail to behave as monopolistic providin ers of services, inflexible in their practices and unresponsive to the needs of customers. I The rail industry needs 10, 20 or 30 years of planning and this has not been achieved when short-term political ends have dictated investALL ment decisions, rail operations and reform. Last weekend, the Weekend Australian highlighted the problem of government ownership of rail where the New South Wales rail union is opposing efforts to reform rail maintenance in New South Wales, reforms designed to achieve greater efficiency in rail. The involvement of the private sector in rail of is not unique to Australia, once again something that you did not hear from the shadow to minister this morning. It has occurred and a Labor continues to occur around the world-in Europe, the United Kingdom, the United Rail States, Asia and even South America and New Zealand. Evidence from all countries the demonstrates that, although the particular WE environments of each are different, the comas a mon threads of private sector investment, introduction of competition and provision of have led to a revitalised rail and new people opportunities in that industry. Countries where the private sector has involved in taking over moribund rail operations have seen old lines reopened, new constructed, freight tonnages increased, new rail jobs created, private sector investment in track and rolling stock, and a much greater focus on customer service. As I have already demonstrated to you this morning, the Labor Party's history of ownership of AN is appalling-job losses, line closures, freight lost and massive spiralling debt. Labor told the AN work force that all was well and that they would have jobs in the future. Yet the Labor Party secretly signed hundreds of rail jobs and approved the ness plans that would see further service reductions and job losses. The AN Commisby sion itself knew that this was not true as the chairman advised Minister Sharp on his Rail coming to office. The minister, as I have mentioned, commissioned the Brew report to reveal the true position-7,000 jobs gone in 13 years; 50 per cent of the South Australian rail network closed and ripped up; a $1 billion debt no way of servicing it; passenger rail services investment. to Mount Gambier, Burra, Peterborough, Port Augusta, Why alia, and Broken Hill all closed; a reduction in the frequency of the Indian Pacific services; and the closure of the Transmillion Australian rail service, a train that operated Adelaide-Perth and supplemented the Indian Pacific which operates Sydney-Perth. The Brew report revealed that AN employ the ees were being subsidised by the taxpayer $30,000 per head per annum, and this would increase to $220,000 per annum if nothing was done. But today Labor says they do not want us to do anything about it. Business levels were decreasing and there was no way that AN could cover its costs. It was technimember cally bankrupt. The report revealed that the way the former Labor government had set up National Rail was the cause of much of AN's problems. National Rail was given all the best assets the revenue generating interstate business, AN was left with all the debt and no possipeople bility of repaying the debt. AN was doomed from the day National Rail began, as Senator Collins is quoted as saying in the Senate of references committee hearings in Adelaide and Port Augusta. The government announced a $2 billion reform program to fix these problems. The government is selling Australian National its shares in National Rail and is setting up a Senate. national track authority to bring single management to the interstate standard gauge network. The sale of AN is supported by AN workSenator ers, as I have explained this morning. It supported by a petition to the Senate signed by 120 workers of Australian National at Port off Augusta. It is supported by the customers of busiAustralian National. I have got copies of letters outlining this support. It is supported the South Australian and Tasmanian governments. It is supported by the Australian Association, the peak rail industry body with over 80 members. It is supported by Rail 2000, the rail lobby group in South Australia. It is supported by the AN Commission and management. It is supported by National Rail. As I have also said, evidence around the with world supports private sector enterprise Labor, as we have heard from the shadow minister this morning, would not have us believe any of that. They are delaying the $20 rail reform transition program and the benefits it will bring to rural South Australia and the metropolitan and north-western suburbs of Adelaide. That $20 million is for creation of long-term, sustainable jobs. It by is not for programs in which somebody goes in and comes out at the other end after six months and still does not have a real job. They are programs that will lead to long-term, sustainable jobs. I have been chairing some consultative meetings on this issue. I am a of the state committee looking at the matter. I know about the quality of many of the submissions that have been put forward. Most of the first round of $10 million goes to the Port Augusta region, but $1.5 million and will be available for the north-western suband urbs, some of which are in my electorate, and there will benefit from that. But it will be held up; those programs will not go ahead. They will not stand a chance. That first round $10 million will not be available until after this sale legislation is passed. So if Labor, Democrat and Independent senators wish to do something for South Australia and Tasmania, they know what course of action they and can take when this legislation reaches the The Senate had a committee inquiry into the matter. It was interesting to note some of the things that were said during that inquiry. Collins, as I have already mentioned, is was quoted in regard to what had happened to Australian National when National Rail was set up. The colourful Mayor of Port Augusta, Joy Baluch, who stands up for her city, had things to say as well. She could not believe that any senator would be dumb enough-I think those were the words she used-to block the sale. Senator Collins asked her how many senators she knew. Her reply was, 'Well, I know you, dear.' So from the city of Port Augusta there were strong words of support. Many letters, faxes and editorials in the media have been written in support of the sale, and many workers want AN sold. From the workshops at Islington, from the workers and unions, who obviously speak to me more frankly and more frequently than they communicate with the Labor Party-that party which is meant to be supporting themthere has been strong support for the sale of Australian National. I would have thought that after Labor's record during its 13 years in government they would join us in doing something about this. If the problems are not solved, there will not be a viable industry. Rail is important. As my colleague the member for Grey has told the chamber, rail has a proud history. It helped to open up this country. As I said, I have met workers whose fathers and grandfathers worked on the rail. They must be given a chance. We must look at ways of doing things differently. If there have been failures in the past, there is no point in going on in the same old way and having one failure after another. I call on all parties to get together on this, to do the decent thing and support the sale of Australian National.  a.m.)-I listened with interest as the crocodile tears flowed from the eyes of the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), because I have heard her speak in similar terms in respect of the car industry.",33
18,Mr CADMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,You wouldn't have stuffed it up if you had been the minister! ,36
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"The member for Shortland will ignore the member for Mitchell and address his remarks through the chair.  Liberal and National Party governments in respect of rail services in this country is a very shabby history. If the honourable member for Adelaide wants to refer, as her opening gambit, to losses incurred by AN, let me remind her that when we came to government in 1983 the loss incurred in the previous year by the Australian National Railways Commission-which at that time embraced all of its services, from Kalgoorlie across to Broken Hill and from Alice Springs down to Adelaide and all the country rail services in South Australia-in today's terms was $192 million. The AN which she is now referring to is the remnants left after the main-line operations were taken out to be absorbed into the National Rail Corporation. So what we are looking at is the result of the formation of the National Rail Corporation, which was strongly supported by those opposite when in opposition. They cannot have it both ways. If you are going to make comparisons, please make comparisons on a like basis, not a selective basis. The member for Adelaide referred to the performance of the government railway systems, as did the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) in his second reading speech. He opened with these words: Australian National's operations, in common with many other government owned railways, are characterised by a large and increasing debt and a declining market share. The performance of rail stands in stark contrast to the road transport sector, which has been very successful in addressing customer needs and therefore increasing its market share. That is cynical. It is dishonest. It does not present the picture. Whoever drafted those words knew when they drafted those words that they did not present to this parliament an accurate picture of what constituted AN or the problems with AN-the segments that were left following the formation of the National Rail Corporation. AN's operations were those sectors and those assets that were left. That had been drafted by a person who knew full well that the National Rail Corporation and revenue earning sections which had been taken out and placed into the National Rail Corporation had been removed. He should not demean all railway people and the performance of the decisions made by this parliament and by the people who manage those organisations. In the case of AN, certainly the staff at like all other railway people, are proud people. In the railway industry, where there are generations upon generations of peoplestarting in the last century-working in the rail system, they have good right to be proud. They were the people who developed much of this nation, albeit, they destroyed the horse-drawn transport industry and the river boat industry and, in many ways, the coastal shipping industry. But they were the state-of the-art transport system in their time. That generation upon generation of service is a very proud service. I have sat in the dust and talked to the people in Port Pirie and in Port Augusta and in Peterborough and in Whyalla on numerous occasions in the past. I very much understand and feel for those people. But what we are seeing in this situation, which is being quite cynically exploited by this government, is that you have people who have had disappointment upon disappointment, who see no future with this government for a publicly owned rail system. They see the sale, getting out and taking a redundancy package, as their only hope of some way out and some way into the future. That has been very carefully exploited by the previous speaker and by this government in the contributions that have been made by the minister. If you look back to when Australian National was formed, it followed on from the 1975 legislation and then from National Party ministers from 1975 through to 1983 who were responsible for the administration of the Australian National Railways Commission. Their record was a very shabby record but, if you tum to the role that was played by that rail system, to put things in their proper perspective, you will see the posters of the Trans Australia line advertising their travel. They read something like 'Trans Australiasee Australia in comfort', 'Save days-travel Trans Australia'. We have gone from that to where it now takes 31/2 days to get to the west by rail and 3'12 hours to come back by air service. So the world has moved on and the nature of the services has moved on. What is wrong with this legislation? There are two fundamental things wrong with the AN, legislation. The first is the power-were this legislation to pass through the Senate-it would give to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) to virtually do as they will in respect of assets of the organisation and the formation of the national track authority. The second is there is no national strategy. It is not good transport planning to be considering the formation or disintegration of a rail system to the exclusion of all other forms of transport. There is no better source to go to than the recent report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on the Brew report. Their recommendation on page 60 states: The Committee therefore recommends that before proceeding with the sale process, the Government should develop a coherent land transport policy framework, taking into account financial, economic, social and environmental goals and recommending mid and long term investment programs for road and rail in all major corridors. That is a current recommendation, avoided completely in this parliament by this government. Let me go to the report from the national transport planning task force of 1994. Recommendation 2, page viii, states: Road, rail, port and airport infrastructure investments and their funding arrangements should be considered within a framework that allows intermodal, network and corridor considerations to be evaluated transparently. There is the best report that has been done on transport needs and the establishment of a proper transport strategy in this nation's history. It is current. It is right across the three forms of transport. It is not being picked up in this legislation. There is no regard had to its recommendations or to its content. Then we can go to the meeting of this morning's House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Micro Economic Reform and the terms of reference that have been handed to us by the minister. These are the terms of reference for the inquiry into the role of rail in the national transport network. It states: I How current administrative, institutional, operational and pricing arrangements can be improved to promote effective and efficient use of the national rail network, and to investigate the role of the Commonwealth and Statesrrerritories in achieving consistency in these areas. 2 The opportunities to increase the participation of the private sector in the rail industry. 3 The opportunities to maximise access to, and utilisation of, the rail network. 4 Effective investment and ownership arrangements for the rail network. S Characteristics of international best practice in rail operations. They are the terms of reference of the inquiry we are about to embark upon, but this legislation precedes all of that. So this is really from this government the blind leading the blind. There is a bit of a stunt. They see an opportunity to exploit. In respect of AN, they have misrepresented the situation to talk about AN's losses and the fabricated figures and the selective use of information by the minister and by those documents that have been circulated, particularly by Brew. Brew had a vested interest, which was what was disclosed, and he is happy to withdraw. His report, in my view, was not a report of integrity, was not a report of impartiality and was not a report designed to present the most accurate position and the position of the best interest of this nation and of this parliament. When you look at all these things you can see that the government is going for a quick fix here. It is opportunistic. Let us look at it again from the broader view of what is best for Australia and what should be happening in this situation. The national transport planning task force report shows that in 198889-these are the latest figures which were available-on a weight basis rail carried 23 per cent of the transport task in this country, road 74 per cent and sea three per cent, out of a total task of 1,337 million tonnes of goods or freight transported in that year. But, looking at it on a weight-distance basis, rail's share rises from 23 per cent to 32 per cent, road's share drops to 33 per cent-most of road is short haul; it is metropolitan, intraurban, intra-region-and sea's share rises from three per cent on a weight basis to 35 per cent on a weight-distance or tonne-kilometre basis, on a total task of 257 billion net tonne-kilometres. If you look at value it all changes again. Seventy three per cent of the expenditure on transport in the years 1988-89 went on road, 19 per cent on rail, six per cent on sea and two per cent on air. That is the analysis of the foundation of transport in this nation. This legislation ought to give us the best set of integrated transport arrangements for this country; it should not just opportunistically pluck out information to deal with the situation on a budgetary basis to the exclusion of what is best for Australia. The other thing that greatly worries me about all this is this government's ideology. We saw this ideology in the minister's second reading speech when he referred to AN's losses by saying: To a large extent this situation reflects the fundamental problems arising from government owning and operating businesses that are more efficiently conducted by the private sector. That is bunkum. It is total misrepresentation. I am sure it was not written within the department. Those words came straight out of the minister's office. Ownership is not the problem-that is straight ideology; the problem is the nature of the system and the remnants of what was the Australian National Railways Commission and its interstate operations. This government's ideology is to sell it off: whatever it is, sell it. That is the policy of this government. If you can get a buyer, sell it. Based on that ideology, any business that is government owned and operated would be more efficiently conducted by the private sector. Ask some of the Bond shareholders. Ask some of the Alan Bond companies about that bit of ideology. Run through the stock exchange. Ask some of the shareholders in some of the other companies on the stock exchange. Have a look at all ideology about private versus public. There is another thing that concerns me about the nature of the transport task around the world. In the United States-the Mecca of free enterprise-there are two main rail operators in the west and two main rail operators in the east. With rail transport there is a growing tendency toward the provision of point-to-point services, door-to-door services. The European Commission is following the same line so that there is an integrated service: transport from one place in one nation to another place in the same nation or from one place in one nation to another place in another nation. A seamless transport system is being provided. It is all linked together. The two largest markets are looking at the integration of rail systems to get economies of scale, efficiencies of management and reliability of service. As I said, efficiency of service and reliability are so important. In this country rail is being fragmented. It is a mickey mouse system in comparison with the systems in the United States and Europe and it seems this government is determined to make it a minnie mouse system by fragmenting it into smaller and smaller bits. Sure as night follows day, later on there will be a reconsolidation of rail systems in this country. The system will go back to being a larger system, because that is where efficiency and reliability of service come from. I have a great fear about the direction being followed by this government-it is simply ideological. Turning to what should happening, I have explained my concerns about having a series of micro-systems when the world is moving to larger and more efficient systems. But the situation in this country will be further exacerbated because this government has a policy of opening up Australian coastal shipping to foreign shipping. The effect is that the cargoes which are being lost to foreign ships operating between Australian ports are not so much cargoes from Australian flag ships; they are cargoes from the National Rail Corporation. Rail and land transport cargoes are being lost to foreign shipowners and Third World seafarers. This government does not have a transport strategy. It is operating in isolation on this issue. It is not taking into account other forms of domestic transport or the prospect of integration. The government has another policy which for several years has damaged the Australian railway industry. The target of the Third World seafarers and the foreign shipowners is not so much the Australian coastal shipping scene; the target is to hit the National Rail Corporation. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know you understand this: effectively, Australian railway workers are being replaced by Third World seafarers. An analysis of the cargoes being carried under single voyage permits has been carried out288 such permits have already been granted in the first half of 1996 and we are looking at a figure well in excess of 500 for 1996-97. The analysis shows that the cargoes that are being carried are essentially cargoes from east to west and that they are containerised break bulk cargoes, not cargoes that are carried by Australian coastal vessels, which are mostly bulk cargoes. So here is the government's own shipping policy flying in the face of what purports to be its rail policy. That is why I support the amendment that has been put forward by the shadow minister, the member for Melbourne, which says: ""the House declines to give the Bill a second reading until such time as: (I) the Government develops a coherent policy for the Australian railway industry; (2) the government reaches agreement with South Australia and Tasmania on funding assistance for the development of their rail infrastructures; Remember that in Tasmania the rail system is a fundamental part of their land transport system. I will come back to the amendment in a moment, but it underlines the fact that this government does not have a transport strategy. It has something that it wants to do in rail-in this case, in this legislation, that is based on an ideology-and it has something it wants to do, again based on ideology, in shipping, because it hates the membership of the Maritime Union of Australia. It cannot remove its blinkers to see that all of the wiser countries in the Western world are looking to expand their shipping industry because they recognise the value in jobs and financial turnover that comes from all the shore based industries that are associated with your own flag shipping industry. The amendment goes on in part (4) to say that the House declines to give the Bill a second reading until such time as: (4) the Government guarantees existing passenger service operations and concession arrangements; (5) the Government guarantees the employment and training of apprentices currently employed by the Australian National Railways Commission until completion of their contracts; (6) the South Australian and Tasmanian Governments have put in place safety and regulatory arrangements for the rail industry; (7) the Australian National Railways Commission demonstrates that all employees that have left Australian National since 24 November 1996 as a result of work related illness or injury have been offered a redundancy payment; The last part deals with the vesting of employer contributions to employees that have left or leave Australian National after 24 November 1996. There are groups of employees, as the shadow minister mentioned earlier, who are not being fairly dealt with in this legislation. Hopefully, the legislation will be amended in the Senate to make sure that those people are properly dealt with and that they do get a fair go. The other thing that is of great concern is that, in the event of these powers being passed on to the ministers by this legislation, they will not be accountable to the parliament and they will have a power that I think is unprecedented. I recommend to members that they look at the report of the national transport planning task force, because it considers what is the best system of transport services for Australia the nation, and it points to the need to improve the efficiency and the linkages between road, rail and sea. It also points out that nothing much has changed. Rail has a natural advantage in about 40 per cent of cargoes; road has a natural advantage in about 40 per cent of cargoes; and there is about 20 per cent that is left to compete in the middle. Overall, we want to see a system that is integrated as a whole. (Time expired)",36
20,Mr ANTHONY,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"Richmond) (11.32 a.m)I rise today to speak in favour of the government's policy of the AN sale. I would like to take up a number of points, if the  happens to remain in this chamber, on some of the comments that he made. One of the comments that I think should be corrected is this notion that this is driven by ideology; he said that we are selling everything. It is interesting that some of the greatthe est asset sales happened under the previous government-whether it was Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank-having promised the workers of which on numerous occasions that they would not sell-or whether it is the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. The honourable member talks about the reforms on the waterfront. An enormous amount of money was spent on waterfront reforms and today our container rate of shifting is still low. Indeed, the government strategy of a more efficient rail system will lead to greater efficiencies and it will lead to greater tonnage coming off roads onto rail and from ships to rail. This package is part of a $2 billion package. The AN sale is the beginning, and it will then move on to National Rail. The problems with AN today have been created by the previous government when they took out most of the valuable freight assets and put them into National Rail. That is why we have a situation today that we have to address. It is interesting that, as previous coalition speakers have mentioned, the unions support the package, the locals support it, the papers support it and the communities support it. Indeed it just highlights that the ALP are very much out of touch. This $2 billion package comprises: $325 million to the AN restructuring; $50 million to environment work to clean up potential sites; $800 million in retiring debts so that the future buyer of AN-whether it is as a whole or components of it-will be unencumbered; a large proportion, $580 million, to superannuation; and $90 million unfunded, which is very different from what the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has been saying in this parliament. There is also a further investment of $175 million in track access. The whole purpose is to develop a system that gives greater competition, greater flexibility and long-term job security, and gets the politics which have dominated the industry since Federation out of rail. The facts are that it was the ALP and the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton)-who, I am delighted to say, is in the chamber-who left AN in the trouble it is in at the moment. This sale is concentrating on the assets of AN in South Australia and of course Tasrail. As has been mentioned before, in the Brew report-and, I might add, Brew did not have a vested interest, which aspersion was cast by the member for Shortland-when NR was established, all of the profitable routes were taken out of AN and it was left with unprofitable routes, enormous debt and an uncompetitive passenger service. As even Senator Collins said, it was doomed from the very day the plan was cooked up. He should know, as a senator from the Northern Territory which has been trying to connect that line from Alice Springs to Darwin. It is interesting to look back at the history of AN and these crocodile tears that are coming from the opposition and to consider that 7,000 jobs were lost in 13 years under Labor. The financial loss of $150 million in 1995-96 would continue if nothing was done. In South Australia, AN has $1 billion worth of debt. Indeed, passenger services have diminished and many lines have been closed-whether to Mt Gambier, Port Augusta, Why alIa or Broken Hill. And of course there is the far less frequent service of the Indian Pacific. Unless we do something now it will be a basket case and there will be no hope for those people in South Australia and regional areas. The sale of AN is an integral part of the future rail reform of Australia. At the moment AN has debt of $30,000 per annum per employee. On current forecasts that would move to $220,000 per annum in the next couple of years, if we did nothing. It would be irresponsible of this government not to make the hard decisions that it has made. Even more irresponsible is the opposition's blatant and opportunistic blocking of legislation when even their own workers want it. AN will be sold-there have been over 50 registered interests-either with totally vertically integrated components or broken up into parts. It may well be the three passenger trains, the Ghan, the Indian Pacific and the Overlander. It may well be just the workshops at Whyalla. It may well be just Tasrail, which has worked quite well. Or it may be some of the intrastate tracks in that particular state. As I mentioned before, if you look back at the history of AN, it was left in this deplorable state because all the valuable assets were ripped out of it and put into NR. And the member for Shortland stands up here and says that NR is a great success. It is carrying less freight today than it was a year ago. If you talk to the private operators who use it, whether it is SCT, TNT or Patrick, they will tell you it has got worse. At the end of next year when the agreement unwinds-let us hope that the New South Wales government, which has been dragging the chain on this, comes to the party-it will be unwound and it will be sold. The deal you put together for National Rail is one in which the Commonwealth has 73 per cent of the equity but only 49 per cent of the voting rights. We never had a chance from day one. Let us look back at the history of rail. Five states have been rail players. When you go back to Federation, part of the problem is that we had three different networks-the narrow gauge, which is predominantly in Queensland, the standard gauge in New South Wales and WA, and broad gauge in Victoria. As we built the steel highway, this created problems for this country which have been naturally superseded in many areas by road, air or sea freight. The trans-Australian railway, which linked Perth to Adelaide and which opened up the west, was completed in 1917. That was one of the carrots that got Western Australia into the federation. It was the Labor government in the 1970s under Whitlam that tried to buy back the rail systems into a Commonwealth system. Only South Australia and Tasmania came to the party. That is why we are trying to sort out that problem now. If all the players had come together, maybe it would have been different. AN is the smallest of the rail operations in Australia. It has a track of about 6,151 kilometres capitalised at around $1.5 billion. VLine has 5,670 kilometres of track in Victoria and moves a smaller amount of freight. Westrail has 5,411 kilometres of track and is capitalised at $6.2 billion. In New South Wales, the old State Rail Authority, which has now been split up, has 8,000 kilometres of track and is capitalised at $15 billion. The big one is in Queensland-l0,000 kilometres of track and capitalised at $26.5 billion-a vertically integrated railway organisation. This government is trying to build an integrated transport policy, particularly with rail. The beginning of this is the sale of AN so we can get greater competition, greater flexibility, better services, lower costs and a more viable operation that does not cost the taxpayer an enormous amount of money and gives hope to communities, particularly in South Australia and Tasmania. There were some salient points made by the previous speaker. Out of capital city areas, rail still accounts for 56 per cent of the nonurban land freight. It is still the king of freight outside capital cities relative to trucks, which have 44 per cent of land freight. The trucking industry is seamless and reliable. It has about 20,000 operators, which is good for short haul. Like the trucking industry, there has to be greater competition put in for rail, just as has happened overseas in a number of other countries, particularly New Zealand. One of the success stories is West Coast Rail, which is now running on a private line in Victoria. They have increased services to Warmambool and a number of other regional communities. They still have difficulties, particularly the interstate operators who are in a partnership-some of them with National Rail, some of them not. They still have to go through 13 different authorities to move goods from the Port of Fremantle or from Perth through to Adelaide and Melbourne. It is inefficient. To think that the previous speaker was standing up here espousing the efficiencies and the claims of National Rail is quite frightening considering that he was a previous minister for transport in an earlier period of this country's history. The ALP's position, particularly with One Nation, was that they directed an enormous amount of money, perhaps with the best of reasons, into rail. They built crossing loops. Unfortunately, the crossing loops they built are too small now for the superfreighters coming from Brisbane to Sydney. They did not address the problems of congestion, particularly with freight trains in Sydney, where the rail links all hub into that area. They did do some positive things, I will hand them that. The standard gauge that went from Melbourne through to Adelaide was a positive move. But when they created this beast called National Rail, they saw it as their salvation and it just has not stacked up. This government has to clean that up and build so as to have not only some viable private operators but also a national track access regime, and that is what we are building towards. It is interesting to look at the United Kingdom. For 120 years prior to 1948 all the railway systems, which were built after the Industrial Revolution, were actually privately owned, and they worked well. Of course, straight after the war when the Labour Party was put back into office it nationalised them all. That has been the case until recently when it was privatised, and that has worked well. The key elements are safety, reliability, lower cost and frequency of service; and this is where rail has not been able to compete, principally in freight but also in passenger services, in this country. New Zealand had a government owned railway until recently. It has been privati sed. Transrail, as it is now called, has a large equity holder called Wisconsin, a major US operator, which came into it. The usual fears were voiced, but there has been a 15 per cent increase in passenger numbers. Instead of making enormous losses, Transrail is making good profits. It is actually building more track, expanding its services and more trains are running on time. That is what privatisation has done for rail in New Zealand. Indeed, the same is the case in the United States where most private operators are moving huge amounts of freight, where there are interrnodal ports and where there is road and rail access. The system is seamless and it does not matter how it is transported from A to B as long as it gets there on time. That is where they have been successful. That is exactly the vision that we want in Australia with rail. That is why the sale of AN is critical. If we do nothing, as has been demonstrated by previous speakers, the losses will accumulate and the services will be cut back even further. AN never had a chance after the main interstate freight assets were taken out of it and transferred to National Rail. It has to be sold. We need to get private operators into those short intrastate lines, those workshops and those icons, the Chan or the Indian Pacific. They are losing money hand over fist; a private operator is needed there who can use the services as a torch to attract not only domestic tourists but also foreign tourists. It will be done with government getting out of it. That is exactly the policy that the previous government was advocating when it privati sed Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank and, no doubt, would have done with Telstra if the now Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, had had his way. So the vision, from the sale of AN, is to give a private operator access into this area and then to move on with the sale of National Rail to link up all the rail links-it is a bit hard in Queensland because of the different gauges but you can get to Brisbane-and to have private operators running on those lines with equal access for people. We will have a national rail infrastructure entity through which the Commonwealth will still retain control of those main interstate lines and tracks. Even with the sale of AN and the sale of those particular intrastate lines, the Commonwealth will still retain an interest in the actual land that they are built on, and that goes for the state governments as well. That is exactly what the workers want: to be given these opportunities. As we look into the future, we will have a viable east-west link where ships will dock in Perth, as they do now-and the member for Shortland was quite deceptive in what he was saying because ships are doing that now: they are coming into those ports like Perth and they want to-and their cargoes sent across the Nullarbor. They want to do it with Brisbane and Acacia Ridge, with the rail line put through to Fisherman's Island. Ships want to dock there, put their cargoes on a train and get them straight through to Brisbane or through to Melbourne, which would be faster than sending a ship around the coast to the Port of Melbourne. Foreign carriers want to do that now. I might add that I got the impression that Australian National Line was held as a shining light in a previous speech today. That has made horrendous losses. It could not be sold. So the vision is that there will be in intermodal ports that will be seamless; that cargo can come into this country, can get off a ship, can get on to a train, can get to an intermodal port and on to a truck or into those particular locations. The vision is the completion of the line from Alice Springs to Darwin, an integration of the rail infrastructure-which should have been done not just by the previous government but by other governments back through our history-and a viable transport system from north to south and from east to west. There have been 50 expressions of interest for AN. This is just the beginning. If this is done right-and it should be bipartisan because it is ALP supporters who will be the beneficiaries-there will be new opportunities and new jobs. It is disappointing to hear the shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne, say that the only holes that he can put in this legislation concern the way the process has been conducted, not the spirit and the intent of it. I think the shadow minister should take his guide from Tommy the Tank Engine and go back home because he is not making a valuable contribution in this House. This is a good package. The government needs the sale of AN. It needs to rebuild, revive and rejuvenate rail not for nostalgic reasons, not for the romance of rail, but to get greater efficiencies, to get cargo off the roads and back on to rail and to get cargo to locations quicker. The way to do that is to sell AN and to give it to private operators. I do not believe, though, that we should have a monopoly situation; we do need to have adequate entrants coming into the market. The next step is track infrastructure and also adequate access rights. That is particularly important. I commend this bill to the House.",40
21,Mr DARGA VEL,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"Fraser) (11.52 a.m.)That says it all. The intellectual fortitude that the government brings to bear in the debate on the rail infrastructure of regional Australia is reduced to Thomas the Tank Engine. It is very sad to bear witness to an attempt by the Liberal government to sell out our national railway. It is the backbone of regional industry in this country, particularly in South Australia and Tasmania. It is very sad to bear witness to yet another attempt by the government to sell out regional Australia-selling off public assets and adding to the crisis in employment opportunities, particularly in our regional centres in Australia. Let us look at the evidence of the sell out. We have the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) tripping off to the UK to watch the cricket at Lords. Meanwhile, workers at BHP are still waiting for the Prime Minister to make good his promise to go and talk to them about their concerns and about the lack of a consistent, coherent government industry policy and a steel plan. The minister could not even be bothered to talk to the workers in National Rail as minister. He has been not been to major National Rail workplaces as the shadow minister has. We now have a government getting more workers sacked with this potential sell off of the National Railways Commission. This bill refuses to guarantee existing services. There are at least 2,600 jobs in regional Australia, as well as vital railway services, that are placed at risk by this bill. This does not include all of the other workers who depend on the operation of our railways to keep their jobs. The government does not appear to care that this hill, which is still vague and fuzzy around the edges with regard to the real future of our national railways, is spreading fear and concern amongst railway workers all over Australia. The government is blackmailing battlers in regional areas who have given their lives to maintaining and developing our national railways. It has put a gun to their heads and is threatening to close the lines if the bill does not pass. What sort of government does this to people-revelling in the fear that they have been able to generate in the hearts of regional workers? People in regional Australia are being held to ransom by the government on this issue-support privatisation or you lose your jobs. There is no guarantee that they will keep their jobs if they do support this Liberal government's agenda of privatisation. Of course there are railway workers who are scared in this environment and of course there are railway workers who are consequently attracted to the minor safety net of privatisation that is brought about under the threat that is perpetrated by this government. Of course there is a minor union that is concerned about the opposition's intention to oppose or to amend this bill. However, the SBU, the single bargaining unit, representing the majority of workers in AN has carried a resolution supporting the opposition's moves to oppose and amend this legislation. The coalition's pontifications about the support it purportedly has from AN workers is absolutely hollow. The government plans to make all staff redundant, with the new operators being able to recruit staff as they wish, if they wish. The government has sold these people out without even ensuring that they will be able to get jobs with the new proprietors. The rail unions are asking for continued employment and training of current AN apprentices to the satisfactory completion of their contracts of training without being disadvantaged-that is, wage maintenance. What undertaking can the government give that this bill will deliver for apprentices? Our young people in regional Australia need jobs. They need careers. They need futures. It is commonly known that there is a crisis of confidence amongst young people in regional Australia. There is a higher incidence of suicide and substance abuse among these people. This bill does nothing to reassure young people in regional Australia of their futures. Railway workers have indicated through their unions that they want to make a labour adjustment program a specific feature of the regional impact fund, with an increase to the overall fund to support the workers who will lose their jobs if this bill passes. They are not asking for much-just to ensure that money will be available to clean up the mess once the Liberals have finished chopping up our railways and just enough money to address some of the economic and social problems that this bill will cause in regional Australia. None of these protections for regional workers and their families are in this bill. But more than that, workers have indicated through their unions that they are concerned not just about their own jobs but the regional economies themselves. They are concerned about the future of Australian railways for all of Australia. This bill will destroy the Australian rail industry as we know it. The railway unions have started the fight for all other rail users as well as the workers, including the majority of industry players who move freight by rail and pensioners who travel by train, many people in regional Australia and throughout the land are affected by this bill. The unions have called for guaranteed service levels for the Indian Pacific, the Ghan and the Overland, an overhaul of the Overland rolling stock and guaranteed continued concession levels for pensioners on these services. Where are the guarantees from this government to industry in regional Australia? Where are the guarantees from this government for pensioners who need to rely on rail transport in regional Australia? There are none. This government is seeking to abrogate the responsibility of the parliament to people in regional Australia who rely on rail transportation. The workers have asked for the retention of all services and lines unless there is an independent public inquiry which determines that they can be closed. This already applies in South Australia. But this bill leaves the Tasmanian services and lines unprotected. Why will the government not support the opposition's calls for a coherent rail policy? Why will the government not hear the opposition's calls for a coherent steel plan for that matter? Where is the member for the Parkes (Mr Cobb), whose electorate in western New South Wales stands to lose a great deal from his government's actions, in this debate? He is silent, complicitly supporting his government's attack on his electorate. The railway unions have called for a commitment from the government to intrastate rail infrastructure in South Australia and Tasmania and have opposed the sale of track infrastructure. Yet in its rail reform package in November last year the government provided inadequate funding for track upgrading to provide Australia with a decent interstate rail network. Now it has the temerity to tum around and say that this sector is not performing as well as it might. The government are out of touch with regional Australia. They do not know what the needs of regional are. They do not want to spend money to service those needs. Their solution is to sell out and then sell off. What this government does not understand is that rail is a vital link for Australian travellers and industries. Not everyone can do a John Sharp and jump the queue at the airport; many Australians cannot afford to travel by air. For all Australians an affordable, wellmaintained and cohesive rail service is essential. It is essential for developing and maintaining regional industries in Australia. Importantly, unions have urged the government to establish regulatory and safety frameworks in South Australia and Tasmania. Australians still remember and mourn the very few accidents we have suffered on our railways. Without adequate regulatory and safety frameworks, how will the government ensure that accidents do not occur? By abrogating the parliament's responsibility to the minister, clearly it cannot. There is no provision for any of these protections for our rail industry in the bill. With all of the pitfalls in this bill, all the bits of half-thought-out material that the government is peddling, the question has to be asked: what is the government attempting to do? John Howard continues to fiddle around while the Treasurer slashes and bums our national railways. He lets his minister for transport run around at the edges, with no idea of how to develop a coherent plan. But is this just incompetence or is it something more sinister? Why can't they tell us what they really want to do? Why release reports bit by bit? Why do they persist in frightening workers in regional areas by not giving them any certainty about what they are going to do with our national railways? This bill places our fragile regional economy at risk in places like Port Augusta, where workshops and infrastructure facilities are under severe threat of closure. Closure of workshops at Islington will further reduce the already declining heavy engineering industry in Adelaide, not that this appears to worry the government. I am concerned that those people in regional Australia who looked to the National Party in the hope that in government that party would deliver regional growth have been bitterly disappointed. This bill does nothing for rural Australians. Railways are commonly in public ownership throughout the world and for good reason. For Australia to sell off its railways in the general economic rationalist agenda that this government is running just does not work, and there will be plenty of people out of work as a consequence. This economic rationalist agenda has failed to provide Australia with a coherent national rail policy. In fact, the economic rationalist agenda underlying this bill reduces any capability we may have of the national rail plan that we in this country need for our future. Under this bill. our railways will become a weak link in any regional employment or industry strategy. Who then does this economic rationalist agenda serve? This is where we get into the really gory bits. It is clear that serves one group in this country and one group only. Why else would John Sharp appoint John Brew. who was proposing to act as a consultant to the Great Southern Railway Corporation, formed by the Macquarie Bank to buy and operate AN business, to conduct an inquiry into AN? Why else would the government delay the release of the full report of the Brew report and provide only an edited version of the executive summary of the report nearly three months after the report was provided to the minister for transport? The minister for transport maintains that only the edited version of the summary was made available to protect commercial interests. This is Liberal code for protecting the interests of his mates. People in regional Australia should be very worried. Why are the interests of commercial firms more important to this Liberal government than the interests of workers in our regions? And they are. Why else would the parliamentary secretary to the minister for transport tell the Senate that 'noone should assume the government will be implementing this report in making decisions about the future of the rail industry' when a press release was available which reflected key recommendations of the Brew report the next day? This government has sold out the workers in regional Australia. This is a government which is prepared to sacrifice, to offer up, national programs and enterprises which should be owned by all Australians. This is a blood sacrifice that the government is asking people in regional Australia to pay. This is a treachery by the government. The government should be condemned, in my view, by every person in Australia for the sale of AN. There are a number of amendments that the opposition are seeking to move to this legislation. I would like to talk about two of them. One is that the government develop a coherent policy for the Australian railway industry. What is wrong with the government developing a coherent policy for the rail industry? Clearly, it is something which is well overdue. A lot has been made by members opposite about difficulties in performance in rail in Australia. It is well known and documented it that rail in Australia has been starved of funds. Certainly, a lack of infrastructure development commitment over many decades by Australian governments of successive orders has meant that it is problematic for rail in Australia to compete in perhaps the way that it might like to and in a way that would be in the national interest. Of course what we have here is a government that is intent on privatisation. After that privatisation regime has been unleashed, it will then release into the sector capital that has been held in abeyance. There has been a capital strike on rail in favour of road transport, in my view, and one that is contrary to the national interest. Regional Australia requires good rail infrastructure. Regional Australian industries require sound rail infrastructure. This bill does not guarantee existing services. In the absence of guaranteeing existing services and where there is not a commitment for cross-subsidisation to regional Australia, people in the bush will suffer. Businesses in the bush will suffer. Pensioners who rely on rail transportation will suffer. We have also said that the government should guarantee existing passenger service operations and concession arrangements. What is wrong with that? Why can't the government guarantee existing passenger services? Is this really a way of closing down passenger services by stealth-flog it off and let someone else do your dirty work') It is an outrage. Why not guarantee concession arrangements? What is wrong with ensuring that pensioners can travel about, go and see their kids or their grandchildren by rail? They certainly cannot fly around the place like John Sharp can. A government that is seeking to privatise something, if it can muster the argument, needs to be questioned about why it would want to abrogate the parliament's responsibility and regulation for this sector. It has to justify why it is not guaranteeing existing services. So far, we have not been able to get a single line of rational debate from the government justifying why it should not guarantee services for the community. What do members of the community expect from the government for paying their taxes? What do they expect from us in this House? They expect good law and services. People in regional Australia particularly rely on things like cross-subsidisation. That is at the heart the debate about telecommunications. If people in regional Australia were paying full market rate for telecommunications that were not cross-subsidised by people in the city, the argument is that life would become very difficult for them. The argument with transportation is that if people in regional Australia state. are not guaranteed services-if enterprise runs them at full cost recovery-then the community will become extremely isolated. A lot is made of the world being a smaller world these days with modem transportation systems. Unfortunately, those in regional Australia-the people in the bush-are going to find that the world is becoming a larger place not a smaller place. It is going to be harder for them to get around and harder for business to freight their materials around because they will not be cross-subsidised. Increased urbanisation in this country has been the subject of a lot of research and discussion and, ultimately, debate in this parliament. In my view, increased urbanisation will continue not only unabated but hell for leather. People will continue to leave regional centres and the bush in general for the cities at a greater rate of knots when jobs disappear. Jobs will disappear when enterprise in regional Australia-business in the bushgoes bust because of the increase in cost of transporting products to cities and, ultimately, overseas. That oncost for doing business in the bush has to essentially be reliant upon an adequate national infrastructure, and this bill is about destroying that national infrastructure.",44
22,Mr VAILE,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"The Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill 1997 is a very important piece of legislation that the House is debating today. The debate, which I have been listening to this morning, has been wide ranging. I think it is important that we focus on some of the key elements. Firstly, the name Australian National belies what it does. Australian National does not operate rail nationally around Australia. The previous speaker, the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel), said that it services all of regional Australia. It does not. It does not service my part of Australia in the state of New South of Wales or Queensland. The previous speaker's comments about the operation of rail in Australia, particularly the subsidies and crosssubsidies within the passenger systems, should have been directed to some of his colleagues in the New South Wales government because of the way the rail operation is running in that The purpose of the bill is to allow the sale of the non-interstate main line track rail assets of Australian National. Australian National operates SA Freight and Tasrail within the states of South Australia and Tasmania respectively, the Seat of Government Railway, contract rail and engineering services, the Indian Pacific, the Ghan and the Overland passenger trains. It is interesting to note a bit of the history-what is happening and how the government arrived at the decision to sell Australian National, which has put this bill before the House. The history of government ownership of railways in Australia has seen declining work forces, declining market share and spiralling debts. That is not just a comment limited to this debate and to this particular rail operation. It is across the board. Government ownership has resulted in political intervention in the rail industry to the detriment of its long-term viability. It has allowed government owned rail operations to behave as monopolistic providers of services, inflexible in their practice and unresponsive to the needs of the customer. Again, I note that the state Labor government in New South Wales is grappling with this same problem with its state rail operation and the costs. The rail industry needs 10-, 20or 30-year planning horizons, and this has not been achieved where short-term political ends have dictated investment decisions, rail operations and reform. The coalition was elected to government with a commitment to reform not only the rail industry as part of the transport sector but also the overall transport sector. I think the National Commission of Audit identified to the Commonwealth government that reform in the transport sector of the economy could produce a massive improvement in real terms to the GDP of this nation-road, rail, sea and air, all those elements of transport. This government is about reviewing and reforming all those elements of the transport network in Australia. The proposition that is before the House today is a result of some of the decisions of the previous government and of the review undertaken-the Brew report to government, particularly about AN. The Labor Party's history of ownership of AN is not very good at all. It is a history of job losses, line ures, lost freight and spiralling debt. The Labor Party told the AN work force that all was well and that they would all have jobs for the future in AN. Yet the Labor Party secretly signed off on hundreds of rail jobs and approved business plans that would see further service reductions and job losses. Yet the AN commission itself knew that this was not true and the chairman advised the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) on his coming to office. The former government was overseeing a declining service, spiralling debt and a government business enterprise that was getting itself into a lot more strife-as did ANL. We know the history of ANL. The former government tried to sell it, and could not. The taxpayers of Australia poured hundreds of millions of dollars into it. As a country, we are getting into the same situation with this particular government business enterprise. We have to be realistic. Opposition speakers this morning have spoken about the jobs that are there and the jobs in regional Australia. What this government is trying to do is secure those jobs before they are all gone and beyond redemption-absolutely beyond redemption. Sadly, that is about where ANL is today: beyond redemption. At great taxpayer expense, we had the appointment of special consultants to try to salvage ANL-but it just did not happen. The previous government now know that they should have acted sooner-and so they should have. The previous government probably reckon that they did fairly well, considering the different elements of their political party, in getting away with some of the privatisation exercises that they undertook whilst in office. In this and other debates in this place, we have listened to speaker after speaker commenting on track records and speaking with shock-horror about the economic rationalist view of privatisation and what it will do and saying that, under the coalition government, it will just be a scorched earth policy of privatisation. Yesterday in this chamber during a division, it flashed up to me that it was interesting to clos- note the argy-bargy that occurred between both sides of politics about the division and who should be crossing the floor, who should be sitting wherever and the control being exercised by different political parties in this place. I remembered-as you will remember,",47
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"the division that took place in this House under the previous government on the sale of the second half of the Commonwealth Bank. You will recall that the very last thing the government of the day wanted was to have a division in this House on the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. However, a division did occur because two members who used to sit here in these seats, the then membeT for Wills and the then member for North Sydney, called a division to highlight-and particularly the former member for Wills-to the people of Australia the bleeding hearts in the left wing of the Labor party who were all voting to sell the Commonwealth Bank. They were voting to sell the Commonwealth Bank; and they had voted to sell Qantas, they had voted to sell Australian Airlines, they had voted to sell CSL and they had voted to sell our share in the Snowy Mountains scheme and a whole raft of government enterprise businesses. Yet it is amazing how short that road to Damascus is and how quick the conversion takes place when flicked back onto the other side of the House. All of a sudden they are anti-privatisation-it is the dogma of the economic rationalists; it has nothing to do with good management. It was all to do with good management when the Labor Party were in government, but it has nothing to do with good management of government business enterprises today. That is the Labor Party that is opposing this bill today. The one thing that the coalition has always been consistent about-and this has included 13 years of opposition whilst the Labor Party was running this country, and running a similar agenda as far as the management of government business enterprises was concerned-h;1.s been the privatisation of government business enterprises and assets that were not seen as a core responsibility or activity government. In this, we consistently supported that government then. We had some credibility on this issue in opposition. I put to it you: the Labor Party did not, and does not, have any credibility in this debate. It does not. I have the greatest of respect for the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). But when the former government sold the first half of the Commonwealth Bank, they signed off on the prospectus and said that the remaining shares of the Commonwealth Bank would remain in public ownership. If it were a private operation that had been putting out that prospectus, then surely there would be some prudential rule somewhere that would call that statement into question. But the former government just went straight over the top of that- 'we're selling the other half'. That particular division yesterday wa interesting to note. It just brought back to m) memory that other particular division in this place when the government members and opposition members all sat over there, supporting the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, and we had a couple of Independents here. As for the members of the left wing of the Labor Party, where were they? They were over there. They did not even go outside of the doors. That is how much control was exercised by the government of the day. They did not even leave the chamber and abstain; they were in here voting to sell. The sale of this government business enterprise is based on the fact that we want to maintain those jobs with AN. We want to give those people the opportunity to keep working in the rail industry. These employees were based in this diabolical situation with this government business enterprise as a result of the Brew report. The Brew report revealed some appalling mismanagement, as well as the fact that over 13 years 7,000 jobs had been lost out of AN. Wbo was in government? The Labor Party. Fifty per cent of the SA rail network was closed and ripped up-ripped up. If we have any chance of resurrecting rail in Australia as a major element of its transport infrastructure, how will we do it when the rail lines have of been ripped up? Then there is a $1 billion debt, with no way of servicing it. Passengers rail services to Mount Gambier, Burra, Peterborough, Port Augusta, Why alia and Broken Hill are alI closed. Also, there is a reduction in the frequency of the Indian Pacific services and the closure of the trans-Australian rail service, a train that operated Adelaide-Perth and that supplemented the Indian Pacific, which operates Sydney-Perth. The Brew report revealed that an AN employee was being subsidised by the taxpayers of Australia to the tune of $30,000 per annum, with this increasing to $220,000 per annum if nothing was to be done. What the Brew report did identify was that there was no do nothing option. There was no 'do nothing' option, which is being proposed in the amendment that has been put forward by the shadow minister-a do nothing option. The Brew report indicated that that option did not exist; that, to be a responsible government, we had to do something about it. In the attached correspondence from Brew to the minister, he quoted that 'in comparative terms, the overall loss and debt position of the ANR is four to five times that of the Australian National Line' - which the previous government attempted to sell and could not. I repeat: four to five times. So why did the previous government not take any action on this, apart from ripping up line and ripping up jobs? The question is still unanswered. He also said: This financial year ANR's total losses is likely to exceed $130 million and there is no prospect of it making a profit in the foreseeable future. He later said: The situation has been deteriorating for some time and the Department of Transport in 1992 and again in 1995 provided formal advice to the then government and suggested urgent action was needed. No do nothing option-'urgent action was needed'. Was there any urgent action? No. We all know that there certainly was not. That has been highlighted in that report to the government. It was interesting to note in the Bills Digest that one of the actions the previous government did take as far as AN was concerned and the reshuffling of the Commonwealth's involvement in rail when setting up National Rail was to hive off a lot of profitable sectors to National Rail. The Bills Digest indicates that the loss of primary business from Australian National to the freight carrier National Rail has impacted heavily on Australian National to the point that debt levels in the structure of Australian National had to be addressed. That is exactly what we are doing. We are addressing a chronic situation in an attempt to save taxpayers' money and to try to secure the remaining jobs of those people with Australian National in the rail industry. If we take the do nothing option of the shadow minister, there will be no chance of any redemption of those jobs. The people who currently have those jobs recognise that. The shadow minister was reported in a radio interview in South Australia recently as stating: It was indicated to me in advance that the majority of workers there were of the view that the sale should now proceed. The compere said: So given what the workers have said to you today that they would like to see the sale proceed and get it over and done with. Is that likely to change your opposition to the sale at this stage. The shadow minister, Mr Tanner, replied: No, it is a factor in our consideration but ... The compere said: You are not inclined to pull back at all. The shadow minister said: No, that is right. Some put that view others didn't. We have got plenty of other workers in other parts of the organisation with a different view. We have also got to take into account the interests of the taxpayer. I remind the shadow minister of that comment that he made; that we also have to take into consideration the views of the taxpayer. That is exactly right. There are the jobs that are involved that need to be secured for the future of AN and there is also the interests of the taxpayers. The taxpayers at the moment are sinking a lot of money into keeping AN in public ownership. They are fairly salutary comments by the shadow minister, who has come in here and moved a do nothing amendment. Anybody who has taken any time to investigate the situation of AN is recommending against the do nothing option. He highlights in that interview that we have to take into account not only the workers' views but also the views of the taxpayers. That is exactly what the government is doing. We are looking after the interests of the taxpayers and the interests of the workers of AN. They want that locked in. There was another radio interview with Mr Len Scharenberg regarding the shadow minister's visit to South Australia. The newsreader sai d: Rail Unions say they're worse off after a meeting with the Federal Opposition's Shadow Transport Minister in Port Augusta on the future of Australian National. Lindsay Tanner has met about 50 workers. The Federal Opposition has threatened to block the sale of AN, but Len Scharenberg of the Australian Workers Union says that means no job guarantees for the workers. He says the opposition has turned its back on rail workers. Len Scharenberg went on to say: After a fair bit of soul searching we, the majority of the workers in Port Augusta, had agreed to a sale, we see that as the best way to keep the workshops viable, and then to see our own people coming out and endorsing the blocking of the sale, it sort of left us with a bit of egg on our face. I suppose when he is talking about 'our own people', he is talking about the Labor Party, the people who are supposed to protect the jobs of workers in Australia. They are not. Their own blue collar work force that supports the Labor Party can see it. Why can the shadow minister not see it? He just cannot see it. All the evidence, all the inquiries that have been undertaken that are before the House and the public in this debate indicate that the government is taking the right path with regard to the sale of AN. The only people who cannot see it and who will not see it are the opposition, the Australian Labor Party. The sale of AN is supported by everyone except the Australian Labor Party. It is supported by the AN workers. It is supported by a petition to the Senate signed by 120 workers of AN at Port Augusta. It is supported by the customers of AN. It is supported by the South Australian and Tasmanian govemments, but not the South Australian opposition parties. They are not supporting it; they are in bed with the Commonwealth opposition parties. The sale is supported by the Australian Rail Association. The sale is supported by Rail 2000. The sale is supported by the AN commission and management itself. The sale is supported by National Rail. Why will the Labor Party not support it? Because they have become a populist party. That is all they have become. They have junked their commitment to reforming Australia to take Australia in a healthy state beyond the year 2000. They have junked all of that to become a populist party. Why do the Labor Party want to continue their appalling record as far as AN is concerned? They have locked themselves into becoming the populist party of Australia. We used to think it was only the Democrats that took on that mantle, but now the Australian Labor Party have joined them. I want to refer to some comments made by  who is also the Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform. The member referred to the terms of reference that our committee has received from the minister with regard to rail. Those terms of reference include a report to this House on the reform of rail in Australia and the best way to go. This is the commitment that this government has to rail in Australia and the future of rail in Australia, along with the commitment the government wants to make to the workers of AN to secure their jobs in the future in the rail industry and the commitment that the government wants to make to the taxpayers of Australia to ensure that all government business enterprises are run in a commercial fashion and that we are not wasting taxpayers' money on them. We are prepared to make the hard decisions, we are prepared to debate them in this place, but we are not prepared to go down the populist lines that the Labor Party have gone down on this issue and a number of other issues since they have become the opposition in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia. As I said at the start of my address, it is amazing how quickly they have changed their colours. (Time expired)",48
24,Mr CAMPBELL,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"I get amused in this House when members of the government talk about populist politics. Populist politics invades both sides of this House-Liberal and Labor alike. We heard in this House the other day a disgusting speech by Laurie Brereton, the member for somewhere in New South Wales-an attack on one of Australia's heroes, Geoffrey Blainey. It was an attempt at populism catering to what the Labor Party sees as a ground swell of support-support, I can tell you, that is simply not there. Returning to the debate on the railway, having lived for years alongside the track and having worked as a fettler on the railway back in the days when Australian National was owned by Charlie Ryan, I have some interest in it. The truth about Australian National is that it was probably the best run railway in Australia, certainly up until the time that Julian Grill became the Minister for Transport in Western Australia and reformed the Western Australian railways, which would now arguably be the most efficient railway system in Australia. The Chairman of Australian National was a Don Williams, who was a brilliant, dynamic engineer. He had visions for rail transport across Australia and he wanted Australian National to take over that rail transport. But apart from being a brilliant engineer, Don Williams was also a bit on the arrogant side and certainly did not tolerate fools gladly. It was for this reason that he was totally unacceptable to the railway system of Victoria, which was hopeless, and New South Wales, which, while being very large, was also moribund. It was quite clear that those states were never going to countenance an amalgamation or a takeover by Australian National, so the government of the day was forced into another alternative and set up the National Rail Corporation. The problem was that, having set up the National Rail Corporation, it then took from Australian National a lot of its equipment and all of its business, leaving Australian National with all its debts. Australian National had no way of servicing its commitments and it had no option other than to go broke and become a big burden on the Australian taxpayer. It must be made very clear that the failure of Australian National had nothing to do with the workers. The workers of Australian National were, in my view, long-suffering and committed and were given a very, very poor deal. There is absolutely no doubt that the failure of Australian National lies with the actions of the previous government, and it gives me no great pleasure to say that. There are no job guarantees, contrary to what the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), who spoke before me, said. The act says that all staff will be made redundant and must reapply for their jobs with whoever purchases Australian National, or parts of Australian National. I believe it will be sold in parts because I cannot see anyone wanting to take up the whole lot. But still, it is a much better option than no jobs at all, which is the only other option I can see. There is a flaw in the government's bill, that is, as I see it, it will make Australian National simply a custodian of the permanent way. It will be responsible for maintenance of the permanent way. You simply cannot maintain a permanent way unless you have rolling stock. Right now, service development is being impeded on the trans line because Australian National do not have the wherewithal to carry their requirements for maintenance. So I think it would be very wise for the minister to amend the act to allow Australian National to still have some motive power of its own. This could be done if they were to use the services offered by Aries Engineering in Perth, who have developed a high rail system where they use a truck-in this case, a Kenworth truck-which can move on and off the rail in two minutes and is capable of hauling up to 1,000 tonnes. It recently did shunt tests in Kalgoorlie where it successfully shunted very large loads. This system would be ideal for Australian National, and they want it. They have their rest centres set in place along the trans line and they could use this assembly in the same way that they used their sugar train in the past, which was called 'the bomber going the other way' - a slow goods train used for stopping at the various sidings to service those sidings and to also carry the equipment needed for maintenance. I would urge the minister to not listen to the vested interests that want to keep this at a distance and would encourage Australian National to acquire this equipment available from Aries Engineering in Perth. There is one problem at the moment. To test this equipment, the company is required by some law to have $100 million of public indemnity insurance and a second policy of $20 million which appears to me to be for the same thing. This might be all right to impose on a rail system hauling large trains continually but, for someone running test operations, it is obviously a nonsense. It is a fiction which could easily be overcome if they agreed to have this operating under the existing insurance of Australian National or if they were to apply the same sort of insurance that this assembly would need to have it worked on the roads, where the risk is much greater. To have that in there is either incompetence on the part of the bureaucracy or a clear attempt by the bureaucracy to stop this very worthwhile development happening. Apart from enabling access to the permanent way for maintenance purposes, there is also a local service commitment. I was involved in the opening up of the Nullarbor for pastoral industry-the last great pastoral development that will ever take place in Australia. When those stations were started, there was a clear guarantee that they would be serviced by Australian National. Subsequent decisions, taken mainly at government level, made it simply uneconomical for Australian National to want to service the intrastate positions. If Australian National were to reinstate this truck-powered tea and sugar train or bomber train, it would also be able to set vice those sidings once more. I looked at the figures recently. On the Nullarbor, where pastoralists have an urgent need to de-stock some of their properties which have excess stock, it is simply uneconomical at the moment to ship them to the only market, in Peterborough in South Australia. This could be accomplished by a vehicle powered by the Aries concept much more efficiently and cheaply than the railways could possibly do it in their present set-up. It would serve a very useful purpose in terms of land care on the Nullarbor and it would certainly help to make those places viable-places for which I believe the government has an absolute responsibility. Another matter that concerns me is this: we are told that Australian National will be the custodian of the permanent way and people will be allowed access to the permanent way. I think this is a good idea. But what we see happening already-and I cannot get answers from the minister's office-is that people are saying, 'Yes, we want to use the permanent way for haulage.' One company in Kalgoorlie wishes to haul limestone into Kalgoorlie for the mining industry. Some of this would be made into lime and some would simply be crushed and used as an alkaline reagent in some of the processes. The company has already put in an order for railway equipment. It has already put in an order for a loco which it is seeking to buy from a state rail system. It is being hampered in getting access to the railway system. I suspect this is because of vested interests. If it is not, the only other explanation can be bureaucratic obfuscation. I believe the minister has an absolute responsibility to consider this application now and let these people get on with what looks to me to be a very viable and worthwhile operation-an operation which will cost the government nothing. They will pay for access to the railway. That access must involve reasonable fees. It certainly must be no more than the large companies pay. But it will help to support the gold industry, which is very important to Australia. It will help to support employment and it will help to keep the railways viable. I simply need to know why it is not happening. Another thing that must be done immediately is that we must stop the destruction of existing carriages. I know there are tenders now being put out for the acquisition of stock carrying carriages which were probably destined to be scrapped. I believe this must be stopped until we assess the need for these carriages. Refurbishment would obviously be a much better option than building new equipment. It would be scandalous if we allowed these carriages to be scrapped by any railway system in Australia until there was a clear understanding of the need for this equipment. So many times in the past we have scrapped perfectly good equipment and then put out tenders to buy new stuff. I certainly hope that does not happen on this occasion. Australian National is very important to Australia. It links east and west. It is the link that is capable of taking traffic off the Great Eastern Highway. The Great Eastern Highway, from Kalgoorlie to Perth, is already overcrowded. We now have B-doubles and road trains operating beyond Northam. I believe there will be a serious accident there. I have driven along that road and I felt intimidated by some of these convoys of vehicles. It is much better to have them on the rail. It is also much safer. We must look at railways. The government says it has an absolute commitment to rail. Rail is triumphant over long distances, particularly on flat terrain. That is the nature of Australia. Australia, more than any other country, is made for rail. I refer particularly to east-west routes. It must be remembered that east-west rail routes in Australia have generally been profitable. The massive losses have been on north-south routes. The reason is that for the last 70 years governments have not bothered to keep up the infrastructure on those lines. We hear from the government how efficient road transport is compared with rail transport. Road transport has a clear advantage because the government charges an excise on fuel. It charges that partly for the construction of roads, so heavy trucks using roads get some benefit from the excise. All the reports have shown that it is large trucks that do the damage to bitumen roads, not motor cars. So the motorists subsidise the trucking industry on the road; the truck industry gets a benefit from the excise, some of which does go into roads. But railways pay that excise, too, and railways do not get anything like the benefit. The railway has to pay for every centimetre of its permanent way; it has to pay the full cost. Quite clearly, this needs to be looked at if we are going to have a truly level playing field. It is unfortunate that this legislation needed to be brought before the House. However, quite clearly, it was needed. I say to the minister that there must be some competition. I believe Australian National could provide that competition with the National Rail Corporation. I believe Australian National can provide the intrastate services to which the government should have an absolute commitment. I believe it has a duty to provide those services. Passenger trains could expand their services enormously if there were some intelligent promotion of tourism. Passenger trains would benefit from having two classes of travelfirst-class, which would be very good, and the price would need to go up, and a real steerage class which could provide competitive rates for backpackers to cross Australia. In my view, that class of travel would need to be quite basic in order to keep the cost down. In conclusion, I do urge the minister's office to take heed of what I have said. There are enormous achievements and developments that can take place. They will not take place if it is left to rail, because rail is totally stultified at the moment. They are frightened to do anything. The people of Australian National have actually told me that. They simply dare not make decisions. I think the minister's office has to show that leadership, give access to people who will not access the permanent way and certainly amend the legislation to allow Australian National to keep some locomotive power of its own so that it can be self-sufficient in providing for the maintenance of the permanent way. After all, if that job is not kept up or it is forced into using expensive contract services, it will not be long before we are back in this House bemoaning once more the problems of Australian National and seeking even more privatisation. I believe that for railways like this the permanent way should at least be in the hands of the government, and I think the maintenance of it is obviously better provided for in the main by employees employed by Australian National rather than contract teams. I say that with some experience, having worked on the railways and seeing the contract teams in specific areas, but in general maintenance I think it is going to be in Australian National's interest to keep a day labour force, which must be supplied.",51
25,Mr WAKELIN,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"The Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill 1997 is something that must happen for the national interest and for the people of South Australia and Tasmania. This farce has gone on for far too long, and to have my political opponents coming into this place today and posturing on this is beneath contempt. The purpose of the bill is to allow the sale of the non-interstate main line track rail assets of Australian National. We know that Australian National operates SA Rail and Tasrail within the states of South Australia and Tasmania respectively, the Seat of Government Railway, contract rail and engineering services, the Indian Pacific, the Chan and the Overland passenger rail. Australia's rail history is really Australia's history. The rail industry over the last 20 years-no doubt further back than that-has seen dramatic change. We are at a stage in our history-that is, the coalition's election to government in March 1996-at just another watershed in the history of rail in Australia. As has been said many times in this place, the much maligned Brew report has set down the facts of life once again for the rail industry. The previous Labor government knew what it was, but the new minister, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), confronted with the financial reality and the chaos that was the rail industry, particularly AN, had no choice but to move as the government has done. I want to quote from the letter that Mr Brew wrote to the minister on 19 June 1996-some three months after the government came to office. The government acted as quickly as it possibly could. He makes this point about Australian National rail: In comparative terms the overall loss and debt position of the ANRthat is, Australian National Railwaysis four to five times that of the Australian National Line which the previous Government attempted to sell. This financial yearthat is 1995-96ANR's total loss is likely to exceed $130 millionwe subsequently found that it was more than thatand there is no prospect of it making a profit in the foreseeable future. I make the observation that, if you look back over the last decade and you look at the parliamentary reports, as far back as 1988 a parliamentary inquiry of that era made it quite clear that they expected AN to be breaking even within the next three or four years: that is, by the early 1990s, Australian National should have been in the position to be breaking even. It is very interesting that in the AN annual report of 1995-96 there is a deliberate act by the Labor government to defer all of this to post-March 1996, post the election. The blatant irresponsibility of that action in itself indicates the Labor Party's inability to come to terms with reality. As a representative of a federal electorate my responsibility is to the people of that electorate. It is well known that the seat of Grey has been a Labor seat for many decades, up until 1993. The city of Port Augusta was known as a traditional Labor city. When I was first elected, I did not receive a particular swing in that city, and I would not have expected to. The traditional party lines were drawn, and it is much the status quo. But, as I became familiar with my role as a representative, I became far too familiar with the neglect of rail by the Labor Party. I could not believe that something could have been left to stagnate in the way that Australian National was. Brew makes the comment that 'the decisions that Labor made with the Australian National Railway and the National Rail Corporation meant, in effect, death by a thousand cuts' for Australian National. I come back to my theme of representing people. The people of Port Augusta should never have been placed in that position over many years. As people who have got out of the rail industry over the last year or two have said to me, nobody should be treated like that, with that sort of uncertainty. You either have a positive future and look forward with a growing industry or you at least hold the status quo. You just do not leave an organisation there hanging out to dry. That is effectively what the government did to Australian National. Brew makes the following point: The situation has been deteriorating for some time and the Department of Transport in 1992 and again in 1995 provided formal advice to the then Government and suggested urgent action was needed. The government ignored that advice. I come to today's article in the Transcontinental-Port Augusta, written after the visit by the shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). The Transcontinental's headline reads: 'Too little, too late-Delays surrounding AN's sale costing contracts says workers'. There we have it: an epitaph for the Labor Party written by its own supporters. An article by Ben Osborne in the Transcontinental-Port Augusta today, Wednesday, 18 June 1997 says: One worker said the doubt surrounding AN's future had recently cost it a contract with BHP. ""They looked at us and said no, we don't know if you have a future so they gave it to someone else,"" he said. ""Who did they give it to?"" Mr Tanner asked. ""NRC and Goninan's-the one you mongrels set up,"" the worker replied. There we have it once again: AN laid out as a sacrificial lamb. That is what Mr Tanner had to confront at Port Augusta this week. The coalition government, confronted with those realities, had no choice but to act. In November 1996 it introduced a $2 billion package to revive the rail industry in Australia. That package, as has been said by previous speakers, comprises: redundancies, $112 million; superannuation, $580 million; outstanding contracts and liabilities, $125.7 million; assumption of the AN debt, $779.4 million; regional systems package, $50 million; environment clean-up, $50 million; establishment of the National Track Authority, $161 million; AN subsidy, $30 million; unfunded provisions, leave and workers comp, $90 million; and other costs-that is, managing the sale-$8 million. The business of cleaning up after Labor and putting rail onto a new path was no easy matter. For the record, I say to the parliament and to the community generally that the only people who are not supporting the sale of AN are the Labor Party. The supporters of the sale obviously are the Commonwealth; the South Australian government; the Tasmanian government; AN management; the AN Commission; the Australian Rail Association; Rail 2000; National Rail and its managing director, Mr Vince Graham; customers of AN, including the Australian Wheat Board, the Australian Barley Board, SA Cooperative Bulk Handling and the South Australian Farmers Federation; the Mayor of Port Augusta, Joy Baluch; the corporation of the city of Port Augusta; the Northern Regional Development Board; the Spencer Regional Development Association; the Australian Workers Union in Port Augusta-and, may I add, the Trades and Labour Council in Port Augusta; and, most importantly, the men and women employed by AN in Port Augusta, Islington, Port Pirie, Port Lincoln, Ceduna-throughout South Australia-and Tasmania. The only opposition, as I said, is from the shadow minister and the Labor Party. I do not think they have even started to understand the issue. I want to share with the House Mr Tanner's comments when he was interviewed on ABC Radio 5CK. When asked whether Labor's position would change if it was clear that workers wanted to see AN sold, Mr Tanner said: Clearly we will be taking close account of the work force's view and the union's view, but we also have other responsibilities ... responsibilities to taxpayers ultimately as well. How about that? He suddenly remembered the taxpayers. His government has cost the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by absolutely absurd bad management. Anyway, he ultimately remembered the taxpayers. He went on to say: So the views of the work force are a critical component in influencing our overall decision, but they're not the only component. He went on to say: It was indicated to me in advance that the majority of workers in Port Augusta were of the view that the sale should now proceed, much as they don't like it, but they feel they need to be put out of their misery, and I think that probably was accurate ... The interviewer said: Given what the workers have said to you today, they would like to see the sale proceed, yet it is over and done with. Is that likely to change your opposition to the sale at this stage? This is the key answer: Ah, no, it's a factor in our consideration, but ah The interviewer later said: So theythat is, the workersdon't feel like you're prolonging the agony. And the reply: Oh I think some people possibly do have a view that Labor should get out of the road ... Exactly! Labor Party: get out of the road and let us get on with it. I want to remind the House of the facts about AN. The losses in 1995-96 were $250 million. The debts stand at $800 million. Employment has collapsed by 7,000 jobs over the past 13 years; you do not have to be Einstein to work out who was in government over the last 13 years. Since 1991, 4,300 of the 6,000 jobs have been lost. Fifty per cent of SA's rail network was closed by Labor and ripped up. The passenger services-Mount Gambier, Burra, Peterborough, Port Augusta, Why alia and Broken Hill-have all been closed. The list goes on. I will address the issue of the apprentices. It is expected that there will be fewer than 50 apprentices who have not completed their training at the time the sale is finalised and redundancies are offered. A number of organisations have indicated an interest in taking the apprentices on, including the Spencer Gulf training group and similar schemes in metropolitan Adelaide. The new owner will be keen to employ apprentices, particularly those whose training is more advanced. The House, the nation and the communities of Port Augusta and metropolitan Adelaide can be assured that both the Commonwealth and the state governments will be seeking to ensure that young people still being trained will not be disadvantaged by the sale. I repeat: they will not be disadvantaged by the sale. I come to the conclusion of my comments on this sad and sorry business. I can only plead to the Labor Party-I refuse to begbecause their conduct does not require me to do other than to put the facts before them and say, for the interests of the people of Port .Augusta and the people of South Australia, I ask you to proceed with this legislation posthaste. I would not wish you to, because of your conduct, get benefit from it, but I say to you in the national interest-remembering what  said to me about the transport task and the future of rail-that the future of rail can be quite dynamic. There is a great future for the rail industry of Australia. We need to give it the dynamism, the strength, the private enterprise ethic and the investment to enable it to perform the transport task for the nation. There has been much discussion since 1915-even in the last decade and in recent weeks-about the Alice-Darwin railway. I think it was Senator Bob Collins who said in the 1993 election, 'No-one believes us anymore because, every time someone says they are going to build the Alice-Darwin railway before the election, they renege on it afterwards. So no-one really takes us too seriously.' We know the previous Prime Minister Paul Keating was not a fan of that railway. Nevertheless, there is a growing body of opinion and growing body of evidence which will make that rail a viable concern. I have always been one who said that it could only be a viable concern if it were based on a properly structured rail industry. This gives us the opportunity to have a properly structured rail industry which will enable projects like the Alice-Darwin line to proceed for the national good and for the good of the export industries of Australia particularly and to assure the jobs of people throughout South Australia and Australia linked particularly to the export production but also directly to the rail industry and associated industries. In my final minute or two I say that, over my four years in the parliament, I have great respect for the rail industry and for those people who work in it. It is a tough industry. I am used to working with heavy equipment and I am used to working with my hands, but the rail industry is all heavy equipment and it requires particular skills to operate in an effective, efficient and safe manner. I have nothing but respect for those forebears and for those people who currently work in the industry. In no way can those people who work in the industry now and those who have recently left the industry be held responsible for what has happened. It has been the poor leadership of government which has led us to this situation. Therefore, with the new coalition government's proposals we will go forward into the 21 st century with a strong rail try, which I will be proud to support.",55
26,Mr COBB,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"It is somewhat ironic that we are discussing the Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill here today because 142 years ago in September 1855 the first rail journey occurred in Australia between Sydney and Parramatta. The railway was then owned by the government. It was only because the private consortium called the Sydney Railway Co. had gone bankrupt that the government had to step in and take it over. Today we are debating doing the reverse because the government has gone bankrupt. We are going to hand it back to private enterprise. This bill provides a flexible framework to sell all of Australian National's assets, the interstate main line track. AN, as previous speakers have said, operates the interstate passenger services as well as the South Australian freight within South Australia and Tasrail freight within Tasmania. National Rail, which handles the interstate freight, commenced operations in February 1993. It was hived off by the previous government, which set up AN as it exists today to fail. But we are going to hand AN over to a new rail operator completely free of debt. It is interesting to look at the Brew report that was set up by the present Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) after we came to government. The present minister has done a magnificent job in this area. The Brew report revealed that a scandal had taken place in this country that had been covered up. We were left with massive debt and this story was hidden from the Australian people. The story of AN is a history of mismanagement by the previous minister, as he has mismanaged the aviation industry in this country in the past and also ANL, our shipping line. We have had to start to sort out those areas as well. It just goes to show that the previous government could not handle money and could not run a business. The Department of Transport and Regional Development had advised the previous minister in 1992 and 1995 to do something and he did nothing. On coming to government induswe were landed with debts in excess of $1,000 million-an outrageous situation! He told us that for the last year-that is, 199596-AN would lose probably $25 million. What did we find when the figures came in? Debt for that year alone of about $250 million. This is for an organisation that runs only three trains for heaven's sake-the Indian Pacific between Sydney and Perth, the Chan between Adelaide and Alice Springs, and the Overlander between Melbourne and Adelaide. That is the sort of debt it has been clocking up. The Brew report showed that the average debt per employee was about $30,000 per year. If things were left running as they were, that debt would have amounted to about except $220,000 per employee by the year 2000incredible! Already the accumulated losses per rail employee is of the order of $415,000. The workshops were overstaffed by about tenfold. We have 500 people in some workshops with work for only 50. They had 230 carriages when they needed about 140. The saddest situation of all was what had happened to jobs. When we handed it over in 1983, there were about 10,500 employed with Australian National. Today it is about a third of that, about 3,500 people. It is a shocking situation all round. We have a declining work force, a declining market share and spiralling debt. If we go back a few years to 1971-72 and look at the figures for market share, the Sydney-Melbourne run had 48 per cent of the freight. Today it is about 22 per cent. On top of all that we have had a series of inappropriate government interventions which led to decisions being taken for short-term political ends rather than a long-term vision. We have ended up with a monopolistic provider of service with inflexible practices which are unresponsive to the needs of the customer and an organisation which is starved of capital. The solution to all that is to get the government out of both the passenger side as well as the freight side, which will come later, and get private enterprise in. You can inject capital into the areas that need it. You can bring in expertise. You can bring in new ideas and you can bring in enthusiasm. This is not a pipedream; it has been done on virtually every other continent of the world, except possibly Africa and the Antarcis tica where they do not run trains. It has been done in Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, Asia, South America and even our near neighbour New Zealand, where you virtually into second gear and you are running up against the coastline because of the small size of the country. New Zealand has turned a deficit of $150 million around to a profit of $50 million or more in the short few years since it has been privati sed. In those other areas, private operators have taken over moribund rail operations, reopened old lines and constructed new lines. Freight tonnages are up. There has been a focus on customer service and new jobs have been created. It has been done in it has been done elsewhere and we are going to do it in Australia. The previous government was in power 13 years. In that time 7,000 jobs went and created a $1 billion debt. There was no to service the debt. Also, 50 per cent of South Australian rail network was ripped up or closed down. It closed quite a number of passenger rail services. One of them ran my electorate between Adelaide and Broken Hill. The Indian Pacific services were wound down. It closed the Trans-Australian service, which supplemented the Indian Pacific. So it is a sad story overall. We found when we took over AN that it was a bit like the Labor Party after 13 years: bankrupt and moribund-an incredible legacy. We have decided to pay off the debt, to bring in private enterprise, to create a single entity to control and manage access in a nondiscriminatory way to the line and virtually to operate interstate passenger and, later on, freight services similar to the way the roads are run now. The government owns the roads, but anybody who has got proper licensing can have access to the roads. We have done it with roads. We have been doing it for hundreds of years. Why cannot we do it with rail? It is an unremarkable thing to do in that sense. As far as paying off debt goes, there is quite a bit to pay off. The restructuring costs are going to amount to $344.4 million. There an interest bill of $9.1 million. We are injecting $20 million in regional assistance because of the restructuring that will take place. We are going to upgrade the track at a cost of $175 million. We will give AN a cannot get subsidy of $30.1 million. The sale management costs will amount to something of the order of $8 million. We are going to acquire the AN debt of $779.4 million-that figure has risen since then. We will payout all the superannuation of $580 million, although that may have fallen somewhat since that figure was given out. We have had to find a total of over $1,900 million over and above the black hole figure that was in the budget to get the federal rail system in this country up and in a respectable state to New Zealand and be handed over. If we can get private operators involved, it will be the lifeblood of the rail system in this for country-particularly AN, which we are it debating here today. We were worried about way who would be interested in the passenger the services. We were more confident of who would be interested in the freight servicesand that is to come later. But, despite that, 56 in serious expressions of interest came in. We have narrowed those down to 16 and a decision on that is imminent-within a matter of rail weeks or a short few months. We believe that the future operator or operators will be much more responsive to customers and will be able to provide upmarket tourism. For example, the Indian Pacific that runs through my electorate between Parkes and Broken Hill can be promoted eor the first time as a world-class tourist experience, the same as is done with the Orient Express in Asia and Europe, with the Canadian Rocky Mountains train and the Blue Train in South Africa. It is done in other areas of the world and should have been done in Australia many years ago. If private operators come in, we will see a surge of confidence in rail. We are already seeing it to some extent in freight now. We have got SCT and TNT operating between Melbourne and Perth. We have got Patrick who have not long started up between Melbourne and Adelaide. Only the other day I had the great privilege and honour of opening facilities of the FCL organisation, who are going to operate freight services between Parkes and Perth. On that line between Sydney and Parkes and Broken Hill and Crystal Brook, north of Adelaide, through to Perth, the closest point to Sydney where you can double-stack containers-because of tunnels and bridges, et cetera-is Parkes. FCL have come in there on the conjunction of the eastwest rail line and the north-south road linethe Newell Highway between Brisbane and Melbourne. It is an ideal point to start this operation. They are going to double-stack containers-4:ontainers up to 48 feet long. We saw the first loaded to go to Perth. That will be a service running five days a week over and back. You put a container on the rail in Parkes and 60 hours later it is being unloaded in Perth. I pay tribute to the managing director of FCL, Bill Gibbins, who started that company in 1974. He borrowed about $3,000 from the State Bank of Victoria and I think he was one of the few who paid his debt back! FCL has grown into one of the biggest container freight services today. It is a great tribute to the traditional history of some very colourful transport operators that we have had in this country. That east-west rail line is underutilised by about fourfold. It is the shortest, quickest flattest rail journey between Sydney and Perth and it should be used more. I am delighted to see that it is being used in this manner. The thing that tipped the success in favour of FCL using this operation was that they finally won the Email contract to shift whitegoods. They have taken whitegoods off roads for long distance and they are now putting them on rail, which is something I believe we all want to see. I might add that the Newell Highway, which cuts north-south through Parkes, is 1,682 kilometres in length between Brisbane and Melbourne. In the future I think we will see a lot of containers coming down by road into Parkes to be loaded on rail to go west to Perth. There is tremendous potential there. We have only had 600-metre length trains in New South Wales in the past. They are stepping up in length now. A 900-metre train is equivalent to 45 semitrailers or 24 B-doubles and 1,500metre freight trains are equivalent to 75 semitrailers or 40 B-doubles. We can now get some of that freight off our roads. Having said all that, there is a pressing need to get this legislation through. Everybody wants it--everybody except the federal Labor Party. They are so out of touch with the rest of Australia. Australian National wants it-the operator that we are talking about here today. The users of the service want it, which includes the passengers, of course. The workers in Australian National want it-they have even presented a petition to parliament, I believe. And the coalition government, of course, wants it. Everybody wants it-except the Labor Party. I have a letter here from Mark Carter, the executive officer of Rail 2000. He says: We support the sale of AN. If we delay this process any further, what you are going to see is that there will be no rural rail services in South Australia, and the same is true for Tasmania. In South Australia, the Australian Wheat Board, the Australian Barley Board and Cooperative Bulk Handling have written a letter which says: OUf view is that the sale proceed as quickly as possible. and They are in favour of it. The South Australian Farmers Federation have put out a press release which says: Primary producers are frustrated by ongoing delays in the sale of Australian National. AN has no future in its present form. The slate has to be wiped clean, and we need to move on. The federation wants to see a sale within the next couple of months. I also have a number of letters here from Kym Thomas, who represents the AN-Port Augusta Rail Task Force. He has written to various people, including Kim Beazley. I have a copy of that letter. He says: The work force is concerned about continuing media reports in connection with your persistencethat is, the opposition leader'sin blocking the sale of Australian National. They are also very much in favour of it. I would have thought that the Labor Party would have paid close heed to those letters. In giving evidence to the Senate references committee, Mark Carter said: · .. we support the sale of AN. Rail 2000 believes that many of these lines that have been closed could have remained open had the opportunity been given to alternative operators ... Further on he says: · .. a private operator would look at the situation differently and would be more responsive to their needs. · ... over the last decade or so and over 1,300 kilometres of track have been lifted ... He makes various other statements in favour of private operators managing AN. Joy Baluch, the Mayor of Port Augusta, says: · .. you would have to be deaf, dumb, blind and with a labrador dog to suggest that AN should continue to be operated by government. She goes on to say: We had Laurie Brereton here on a number of occasions, and he lied to the work force. .. What we need in this enterprise here in Port Augusta is people from the private sector who are entrepreneurial and who are not tunnel visioned and got blinkers on. Ian MCSporran, the City Manager of the Corporation of the City of Port Augusta, said: · .. council favours the privatisation of Australian National.  Cooper from the chamber of commerce says: It is our belief that the system would be better operated in private hands ... Mr Scott MCLean, the Assistant State Secretary of the CFMEU, says: Theythat is, the former Labor governmentused Tasrail as a political football ... it needs to change. Otherwise the only option is that it will close because it will continually run itself into the ground. There is testimony after testimony saying that AN should be sold as quickly as possible and handed over to private enterprise to manage it in a far better way than it is being done now. The head of National Rail, Vince Graham, also agrees with that, as does Jack Smorgon, the head of Australian National. In conclusion, all Australians are in favour--except for the Labor Party. I believe that, if the Labor Party have a .conscience, they should expedite this sale as soon as possible so that we can revitalise rail in this country and give it a confident future.",58
27,Mr RONALDSON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"BallaratParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) 0.24 p.m.)-It is a pleasure to be able to sum up today the debate on the Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill. I thank all members who have participated and I will refer to them during my speech. I think it is probably fair to say that, in the last two hours, we have seen the candle of political convalescence snuffed out. A new Labor has flickered and, indeed, failed, and it is quite obvious that the Labor Party simply has not learnt the lessons of March 1996. They are not listening and they have their heads absolutely buried in the ground. I would like to thank, in particular, the members for Adelaide (Ms Worth) and Grey (Mr Wakelin), who are actively involved in this matter. The member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) has just spoken and I thank him for his contribution. But I just want to go through some of the contributions from the other side and I will talk about the shadow minister shortly. I want to speak about the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel). On what authority the member for Fraser is talking about matters in the regions is absolutely beyond me, but I suppose we should not be surprised given that, after the Canberra by-election, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said that this is a clear message from regional Australia. You might be interested to know that the Electoral Commission actually describes the electorate of Fraser as being inner metropolitan. These are the Labor Party regional members talking about it when they are coming from seats that are described as being inner metropolitan. That is utter hypocnsy. I thought the other interesting comment from the member for Fraser concerned the need for a rail vision-for a rail policy. This government has been in power now for some 14 or 15 months. We, indeed, have a rail policy; it is in this legislation. I do not know where the member for Fraser was over the past 13 years of his government, but they had no policy. That is why we are in this diabolical mess that we are now in which is affecting a very special group of Australians-the workers involved in AN; the workers who were, effectively, over 13 years, tossed onto the scrap heap by this government. We then heard from the member for Short better known as the cabotage kid. How you can get that into a speech about rail is absolutely beyond me, but I suppose I should not be surprised because I am sure he goes to bed muttering 'cabotage' before he goes off to sleep. He talked about the US rail system and what was being done, and how successful it was. The US rail system is now predominantly run by the private sector. They have turned around a moribund rail system and made it successful, and that is exactly what this legislation is designed to do-to tum around a moribund situation. I am glad that he raised it, but he should hang his head in shame for not getting his facts right about who was doing what and where. I suppose you could say that there are none so blind as those who will not see. I would now like to tum to the shadow minister, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). In the 7V2 years I have been here I have never heard, and I very much doubt whether other members who have been here for longer would have heard, a speech about a matter of such importance in this country which lacked so much passion. The member for Melbourne simply did not have his heart in this debate. I rather suspect that that is because the troglodyte quads have got to him-Beazley, Evans, Crean and Ferguson; the ones who have destroyed the young braves-and he is very much in that category. He put his head up with something which he thought was appropriate for new Labor and they knocked him down. They knocked him down with great passion. Of course, when you have a Leader of the Opposition who is intent on muzzling young MPs and knocking on the head those who pretend to have a bit of vision, you can see why this flame has flickered and gone out. The alternative is that the member for Melbourne did 1I0t believe the things he put in his paper, 'Populism and rationalism'. If he did not, he should say so; if he did, then the troglodyte quads should apologise to someone who is trying to do something constructive. The most disappointing aspect of the speech from the member for Melbourne was his lack of vision about the rail sector and his blatant attempt to blame every single person involved in this except the ones who are truly guiltythe party that he represents. I will talk only about that today because that was all that the member for Melbourne wanted to doapportion blame to everyone else. The classic was to attack the author of the report, Mr Brew himself. In my view, that was a disgraceful attack. It was a grubby attack on someone who did no more than tell the facts of life about what the former government had done in relation to AN. I will just go through the Brew report again, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I think the House should be aware of it. I know other members have made some reference to it. Seven thousand rail jobs were lost in 13 years. Fifty per cent of the South Australian rail network was closed and ripped up. There was a $1 billion dollar debt-a one thousand million dollar debt-with absolutely no way of servicing it. Passenger rail services to Mt Gambier, Burra, Peterborough, Port Augusta, Whyalla and Broken Hill were all closed. In South Australia alone 16 Iines-l,300 kilometres of track-were ripped up. The Brew report went on to talk about the level of liability and the subsidy by the Australian taxpayer which currently stands at about $30,000 per annum but which would increase to about $220,000 if nothing was done. Business levels were decreasing and there was no way known that AN could cover its costs; it was technically bankrupt. The report also revealed a very interesting fact: that it was the way that the Labor Party had set up NR that caused AN's problems. NR was given all the best assets and the revenue generating infrastructure; AN was left with the debt and no possible way of repaying it. Someone was quoted as saying that AN was doomed from the day NR began. Was that the minister for transport? Was it me? Was it John Brew? Was it one of the AN rail workers? Was it? Do you want to know who it was? It was, in fact, Senator Collins. Senator Collins is reported as saying in the Senate References Committee hearings in Adelaide and Port Augusta that AN was doomed the day NR began. We have announced a $2 billion reform program to fix the problem. That is just part of our rail policy. A part of any policy must be to fix the problems before you head into the future. Ah, the shadow minister has arrived. Mr Tanner-To listen to you.",61
28,Mr RONALDSON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"Thank you very much. I am looking forward to his participation later on. The only ones who have not supported the sale of AN are the Australian Labor Party. I cannot believe that they have got their heads so badly buried in the sand that they can put themselves so far out on a limb from everyone else. They have put themselves out on a limb from industry, from AN workers, from users, from the South Australian Farmers Federation and the list goes on-you name them, I have got pages of messages from them. But I think the important ones are from the families themselves, the ones for whom we should reserve our primary concern. I do not for one minute think that the member for Melbourne is not concerned about families, but he needs to be acutely aware that, by being rolled on this issue by the troglodyte quads, he has left the very people that he should be supporting in an incredible lurch. It is those people-not the multimillion dollar industry people, not those with vested interests-the workers themselves, who have pleaded with him to do something about it and let the sale go on. He has been up to Port Augusta, I think only onceMr Tanner-Twice. He has been there twice. It is interesting that the workers have pleaded with the Leader of the Opposition to go to Port Augusta. I do not think the Leader of the Opposition has been to Port Augusta, has he? He has had 15 months to do something about this-I5 months to show his concern for the workers in Port Augusta. And where has the invisible man been? Nowhere. But he sits across here during question time smiling and with that stupid little giggle talking about what the government is doing in relation to Newcastle. In Newcastle-which can be equated very much with what is happening with rail in South Australia and Tasmania-this government moved quickly and swiftly to get people on the ground, to see what people wanted. But where have the opposition been? Absent-absolutely absent. I think it is interesting to refer to an interview from Radio 5CK; it is Lou Hendriks interviewing Len Scharenberg from the AWU-not industry, the AWU, the representative of the workers. Mr Tanner-Some of them.",63
29,Mr RONALDSON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"I tell you what, if he represents some of them, he is representing 100 per cent more than you people are at the moment. The reporter asked Mr Scharenberg: Do you think the meeting was worth the effort? Did you get any guarantees at all from the shadow minister? Mr Scharenberg replied: No guarantees at all. That is what we ... one of the things we were hoping to get by him coming up is that he guarantee that, if the sale was blocked, they'd guarantee the existing jobs. But, oh no, no such guarantee at all. The reporter asked again: Do you think there was any point in his visit at all? Mr Scharenberg replied: Well, going on that, no. Well, as I sai-, a.fter a fair bit of soul-searching, the ... the maJonty of the workers in Port Augusta had agreed to a sale. We seen that as the best way of keeping the workshops viable and then to . . . to see our own people corning up and ... and endorsing the blocking of the sale it sort of left us with a bit of egg on our faceleft us with a bit of egg on our face. Not just that: no jobs, no hope, no future, if they get their way. The reporter went on: Did it take you a long time to actually decide that a sale was a good option? And, as we have heard before, people have said it didn't matter whose name was on the gate as long as there were jobs, but now it seems that you might actually be worse off than you were before. And the answer: Yeah, well, it took 18 months of soul-searching to come to that decision. One of the things that was put to Lindsay was: where was he in that time? Mr Tanner-I have visited every major AN workplace in the country. That is where I was.",63
30,Mr RONALDSON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"Absent; absent when it counted; the Labor Party absent when jobs counted; and absent when the rights of workers in this country were being hung out to dry. Where was the Leader of the Opposition-where was he? Absent. I will go on. The reporter asked, 'How are the workers feeling?' and Mr Scharenberg replied, 'Between <t rock and a hard place.' The reporter went on: Is there likely to be any light at the end of the tunnel? Mr Scharenberg replied: Well, we can't see any light at the end of the tunnel. I mean, I must say as much as it hurts me, that after Lindsay's visit we were in even worse than we were before. I think they should hang their heads in shame with that. I would like now to refer to an interview that the shadow minister did on a Drive program. Mr Tanner-Will you get five minutes out of this?",64
31,Mr RONALDSON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"I could probably get about 15 minutes if I go through alI the stuff that you said. In fact I might take 15 minutes. I did not think you would want me to speak about this, but if you want me to, I am happy to. The shadow minister very generously conceded that it was indicated to him in advance that the majority of the workers were of the view that the sale should now proceed. But he went on to say: Obviously Port Augusta is only one work site out of a substantial number of AN work sites, so there are differing views amongst workers across the network. There certainly weren't differing views at Islington. They certainly have not been differing views at Port Pirie and across the board. So I am interested to hear from him where he thinks these differing views are. The only difference of view in this-about the workers towards the Labor Party-is whether they are realIy bad or absolutely appalling. That is the only difference in view between the workers in AN. I was interested to hear the shadow minister say that he had visited alI the work sites. If he has-and I suppose I have to accept when he says he has that he has-I am utterly amazed that he seems to have come out with a different message from everyone else involved in this. He is bragging about visiting all these work sites, but he seems to have come out with a totalIy different message. I have another quote: Compere: So given what the workers have said to you today that you would like to see the sale proceed and get it over and done with. Is that likely to change your opposition to the sale at this stage? Mr Tanner: No. It is a factor in our consideration but ... How incredibly generous! Mr Tanner-What about the rest of the sentence!",64
32,Mr RONALDSON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"It went on: Compere: ... you are not inclined to pull back at all? That is what the transcript says-'It is not a factor in our consideration, but'. How incredibly generous, that the views of the workersthe ones that he should be protecting-are only a factor. I would have thought that they are not just a factor; they are the be-all and end-all of where you should be going. I think the answer might lie a bit further on when he talks about the involvement of the Australian National unions. This is where the truth lies, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr Tanner-They're representatives of the workers.",64
33,Mr RONALDSON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"Thank you very much! They are the representatives of the workers. What a mighty job they have done for the AN rail workers! What a mighty job they have done looking after their interests! What has happened is that your little foray into the brave new world has been snuffed out by the ACTU, who have told you-the troglodyte quads-that they are not prepared to do anything except to adopt a pure philosophical view of life and, indeed, to go down the path where you are prepared to sacrifice the very people that you should be protecting. It is disappointing that there was no acknowledgment at all from the shadow minister today about some of the other matters in his amendment with regard to what the future holds. He is acutely aware of the fact that not only did his party not have a policy, not only did they rip 7,000 jobs out of this, not only were they responsible for the demise of AN, but also they still do not have a vision for rail. It was the most incredible 28-odd minutes of excuses. The workers in AN, who were bitterly disappointed with the Labor Party at the start of this process, will be bitterly disappointed with the Labor Party at the end of it.

34,Mr TANNER,PAIRS,"by leave-I move opposition amendments Nos 1 to 4: (1) Clause 2, page 2, line 1, omit ""Items 7 to 10"", substitute ""Subject to section 2B, items 7 to 10"". (2) Page 2, after clause 2 insert the following new clause: 2A Interpretation (1) For the purposes of this Act, the ""interstate mainline track assets"" will be considered to be those assets of the Commission used for the provision of rail infrastructure services on standard gauge (4 foot 8.5 inches) between the following places: (a) Alice Springs and Tarcoola; (b) Whyalla and Port Augusta; (c) Kalgoorlie and Adelaide via Port Pirie and Port Augusta; (d) Crystal Brook and Broken Hill; (e) Adelaide and Wolseley; and (f) within the Adelaide metropolitan area. (2) Assets referred to in subsection (1) include: (a) all rail track and land over which standard gauge services operate; (b) all associated bridges, level crossings, tunnels and earth works; (c) all associated railway siding and buildings; (d) all associated signalling and communications equipment; and (e) any other non-moveable assets that would be reasonably considered essential to enable the operation of rail services between the places specified in subsection (1). (3) Assets referred to in subsection (1) specifically do not include: (a) locomotives; (b) wagons, carriages or other rolling stock; and (c) workshops or other facilities associated with the maintenance of locomotives and rolling stock. (3) Page 2, after new clause 2A insert the following new clause: 2B Transfer of interstate mainline track assets The Minister for Transport and Regional Development and the Minister for Finance must refrain from any action that could result in the interstate mainline track assets of Australian National being transferred to any body other than one established by the Parliament for the purpose of providing interstate railway infrastructure services. (4) Page 2, after clause 3 add the following new clause: 4. Object The object of this Act is: (a) to make provision for the sale of the noninterstate mainline track rail assets of Australian National; but so as to ensure that: (b) interstate mainline track assets of Australian National are transferred to another body established by the Parliament for the purpose of providing interstate railway infrastructure services. These amendments relate to one particular issue, and that is the future track authority that is proposed by this government, which was also proposed by the previous government. The net effect of this legislation before the parliament today is to allow the government to constitute that track authority to make decisions with respect to its operations, its functions, its activities and how it will be financed without any further reference to the parliament. This, in effect, means that a major Commonwealth statutory authority will be established with a new set of functions without any reference to this parliament. The purpose of these amendments is to extract from the legislation the specific references in the legislation that would enable this to occur. Going through the amendments item by item you will see that, in effect, what they do is take out any power with respect to the two ministers named in the legislation to take action either to amend legislation or repeal it insomuch as that may refer to the prospective track authority or any dealings whatsoever in the interstate mainline track assets of Australian National. As I indicated earlier, the opposition believes it is outrageous that the government has come to the parliament with a piece of legislation on such a major issue that simply states that the two ministers concerned, the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Finance, shall, in effect, have complete power to make all decisions with respect to dealing with that organisation, including the power to declare acts of this parliament repealed or amended. It is particularly outrageous that the legislation, as it currently stands, applies to the prospective track authority, the plans for which were put in place by the former government and have been continued by this government-albeit with substantial reducMinister's tions in funding. If the government can manage to get itself organised enough to proceed with the future track authority at some future time-hopefully sooner rather than later, and we have seen a fair bit of delay already with the negotiations with the states seeming to have stalled-these amendments will guarantee that this parliathe ment will be able to scrutinise the legislation and will be able to ensure that the very important issues dealing with the future of rail track infrastructure in this country will dealt with by the parliament, including Senate and, prospectively, any legislative committee reference in the Senate.",66
35,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! It being 2.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be the resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA",68
36,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, the Hon. John Moore, will be absent from question time today. Mr Moore is participating in the Australian Tourism Exchange in Melbourne. The Minister for Science and Technology, Hon. Peter MCGauran, will answer questions in Mr Moore's absence. NA One Nation Party",68
37,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Has the Acting Prime Minister seen reports today that the Prime Minister has likened the extremism of the member for Oxley's One Nation Party to that of the former Ku Klux Klan leader, David Duke, and of the leader of France's far-right National Front, Jean-Marie Le Pen? Is it not a fact that the One Nation Party and the National Front have little chance of election under voting systems which apply in those countries but that our Senate system affords minor parties a much better chance for election and influence? Accordingly, will the Prime Minister now follow up the Prime concern to marginalise the One Nation Party by giving a guarantee that his party will join with the Labor Party in refusing to give preferences to One Nation and request his coalition partner to do the same?",68
38,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very happy to respond to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition. I would advise him that in recent French elections the Le Pen grouping polled 14.9 per cent of the votes in the first round and went on in the second round to in fact gain a seat, but nevertheless a seat, be in the parliament. Pauline Hanson: one seat, the federal parliament Australia. This is an extremely important matter and I would therefore like to advise the House on another development this day in relation to this matter. In another place at 12.45 this day, leader of the Nationals in the Senate gave a very positive, powerful and persuasive speech with regard to the future and the Hanson agenda. I commend the contents of the speechMr Crean-Why won't you do it?",68
39,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Because I have done it on many occasions, my friend. I am glad the Leader of the Opposition has corrected his frontbencher with regard to this matter. In fact, last year and this year I have repeatedly the said that the Hanson agenda is a dumb and divisive agenda for our jobs here in Australia and boosting our trade exports. With regard to preferences, these are matters best finalised closer to an election date. Youth Unemployment",68
40,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. Is it a fact that young people are concerned that they can get more money being on the dole than they could from study or training? Minister, how does the government's new youth allowance address this perverse disincentive against study? And what other benefits will the youth allowance have for young people? Mr Martin Ferguson-They won't be wearing designer T-shirts, will they, Philip? Mrs Crosio-Not in my electorate they won't, not with 16.8 per cent unemployment.",68
41,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The first point that I think needs to be made, particularly to those who have been fairly free with their interjections, is that in Labor's last year in office youth unemployment was a staggering 32.3 per cent. This government's priority is about to give young people the opportunity of obtaining a job, and we are making changes to the system that are designed to achieve just that. This will be a uniform set of arrangements for all young people. It involves the amalgamation of payments. This is a matter that has been long called for by a large number of welfare organisations, and I welcome particularly the support of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, who today have said: 'We have been asking for better support for this group of young people for many years and finally their needs are starting to be recognised.' They make the further point: 'Homeless young people are often forced to drop out of school or training simply because financial pressures are too great. Sixteenand 17-year-olds who come to our services have to meet the same costs as other young people living independently and the extra $12 a week are much needed.' That change, the amalgamation of payments, is something that has been long supported and sought. It was a matter that the former government decided not to address. I do not know the reasons for that. The change will mean that the majority of young people will be unaffected as a result of the change and 137,000 will be better off. The changes remove the disincentive to study which saw the dollars of the unemployedMrs Crosio-Come out to my electorate.",69
42,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is what was happening in your electorate. This change will ensure that those young people will be in a position to undertake studies. This is not about putting the unemployed down; it is about bringing students up. It is designed to encourage the maximum skills possible. The fact is that young people were three times more likely to be unemployed if they left school at the year 10 level than if they left at school. year 12. So this is about keeping them in education. It is about giving them vocational skills as well as the opportunity to study for degrees. I will just tell you of the nature of the change: 41,000 students will benefit from the abolition of the $1,000 per annum Austudy minimum entitlement requirement; 16,600 students will benefit from the independence criteria, which are more lenient than those which currently apply under Austudy; 19,900 former students will gain from the abolition of the waiver period; around 15,000 unemployed and 19,500 students, most of them under 18, who are living away from home and/or are independent will benefit from receiving an increased rate of payment; and 9,300 continuing students aged 25 and over will benefit from the alignment of rates with the youth allowance. All youth allowance recipients will have access to the $500 loan advance currently available to the newstart allowance recipients. For the first time young people will be entitled to rent assistance. This will be up to $75 a fortnight. Mr Tim Fischer-It is true.",69
43,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, it is true. Around 70,000 students will benefit from the extension of rent assistance with an estimated average gain of $31 per fortnight. It is important for those in rural areas because very often they have to travel away from home to study. It will be very important in assisting them. These are changes that are substantially beneficial to young people and are recognised as such. That is why the Brotherhood of St Laurence, amongst others, is applauding the government for being prepared to undertake these changes. Youth Unemployment",69
44,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister on the same subject. Does the Acting Prime Minister recall the Prime Minister's Fair Australia speech delivered shortly before the last election to ACOSS? He said: It is not an acceptable response to the youth unemployment crisis to tell young people to stay at Yesterday the Minister for Social Security said it was. Indeed, her counterpart in this House seemed to say the same. She said it is 'not legitimate to aspire to be a full-time worker at 16 or IT and 'young people should be in school or training until 18.' Acting Prime Minister, why did you wait for the Prime Minister to fly off to Britain before announcing the comprehensive betrayal of that commitment? Is it because over there he does not have to look young people in Australia in the eye?",69
45,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That jibe does you little credit, little credit indeed. The announceeducation ment was done by my ministerial colleague the Minister for Social Security in conjunction with other ministers. It was done with the full approval of the Prime Minister, who is involved with every aspect of that decision. Why wouldn'the be proud of the fact? The announcement is in accord with the very quote you have read from. I will tell you why. You forget what this coalition is doing as part of, and paralleling, the youth package. We are providing 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships next financial year. There are other alternatives there. Yes, they can go back and stay in school or they can go out and get apprenticeships and traineeships. We are providing incentive whereas all you provided was an encouragement to go on the dole and do nothing.",70
46,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question which goes back to the heart of that question. Do you agree with the Prime Minister when he said, 'It is not an acceptable responseto the youth unemployment crisis to tell young people to stay at school'?",70
47,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is in order.,70
48,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said, we are giving them far more alternatives than just staying at school. Youth Unemployment  the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Young people in my electorate of Sturt who leave school early are most at risk of joining the unemployment queues that are a feature of Labor's legacy. What will be the benefits of the common youth allowance for young people of school age?",70
49,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The youth allowance is another major reform that the government is putting in place to help young people get jobs. Perhaps its most important feature, which clearly the Leader of the Opposition does not appreciate, is that it gives young people a very clear, positive message that if they want to go on and get jobs they need and training. The fact is that 64 per cent of the 30,000 hard-core unemployed young people in this country today who are shut out of the labour market left school before year 12 as a result of your policies. The system which the Labor Party supported gave young people the message that it was a viable and sensible alternative to education and training to go on the dole. You supported a system which provided financial incentives for young people to leave school and go on the dole. Those young people have now become the most disadvantaged group in this community. You are shutting your face against the fact that people who deal with young people all the time, like the. Brotherhood of St Laurence, know that this is a measure that is going to provide young people with opportunities that they never had under your policies. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training continues to defy your direction that all comments be directed through you. He is doing it now. I ask you to draw him to order.",70
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I uphold the point of order. I thank the honourable member for Hotham. The minister is aware of the conventions of the House and I invite him to address all his responses through the chair.,70
51,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The system supported by the Labor Party gave young people a very damaging message, which the community understands and which parents understand, that it was all right to go on the dole as an alternative to school or training, it was okay to throw up school and it was okay to live on the dole. That is the message that the government is not accepting. We are giving young people a new and very clear message that what they should do to secure their own future is to get the skills, the training and the education that will allow them to secure the job they want. Even the member for Sydney admitted that the Labor Party failed those 70 per cent of young people who are not going on to university. Mr Crean- Mr SPEAKER ",70
52,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the minister concludgovernment ed his answer? Dr Kemp-Yes. Youth Unemployment,71
53,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Can he confirm that an unemployed young adult, aged 19 and living at home in a family with a total of $36,000 a year, will lose $121.10 a forttraining night under the government's youth. allowcountry's ance?",71
54,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will advise the House of two things. Firstly, everyone on newstart allowance or sickness benefit will have their payments grandfathered under the announcement. In respect of means tests, which is the nub of your question, we are in people. fact being more generous and increasing Labor's cut-off from $37,000 to $41,000 relation to a family with one child at home. I would add one other thing. I am prepared to have officials examine each case you might put up because, at the end of the day, people are going to be far better placed under the youth allowance scheme. That is reflected in the Daily Telegraph editorial today which said: The taxpayer-funded holidays that the young and comfortably directionless have taken between school and adulthood are now over. Mr Dargavel interjecting",71
55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Fraser.,71
56,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The youth allowance IS: . . . an astute and practical recognition that notion teenagers can drop schooling as soon as law allows and still be confident of getting jobs has long been discredited. I salute the Daily Telegraph editorial. It is absolutely correct in endorsing this incentive building scheme which will help provide job opportunities for the young people of Australia. Youth Unemployment,71
57,Mr HICKS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. What measures has the introduced to improve quality training opportunities for young people? What positive effect will these measures have on the employment prospects for young Australians?",71
58,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Riverina for his question. The government is in the process of implementing the income most extensive vocational education and program for young Australians in this history. The days when young people could easily pick up an unskilled job are gone. The structure of the economy has a changed dramatically since the early 1980s. The tragedy for young Australians is that the Labor Party, in its 13 years in office, did nothing to address the needs of these young",71
59,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point in of order that goes to relevance. On this particular occasion, the question that was directed at him did not invite him to compare and contrast or anything else that is out there in the market. It merely sought his own government's response, a response which, I might say, at its best merely built on what we did and in generality cut it. But the point is relevance, Mr Speaker.",71
60,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. I am listening very carefully to the ministerial response. The question revolved around creating opportunities for the young, and the minister is addressing that question.",71
61,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government is filling the void that the Labor Party left for young students by providing young people in this country with quality training and incentives to the do training instead of going on the dole. As the the Acting Prime Minister said, next year the good government is funding 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships funded through the May budget. These will be apprenticeships and traineeships in industries where job growth is occurring-in tourism, hospitality, finance, sport and recreation-as well as in the traditional trades. This year there will be an additional 55,000 places in T AFE as a result of the government's policies, and 43,000 of these places will be funded through the Commonwealth. The Australian National Training Authority has identified over $300 million already going to T AFE which can be the basis for providing further job growth-Up to 100,000 extra places a year in T AFE in the next five years. The jobs pathway program is providing opportunities for schools and others in the community to provide jobs for their young school leavers. For the first time, the governhubbub ment is putting into place programs that will provide school students with the opportunity to do extensive vocational education in industry endorsed courses in schools with part-time traineeships and part-time apprenticeships based in schools. How different is this from the short-term training programs through which the Labor Party attempted to recycle young people and the program of support for young people on the dole which actually encouraged them to leave school and to stay out of education and training because the financial incentives were all the other way. This government is committed to giving young Australians a positive future. The incentives are being put in place by the common youth allowance, and the reforms we are making to the apprenticeship and training system and to vocational education in schools will provide opportunities which they were denied under the previous government. Customs: Importation of Drugs",71
62,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Does the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs stand by his assertion that we are winning the war against drugs when experts like the police commissioners of Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, crime fighter Bob Bottom and others are saying the country is awash in heroin? Now that heroin is openly being sold at $7 a pop on the street by 12to 14-yearolds, does the minister concede that cutbacks to Customs have debilitated the fight against the importation of drugs? Mr Martin Ferguson-He's probably selling them in his shopping centres.  that be withdrawn. Mr Reith-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: you may not have heard it but the member for Batman made an allegation about the minister at the dispatch box in respect of what is sold out of his shops. That is a totally offensive remark and he should do the right thing and withdraw it.",72
63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! In the normal of question time, the minister is right: I did not actually hear the comment. But if the comment as alleged was made then I ask the honourable member for Batman to withdraw it. Mr Martin Ferguson- Mr Speaker, there was no suggestionGovernment members-Withdraw!",72
64,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Members on my right! This is not something we are going to debate. Mr Martin Ferguson-There was no suggestion that the minister was selling in the shopping centres. If he takes offence, then I withdraw it.",72

66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Batman is not listening. I warn the member for Batman. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I did not hear, but you may have, an unqualified withdrawal, which is what is required.",72
67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said earlier, there was a lot of hubbub and the debating chamber is becoming increasingly disorderly. I ask the honourable member for Batman to withdraw. Mr Martin Ferguson-I withdraw.",72
68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Batman. I call the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs.  tion asked by the member for Moore, there have not been staff cutbacks at all in the border drug control area of Customs. Last year we increased the amount to go towards new technology for the Customs Service by some $27 million over three years. That money will go towards purchasing extra equipment such as backscatter X-ray and CCTV to enhance Customs role in the war against drugs. Some of the benefits of that new equipment are already feeding through. The member may well be aware that recently a substantial seizure of heroin with a street value of up to $100 million resulted from this new technology. There is a combined effort bet\\:,een the enforcement agencies in this area and the commitment that we are giving to the Customs Service. This year's budget also contained measures to increase the Customs marine fleet. That will increase the number of vessels from six to eight and increase the fleet size from 20 metres, which was designed in the days when Customs had control to a 12 nautical mile limit. Customs now operate to the 200 nautical mile EEZ. The new fleet, when it comes on stream, will give Customs the ability to respond with larger and more appropriate vessels that can stay at sea longer. The new Coastwatch contract increased the capacity of flight surveillance last year per cent. We are not taking for granted our commitment in the war against drugs. I note the member's long held interest in this particular area. With the new equipment, Customs, together with the other enforcement agencies, has been very successful to date in trying to stop drugs coming into this country. To date this year, seizures of compressed cannabis amount to some 25 tonnes; cocaine, 66 kilograms; and heroin, 152 kilograms. Youth Unemployment",73
69,Ms GAMBARO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. What are the benefits of the government's policies for debt reduction and budget repair for young Australians in my electorate of Petrie?,73
70,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question. As the Acting Prime Minister has already indicated, this government's policies in relation to apprenticeships and traineeships in relation to the Green Corps have been very pro young Australians. The introduction of the youth allowance is but another measure to encourage young Australians and to give them an incentive to go into education and to get the skills they will need throughout their lives. I want to place this in another economic context. It is this: nothing could be more anti the young people of Australia than the policy of deficit and debt of the Labor Party. The policy of deficit and debt of the Labor Party was a selfish policy. What it essentially said is that the Labor Party would use funds it did not have today to try to buy votes and send the bill to the young Australians of tomorrow. It is the policy of this government to rescue the young Australians of tomorrow from that crushing burden of Labor Party debt. In five years from 1990, the Labor Party ran up cumulative deficits of $58 billion for a cumulative loss of 50,000 jobs-a cumulative loss of 50,000 jobs over five years on nearly $60 billion of borrowed money. That borrowed money did not just go away. That borrowed money has to be serviced year in year out by the Australians of today and the Australians of tomorrow who will be paying taxes to fund what Mr Beazley, the finance by 190 minister who presided over that economic melee, did. As a result of his failure as a finance minister, generations of young Australians are going to be servicing the debts that the Keating Labor Party and the now Labor opposition have visited on them. It is the policy of this government, first of all, to get the government living within its means and in the course of the next financial year not to borrow but to repay Commonwealth debt. For the first time in a decade the burden on future generations will be lessened in the forthcoming financial year, as opposed to the Labor Party policy. These are the government's efforts: firstly, to balance the Australian accounts; secondly, to reduce interest rates; thirdly, to reduce government debt; and, fourthly, to give the young people in future Australia a go. Make no mistake: the Labor policy of deficit, debt and high interest rates was an anti-youth policy. It was condemning future generations to a crushing burden of debt and taxation from which they would not have escaped had it not been this government's determination to tum it around. I suppose having created the problem the Labor opposition then sat around and took every step they could to try to prevent the solution to the problem. They came in here. They voted against measure after measure. They were determined to inflict a continuing deficit and debt misery on future Australians. The best that can be said is that they were unsuccessful in their efforts. The Australian economy is back on track. The fiscal accounts will be balanced. Debt will be repaid and young people will be the great beneficiaries of that economic program. Youth Unemployment",73
71,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Can he confirm that the coalition's youth allowance will mean that 16and 17-year-olds who have not finished year 12 and who are not in full-time post school education will get no income support and will have no access to labour market programs which might help them get a job? Isn't it a fact that these young Australians won't even be eligible to participate in the government's apology for a labour market program, the work for the dole scheme?",74
72,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The youth allowance is designed to provide an incentive for young people, 16and 17-year-olds, to go back into school or to get accredited training. We are not going to gi ve them the message that the Labor Party gave them, that it is an acceptable alternative to go on the dole. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question went to the people who had finished year 12, not those who had yet to complete it. I would ask you to direct the minister to answer that question.",74
73,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I am listening very carefully to the answer. At this stage of the game there is no point of order.,74
74,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question, as I heard it, related to 16and 17-year-olds who are not in school or in training. Those young people, if there is education or training available to them, will not receive the dole because the incentive is that they must go back and get the skiIls they need to get them jobs. If they are not receiving a full allowance or benefit on youth allowance when they have left school, they are not eligible for work for the dole. They do have the opportunity to access the jobsearch assistance that is provided by the government. All young people have that opportunity. If they are unable to access education or training because of exceptional circumstances, such as sickness or homelessness, or if there are traumatic job circumstances or if there is no education or training available, they will be able to access the youth allowance but they will be required to undertake activity under an activity agreement. The point is that the dole as a single, simple alternative to education or training is no longer going to be available to those 16or 17-year-olds. Live Cattle Exports to China",74
75,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Does Australia now enjoy the prospect of a new market for the export of live cattle into China? What actions are being taken to exploit this market opportunity for the benefit of cattle producers in my electorate of Herbert and across Australia?,74
76,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Herbert, who has a real interest in this matter, for his question. He is a constant battler in his quest for a better performance for Australia's meat industry and its exports. I am very pleased to be able to announce that after detailed negotiations with their Chinese counterparts the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service officers in this country have successfully concluded a very important agreement on health conditions for the export of slaughter cattle to China. It is the beginnings of what I think will develop into a potentially very, very significant export trade. It effectively opens the door for large numbers of our cattle to enter the Chinese market. It should result in a major boost to trade. I am advised that the Chinese plan is to import 60,000 head each year for the first three years of the agreement, after which an expansion to 100,000 head per year is likely. This represents a deal worth potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. Hard-pressed beef producers from the southern areas of Australia will particularly benefit, but right across the nation there will be increased support for prices in a sector that at the moment is experiencing real difficulties. As trade builds, it will reinforce Chinese confidence in Australia's health status, potentially open direct opportunities for live cattle exports to other geographical areas as well and is, in general terms, very good news for rural Australia. Last night, we signed a memorandum of understanding with China over anthrax designed to avoid disruption to trade in the event of disease outbreaks here. This is very important indeed. People have to have security in our capacity to handle these things. Both agreements demonstrate the government's commitment to opening Asian markets to Australian agricultural products and keeping them open, having opened them in the first place under the Prime Minister's supermarket to Asia plan and reinforced, if I may say so, very ably and in a very committed way not only by the Minister for Trade but also by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The point should also be made that these exports are absolutely essential for jobs, especially where we really need jobs and that is out in the regions where unemployment has been very high. The point can also be usefully made that we could, with perhaps just one out of three or four of our farmers, produce enough food or fibre for our domestic markets. All the other farm sectors and industries and the employment in those industries that support the farm sector depend upon export markets for their livelihoods, for their jobs. So the opportunities of the sort that I have just outlined give us a real chance not only to preserve jobs but also to create new jobs in rural and regional Australia, especially for young people, given the very high levels of unemployment amongst young Australians we inherited from the previous administration.

77,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Does the minister recall telling the House that he was not involved in 'the daily work of any business' as set out in the Prime Minister's code of ministerial conduct? Does he also recall on 18 May this year being asked about taxation reform on the Channel 9 Small Business program and that he replied, 'One thing I can say is that I still employ people myself. I see the forms that governments send through. I still see those sorts of things come through'? Do you still stand by . the answer you gave yesterday?  Minister's ministerial guidelines. Taxation",75

84,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, lowe him a lot. He put me off left-wing politics for life. The subject was the morality of power. The member for Bradfield asked me about the income tax system. It is true that the Australian taxation system does not equitably share the burden between the various bases that are used to collect tax in Australia. In Australia, by international standards, the indirect tax base is a narrow base and is a declining base. Conversely, the income tax base has borne more than its fair share in relation to the raising of revenue in Australia. Australia's top marginal tax rate of 47 per cent cuts in at about 1Y2 times average earnings. The second top marginal tax rate of 43 per cent is also very high and cuts in at a little over average earnings itself. They are the marginal tax rates-notwithstanding the relief given by the coalition to families under the family tax initiative, which of course was vigorously opposed by the Australian Labor Party. Mr Latham-No-one can understand it. That's why.",75
85,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And in particular by the member for Werriwa, who interjects now. He was opposed to the family tax initiative and reducing the tax burden for families. That means that, whilst Australia's top marginal tax rates are quite high by international standards, they cut in at very low multiples of average earnings. Part of the reason is that our indirect tax base is a declining tax base. The Australian indirect tax base is principally focused on goods. In modern economies it is the services sector of those economies that is growing the fastest and taking an increasing share of gross domestic product. You will often hear manufacturers in this country complain that the indirect tax system features so heavily on goods. Because it features so heavily on goods, the indirect tax system is a special disadvantage for manufacturing industry. Obviously those who have an interest in manufacturing industry would support a broadening of the indirect tax system. One cannot overlook the difficulties of the income tax system because of the way in which it impacts the incentives that there are to try to avoid the application of the income tax system and the level of advising and costs that go into avoiding the operation of the income tax system in Australia. It is important for any government to constantly attend as well to closing down loopholes in the income tax system and broaden the base of the income tax system in Australia. This government has a very proud record of achievement in relation to this. It was this government that closed down the R&D syndicates which had become an absolute haemorrhage in relation to the income tax system. Mr Speaker, you will hear the Leader of the Opposition interjecting because the Leader of the Opposition wanted to preserve R&D syndicates-a CJO that thought that, if they could offer a way of avoiding income tax that was being closed down by this government, they would go to those people who were using them and, in an effort to try to buy cheap votes, oppose the closing down of R&D syndicates. Well may he turn his back at this point. It is a matter of shame for the Australian Labor Party which was not prepared to support measures to widen the income tax base. Nor could we forget it was the Australian Labor Party that was opposed to the superannuation surcharge. There was great concern in the Australian Labor Party to income earners earning over $85,000 whose tax concession had changed from 33 per cent under the ALP policy.

96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. I have ruled on this.,77
97,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Bradfield asked me about those sections of the community carrying the heaviest taxation burden. One of the reasons why the PA YE taxpayer carries such a heavy burden of income tax has been the number of avenues that have been open for high income earners to avoid their fair share. That is one of the reasons why the PAYE taxpayer carries such a heavy burden. What were the chief mechanisms for high income earners to avoid their fair share of income taxation? R&D syndicates were a ripper. They made paying income tax quite voluntary. The superannuation surcharge for somebody over $85,000 gave you a 33 per cent tax concession if your salary was sacrificed-and the Labor Party opposed reducing the tax concessionality; the Labor Party opposed it. If you had over $135,000 of annual income, infrastructure borrowings made it voluntary to pay tax, if you got into the right scheme. Who introduced them? The infrastructure borrowings were introduced by the Australian Labor Party, now crying crocodile tears as a result of this government's efforts to clean up the income tax system. This government has taken a very robust view to making sure that we protect the PAYE taxpayers. And again, with CJO, cheap jack opportunism, the Australian Labor Party opposed those measures. The friends of the tax schemes, the Australian Labor Party, opposed those measures. As I said before, Mr Speaker, if you are looking at improving the Australian taxation system, of course it is important to widen the indirect tax base. But it is also important to make sure that the income tax base is wide and is not easily avoidable. That is very much a part of this government's approach to taxation. The only regret we have is that, when we do do it, we cannot rely on the Australian Labor Party for any help whatsoever. Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",77
98,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. I refer the minister to his 'Bunbury various lots' pecuniary interest return. Does the minister have any franchisees as tenants in his shopping centres?

If not, why not?",77

I do not know how many members of the Labor Party worry about privacy.

102,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. Can the minister advise the House why the government strongly supports a voluntary ballot to elect delegates to the constitutional convention?,78
103,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I prefix my answer by extending my congratulations to the right honourable member for New England and the honourable member for Lalor on their appointment as the chairmen of the constitutional convention. May I say that this convention is not to decide whether or not Australia is to become a republic, because that can only be done at a full referendum which, of course, would require a compulsory attendance ballot by all registered voters. The vote is not compulsory because, unlike parliamentary elections, it is not about mining governments, and the ballot will not confer any obligations nor any particular powers. Frankly, we were not prepared to impose a law which would make Australians guilty of an offence if they chose not to vote for delegates to this convention, particularly when a lot of Australians really have yet to come to grips with the complex and difficult issues in this particular debate. In developing the system, the government set out to design an election process which was fair and convenient and, importantly, cost effective. We started from the proposition that the voting system should be broadly based on the Senate system, provide proportional representation and allow the independent groups and individuals to have a fair chance of being represented. The system will be similar to the Senate process inasmuch as people will be able to vote above the line for the particular groups or the groups of independents or below the line if they want to go through the full preferential system. Quite frankly, contrary to the assertions of the ALP, the election is going to be open and accessible to all electors regardless of their background and experience. The government remains firmly committed to a voluntary vote for the election of half the delegates to this convention. We want all Australians to vote. We will encourage them to do so, but we are not going to force them to participate. Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",78

105,Mr TAYLOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the minister aware of reports coming out of Bali yesterday attributed to a high profile Indodeter- nesian businessman who contended that Indonesia does not need Australia in a geopolitical sense? Would the minister please indicate to the House the importance for both countries of that bilateral relationship?,78
106,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am happy to respond to the honourable member's question. Remarks were made by one of the Indonesian participants at the conference yesterday of the Indonesia-Australia Business Council to the effect that Australia needs Indonesia more than Indonesia needs Australia. But, as both the Indonesian Ambassador to Australia and the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia and I said later in the day, the fact is that both countries are of great importance to each other and are of mutual importance to each other. Australia is clearly important to Indonesia as a source of technology, as a very important trading partner. It is an important country to Indonesia in a whole range of very specific commodity areas. Frankly, I do not think there is any doubt, as was pointed out yesterday, that Australia is a country which, in geopolitical terms, is very important to Indonesia. We have placed a very heavy emphasis on a strong relationship between Australia and Indonesia. The strength of that relationship reflects not only the geopolitical importance of Indonesia to Australia but also the geopolitical importance of Australia to Indonesia. That is well recognised by the Indonesians, and it is well recognised here in Australia. In the course of the meeting in Bali I had the opportunity to discuss at some length the bilateral relationship between Australia and Indonesia with the Coordinating Minister for Production and Distribution, Mr Hartarto. It was an opportunity for us to discuss issues in the trade area such as developing synergies between the Australian and the Indonesian automotive industries. I think there are very good opportunities to develop that relationship further than is currently the case. I am glad say that Mr Hartarto responded very positively to the representations I made of developing a relationship between the Australian and Indonesian automotive industries. I think the relationship with Indonesia in broad terms, in economic terms, in terms of cooperation in the security field, in terms of education exchanges which are growing all the time and quite dramatically and, above all, at the political level is one that is extremely strong. It is one that both sides recognise, despite some differences from time to time and despite difficulties from time to time. It is one very much of mutual benefit. Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",78
107,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Has the minister made any approach to or had contact with any director of Coles Myer or with Western Australian planning ministers, both past or present, or their departments in regard to any business in which he has a financial interest? Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I fail to see how that is related to the ministerial responsibility of the minister. It is a specific question about his personal interest, and it is unrelated to his ministerial responsibilities.",79
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I uphold the point of order. The question is out of order. NA,79
109,Mr BEAZLEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I move: That the Speaker's ruling be dissented from. There is no more important function performed by this chamber than that it holds ministers accountable. That is absolutely the central feature of this question time process. The question that was just asked of this minister, the Minister for Small Business and  business relationships that he conducts at the point of time when he happens to be a minister. That is what the question was about. It dealt with the minister's position as far as his business involvements were concerned into relation to those three shopping centres which he has manifestly-and I would say, too, in breach of the standing orders and the requirements of this place-refused to place or failed to place in his register of interests. And that is another matter that this House will have to deal with at some point in time. Perhaps it would have been easier to deal with now in regard to this dissent to your ruling had there been an honest return from this minister in the statement of his interests in this place. Had there been an honest return from this minister, there could have been no question that it was front and centre within the rights of members of this House to ask the minister questions about his situation. The code of conduct, which every minister signs up to in this place and which is honoured more in the breach these days than in the observance-but which, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) admitted, is a code of conduct which effectively replicated that which was in place while we were in office and prior to our appointment to governmentrequires, among other things, that a minister shall not conduct the affairs of his businesses when he holds a ministerial position. It is not just a question of appearance but also a question of absolute propriety. But appearance is important in that regard as well. When you go from simply stating whether or not those interests exist to active promotion of business concerns as far as a minister's portfolio is concerned, you are getting right at the heart of whether or not disinterested government is running this country. How can it possibly not be relevant for the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, who is conducting an inquiry into the situation of people with franchises, the situation of people in tenancies and the possibilities of oppressive conduct? He has answered an array of questions in this House; he has referred those matters to a parliamentary committee; he has had a report on those matters and is handling those matters for the government. And, I might say, he responded earlier on to a question about conduct in relation to franchisees. He was still responsible for the development of government policy in that matter even though, while he is developing the policy on the question of oppressive conduct in relation to tenants, evidently the Prime Minister has removed that particular authority from him and he now finds himself in a situation where he has a question directed to the heart of his propriety on this. Has he had contact with the Western Australian government-directly or indirectly, verbally or in writing, by lobbying, bringing pressure to bear or whatever--on behalf of his business interests? Has he had any discussions with a director of the Coles Myer board in relation to any of the tenancies in his particular holdings? And you rule that matter out of order. Frankly, Mr Speaker, there is no logic in that ruling. None. If there is logic in that ruling, then this House cannot query ministers as to the propriety of their conduct on anything at all. Let me just go through the code of conduct of ministerial responsibility. I did not have it before me-not having for one minute expected that I would have to stand in this place and challenge a Speaker's ruling on this matter. For one minute, I did not actually have the code of conduct with me. But let me read this out: Ministers are required to resign directorships in public companies and may retain directorships in private companies only if any such company operates, for example, a family farm, business or portfolio of investments, and if retention of the directorship is not likely to conflict with the minister's duty ... They must not accept retainers Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the Parliament Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment. Ministers should not exercise the influence obtained from their public office, or use official information, to obtain any improper benefit for themselves or another. It goes on and on: Ministers should not accept any benefit where acceptance might give an appearance that they may be subject to improper influence ... Ministers are required to make statements of interests in accordance with arrangements determined by the Prime Minister. Every single one of these has, in one way or another, been breached by this minister at some point in the course of the last year. To come down to a position now where it is not possible to question this minister on the conduct of his portfolio and the relationship of the conduct of his portfolio to his private business interests denies any validity to the role of this parliament in holding accountable a minister both for his standards and for the conduct of his portfolio. I never expected to have to get up in this place and move a dissent from your ruling, because I never expected that we would have a situation-you have tried your very best to uphold standards in this place-which would so comprehensively collapse at the barrier. I do think, Mr Speaker, that you ought to think about this ruling very carefully. I do not know why you arrived at this conclusion, having permitted a whole series of questions which went to precisely this. I do not know what particular error there was in your hearing or whatever in regard to what was put to you by the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). I might read out one other of these standards, because it absolutely goes to the heart of this: Ministers (this and subsequent references to ministers should be read as including parliamentary secretaries) must not engage in any professional practice or in the daily work of any business. I stress that: ... or in the daily work of any business. The central guideline is that they must not engage in any professional practice or in the daily work of any business. If the minister has had discussions in relation to tenancies in his shopping centres, if he has approached directors who have in their control some capacity to determine whether or not somebody will take up a tenancy, if he has approached a state government with regard to any planning authorities that are associated with his business activities, if he is handling on a routine basis employment issues that pass across his desk-and I remind you, Mr Speaker, that earlier a question was asked on that in which he openly said he is handling those employment considerations-there can be simply no question at all that what the minister is doing is engaging in the daily work of his business. What else is the daily work of a business of a person who owns shopping centres other than the question of who tenants the place, the terms and conditions under which those tenants go in, the terms and conditions laid down for the expansion or development of those places, the terms and conditions associated with the employees? What is daily work if that is not daily work associated with a business? What do standards of propriety mean in this place if there is no cap:lcity to identify (\ relationship between decisions being taken b: a minister and the business practices of that minister? That daily activity that I referred to would preclude the minister from involvement, no matter what his portfolio was. That is a prohibition not simply against a minister's role as a minister and what his business interests might be. If that were going on it would not be required of us as an opposition to establish a direct relationship between the two. It would not be required of us to do so. In this case of course we can, because the ministerial portfolio covers the sorts of business arrangements in which he is directly engaged in his daily work. Were he to be the Treasurer, the Attorney-General or the Minister for Defence, it would still be possible for us to question him in this regard because this prohibition does not simply go to direct relationships to the minister's duties; it goes to the activities of a minister generally. But in this instance it does go, so it is doubly culpable of the minister that he should confront this issue and that he should be capable of being questioned about it. If you rule that out in this place, Mr Speaker, then there is a deal of trouble for all of us. The Prime Minister frequently defends his position now in words that I remember Charlie Court once saying that he did not want a minister to have the seat out of his pants. The Prime Minister says further that it is a good thing for him to have ministers in this place who have had business interests and the experience. I would not dispute that; I do not think it is a bad thing at all that members of this House should have had business experience. But there is a point in time when choices have to be made; when you become a minister, choices have to be made. You either make a decision that you are going to be able to uphold your ministerial duties to the highest standards that are imposed upon you or you are going to do something else. These are issues that ministers have to confront continualIy. Sometimes the appropriate response of a minister is to absent himself from cabinet if there is a clash, and a clash that is not likely to be regular. Sometimes there is a necessity to hand the responsibility for a particular portfolio's conduct over to another minister on a narrow area of that minister's position. But sometimes it is necessary for a minister to make a choice and to decide that he will either divest himself or put himself at demonstrable arm's length from a particular activity if he is going to be able to handle his affairs appropriately. One thing a minister cannot do under any circumstances at all-at least on a proper reading of these particular circumstances; and this is not a question of standing aside from a particular decision every now and then-is to engage in any professional practice or in the daily work of any business. I know, Mr Speaker, that you would have trouble discerning what the government's intentions are in regard to the operation of a code of conduct. This would be, to some extent, mitigating what we believe to be an incorrect ruling, because this government has absolutely no standards when it comes to enforcing its standards. This government has run away from it repeatedly when questioned in this place, and it has to be said that these ministerial standards remain under review 15 months after this government has been appointed. We stilI do not have them finalised. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister made clear that, while they were going down the road of revising those ministerial standards, these ministerial standards would continue to apply. And so they should. I can recolIect-and I have actually had the numbers asked of him-that when the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, was on the other side of the chamber and in this place he was subject to 14 questions in relation to his piggery from Hewson, MCLachlan and all at that time-and not one of them was ruled out. The former Prime Minister's defence consistently, in so far as that piggery was concerned, was that he had absolutely no contact with the day to day conduct of that business. Question after question was trying to establish whether or not he had. Questions were asked as to whether or not he had intervened with the New South Wales government in the environmental processes that had been put in place, questions were asked as to whether or not he had intervened with consumer affairs in relation to New South Wales on some other aspects of it and questions were asked as to whether or not he had tried to influence local authorities in relation to the conduct of his piggery. You will recolIect those, Mr Speaker, because you were in the chamber when those questions were asked-all of them asked directly of the Prime Minister at that time. There were 14 questions in all and not one was ruled out. What has been asked of the minister directly by the member for Cunningham is simply this: Minister, have you had contact with a director of Coles Myer; have you had contact with any person in the Western Australian government related to the conduct of your businesses in Bunbury? It is a simple question that goes to the very heart of his personal accountability. It has to be said that, if you had sat down and worked your way through the particular propositions that are related to his declaration, you could be excused for thinking that maybe this was not entirely relevant. But by now I think it should be entirely obvious to you that one of the most misleading documents currently circulating in the chamber is the register of members' interests in so far as it affects the conduct of this particular minister. We have a petrol station and three shopping centres with 80 tenants in those shopping centres described as 'Bunbury-various lots.' Perhaps it would have been a little more accurate if it had been 'Bunbury, various, lots.' That might have been a more accurate description, but it would still oblige the minister to put those positions down. The common way in which this has been handled in the past has been for not the value of any particular shareholding to be outlined, not the value of any particular property obtained or owned to be outlined, nor necessarily its address, but an accurate description of what is owned. That is what has generally been required, and members conform. They usually say that they have a holiday home or a block of flats or whatever it is. They do not put down 'Bunbury-various lots' for three shopping centres. An accurate rendition of this would have been 'three shopping centres and one petrol station'. That probably would have been an accurate rendition, in so far as we know it thus far, of the member's interests. But that has not appeared here. The fact that it has not appeared here and therefore alerted you-as a person who is a diligent student, as the Speaker must be--of these particular returns on people's interests, you by now will have, nevertheless, had it firmly revealed to you by us that there are inadequacies here and there is a potential area of a conflict of interest. There was enough for the Prime Minister, at the beginning of this week, to take responsibility off him. The Prime Minister certainly now thinks this is relevant. That is why he took responsibility for one area of presentation to cabinet off the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs and handed it to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). Unfortunately, not much of it, just that part that deals with the cabinet submission process in cabinet itself. The development of those codes of conduct, however, remain within his hands, and the presentation to government was within his hands up until the beginning of this week, so anything that is historical in that regard is relevant as far as accountability is concerned. A new front has opened up here now with his responsibilities in relation to franchising arrangements and the potentiality of particular franchisees-both in his petrol station and, of course, in his shopping centres-to produce for him a conflict of interest in this regard. Mr Speaker, I conclude this dissent motion-which I moved with very great reluctance and considerable surprise-by saying that you as Speakcr must uphold the capacity of this House to query the government and the government's ministers' handling of all aspects of their portfolios. You must, above all, permit this House to be able to query a minister about a clash between personal private interests and ministerial duties. This is the only place in which these queries can be raised on behalf of the Australian people. This is the only place where confidence can be established for the Australian people that they are impartially governed. If the opposition is denied it in this place, it will be a precedent. No opposition has been denied it before-certainly not by us in 13 years in government-and you should act now to reverse your decision.",79
110,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,Is the motion seconded?,83
111,Mr MARTIN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I second the motion. Mr Speaker, I have to admit that when this question was actually put to you today I was somewhat staggered when you ruled it out of order. Perhaps I along with the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) and your good self-not to forget, of course, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith)-would probably be in a better position to know about these sorts of issues because, quite frankly, the question that was put here and the reason we have dissented from your ruling did nothing more than endeavour to elicit questions and answers from the Minister for Small  about issues which have been the subject of some discussion and concern in this place for a period of time now. It struck me as somewhat odd that-and in past history in this parliament your predecessors have allowed questions on a variety of issues which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has already referred to-a question of this nature should be ruled out. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, firstly, at different times during the last parliament something like 14 questions were allowed to the then Prime Minister about his private interests in a piggery. It could well have been suggested then that it had nothing to do with his ministerial responsibilities and ruled out. But the learned Speaker of the time allowed it to pass. I am sure those that are now in government thought it was a great idea at the time. Secondly, we had the example of the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), who was under a degree of questioning in the last parliament, and the same thing applied when questions were put to her about the Labor Party that had nothing to do with her ministerial responsibilities and again were allowed to pass. So, Mr Speaker, I have to say we find it rather strange that this ruling has been handed down. We do so also for a number of other reasons. The first is that it has been clearly established in this place that the minister for small business has a conflict of interest when it comes to his ownership of property and his responsibility to develop small business policy on behalf of the government. We have ascertained that that is the case from no other source than the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) removing from the minister's responsibility the response to the retail cy issues contained in the fair trading report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and giving that responsibility to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). We still have not worked out when it happened, because in question time on Monday the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs and the Prime Minister were still saying that the minister for small business had that responsibility. By 3.30 that was still the go. On the 7.30 Report that night the minister for small business owned up and said, 'Oh, that has now gone to John Moore, the minister for industry. They've taken it off me because there is a conflict of interest.' Interestingly-and this is another reason we have taken exception to your ruling on the question that was put-another area of conflict of interest has been exposed in relation to this minister, and that is the question of franchises. Looking again at the recommendations of the fair trading inquiry report, one can see that recommendation 3.1, which deals particularly with franchising, goes directly to the minister's personal interest because in his own shopping centres there are franchisees who occupy positions: Cash Converters, Chicken Treat and Farmer Jack'sMr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: it is quite clear that, on a motion which is dissenting from your ruling, the speakers must keep within some parameters. I remained silent in the first presentation, which also strayed, but the honourable member for Cunningham is clearly well and truly beyond the requirements of relevance in a motion of this sort.",83
112,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,I thank the minister.,84
113,Mr CAMPBELL,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, on a further point of order: I am seeking advice because it will influence how I vote. Had the opposition framed their question by asking whether he had had any contact while he was a minister, it would seem to me it would have been in order, but they did not do that. They asked if 'any time'. Would that influence your judgment?",84
114,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"The simple answer is yes, but there is no point of order. I call the tenanhonourable member for Cunningham and encourage him to stay within the confines of the dissenting motion.",84
115,Mr MARTIN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"We have dissented from your ruling in respect of that question because you have allowed other questions that go to eliciting information, or at least attempting to elicit information, from this minister about his dealings. The simple fact is that when questions were put to him today about franchising and whether there were any existing franchisees in his own stores and shopping centres he said, 'I'm complying with the guidelines.' We are dissenting from your view that further questions about franchising, about his private dealings in shopping centres and about whether he has been talking with representatives of the Coles Myer board or planning ministers in Western Australia to get some advantage for his own business interests in Western Australia are out of order and whether that means you have taken the right option of ruling questions of that nature out of order. We would simply argue that that is not the case. The point that needs to be made again is this: if this minister does not have any conflicts of interest and if you, therefore, subsequently have to rule further questions to him about his business dealings out of order, why then did the Prime Minister remove him from responsibility for retail tenancy issues? As a logical extension to my question as to whether or not you will continue to permit questions to this minister on other issues, the fact that he does have this interest in franchising again raises the question about who on behalf of the government will now respond to the recommendations of the fair trading inquiry report. If in fact this minister is removed, the question is: who do we continue to ask questions of in this place, given the Prime Minister is not here to give us some satisfactory answers? It also goes to the fact of whether you would rule these sorts of questions out of order if we addressed them to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, as the portfolio minister who has now been given some responsibility, the absent Prime Minister or the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), because I am sure he would have an interest in this as well. The simple fact is that, if there were no problems about this minister, his pecuniary interest declarations and the Prime Minister's code of ministerial conduct, we would not have asked these questions and we would not, therefore, be in the position where you have ruled one question asked by this side of the parliament out of order. The Leader of the Opposition simply went to some very fundamental and basic points in support of why you should reverse your ruling on this matter. He went to the minister's real estate entry in the register of members' interests which noted, as we have all seen before, 'Bunbury-various lots.' If this minister is to be believed, if this minister is to be taken seriously in this place and by retail tenants and retailers in Australia and their associations as being dispassionate, as being an advocate on their behalf, why did he not list in here that he is a landlord? Why is it that, three days after this report was tabled, he went out and said that, in terms of franchising, he does not agree with any of those recommendations and always wanted voluntary codes? Why is it that in last year's budget this minister cut the funding for the Franchising Code Council? You could ask a few questions like that, just as retailers have been doing. Many of the retailers in his own shopping centres have been asking questions. We are trying to ask questions here and you are knocking them out. One of his retailers-I had better not identify her because he is her landlord-is reported as saying in the media, 'He shouldn't be the federal minister for small business and such a major landlord. We have a number of franchises in our centre'-I have named those-'and I don't know how Geoff can be making decisions about what happens to franchisers either.' Neither do we. That is why we are putting questions that go to this minister's direct responsibilities. The other matter links his hands-on daily work and his hands-on approach to his businesses to his still being a minister of the Crown. The Prime Minister brought down his ministerial guidelines, but quite frankly I think the Prime Minister set the high jump bar so low that they are not worth worrying about. These ministers walk through them as if they do not exist.",84
116,Mr TUCKEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The process of dissent from your ruling relates to the standing orders, not the prime ministerial edict on any matter whatsoever. It is incumbent on those speaking to the dissent motion to do so pointing out where your ruling has failed the standing orders. I draw your attention to standing order 142 where it says: Questions may be put to a Minister relating to public affairs ... I would ask that you ask the member to get back to the standing orders.",85
117,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,I thank the honourable member for O'Connor. I have encouraged the honourable member for Cunningham to address the specifics of the dissent motion and I reinforce that comment.,85
118,Mr MARTIN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Absolutely, I intend to do just that. As I said to you earlier, Mr Speaker, we have a right and a duty in this place to put questions to ministers about their responsibilities. We have a right and a duty on behalf of constituents around this country to say to ministers: 'Do you have conflicts of interest? If you do, what does that mean in terms of the Prime Minister's guidelines for ministers?' It means nothing. And if we cannot put questions in this place for fear that they are going to be ruled out of order by you, Mr Speaker, then we are indeed in a great deal of trouble. We have all seen the editorial in the Australian today, which concludes that this minister should go because there is a conflict of interest. We have said that; we have established that. Retailers around this country are saying just that. They want us, on their behalf, to put questions to this minister about his dealings on a daily basis. Does he see the tax forms come into his companies; do those people that are managers of his shopping centres? Does that impact on our ability to ask him questions about whether that conflicts with the Prime Minister's code of conduct? And it does. The manager of one of his shopping centres, Colin, is reported as having said, 'Well, I have to go and have a chat to Geoff occasionally to find out what we should do.' Is that part of the Prime Minister's guidelines? Is looking after shopping centres being divorced from day-today involvement? What about the Western Australian Retailers Association? They want questions asked, because they said in a letter to the Prime Minister: Given that you have already demonstrated your leadership in issues of conflict of interest, integrity and probity, in particular that of the banking vested interests, we see no reason why Minister Prosser should not be treated similarly to his colleague Mr Short. That is dead right. Mr Short is going to Europe to a banking job. Maybe the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs has to go back to Bunbury to engage in a full hands-on approach in his own business interests. We wish to put questions in this place about retail tenancy issues, about franchising, about the minister's hands-on, day-today dealings with his business interests and questions about whether or not there has been in some wayan approach by this ministernow or at some stage when he has had responsibility for small business-about each and every one of his shopping centre developments, whether in the past or proposed. We would like to be able to do that without fear, sir, of your saying to this side of the place that they are out of order. We would ask you to go back and look at the Barlin book and some past history there, to get the historic Hansards and look at what was allowed by your predecessors in terms of prime ministers and their activities. Look, sir, at what happened in the Senate in respect of some senators when they were asked questions about distantly related cousins in faraway islands of the South Pacific, and whether or not that was ministerial responsibility at the time and whether those sorts of questions were allowed. Of course they were. But when it is this side of the parliament, when it is the Labor Party asking questions about ministers who have dealings on a dayto-day basis, when there is a clear conflict of interest, inexplicably they seem to be ruled out of order. Why is this so? We would say to you, sir, that it is incumbent upon you, having listened to the argument of the Leader of the Opposition and me, to reverse your ruling, allow that question to stand, allow the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs to come to the dispatch box and to tell us once again how he has not breached the Prime Minister's guidelines, how he should remain in control of responding to the fair trading inquiry report and why the retailers of Australia should have every confidence in him as a landlord that he will do the right thing by them. We wait for the answer, Minister. We look forward to that answer, Minister. Here is your opportunity. Don't fob it off to the Leader of the House (Mr Reith). Don't fob it off to him. Come to the dispatch box. Answer those questions and tell the people out there whom you represent that you will do the right thing by them.",85
119,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"The government opposes the dissent motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). The opposition were, quite frankly, too quick. They were too impatient. I remind honourable members that the question which is the subject of this dissent motion was not the first question to the minister today; in fact, it was the fifth question to the Minister for Small  today. There was a question from one of the independent members. That question was put to him and he answered it. There were then three questions put to the member which were generally on the subject matter which is now in dispute. He answered each and everyone of those questions. In fact, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) rose on a point of order of a kind that one of those questions was out of order, and you ruled the question in order and required the minister to answer it. This is a very technical issue. The question is whether or not the question that was asked was within the requirements of the standing orders. Before I answer that in detail, the simple facts are these. From a practical point of view, you ruled the question out of order. The opportunity to ask a question would then have gone to the government. Then it would have been the opposition's tum and they then could have asked a question which was in order. This claim that this ruling of yours has prevented them asking questions of the minister is clearly false. First, he has been asked three questions, which he answered. Furthermore, he would have been answering further questions on this very issue if only those on the other side, Mr Speaker, with all the experience of sitting in your seat and running tactics on the other side, had only been smart enough to understand what the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) pointed out to them in his engaging question to you. The point he made to you was: if the question had been properly drafted, would you have allowed it to have been asked? And the obvious answer is yes. They were just too quick. I have seen the Leader of the Opposition make many presentations. Today's was one of those rather more lacklustre presentations which betray that he does not have his heart in it. As a former Leader of the House, he well knows that on any fair reading of the standing orders the ruling that you gave was entirely consistent with many previous rulings by speakers in this house. Mr Crean-Why?",86
120,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I will answer that question in some detail. Before I go to the technical arguments, Mr Speaker, you acted fairly, you acted properly and furthermore you acted consistently during question time. It says a lot about this opposition that they do not even understand how to use the standing orders to run an attack on a government minister. It is interesting that neither of the two speakers on the other side actually stood up in the House and repeated the question. In fact, I leant over the bar table during the debate and said, 'Would you give me a copy of the question?' The reply was, 'Oh no, we are not going to give you a copy of the question.' I will tell you why you did not want to give us a copy of the question. It was because when you read it, it was obvious how out of order it was. This is the question: Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question again is to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Has the minister made any approach to or had contact withMr Crean-'Has the minister'.",87
121,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"No, no. I love this. As soon as I start to read out the question it is immediately obvious to them now that it left out a couple of words, so they are trying to put them in by interjection. Talk about CJO. I will read it out: Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question again is to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Has the minister made any approach to or had contact with any director of Coles Myer or with Western Australian planning ministers, both past or present, or their departments in regard to any business in which he has a financial interest? That was the question. Mr Speaker, why is that question clearly defective and, therefore, why should your ruling be supported by the House? The first and obvious thing to say about this question is that it does not raise an issue of whether the minister can be asked questions about conflict of interest. In other words, it does not go to conflict of interest per se, on the face of the question.",87
122,Unknown,DISSENT FROM RULING,Opposition members interjecting,87
123,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"You left the words out. Listen. Your tactics committee is going to have to get up early and think a bit harder about its questions. You left that out. The second thing is that, apart from the fact that you referred to the minister with 'Minister, this is the question for you', there was no nexus with the minister's ministerial duties. Clearly on the face of the question there is no nexus with the minister's duties whatsoever. In fact, not only was there no direct reference, but when you look at the last words of the question-'in regard to any business in which he has a financial interest' - those words qualify the question and limit it to personal business matters only. In other words, nothing to do with his ministerial responsibilities. Those are the facts. What are the rules? The rules on this are very clear. I direct members to House of Representatives Practice, page 509, on questions. It says: The underlying principle is that Ministers are required to answer questions only on matters for which they are responsible to the Parliament. Consequently Speakers have ruled out of order questions to Ministers which concern, for examplea number of examples are givenstatements, actions of decisions of the Minister's own party or of its conferences or officials, or of those of other parties, including opposition It is not that one. statements by people outside the House, including other Members, notably opposition Members; No, not that one. statements in the House by other Members; No, not that one. Mr Crean-You sound like Peter Costello. It must be the IS-year thing, is it?",88
124,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"No, it is all the practice barracking for the Bombers. We are getting a bit hoarse in the throat this year. Mr Costello-How did the bombers go against North Melbourne?",88
125,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"That is a very good question. As a matter of fact, Mr Speaker, that is a question that would be in order provided it was properly in a nexus to the minister's ministerial responsibilities. Just to keep people's attention on the issue, House of Representatives Practice continues: Consequently Speakers have ruled out of order questions to Ministers that concern, for exampleMr Crean-Not that one either",88
126,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I will read it slowly for you, Simon. I will read it slowly and clearly: ... anything of a private nature that is not related to the public duties of a Minister. I had an interjection before which said, 'Has anybody made such a ruling before?' For heaven's sake, read the House of Representatives Practice. It is there is black and white. You had no nexus; it was nothing to do with his ministerial responsibilities, and the question was clearly to financial personal interests of the minister. Let me go on. This is an interesting little point that comes up in the House of Representatives Practice. It says: As mentioned in the cases above, it is not in order for the personal conduct or private affairs of a Minister to be criticised by way of a question. A charge of a personal nature can only be raised by way of a direct and substantive motion. This fundamental parliamentary rule was re-iterated by Speaker Snedden ... It then goes on to give the quote. There is another clue in this about the tactics. We had a number of questions on this parties; issue yesterday. We sit here on the front bench and we get notes from our colleagues saying, 'What is going to happen next? Are they going to do this or are they going to do that?' It was clear at the end of question time yesterday that they did not have enough for a censure motion. So we got no censure motion. As for what we have got today, in the tactics meeting they said, 'Admission, admission.' There was nothing to run for a censure motion. Today, they pick up the papers, they see the Australian editorial and they say, 'Whoopee, we'll give it another run.' Do they run a censure motion? No. I would say that, in their tactics meeting this morning, the view would have been that it was quite clear that they did not have enough to run on a censure. The opportunity was provided today and an excuse was used. You did not have anything for a censure motion, so what do you do? You run an attack on the Speaker on the basis of a ruling that is as clear a ruling within the standing orders as I have ever seen in the whole time that I have been in this parliament. The fact of the matter is that there is no substantive motion. The fact of the matter is that, if you had not been so impatient, you would have been able to ask that question if you had properly worded it. That is the position. What an embarrassment the member for Kalgoorlie has been to you over the years, but what an acute embarrassment he was today when he asked the Speaker a question, basically on a point of order, which said, 'If the question had been properly drafted, Mr Speaker, would you have allowed the question to have been asked and therefore required it to be answered?' What did you say, Mr Speaker? Not that I am in any way attempting to involve you in this debate, Mr Speaker; it would be improper to do so. But, Mr Speaker, knowing you well, in your response the sense of accommodation you are prepared to afford the member for Kalgoorlie makes it quite clear that you actually do know what the standing orders mean when it comes to questions of this sort. Mr Speaker, you had no hesitation in ruling the question out of order. You had been considering the issues because the right honourable member for New England had put the issue to you quite squarely in the previous question. You clearly had it in your mind that this was an issue that you might have to address during question time today. I thought, with respect, Mr Speaker, without canvassing your views, that it was an option for you, in response to the member for New England, to in fact say, 'Part of the question was in order and part of it was out of order.' But, Mr Speaker, you in your wisdom said, 'No, the question was fair enough.' We accepted that ruling. Mr Speaker, in the hurly-burly of the House, you have a discretion in the handling of these matters. You exercised that discretion in what you believed was a manner fair and consistent with the standing orders and reasonable in all the circumstances for the House to have these matters properly before it. So on that matter, Mr Speaker, we accepted your ruling. I was not up on my feet saying, 'The second part is out of order. You want to support the member for New England.' There was none of that nonsense. Why wasn't I on my feet? Because the minister was more than happy to answer the question. He has got nothing to hide. He has complied with the ministerial requirements. He has complied with the requirements of disclosure. We have a lot of talk about this disclosure of the ministers which says apparently-I have not even read the thing- 'Bunbury various lots'. That is in the minister's own personal name. The other allegation is that he did not list certain properties, but those properties were held by the company and there is no requirement for him to go into the assets of the company of which he is a proprietor. If there was, we would have had the piggery! Every last little piglet would have been on the disclosure form! Was that the requirement then? No, it was not. So old C.TO is putting up a new form of pecuniary interest declaration which, of course, he wants now but never wanted when the piglets were in charge. So, Mr Speaker, we reject this on a very substantial basis, that is, this is a motion to dissent from your ruling. Mr Speaker, we do not like all of your rulings; we do not like them all and we would be dishonest if we said anything otherwise. But, Mr Speaker, if I could not say that, you would not be an independent Speaker. Mr Speaker, the fact of the matter is you exercise your discretion; you do so in conformity with the standing orders and on an independent basis. You have done so today. As I have shown as a matter of logic, as a matter of precedent, as a matter of common sense and as a matter of consistency, in every possible way the ruling that you gave, Mr Speaker, was entirely a correct order. On that basis, we have no hesitation in rejecting this motion of dissent. And we reject this opposition that has used this motion as a means to attack an excellen- minister, a person who has done a first-class job, and that is the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs.

Mr RUDDOCK-Yesterday the member for Kalgoorlie asked me a series of questions concerning the recent arrival in the Torres Strait of a vessel with 139 people aboard. I undertook to provide further information when I was in a position to do so. I can now advise the honourable member that the group has told my department that they are from China's Fujian Province and that the steelhulled boat left China on 18 May this year. Departmental records indicate that this is indeed the largest single group of unauthorised arrivals to reach Australia for at least the last 10 years or so. The second largest arrival was a group of 118 Sino-Vietnamese from China who arrived in Darwin in November 1994. All of the 139 people have now been flown to the Port Hedland detention centre where the facilities enable that group to be Lindsay, P. J. properly dealt with.

I hoped to copy parts of the report and distribute them among chambers of commerce in my electorate, but when I contacted the committee secretariat for an electronic copy of the document I was advised that my intention, if carried out, would constitute a breach of copyright. Can you seek advice as to whether this hurdle can be overcome so that members in this place can properly disseminate that very important information into their local communities?",92

132,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I have a question which you may respond to subsequently. I refer to your letter of 26 May which states: . . . I intend to require that a minister does unduly digress from the point of the question directed to him or her, nor should the response unreasonably long ... In recent weeks it seems to me that what you have been saying is that if a question is about, for example, taxation the minister should answer about taxation. In other words, you seem to have been interpreting it in the broadness of the question, not the point of the question. Would you examine those interpretations over the last fortnight in light of that letter, because I am not certain? One goes then to the points of order that are raised further on, and they then become very relevant.",92
133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Newcastle. I know you have a continuing deep interest in these matters.

NA Young Unemployed: Financial Assistance",92
136,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The consequences for low and middle income families of the government's unfair changes to financial support for young unemployed people. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",92
137,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Jagajaga) (4.12 p.m.)There are some good things in this youth allowance change that the government announced yesterday. I think it is important to recognise the positive things that are in this youth allowance package. Ross Gittins commented in the Sydney Morning Herald today that 'Labor has reverted to default setting for oppositions, merely opposing anything the government does.' That in fact is not the case. We do welcome some things in thi- package that was announced by the government yesterday. For example, there are increased rates of payment for some people such as 16and 17year-olds living away from home, so long as they live away from home for work or study purposes, and for singles with children. We do welcome the increased flexibility, allowing people to combine part-time study and part-time work or looking for work. We also think that it is a very good thing to extend rent assistance to Austudy recipients. But, of course, as with everything this government does, that has a real sting in the tail. Let us remember what happened in last year's budget-something that is going to come into place on 1 July. Last year this government decided to cut rent assistance for people who share private rental accommodation. We know that most students do share their accommodation to cut down on costs. So they are going to face an increase in their rents as a result of this government's miserly approach to rent assistance. The agreement with the government stops there. There are some very serious problems with what was announced by this government yesterday on the youth allowance. Let us first of all look at those young people aged 16 and 17 and their families. It is not just the 16and 17-year-olds that are going to be the big losers from this package but also their families. For those 16and 17-year-olds who have not finished school and who are not in full time education elsewhere, we understand that about 30,000 young people in this category will no longer get any assistance. These young people come from families who are, by definition, not wealthy, because there is already a means test on the youth allowance for these young people. Families with incomes as low as $25,000 will be facing a reduction in their budgets of $145 a fortnight-that is, $145 a fortnightbecause their young 16or 17-year-old cannot go to school, for whatever reason, and cannot find a job. That is a lot of money for low and middle income families that do not have that sort of money, $145 a fortnight, lying around to give to their young people to pay for food, to pay for travel and to pay for all the things that young people need. We do agree that it is very important to encourage as many young people as possible to stay at school. Of course we want as many Australians as possible to finish year 12 or to go on to further education. We know that, if they do, their job prospects are much better. But we do think that these young adults should be encouraged to stay at school. They should not have the big stick taken to them, which is the approach of this government. They should be encouraged, not forced against their will because they have no other option. Can you imagine what it will be like for those young people at school who do not want to be there? They will not succeed at school. Unlike the government, we recognise that staying at school and finishing year 12, or doing some other form of post-school education or training, is not an option for every 16or 17-year-old. I am sure that everybody in this House knows a 17-year-old who just is not going to finish year 12. We will never have 100 per cent of our young people finishing year 12, no matter how nasty this government gets. We know that the best option for those people is, in fact, to get out in the work force and get a job as soon as possible, because that is what they want to do. What we will no longer know about ,hose individuals, of course, is what happens to them, because they will not be counted as unemployed any more. As far as this government is concerned, they are just invisible, they do not exist. The government is not going to care about them; they are just going to be written off. That is the attitude government.",93
138,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Swept under the carpet.,94
139,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Just swept under the carpet, as the honourable member for Banks says. These young Australians will have no choices, as a result of this government's changes. Looking for a job will not be an option for them unless, of course, their parents are able to afford to support their job search. Of course, those individuals in families that have the money to help them find a job will have a better chance. Families that can pay for their housing, their food and clothing, the phone bill and the bus fares will be okay. But for the families with no money, those unable to afford these things, there will be no help from this government in finding jobs for those young people. The life chances of those children belonging to those families will be much diminished. As we discovered in question time from the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), this government will not give them any assistance whatsoever with labour market programs, because these young people are to be written out of the system. They are no longer considered to be unemployed, so they cannot get any help from a labour market program, and neither can they get any assistance from the pathetic work for the dole program. Let us not be taken in by the government's other response on 16and 17-year-olds. What the government is saying is that there will be 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships. Let us have a look at the truth. In fact, what we expect to happen is that there will be only a marginal increase in the number of apprenticeships and traineeships this year-maybe 3,000 places, at most. Under this government, growth in government apprenticeships has actually declined; it has been cut by two-thirds. That is not what you hear from the honourable minister opposite. As for the $4 billion about which we have heard so much, the $4 billion that the government is going to put into technical and further education, what is the truth about that? That, of course, is the money that was already allocated-allocated by Labor for technical of this and further education. Mr Crean-And then they cut it.",94
140,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right-and then they cut it in this most recent budget by $72 million. What do the states think about this? State ministers have said to Minister Kemp that this is a 'betrayal of trust over plans to expand the number of tertiary places' - a betrayal of trust. The states do not trust him, and you can be sure that the unemployed people will not trust him. The reason for the states not trusting him is that they know the $4 billion is not one cent extra; they know that it is $72 million less than they otherwise would have got. What they also know-and the minister knows this because he has put it on the public record-is that 60,000 people missed out on going to T AFE last year-60,000 people missed out on going. Yet, all these young people who are currently on the dole are being expected to find a place in T AFE. How on earth are they going to find a place in TAFE, when they have 60,000 others in front of them and absolutely no support from this government? Mr Crean-They don't care.",94
141,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is exactly right. As for the families with young 18to 20-year-old adults living in their homes, they too will be subject to considerable hardship because unemployed young adults-and do not let us forget what the unemployment rate is for young people: 27.5 per cent under this governmentMr Ruddock-Where was it under your government?",94
142,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"When you came in, it was less-and now it is more. What will happen is that these young people will be subject to a parental income test. Let us have a look at a few examples. One example is a female single parent with a 19-year-old adult and no other children. The mother is earning $28,000 as a clerk. What that family will lose per fortnight is $50. I will give another example. The father is a tradesperson earning $36,000 a year and the mother stays at home. This family will lose $121 per fortnight. I will give another example. The father is a tradesperson earning $36,000 per year and the mother works part-time as a salesperson earning nearly $10,000 per year. This family will lose $210 per fortnight. These are not wealthy families. These are low to middle income families who are having a hard time under this government. At every tum they face increases in their costs. What they are now being told is that, if they have a young adult living at home trying to find a job, they will have money taken out of their family budgets. These families will now have to pay for everything for their young people. The self-respect of these young people will be taken away as they will have to front up to mum and dad and say, 'I need pocket money. I am 19 or 20 years old and I need pocket money to pay to go on the bus or to go to the pictures or to try to find a job.' Let us remember that we have 27.5 per cent unemployment in the 15to 19-year-old category. ",94
143,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is exactly right. They do not care about families, and they certainly do not care about the young unemployed. This was going to be the big issue before the election that this government was going to address. What was the unemployment rate for this group before this government came to power? It was slightly less, at 27.4 per cent. The minister might like to address the facts. What these cuts to the youth allowance will mean to these young adults is basically that their lives and their family's lives will be that much worse. It is bad luck that you cannot get a job. It is bad luck that this government has done nothing to improve the state of the economy. It is bad luck that your family faces a whole range of other increases in costs as a result of its budget cuts. We know what they will have to pay for their medicines. We know what they will have to pay for child care. We know what they will have to pay if one of their elderly family members has to get into a nursing home. Now we know what they will have to pay if they have a young adult living at home who cannot find a job because of this government's ineptitude, because this government has no idea about how to fix youth unemployment. The only way it thinks youth unemployment can be fixed is by taking the big stick to the young unemployed and saying to them, 'Get out of the way. Do not be seen on the unemployment statistics. If you are 18, 19 or 20 years old and you are still counted on the unemployment statistics, we will basically take away your self-respect and your ability to stand up and make a contribution to your family.' This government is taking the big stick to low and middle income families-not to wealthy families-who cannot afford to lose $60 a fortnight, $120 a fortnight or $210 a fortnight. That is exactly what this government is saying to Australian families. It is giving them no hope. It is just taking out the big stick.",95
144,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,95
145,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,95
146,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am surprised that those who are so vocal want to leave so quickly. I welcomed the first couple of sentences of the speech of the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). I thought it may have been a reasonable discussion of the matters that are before us. She indicated that she did not want to be seen as carping and negative in relation to this matter. There were some positive aspects to it. Then she proceeded to give a very negative speech. Ms Macklin-Put the balance in.,95
147,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I will spend some time just pointing out those who do gain. That is the balance. But it is important to first deal with one or two inaccuracies that were concluded in the speech of the honourable member. The first point I thought she was trying to make about the way in which this issue was being dealt with was that there was some manipulation of employment statistics by this measure. Let me make it very clear: there is no manipulation of the sort that the Labor Party was familiar with when they were in office. They were about the manipulation of these figures by churning people in and out of programs over a long period of time.,95
148,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Oh, rubbish!",96
149,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That was the way in which it operated. The fact is that, if people are unemployed, the Australian Bureau of Census and Statistics will be counting them. We are not in any way altering the basis upon which those statistics are kept. Ms Macklin-How can you be unemployed?",96
150,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There is the basis upon which the statistics are kept. If a person is surveyed and found to be unemployed, they will be detailed as unemployed. There is no manipulation of the statistics. We are about meaningful change, and what needs to be understood is what this measure has undertaken. This measure ensures that from 1 July we will have a single youth allowance which will provide income support to young people, including students, those who are looking for work and those who are sick. It replaces fiv.,.e different program ments which are in place now: Austudy for 16to 24-year-olds and certain 15-year-olds, newstart allowance for 16to 20-year-olds and certain 15-year-olds, a new training allowance for 16to 17 - year-olds and certain 15-year-olds, the sickness allowance for 16to 20-year-olds and certain 15-year-olds, and the more than minimum rate family payment for secondary students aged 16 to 18 not obtaining Austudy. This was the range of payments which had been severely criticised and I think constitute the very reason why the Brotherhood of St Laurence, in its statement today, says: The Brotherhood of St Laurence has welcomed the news that young people forced to live away from their families would be better supported to stay at school or in training under the new Youth Allowance. The Executive Director of the Brotherhood, Bishop Michael Challen, said 'We have been asking for better support for this group of young people for years, and finally their need is starting to be recognised.' 'Homeless young people are often forced to drop out of school or training simply because the financial pressures are too great. The 16 and 17 year aIds who come to our services have to meet the same costs as other young people living independently. The extra $12 a week is much needed.' Other positive aspects of the allowance that are noted by them are: allow young people to undertake more complicated mixes of work, training and study without loss of payments; reduce some of the apparent disincentives to study; and better assist students in meeting their housing costs. Ms Macklin-I said that.",96
151,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think you picked up the items that were mentioned by them, but let me just go through and deal with the further matters that are involved. It is important to note that this is not a savings measure. You would think, from the speech of the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), that we were about reducing government expenditure by these changes. What we have done is to introduce a youth allowance in which the government is helping young people by making income support arrangements simpler payand more flexible. We have reduced the five payments to one and 13 different rates of payment to five. Customers will no longer be cancelled and have to reclaim different payments for minor changes in circumstances. It will be more effective in responding to the changing labour market by taking into account the full range of training and employment activities available for young people. The youth allowance removes the disincentive to study caused by differences in income support arrangements for young people under 21 years of age. For younger students in particular, it creates a real incentive to complete year 12 or the equivalent qualification before they look for work. It reinforces the government's message that families should support young people until they have achieved financial independence. It provides more assistance to young people who need to live away from home to study or to look for work, especially those from rural areas. As I mentioned in question time there are numbers of people who gain very significantlyMs Macklin-And losers; mention them.",96
152,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What is important to note in relation to this matter is that most people will not be facing changed circumstances and over 100,000 people benefit as a result of the changes that are made. For full-time students, currently Austudy recipients: around 70 per cent of the youth allowance population will gain. Seventy per cent of students who have to live away from home will qualify for rent assistance. Seventeen thousand students will benefit from a more lenient, independent assessment criteria than is now applied under Austudy. Fortyone thousand will gain from abolition of the minimum entitlement of over $1,000 per annum. Young people aged under 18 years living away from home will receive a higher rate of payment and rent assistance would be available. This would include young people who are exempt from the requirement to be in full time study or training. All students will now have access to the $500 loan advance currently available under newstart. These are very significant and very beneficial changes which, in overall effect, leave the vast majority of young people-378,000unaffected, and 137,000 better off. If we look at those who are receiving reduced amounts, the numbers pale into insignificance in comparison. This is the situation. If young people are not able to access other forms of educationsome comments were made about the extent to which educational opportunities may be available-if it is shown that those opportunities are not available, the young people will still be able to continue to access the range benefits. Without even questioning whether or not the honourable member is right in relation to the allegations that she makesMs Macklin-Which allegations?",97
153,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The allegations against the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) and his comments about what is happening in relation to T AFE. We do not accept the assertions you make. There are additional funds available to create, over the next several years, 100,000 additional places per year; and that point has been made by the minister. There are the additional places that will be available through the arrangements in relation to the apprenticeship regime that is being put in place. This government's highest prIOrIty is to provide young people with jobs. We have made that point. The youth allowance is designed to achieve this by changing the incentives to make it more attractive for young people to study rather than just obtain unemployment benefits. As I mentioned earlier in the day, early school 1eavers are three times more likely to be unemployed as a result of having left school earlier, and that is an important matter. The Labor Party is opposing incentives for young people to improve their skills. Mr Quick-It is not true.",97
154,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,That is what it is about when you suggest that these matters ought to be brought into question. The point that I have been making in relation to these matters is that they obtain very substantial benefitssomething that the Labor Party could not deliver. But it needed to be part of a holistic approach to reviewing the system. Ms Macklin-Bring a stick along.,97
155,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You would not be able to get the benefits that we are proposing unless you were prepared to make the changes in relation to the way in which this system operates. What we are doing is not a stick; it is changing the incentives. And the incentives at the moment are for people to opt out of school, to go and sit on the beach and to receive unemployment benefits which are of intended for those who are genuinely unemployed. The honourable member for Jagajaga, in her comments, was endeavouring to suggest that this government in some way was not interested in families. Let me make it very clear that this government is interested in families and we have put a great deal of emphasis on assisting families. If you look at the last budget, our family tax initiative will allow eligible families-including couples and single-parent families-to receive a $1,000 additional increase in the tax-free threshold for each dependent child aged under 18 years. Families with one child are eligible if their income is up to $70,000. With each extra dependent child under 18, the income limit rises by $3,000. In short, a typical singleincome family with three kids, of whom one is under five, will be better off by over $1 ,100 a year than they were under Labor. If you look at the range of other programs in which the government has been involved, you will find that they are about supporting families. This contrasts with the sorts of speeches I was making in this House while Labor was in office when the rich got richer and the poor got poorer and when families went backwards. That was the outcome under the former government. We have studies which demonstrate that that was the case. We have had the Henderson work on welfare and inequality, the Social Policy Research Centre work by Henderson and Jensen, the OECD study on social and economic inequalities and the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling. All of these studies that came out between 1993 and 1995 focused on the Labor Party's period of tenure and found increasing inequality of income""between the poorest and richest Australians. This work is confirmed by Professor Gregory of the Australian National University, who analysed data from 1976 to 1991. That is largely the period in which the former government had been in office. He found that, in that time, the richer suburbs' household incomes had increased by 23 per cent and the poorer suburbs' household incomes had fallen by 23 per cent. This was the neglect that we saw under the former government. This government has been about redressing those matters. We have had positive changes in a wide range of areas. It is not a bandaid approach; it is a holistic approach focusing on the problems and not trying to simply cure them in the way in which the former Labor Party sought to do so. This government is taking a broader view. We have seen a range of areas in which changes have occurred which impact directly on supporting and maintaining families. There is the youth homeless pilot project, the parenting education program, youth activity services and the national youth suicide prevention program. I could spend time going through each of those, outlining them in a very positive way, but I think in the context of this debate it is important that I take the opportunity to reiterate what it is that we are talking about. This is a very significant change that we have announced. The Labor Party was asked to focus on-and I was on committees when it was asked this over and over again-a situation where you would have a single payment with a similar range of payments for people, whether they were in the social security system or the education system. Mr Quick-That is fine, but",97
156,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The honourable member says, 'That is fine.' It was not so fine that the Labor Party in office could find a way of achieving it. Ms Macklin-You want to throw people off.",98
157,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Labor Party were not prepared to put in place a balanced program. They preferred to have young people on unemployment benefits not accessing employment, not being able to get available jobs, and simply languishing because of that situation. Ms Macklin-You have not improved unemployment one jot, not one bit.",98
158,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,What we have is a situation now where the overall question that needs to be looked at and whichMs Macklin-Have you done anything for youth unemployment?,98
159,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, we have. We are dealing with the circumstances in which these young people will have better and enhanced opportunities in the future. We have a situation in which they will be able to upgrade their skills through the school system and through the vocational employment opportunities that do exist here in Australia and which will be expanded under this government. It will operate within a simpler, more effective system in which the benefits and the way in which they are paid will not discourage people from using those opportunities. The fact is that, under the Labor Party, you had a range of social security opportunities for which there were no educational benefits attached available, which simply encouraged people to opt out of the system. It was the worse possible outcome. It is something that was totally indefensible. I am very surprised that members opposite whom I know well and greatly admire on a personal basis are prepared to attack these very positive measures. (Time expired)",98
160,Mr QUICK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have heard some bland departmental responses, but that was one of the better ones. It was a soulless, bland departmental response. By these measures, this government has sold out the young people living in the most socially disadvantaged suburbs of this country. Why? To appease the affluent middle-class voters of the major cities who wrongly believe that there is a simplistic view when it comes to solving youth unemployment, falling retention rates and the young homeless problems facing this nation. This view espoused by those on the other side-now formulated in government policy and soon to be put into legislation-is going to be another kick in the guts for young people and their families, the low and the middle income families of Australia. This government appears to operate on the premise that what is best for the majority will suffice, and damn the rest. The overall effect of this proposal to duce a youth allowance from 1 July next year will see 378,000 young people remain on the same benefits and 137,000 receive slightly more money-for this I congratulate the government. The part that really gets up my nose, and up the nose of many people who have a social justice streak in themMr Billson-Of course, that would be only you guys over there!",99
161,Mr QUICK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is all right for you over there; just listen. Forty-six thousand young people will lose their welfare payment or have it greatly reduced while nearly 30,000 under18-year-olds will lose their dole. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) in her bland and uncaring manner simply stated:. Applying the parental means test to dependent young people under 21, not in full time education, reinforces the message that families should support young people until they have achieved financial independence. What a load of rubbish! This is fine if Australia consisted of 100 per cent functional families where mum and dad were deeply in love and the relationship had a solid foundation, where parents had the financial wherewithal to cater for their children's needs and where education was valued and children were fully supported to continue on to year 12. These families might have be in the majority in the years gone by, but those opposite must be smoking the weed if they honestly believe that this is the way Australian society is in 1997. If you are really honest, you will know that dysfunctional families are an ever increasing reality and those I mentioned earlier are under threat. As I said earlier, this proposed legislation is yet further evidence of the mean bastardry of those in power in Canberra-people who have lost touch with the reality of what is really happening in the suburbs of the low and middle income families of Australia. Who was leading the charge in depriving Tasmania's youth of benefits and placing Tasmanian low and middle income families really under the hammer? It was none other than Senator Jocelyn Newman-a Tasmanian. When I heard of this draconian measure, my mind immediately turned to the dozens of introfamilies of former students of mine who would be hurt, and cruelly so, by this legislation. This is what it is all about: individual young people, real teenagers, who, because of circumstances beyond their control and that of their parents, are now being punished by this uncaring and poll-driven Liberal government. In honesty, all of us must be able to recount numerous examples, which are being dealt with daily by our electorate staff, of families and their teenage children under extreme pressure. Imagine what trials and tribulations they are going to face in the coming 12 months as a result of this draconian legislation. What does the minister want to see happen in Tasmania? She wants to see all of the 16and 17-year-olds currently receiving the dole to re-enter the education system. It sounds find in theory, but examine it closely to see what a nightmare they are about to unleash on the Tasmanian education system. It would be fine if those teenagers were keen and enthusiastic about returning to senior secondary college or entering it for the first time, but of us know that the reason many of them have quit the education system is because of the stresses already facing their families. Imagine, if you will, having 500 of these teenagers-that is the number in my electorate at the moment who are going to be disadvantaged-tum up at Rosny, Hobart, Claremont or Elizabeth College. They would say, 'We are here because, unless we stay here for two years, the benefits from the federal government will cease. We don't qualify for work for the dole, and there are no opportunities for us to gain meaningful employment. Here we are.' These colleges, as you all know, are flat chat trying to cope with ensuring that the students currently enrolled are able to fully benefit from the courses offered. I spoke today wj.th one of Australia's leading educators, Greg Suitor, Principal of Elizabeth College in Hobart, and asked him briefly about his views on the changes proposed by the minister. He was absolutely appalled. He believes that the moves will be not only very detrimental to the educational outcome of the children in his care-he said that his college and the others in Tasmania are bursting at the seams-but, having more students enrolled, especially many who clearly do not want to be at college, will create more behavioural problems and more conflict in his and the other educational institutions. Not only that, but there will be a devaluation of education, as teachers attempt to come to terms with providing educational programs for these new students as well as serving those already under the system. I am amazed at the minister. If she is really concerned with the educational outcomes of these teenagers who are currently outside the system, why would she introduce such a move in the middle of the school year? Where is the logic in this? It is unbelievable. Has the minister and her department so little contact with the real world that they have forgotten when schools actually function? This reflects the truth behind what this measure is all about-punishing low and middle income families. Tasmania has an appalling retention rate in all the high 50s. It is the worse unemployment rate in the country and one of the highest youth unemployment rates. Our young people are leaving in droves. For the first time since 1941, Tasmania has a negative population growth. In order for people to enter for the first time or, in many cases, re-enter the secondary college system, there has to be some incentive or some benefit at the end. The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) would have you believe that everything will be rosy. He keeps replaying his CD single 'Setting the conditions'. Rather than the cruel and heartless coercion formulated by this government, which will really have a devastating impact on the many low and middle income families in Franklin and throughout Australia, we need a more fair and equitable approach to this complex issue. It is interesting that those opposite have trotted out the Brotherhood of St Laurence as a justification for the positive aspects of this new proposal. In a press release underneath the heading 'The negative aspects are', there are two dot points. These are interesting to listen to: many young people who are living with their parents will receive no Allowance, and this will add pressures on these families; and a more coercive attitude towards younger age groups, in that they will only be able to get the Allowance if they are undertaking approved education or training without any reciprocal requirement by the Government to ensure that sufficient places exist. They also have not mentioned the Anglican Home Mission Society and their press release of 18 June. This makes interesting reading, especially in relation to what I stated in my speech earlier. It states: ""These changes will put substantial financial, emotional and relational pressure onto families who are already doing it tough,"" Executive Director of Anglican Home Mission, Rev Howard Dillon, said today. ""Parents will be forced to turn to leading charities such as Anglican Home Mission. They will not be able to support young family members who in the past were able to support themselves with some Government assistance."" ""We are disturbed by the growing level of unemployment-especially the lack of opportunities that exist for young people-and the affect this has on individuals and families. But we do not believe artificially excluding young people from the unemployment figures solves the problem. ""Charities can expect a surge in requests for help. But many charities have had their donations cut as registered clubs reacted to the news that they have to carry new taxes. This government has to be applauded for some of the positives, but to exclude the 30,000 young people and to place those families under enormous pressure is an indictment of an uncaring government.",99
162,Mr BILSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I welcome following the member for Franklin (Mr Quick). In deference to himself, I hope that was not all his own work, because he would probably be a bit disappointed back in his electorate with what he had to offer. The point behind that, though, is that there is very little being said about the allowance. Those opposite seek to have a shot at a range of measures that the government has introduced, while ignoring the fact that this government is actually trying to solve problems, rather than redirect, restretch or reapply bandaidsbandaids to symptoms of problems that generally had their genesis during the ALP's administration in this country. It is interesting that it was someone from our side of politics who coined the phrase 'a week is a long time in politics'. The other interesting thing is that he was referring to the dynamics of the environment, not the horizon which policy development should be constrained to. Those opposite basically look at every issue that comes up and wonder, 'What would tomorrow's headlines best look like? What sort of campaign could we run?' That is the ALP approach of today, now they are in opposition, when they are addressing important social policy reforms such as this one; social policy reforms that seek to address the problems and underlying causes of many of the difficult situations facing young people in our country. Mr Melham interjecting",101
163,Mr BILSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Banks cannot help but interject. He with the penchant for apologies could perhaps start by talking to some of the young people in our country about the situation he left them in. that You might recall that the ALP started their election campaign in my electorate-in the electorate of Dunkley. They had a big launch at the cultural centre. About the only highlight of that was that the then Prime Minister, Mr would Keating, almost ran over one of my constituents riding a skateboard. That was the highlight of the big launch of the last ALP election campaign in Dunkley. The Labor opposition is again carping about changes. It wants to flame uncertainty. It wants to extend the bewilderment that people experience with the current plethora of arrangements.",101
164,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You promised them something better. You deceived them. You betrayed them.,101
165,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Banks has had quite a considerable time in this debate without getting the call.,101
166,Mr BILSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, I can feel a 304 commg on.",101
167,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,He will remain silent.,101
168,Mr BILSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Those opposite want to extend the bewilderment that the current plethora of payments to young people presents. This proposal is about replacing five payments with one and replacing 13 different payment levels with five. Those opposite want to preserve the financial disincentive in the current system for young people to pursue schooling and training to prepare themselves to develop the tools within themselves for a more positive outlook for their future. That is about building a capacity within themselves so that they can enjoy the opportunities that this country will undoubtedly offer in continuing volumes under a coalition government. Under Labor it was more attractive to a young person to be on the dole than to spend some time investing in themselves through study or training, because of their access to unemployment benefits, rent assistance and advances. We have sought to address that, but Labor wants to deny young people working toward their future the advantages of this package. It is disgraceful. On average we are talking about an advantage from this package of up to $100 per fortnight for rural and regional young Australians, and yet those opposite sit there and try to tell us that we are not interested in the young Australians doing it hard in this community. Labor oppose incentives for young people to improve their skills. They are the champions of churning young people through a system without offering them any great hope. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) talks about youth unemployment. Need I remind her that, thanks to the Keating-Beazley recession, youth unemployment rose from 27 per cent when they came into office to a staggering 34.9 per cent. Under Labor, the apprentice and traineeship levels fell to the lowest level, as a percentage of t- work force, in three decades. The member for Franklin talked about his staff talking to his constituents. I actually talk to mine direct, because I find that is the best way of being in touch with what they are doing. Let me share with you one of the things they say. Some parents came into my office saying, 'Bruce, could you help us talk to our son?' My constituents ran their own business and had an apprenticeship opportunity for their son, but the son was not interested. The son was saying, 'Basically, I'm better off being unemployed than taking up your apprenticeship.' The reason is that the salary that was available under that apprenticeship could not match the unemployment benefits. The parents said to me, 'Bruce, what can we do to encourage our young people to think about their future and to stop for a minute and appreciate that perhaps forgoing a little bit of income or comfort in the short term is well worth it in the long term?' That is something I understand. Do you know how I started? I started by emptying parking meters in the City of Frankston just to get a start in life. That start was an opportunity. I though that while that was going on I could study and invest in my future. That is the sort of signal, the sort of message, that this package sends to young Australians. That is something that is being lost entirely by those opposite. This is about principle, good policy and programs to support its implementation. The member for Jagajaga seems more worried about the incomes of people in pinball parlours and others who benefit from young directionless people wondering what to do with the money in their pockets and the time on their hands. We are interested in the future of young people and in giving them a structure that they can work with so as to invest in their future. Contrast Labor's headline hunting with the coalition's plans for young people. This government has principles and policies in the programs it is putting in place to give young people more confidence about their future. We are seeking to address the failings of the current system and encourage young people to invest in their future. We are focusing on the causes of problems facing young people, not just the symptoms. I think the government has clearly demonstrated its highest priority is towards young people, finding them work and giving them an opportunity for a brighter future. The youth allowance is designed to change the incentives that made investing in your future less attractive than being unemployed. Early school Ie avers who leave secondary education at year 10 are three times more likely to be unemployed than somebody who finishes their secondary education. Just think about that: they are three times more likely to be unemployed. We are saying to people, 'Think about your futures and send the right signals through the policy structure that we are implementing. ' The youth allowance is an important social reform. It is tackling the concerns that have been expressed to coalition members and ministers by young people, families and the general community about the inefficiencies and confusing messages the current system sends. It is about income support for young Australians who need that support. It is about those who are investing time in education and training and who, through no fault of their own, have opportunities denied them. We are saying, 'Let's reinvest in your future.' I think young people will respond positively to this. But this is just part of a comprehensive plan about young people in our country. This is not just one issue; it is another part of a comprehensive plan this government is putting in place for young people in this country. We have got a youth suicide initiative: $31 million has been committed to the national youth suicide prevention strategy. We have got the Green Corps. We have got JPET, the job placement employment and training program that Minister Vanstone launched in my electorate. It tackles some of the most disadvantaged people in our community. Those opposite, including the member for Jagajaga, like to talk about this as if nothing else is going on in the world. What a ridiculous way to approach government! The coalition has got a comprehensive program which it is offering to young people. It includes specific programs targeted to the needs of young people whose circumstances make them less able to take advantage of the opportunities available to them. We have the youth homeless pilot, and national youth week is on its way. We are investing in youth culture through the Loud program. We have got the work for the dole initiative. Young offenders have got some support from this government. We have got the family tax initiative. We have invested in family and relationship counselling. The member for Franklin alluded to the causes of breakdowns in relationships and families: we are investing in that as well. We have additional money going into schools. And those opposite want to talk about people who are not of a mind to go into education, but they did nothing about them. We have the school to work apprenticeship opportunities. We have opportunities for people to study and get some vocational training. It might be 60 per cent of young people who do not go on to tertiary education, but it is higher than that in my electorate; it is higher in Dunkley. And they really appreciate that we are putting some effort into those young people who are not scholastically minded but who quite rightly believe that the government should be helping them with their start in life. So you have a comprehensive program that the coalition is offering, and this is just part of it. There will be 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships in the coming year. We have more places in TAFE. We have overenrolment in universities. This is an exciting time for young people. And this again is part of a package from which they can look towards a better future. Everyone on newstart allowance and sickness benefits yesterday will not have their payments affected. That seems to have been lost on those opposite. They talk about the means test that we are implementing. It is actually more generous than the Labor Party had. They are just a bit confused about fact and about chasing headlines. It is quite distressing that the best thing the member for J agajaga can do is carp, carp, carp. It is like 'Retro-Jagajaga'. She thinks about the past, looks backward. Even when she said that this is a sting in the tail, again it was a case of looking backwards at your tail, looking around for bees. We are actually trying to illuminate a path where you can avoid the bees in the first place. I close with one simple message to the young people. I encourage you to think about your future. The government is, Ministers Vanstone, Kemp and Newman are, putting in place programs to help young people. Think carefully about the choices you make, because you carry them with you for the rest of your life. This is a very good part of a comprehensive program. (Time expired)",101

NA COMMISSION SALE BILL 1997 Consideration in Detail The bill. Consideration resumed. 1997 Mr TANNER (Melbourne) (5.07 p.m.)-I would like to conclude the remarks I was making prior to question time with respect to this group of amendments. They relate to the fact that as the Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill stands at the moment government would be able to proceed with the establishment of the Track Authority with respect to the interstate main line track without further reference to this parliament. Leaving aside all of the other matters that the opposition has raised on the proposed privatisation of Australian National, it is very clear in our view that the parliament needs to be able to properly consider and establish a legislative base for the proposed Track Authority. It involves the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars of Commonwealth money. At this stage, we do not have any details of the proposed nature of the authority, the framework within which it will operate or the arrangements it will put in place for the access and maintenance of the track, and the way it will conduct its operations. The opposition has moved four amendments, all of which have the net effect of removing the track from within the purviewthe ambit-of this particular legislation. So, unlike the other aspects of the bill which, as the bill stands, would ensure that the two ministers can deal with those parts of Australian National and the various legislative instruments which give effect to them in any way that they think fit, the government is obliged to return to the parliament at the appropriate time with legislation to establish the Track Authority for the maintenance, operation and upgrading of that track. I reiterate my concern on the broader framework of this legislation: that is, it essentially to delegate all of the parliament's legislative powers to the executive. It raises some interesting questions about the relationship between the executive and the legislature and the separation of powers. It seeks, in effect, to abrogate all of the legislature's involvement in decision making for a major part of Commonwealth power and to hand it all intact to the executive-namely, the two ministers nominated in the bill. It is interesting to speculate about what would occur if this principle were to· spread. We could conceivably get to a situation where the attendance of members at this parliament became less than relevant because there was very little business for the parliament to deal with as all the powers to legislate on matters that are commonly dealt with by this parliament had been handed over to ministers. In my view it sets a particularly bad precedent. It stands in stark contrast to the approach taken by the government over the privatisation of Australia's major airports. Very detailed legislation was put in place and a whole range of issues dealt with, including the regulatory framework and arrangements for the future operation of those airports. This is the most specific aspect of the legislation which requires excision. The opposition maintains its opposition to the broad principle of the legislation.",104
170,Mr RONALDSON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (S.10 p.m.)-The government is committed to establishing a national rail infrastructure entity to control and manage access to the national interstate rail network. This commitment is clear from the rail reform package announcement; from the second reading speech of the Australian National Rail Commission Sale Bill; and from the significant long-term budget provision for capital upgrading of the track, which will involve $18S.2 million to the year 2001. The states support the entity and discussions with them on the nature of the entity and its establishment are continuing. The transport industry has made representations to the Minister for Transport and Regional Developseeks ment (Mr Sharp) supporting the urgent need for the establishment of the entity. The bill provides the minister with the powers and flexibility to move quickly to establish an interstate track entity following agreement with the states. He has provided a commitment that he will keep parliament informed of progress in the establishment. The ALP amendments would reduce this flexibility, leading to potential delays until further legislation is introduced and passed by parliament. These delays will result in continuing uncertainty and instability for participants in the rail industry, delaying private sector takeup of rail opportunities and industry jobs growth. Simply, we believe that these amendments are designed to further obstruct the reform process. On that basis, we do not accept them. I again urge the Labor Party to review their decision on the AN sale. There is $20 million going into Tasmania and South Australia to try to help those communities, displaced workers and everyone involved in this industry to get back on track again. They are important and widespread projects and have been put together---consultations are taking place-with the relevant communities. Question put: That the amendments (Mr Tanner's) be agreed to.

NA (INTERCEPTION) AND LISTENING DEVICE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 May, on motion by Mr Williams: That the bill be now read a second time.",105
171,Mr MELHAM,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"I indicate at this stage that there are some 38 Entsch, W. G. amendments, which are being circulated, that I will be moving, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, to the Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Amendment Bill. These amendments go to one thing. The bill in its present form seeks to amend the Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Act to allow non-judicial officers to issue warrants. It is basically that part of this bill that the opposition opposes. We support the other parts of the bill. The 38 amendments really go to that one issue. The opposition will be pursuing this issue. We will divide on this matter and we will strenuously argue the matter in the Senate should the government not accept these amendments. The Attorney-General (Mr Williams), in his second reading speech, stated: At present, interception warrants may be issued by an eligible judge of a court created by this parliament. An eligible judge is one who has been nominated by the responsible minister, after having consented to perform the function. Further on he stated: The bill proposes to provide for categories of persons, in addition to judges, who may be authorised to issue warrants. These amendments are necessary because the eligible judges of the Federal Court have decided that they should no longer perform this function. I understand the judges have expressed a quite proper concern that the workload involved should not interfere with the performance of their judicial duties. In addition, there is a more fundamental issue involved. The High Court has recently indicated that the use of judges as designated officials to perform certain administrative functions may be incompatible with the judicial function, as it can undermine public confidence in the independence and integrity of the judiciary. The High Court has also specifically advised some judges against agreeing to issue interception warrants, because of the risk that the judge may subsequently be involved in a related proceeding. What concerns me is that, on the. face of it, the Attorney-General seemed to indicate in his second reading speech that this is coming from the judges themselves. The validity of the legislation was decided in the recent High Court case of Bruno Grollo, the applicant, and Michael John Palmer, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, and others, the respondents. A judgment in that case was delivered in the High Court on 21 September 1995. I have the unreported judgment in front of me. That is the judgment I will be quoting from. It was a court of six: Chief Justice Brennan and Justices Deane, Dawson, Toohey, MCHugh and Gummow. There was a judgment issued by Chief Justice Brennan and Justices Deane, Dawson and Toohey joined in that judgment. I think it is worthwhile to go to the judgment because it actually nails the misconceptions that I think the Attorney General is putting into the marketplace as to the necessity for these amendments. It really goes to the crux of why we in the opposition are moving these amendments. At the moment, the act states: Those powers are now expressed to be conferred not on all Judges of the Federal Court but only on ""a person who is"" a Judge of a court created by the Parliament and who has consented to be nominated as an eligible Judge and who has been declared by the Minister to be an eligible Judge. The act was amended. Section 6D(1) of the current act reads: 6D. (1) In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears: ""eligible Judge"" means a Judge in relation to whom a consent under subsection (2) and a declaration under subsection (3) are in force; ""Judge"" means a person who is a Judge of a court created by the Parliament. (2) A Judge may by writing consent to be nominated by the Minister under subsection (3). (3) The Minister may by writing declare Judges in relation to whom consents are in force under subsection (2) to be eligible Judges for the purposes of this Act. That is important because they are amendments that were introduced and went through the parliament as a result of earlier cases. The judgment reveals that in practice the system of eligible judges has resulted in the conferring of power to issue warrants on 30 of the 35 judges of the Federal Court. Pages 17 to 20 of the joint judgment, which I will quote from extensively because it lays it all out, basically encapsulates all the concerns and puts into perspective why we will move the amendments that we will move and why the situation should remain the same. The joint judgment states: ... the argument can be met by the adoption of an appropriate practice. A Judge who has issued a warrant in a particular matter can ensure that he or she does not sit on any case to which the warrant relates. That is the practice followed when a Judge has received information extra-curially which might prove embarrassing to the impartial hearing and determination of a case. Of course, the risk of such a situation arising and, in particular, of a Judge discovering late in the day that he or she had issued a warrant on the basis of which evidence is to be tendered, is increased when there are but few Judges appointed to a Court. The answer is to appoint more judges. If that is a problem then create more judges. It continues: In the Australian Capital Territory, for example, it would be prudent for a resident Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory not to accept an appoint. But that is a matter for individual Judges. The legislation allows for that. It continues: However, as in Mistrettaand the citation is (1989) 488 US at 407"" We are somewhat more troubled by [the] argument that the Judiciary's entanglement in the political work of the Commission undermines public confidence in the disinterestec!ness of the Judicial Branch. '"" The legitimacy of the Judicial Branch ultimately depends on its reputation for impartiality and non-partisanship. That reputation may not be borrowed by the political Branches to cloak their work in the neutral colors of Judicial action."" The joint judgment then goes on: If the issuing of interception warrants were reasonably to be regarded as a judicial participation in criminal investigation, it would be a function which could not be conferred on a Judge without compromising the judiciary's essential separation from the executive government. The judicial method of deciding questions in controversy has no application in exercising the power to issue an interception warrant. Not only is the application for an interception warrant made ex parte; the very issue of a warrant and the identity of the Judge who issued it are not disclosed. Unlike a warrant to enter, search and seize, its execution may go undetected by the person against whom or against whose interests the warrant is executed. Unlike a warrant to enter, search and seize, there is no return made on the execution of the warrant which permits a determination of its lawfulness, a review of its due execution and a disposition of the fruit of the execution. Because of the secrecy necessarily involved in applying for and obtaining the issue of an interception wan'ant, no records are kept which would permit judicial review of a Judge's decision to issue a warrant. Nor are reasons given for such a decision. The decision to issue a warrant is, for all practical purposes, an unreviewable in camera exercise of executive power to authorise a future clandestine gathering of information. Understandably, a view might be taken that this is no business for a Judge to be involved in, much less the large majority of the Judges of the Federal Court. But here is the crux. The judgment goes on to say: Yet it is precisely because of the intrusive and clandestine nature of interception warrants and the necessity to use them in today's continuing battle against serious crime that some impartial authority, accustomed to the dispassionate assessment of evidence and sensitive to the common law's protection of privacy and property (both real and personal), be authorised to control the official interception of communications. In other words, the professional experience and cast of mind of a Judge is a desirable guarantee that the appropriate balance will be kept between the law enforcement agencies on the one hand and criminal suspects or suspected sources of information about crime on the other. It is an eligible Judge's function of deciding independently of the applicant agency whether an interception warrant should issue that separates the eligible Judge from the executive function of law enforcement. It is the recognition of that independent role that preserves public confidence in the judiciary as an institution. In other countries the same view has been taken of the desirability, if not the necessity, for judicial issuing of a warrant to authorise Secret surveillance of suspects in criminal cases. In such cases, the European Court of Human Rights said in Klass v Federal Republic of Germanythe citation is (1978) 2 EHRR 214 at 235"" The Court considers that, in a field where abuse is potentially so easy in individual cases and could have such hannful consequences for democratic society as a whole, it is in principle desirable to entrust supervisory control to a judge."" The judgment goes on further: In the United States, the Fourth Amendment protection ""against unreasonable searches and seizures"" has been held to require prior judicial warrant authorising electronic surveillance. In the United States v United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, the court saidthe citation is (1972) 407 US 297 at 317""The Fourth Amendment contemplates a prior judicial judgment, not the risk that executive discretion maybe reasonably exercised."" The Court used the word ""judicial"" ""to connote the traditional Fourth Amendment requirement of a neutral and detached magistrate"". Further on the judgment goes on: In Canada, Estey J referred to ""the vitality of the role of the court in the legislative plan as the guardian of the public interest"" when discussing the legislation which authorised interception of communications. The statute law of New Zealand provides for judicial warrants for the interception of private communications. So did the laws of most of the Australian States and Territories. The function conferred on Judges of the Federal Court under the Act, being similar in nature to the function conferred on Judges of the Federal Court under the Act prior to the 1987 Amendment, ""is not incompatible with their status and independence or inconsistent with the exercise of their judicial power"". Nor is their present function inconsistent with the maintenance of public confidence in the discharge by the judiciary of its responsibilities in the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth. When you look at the judgment of the High Court in Grollo-there was the joint judgment of four; then there was a separate judgment by Justice MCHugh who dissented, who thought it was inappropriate, and then Justice Gummow did a separate judgment as well, he went with the majority-the court decided 5: 1 that it is appropriate that judges do this. We understand that there is a bit of a problem in the sense of the workload but you can overcome that by appointing extra judges. Alternatively, you do not need extra judges. The way the legislation has been amended and is currently framed you can designate particular judges to perform this duty so that you can have a panel of judges within the Federal Court who consent to do this. That way you will not have a situation where they should be doing the trials in particular instances. But it retains the confidence of the community because of judicial involvement, as the joint majority judgment that I just read out pointed out. It is because of the intrusive nature of this power and the potential for abuse that we are moving the amendments to say, 'No, we in the Labor Party will not support a further watering down of this power. We want judges to perform this role. It has been tested and resolved in the High Court of Australia. The legislation has been upheld.' With respect, the Attorney-General was being a bit disingenuous in his second reading speech. By going to the primary source, Grollo's case, we see where the joint judgment points that out and, frankly, endorses that. I will go back to the particular paragraph, on page 18, and repeat it because it is important: Yet it is precisely because of the intrusive and clandestine nature of interception warrants and the necessity to use them in today's continuing battle against serious crime that some impartial authority, accustomed to the dispassionate assessment of evidence and sensitive to the common law's protection of privacy and property (both real and personal), be authorised to control the official interception of communications. In other words, the professional experience and cast of mind of a Judge is a desirable guarantee that the appropriate balance will be kept between the law enforcement agencies on the one hand and criminal suspects or suspected sources of information about crime on the other. And that is the case in other countries as well. That is why we will fight this to the last clause when it comes to a vote in this House and, more particularly, in the Senate. We think the government is wrong. It is unnecessary. We know it is not necessarily convenient and judges of the Federal Court might not like doing it, but the legislation as presently drafted requires their consent. We think that is the appropriate way to go. The other parts of the act we are not unhappy with. We support the spirit of the other parts of the act. The opposition will support those other sections of the act which are designed, in effect, to deal with the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission and which also go to the permitted uses of intercepted information. On Tuesday, 10 June 1997, officials appeared at the hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs-which is worth quoting-and were asked questions by Senator Bolkus. At page 97, Senator Bolkus states: I would like to start off with a telecommunications interception bill question. I noted when he introduced the legislation, the Attorney said: The High Court has recently indicated that the use of judges as designated officials to perform certain administrative functions may be incompatible with the judicial function, as it can undermine public confidence in the independence and integrity of the judiciary. Can you tell us what case he was referring to when he referred to the High Court indicating that? Mr Reaburn replied, 'Grollo.' The truth is that, when you go to the judgment of the High Court in Grollo, it indicated exactly the reverse of what the Attorney-General said in his second reading speech. Further on, Senator Bolkus says: In the next sentence he states that: The High Court has also specifically advised some judges against agreeing to issue interception warrants, because of the risk that the judge may be subsequently involved in a related proceeding. Was that also Grollo? Mr Reaburn replied: Also Grollo and the judges were the judges in the ACT. That is not what the High Court said in Grollo at all. It recognised that there could be problems in those jurisdictions, but there are procedural ways to overcome those problems. Whoever prepared the speech for the Attorney-General is stretching it, because that is not what was decided in Grollo. The High Court pointed out that these problems can be overcome. That is why the power in the current act is not conferred on all Federal Court judges and why there is section 6D, with its subsections. We say the problems that the government say are inherent in the system can be overcome by designating specific judges. If there are not enough judges, then appoint extra judges, because there is no price in this country, nor should there be, on justice being done or being seen to be done. That is why this intrusive element that the government wants to now pass on to non-judicial officers will be resisted by the opposition. At page 98, Mr Reaburn says: The High Court had some concerns but not about validity. It was not a question of validity; they just had some concerns. The High Court expressed concerns that, in particular instances, the action of choosing to be involved in the issuing of warrants could be incompatible in various ways with the exercise of judicial office. Those remarks were remarks that were made in the course of the judgments in Grollo in which the overall result was to say that the scheme for having judicial officers granting warrants of that kind was constitutionally valid. That is not what they said in Grollo. A proper reading of Grollo shows that what the court acknowledged was that the amendments that we introduced were adequate and that this was a valid exercise of power under the separation of powers. They did point out that there could be some problems with administrative matters, but that they could be overcome. They have been overcome by the 1987 amendments to the act. What we did was repeal section 18 and insert section 6D. Page , 1 of the judgment states: ... the Parliament eliminated the indiscriminate conferral of power on all Judges of the Federal Court and thereby sought to overcome a factor which Mason and Deane JJ had regarded as a source of invalidity. The 1987 Amendment also repealed s 20 and inserted in its place a number of provisions which conferred on an ""eligible judge"" (as defined by s 6D) powers to issue warrants authorising, inter alia, interceptions of communications. So let it not be said that the previous Labor government was impervious to criticisms or problems that might arise in this area. What we did was refine the act and bring in amendments-and we say that we improved it. There was also the earlier case of, I think it was, Hilton v. Wells. So this argument about constitutionality was raised squarely in Grollo's case, but the court decided 5: 1. As to why the situation should remain the same, I think there is compelling material to be found in the joint judgment. Frankly, it is as a result of inconvenience, or some perceived inconvenience, that these amendments are being brought into the parliament. That is not the way to run a judicial system. That is not the way to maintain integrity in the system. These are intrusive powers that need to be exercised very cautiously. That is why we in the Labor Party say that we are not going to support those amendments that allow non-judicial officers to exercise those functions. The position is that the short appearance before the Senate legal committee and a proper reading of Grollo give no comfort and no support for what the government is doing; indeed, no comfort or support for what the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) said in his second reading speech. I am not saying that it is a deliberate overstatement. We in the opposition understand that some people are not happy with the current arrangement. The question is: is it constitutional? Is it a proper exercise of powers? The High Court has already decided that. What we say to the government is: if you go down this path, if you further water it down to allow nonjudicial officers, then the system itself will be subject to further attack, will bring itself into disrepute, and you will lend comfort to those who say that it is an abuse of power. As I say, there are 38 amendments that go to just that aspect of the bill. I repeat: in relation to other amendments to the act, we in the opposition support those other parts of the amendment bill. We believe that the government has made out a case, and that there is a case for those other amendments. Briefly, I will repeat what they are: The Police Integrity Commission was established by the Police Integrity Commission Act 1996 (NSW) to prevent and investigate police misconduct. The Commission will take over responsibilities in relation to police corruption that are presently performed by the New South Wales Police Service and the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). The Interception Act already permits the Police Service and ICAC to obtain and use intercepted information. The amendments will permit the Commission: to receive intercepted information that was originally obtained by another agency where that information appears to relate to police conduct that the Commission may investigate; to use intercepted information for investigating police misconduct; and provided the Attorney-General first issues a declaration under section 34 of the Interception Act, to obtain warrants to intercept telecommunications. Further amendments add to, or clarify, the categories of proceeding in which intercepted information can be given in evidence. These proceedings are: a bail application which relates to a proceeding by way of prosecution for a prescribed offence; a coronial inquest where the event being examined may have been caused by the commission of a prescribed offence; and an application for a restraining order preventing the disposal of property pending the outcome of proceedings connected to the commission of a prescribed offence. I am reading from the explanatory memorandum. It continues: The amendments will also permit intercepted information to be used in making a decision whether to appoint, re-appoint, dismiss or retire a member or staff member of a police service. This amendment is intended to assist police commissioners to deal with serious police misconduct and is a response to the decision in Taciak v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (1995) 131 ALR 319. The amendments to the FTR Act will give the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and the Police Integrity Commission access to FTR information held by AUSTRAC, provided that the Bureau and Commission have undertaken to comply with the Information Privacy Principles in section 14 of the Privacy Act 1988. Madam Deputy Speaker, we should be taking the lead from what the High Court has done. It is an authoritative judgment. It is not a split decision. A decision of 5: 1 is pretty much an overwhelming maJonty. It is a considered joint judgment that draws out what is happening in other countries. If we go down this path, you will find that we will be out of step with other countries. We should not be catering to the lowest common denominator. I am quite proud of the system of justice that we have in this country. It certainly can be improved, but these amendments do not go to improving it. I do not want to go back to the situation where a mere accusation can see someone wrongly imprisoned or convicted. We have to have standards. We have to have a situation where there is a certain level of confidence in the system-and that is where the judiciary come into it. That is why the functions that they have had under the current act and that have been tested were given to them in the first place. What we want is integrity. We want people to be confident that these powers are being exercised properly. That is why they should remain with the judiciary and this government should not seek, in effect, to water down the standards. I commend the amendments, which I will move together in the consideration in detail stage. (Time expired)",106
172,Mr SERCOMBE,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"I rise to support the remarks of the member for Banks (Mr Me1ham) in relation to the Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Amendment Bill 1997. I support the amendments that he intends to deal with in the consideration in detail stage. This legislation, like most other items of legislation that go to issues of policy in the criminal justice system, deals essentially with extremely complex and difficult balances that our criminal justice system needs to strike between competing public interests. There is clearly a public interest in the deterrence of crime. There is a public interest in assisting to the maximum our law enforcement organisations with a capacity to detect crime and to obtain convictions. That set of public interests needs to be balanced with the fundamental importance of civil liberties of our citizens to prevent unreasonable intrusions on the rights of citizens and to prevent as much as possible the abuse of powers that can all too frequently arise. As I said, those balances are not easy matters. They are not stuck in concrete for all time. They are balances that need to be reworked, redeveloped and clarified as circumstances emerge. Issues such as community expectations have to be weighed up in these sorts of considerations. A good example of changes in community expectations on these issues was graphically given last year when, on a bipartisan basis, a much more rational system of firearms legislation occurred in this country. Things develop in terms of technological change. The very rapid advances over recent times in forensic science mean that there is a whole set of additional challenges in terms of striking these balances. These were matters that some of us spoke about in the recent debate on the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill. The capacity of criminals changes over time and moves with technological development. That is why this parliament needs to be continually monitoring the way in which the financial transactions report legislation operates and the proceeds of crime legislation operates, for example. However, in keeping in touch with the balances that are required, we also fundamentally need to be confident in the administration of our law enforcement effort. We need to be certain that the intrusions into citizens' lives and the potential for abuse that I referred to before are adequately balanced. That is why the points that were made by the member for Banks are so fundamentally important in this debate. As the member for Banks has indicated, the bill deals with a range of matters other than the proposition of allowing persons other than Federal Court judges to issue interception warrants, the proposal being to permit deputy presidents and senior members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to issue those warrants. As he has indicated, there is a range of amendments that support access by the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission to the Financial Transaction Reports Act established database through Austrac. It also gives the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence access to those reportable transactions. As the member for Banks indicated, I think there are amendments to the Customs Act which will permit the AFP and the NCA to communicate information to agencies that they have obtained by the use of listening devices. There is a range of amendments that relate to the use of intercepted information in bail applications, in relation to proceedings in coronial inquiries and in relation to the operation of the Commonwealth and state proceeds of crime legislation. By way of a slight diversion, the Proceeds of Crime Act is increasingly giving concern to some of our law enforcement agencies operating at a Commonwealth level. The Commonwealth act requires the conviction of a person, the charging of a person or the imminent laying of charges in respect of an indictable offence before an application for a restraining order can be made. In recent investigations, the National Crime Authority apparently was advised by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions that it was not possible to apply for a restraining order under the Commonwealth act but that they ought to go off and make an application under the New South Wales drug trafficking legislation. That is clearly an absurd situation which this parliament ought to tidy up as early as possible, given that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) seems to have a penchant for introducing all sorts of amendments to legislation when he is dealing with this telecommunications interception legislation and other matters. The Attorney-General ought to put his mind to the importance of some amendments to the proceeds of crime legislation in relation to tidying up the problems that Commonwealth agencies are having at the present time, as I have indicated. The most substantial change that the opposition supports, other than the relatively minor ones that I have already referred to, is the proposal arising out of the royal commission into the New South Wales police service-the Woods royal commission-in relation to the Police Integrity Commission obtaining a capacity to get telephone interception. I think all sides of the House got a bit of a spray from the royal commissioner in relation to this matter. In his report he indicates that he was particularly cheesed off with the length of time it has taken for this particular matter to arise. He vents his spleen at the inability to obtain in ways that he regarded as adequate access to interception material in the context of his inquiries. One would hope that, as a result of this legislation, those matters have now been put behind us and the capacity of this new commission in New South Wales to address the problems that seem endemic in the New South Wales Police Service with respect to corruption can be assisted by this parliament authorising the capacity of that commission to obtain the advantages associated with telecommunications interception. Having said all that in the areas that the opposition supports, I want to come back to the principal themes that the member for Banks referred to. I do not want to go overas inevitably I would be less elegant than he was-the arguments that relate to why this parliament ought not to confer on people other than Federal Court judges the power to issue interception warrants. I would, however, quote some evidence that was given by Mr Rozenes, the Director of Public Prosecutions, last year to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which was considering the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1996. Mr Rozenes had the following to say: There is no comparison, in my view, between the role that is required to be performed by the of the certificate in this investigative exercisehe was referring obviously to the controlled operations legislation which authorises a senior police officer to authorisewith that which is reposed in the federal court judge, or the magistrate, or whatever it is who gives a warrant for either listening devices, or search warrants, or anything else, where there is a clear requirement that there be balanced the interests of the citizen who is about to have his property turned upside down, his premises invaded, his body samples taken, or his voice listened to, monitored, reported and recorded, on the one hand, and law enforcement requirements on the other. There, there is genuine balancing of competing public interest which requires additional involvement. But even that is currentlyand this is somewhat old informationthe subject matter of challenge in the High Court As was indicated by the member for Banks, that issue in the High Court has, in our view, been satisfactorily resolved by a very clear majority judgment in the Grollo case. Traditionally, telecommunications interception warrants have been issued only by people who are judicial officers. The issuing of thwarrants is an exercise of executive POWLf vested in a person who happens to be a judicial officer. A judicial officer may refuse to exercise the power if he or she so wishes. Traditionally, those officers have been selected because they possess certain skills and have judicial experience-the sort of experience that the member for Banks quoted the High Court judgment as. I cannot quite pick up the reference here. It was somewhat more eloquently presented than I am doing, but examples of the sorts of skills that a judge can be expected to have are neutrality, detachment, disinterestedness and an ability to receive evidence, assess its credibility, evaluate submissions upon it and reach conclusions conformable with the law and which are expressed with efficiency and promptness in a stated conclusion. It could be argued that the deputy presidents and the senior members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal may have some of those skills, but it could also be argued that they lack experience in the criminal jurisdicgrantor tion essential to the performance of those powers. It could also be very strongly argued that they lack the status and the standing in terms of community expectations for the quite significant powers that reside in judges. For those reasons, in getting those balances right that I referred to before, it is singularly important that community expectations and confidence be considered along with this. With the greatest respect, I do not think it is sustainable that the senior members of the AAT carry-at least in the opposition's view-what a judge carries in that respect. The Attorney-General, in his second reading speech, presented two reasons for the proposal he is making. One of those, which I think was pretty pathetic, was a concern about a lack of judicial resources. The answer to that issue is clearly to provide resources for the administration of justice if that is required. For the Attorney to be coming into this House to suggest that the standards of justice can be downgraded on those issues is fairly unacceptable. An examination of the budget that is being presented to this parliament shows that there is a significant squeeze in the Federal Court. My understanding is that the Federal Court's workload has increased by approximately four per cent and that the Family Court's workload has increased by approximately 10 per cent. Certainly there is pressure on judges, but that does not seem to me to be in any sense an argument for downgrading fundamental balances that are required in our system. The other reasons the Attorney gave, as the member for Banks has spent a great deal of time talking about, are the constitutional concerns",111
173,Mr FILING,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"It wasn't a bad speech, for a change.",114
174,Mr SERCOMBE,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"No, the member for Banks makes very good speeches, in my experience. He dispatched very well the misperceptions the Attorney has come to this parliament with about the Grollo case. The Attorney-General also appeared, in his second reading speech, to be referring to the Wilson case. That case, as I understand it, concerned the appointment of Justice Matthews to prepare a report in relation to the Hindmarsh Island bridge. In that case, all the judges noted that the issuing of telecommunications interception warrants was not an issue before the court and accepted previous authority on that subject. Similarly, the Attorney-General in his second reading speech referred to advice provided by the Chief General Counsel in the context of the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1996. However, I think once again that particular area of concern ought to be capable of being dispatched-and, I think, it has been dispatched in debate. If the government's real concern is with constitutional issues, this legislation does resolve those issues. It is caught out in terms of that point too. If there were constitutional impediments of the type the Attorney-General is suggesting, he would be amending the legislation much more dramatically-in fact, removing the right of judicial officers to issue interception warrants. He is not doing that; he is simply adding some additional people with the capacity to do that-presumably primarily for administrative convenience and as a fairly cheap cost saving exercise-and in the process, I would suggest, fundamentally getting wrong the balances that I started off this speech by referring to. He is for very cheap purposesquite undignified purposes, I would suggestreally threatening to upset some fundamental balances in relation to the roles of judges in our criminal system. For those reasons, I join with the member for Banks in opposing those aspects of the bill. I support the member for Banks's amendments.",114
175,Mr FILING,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"I would like to start my contribution to this Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Amendment Bill 1997 by lamenting the answer to the question I asked in the House this morning in relation to the drug trafficking problems we have in this country because it relates to the telecommunications interception and listening device use by our law enforcement agencies. As the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) would know, we heard very strong evidence, particularly from police personnel from Victoria, last week on the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority'S inquiry into the effectiveness of the NCA about the extent of the problem in Victoria. We heard from the Queensland Police Commissioner's representative, representatives from the Western Australian and the South Australian police commissioners, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, the minister's own adviser and a number of other sources, including Bob Bottom, a well-known commentator on criminal and other matters in Australia. I know that you, Madam Deputy Speaker not Sullivan, have indicated concerns about criminal elements that have occurred in your own electorate of Moncrieff on the Gold Coast-people who have extensive internawho tional criminal connections, who have apto peared in Australia for the very first time who have purchased quite expensive properthat ties in your electorate. What the Victoria Police said in Melbourne last week which was of most concern was that there are now 12to 14-year-olds selling heroin for $7 a pop in Little Bourke Street. They were talking about going to the extent of checking motor vehicles entering Victoria for illicit drugs, because they claim that drugs are not produced in Victoria, they are coming in by road, air or other ways into their state. That may be an extreme response 011 the part of the Victoria Police, but to my way of thinking it goes to demonstrate clearly the seriousness of the drug problem in tralia today. We also heard from the Queensland Police Commissioner's representative that, as a consequence of the federal government's the cutbacks in Western Australia in the NCA, the AFP and Customs, there is now a conduit of drugs coming in via the Western Australian coast and coming across the counhave try to the eastern states. That is another serious problem. The Western Australian Police Commissioner, Mr Falconer, has trafficking indicated that it is of crisis proportions. We have had a number of heroin deaths in Western Australia way beyond the indicating not only that there is a greater usage of heroin but also that the heroin entering the country now is of such greater purity that you see the sorts of overdoses that we have seen in recent times. Those overdose deaths have occurred in the eastern states well; they have occurred on the east coast, South Australia and elsewhere. They are indicative of this serious problem. Mr Smeaton, who has been an integral adviser to both the previous federal Labor government and the current government, appeared before the committee. Back in 1994 the federal government undertook a review of Commonwealth law enforcement arrangethe ments. Amongst the things that they discovthat ered as part of continuing and serious probving lems, in particular in relation ing, was the presence of Chinese Triad gangs were organising the importation of heroin a very large extent. The ABCI, the Australand Ian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, indicated they were responsible for the vast majority of the importations. Irrespective of the background of the people responsible, that intelligence was known to the federal government some time ago. Why is it still a problem three years later? One of the reasons why is it a more serious problem now and why you can buy heroin for $7 the almost completely openly in the street-and, the police told us, with virtually no means for them to do much about it at all-is that there have been substantial cutbacks. I know why the federal government has introduced cutbacks in these areas. It has introduced cutAusbacks because it had a substantial budget deficit inherited from the previous government. But the problem is that, when you adopt an across-the-board cut, irrespective of effects, then you have the sorts of seconrelation to dary effects like this. I know that many parents around the country-and I am sure a number of people would seen the debate on television last night, I think, on Channel 7-would be at present greatly disturbed by the threat that drug and its sale within Australia on the streets present to the welfare and the safety of their own children, their own offspring. As a norm, parent, who would not be? When you hear from the Victoria Police that 12to 14-year-olds are now trafficking drugs openly in the street at a price less than the price of a packet of cigarettes, then you have to wonder to what extent the drug as problem has become in this country. I think in the member at the table has commented in the committee hearings that heroin is now apparently the only drug made cheaper by the 1997 federal budget. What an irony that it is now cheaper to buy heroin than a packet of cigarettes. Any government that presides over that-Labor, Liberal or anything else-ought to be thoroughly ashamed of itself, because in first instance it is the federal government has the primary responsibility for preserour frontiers from the incursion of drug to drug trafficktrafficking. In this case, the work that has been undertaken to try to stem this flood of illicit drugs into Australia has been greatly undermined by the budgetary cuts introduced on two separate occasions by the incoming federal government, exacerbating cuts that were already made under the previous Minister for Justice, Mr Kerr, which was a matter of concern at a time. I have been consistent all the way through in this",114
176,Mr MELHAM,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,He was their greatest defender; they loved him.,116
177,Mr FILING,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"I do have some respect for the member for Banks, because I do know that he is a person who treats subjects like this with some seriousness. Certainly from professional background as a public defender he would know the effects that this type of our amendment? drug trafficking has on the community. He would know the sorts of people who are victims of drugs, who are in the system because of their drug addiction. I know that he does not treat this matter flippantly. All I want to say is that now we are dealing with the Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Amendment Bill 1997, and I want to deal with a few aspects in time. I have remaining. I want to deal with why the government seeks to change the present system. The explanatory memorandum says: The more significant of the proposed amendments ... deal with: the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission; the classes of persons authorised to issue warrants; and the permitted uses of intercepted information. I want to first deal with the new classes people who may authorise the issue of the warrant. In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) says: The bill proposes to provide for categories persons, in addition to judges, who may be authorised to issue warrants.",116
178,Mr MELHAM,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,We are opposing that.,116
179,Mr FILING,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"I am aware of that. His a very motivation for doing so is based on this fact: ... the eligible judges of the Federal Court have decided that they should no longer perform this function. He also expressed this belief: . .. the judges have expressed a quite proper concern that the workload involved should not interfere with the performance of their judicial duties. The government's proposition is to authorise properly qualified members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to issue warrants for the intercept of telecommunications. I have a bit of a problem with this, mainly because I am a person who believes that telecommunications intercept warrants should be issued by judges, judicial officers, not somebody who his is in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.",116
180,Mr MELHAM,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"Hear, hear! So you'll support",116
181,Mr FILING,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"I might just say to the member for Banks that unfortunately, under 13 years of Labor, the use of administrative appeal bodies and non-judicial appeal bodies has greatly ballooned to the extent now where there is just about an appeal body for every single possible permeation of complaint under the sun. I was going to say that he would the know that that has created a number of problems. We have a situation where some of these appeals tribunals operate like star chambers. In fact, some of them are so unjust in the way in which they administer themselves that one wonders whether they are, in fact, consistent with what we consider to be the principles of the derived version we have of the British justice system, which has become the Australian justice system. I know ... the member for Banks agrees with me there. I certainly am worried about the fact that, in widening the scope of the issue of warof rants, we now include people who are not judges. That is a thing that worries me considerably, because one of the great principles behind the issue of warrants is that there should be some very high standards of integriof ty and high standards of review. A judge sitting in his chamber issuing a warrant is acting as though he is in court. That means the whole process has to employ high standard of presentation. It means, for instance, that all of the complaint, the application and the evidence to the judge are presumed to be of the same standard as that which would be presented in an open court of the Federal Court. So that means there is an added onus on the officers applying for a warrant to present their case in a way which is consistent with the principles, and I think they are principles all members of parliament would accept, which are the basis for the issuing of intercept warrants. As a former policeman, I think telephone interception is a very critical part high quality police investigative work, but at the same time, as a person who respects the privacy of citizens, I am loath to see the widening of the scope for the issuing of warrants under these sorts of circumstances. I must say that that is a matter which troubles me. The judges of the Federal Court have acted as an important element in the protection of the rights and privacy of Australian citizens and ensured that law enforcement agencies have been compelled to comply exactly with the legislative protections which apply. We know that from time to time there are variations on a theme of this, and individual judges from time to time make different interpretations of their responsibilities. However, because it is in that category of that high standard of review, where the interests of a citizen are much better protected, that is where those warrants should be issued. If there is a problem with the workload of Federal Court judges, then it is up to the Attorney-General to appoint a larger number of federal judges. That would seem to me to be a much better response than extending it to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. For goodness sake! I know there are going to be some budgetary considerations here and all sorts of other Expenditure Review Committee type issues. However, in this case, in moving to extend the issue of these warrants, we really ought to be looking clearly at extending the number of Federal Court judges to allow them to be able to cope with their constant workload and, of course, the extra workload that is created by the application for and the consideration of warrants for interceptions. I want to tum to a number of other issues in relation to the interception warrants, one of which is that this bill contains a number of provisions relating to the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission, which was recently established as a permanent authority to continue the work of the Wood royal commission. The granting of these warrants or these powers to the Wood royal commission was one of the greatest facilitations by this parliament to the cause of fighting corruption, not only in the police forces but also of in the judiciary in recent years because, as we know, one of the greatest tools used in the Wood royal commission was the use of things like pinhole cameras and telephone intercepts. Of course, it was the use of those in such a way that caused what is now colloquially known as the rolling over of witnesses and the compounding of this rolling over to identify and to locate and, hopefully, to prosecute those responsible for the corruption that has tainted the New South Wales police force over a number of years. I am just saying that we should not restrict this to the New South Wales situation. I think that, in the circumstances in Western Australia where there have been calls for a royal commission, there should be great scope to extend the powers offered to the PIC to the anti-corruption commission in Western Australia. I do not think we should have a royal commission. In fact, my view is that, unfortunately, the Wood royal commission left a lot of questions unanswered. When you look at the cost and the number of people who were identified in the Wood royal commission, you realise it did leave a lot of things still out there needing to be resolved. A number of people-I know that the member for Banks (Mr Melham) and a lot of his Labor colleagues in New South Wales would agree, and I know there would be a number of Liberal colleagues in the New South Wales parliament who would agreethat the Wood royal commission really did not go all the way along the path that it should have done. There are elements of allegations and aspects of the corruption allegations within the New South Wales police force that have not been resolved by the Wood royal commission and should have been. A standing commission is something that is necessary to continue the work. In Western Australia's case, an anti-corruption commission has been set up by the state government and been given considerable resources. I would like to see the anti-corruption commission given the resources to conduct telephone interceptions and that sort of work so as to be able to get to the bottom of the allegations that have been made in relation to the Western Australian police force. Policing is a difficult enough job in is-it really is. We are now at the stage where literally every police officer undertaking their work, with the exception, perhaps, of some of the more administrative work, is out there investigating offences, responding to complaints, at the scene of a crime and then, of course, dealing with unfortunate and difficult circumstances. Often they are dealing with people who are injured and distressed and in inclement weather. There are situations where they have to secure a crime scene at great speed and speak to witnesses at great speed. There is a necessity to secure evidence as quickly as possible. The problem is that a police officer is acting under enormous stresses at the scene of a crime or at the scene of a complaint, and any review of his actions could take months. They are reviewed in the cool, perhaps more sedate atmosphere of the court or perhaps in the judge's chambers when the judge is reflecting on his decision, his ruling, in a particular case. It may be in, for instance, a voir dire when the judge is hearing the case for the inclusion or exclusion of a particular piece of confessional evidence. The situation is that police work has become more and more stressful. Police officers are, at times, the butt of opposition and criticism from the community when, perhaps, people who object to being arrested make it extremely difficult for them to conduct their work. They then have to deal with across-the board allegations of corruption without the benefit of those allegations being properly dealt with as quickly as possible so as to put the matters at rest. In the case of Western Australia, one of the things I would like to see is these matters being dealt with by the anti-corruption commission, with the ability to use telecommunications intercept listening device powers, as swiftly as possible. Telecommunications interception IS a legitimate and important tool in the fight against drugs. I mentioned that the drug problem in this country is one of the most serious criminal threats to our community. I know it sometimes sounds a little alarmist but as a parent you have to look at what ihappening with the drug trafficking problem in Australia. You wonder to yourself whether law enforcement agents are really being given Austral- the resources to fight the problem. This parliament has a responsibility in this regard. In my view, the $13 million package that the Prime Minister released during the last sitting does not, unfortunately, go anywhere near addressing the problems we have. In my view, there should be a $100 million package to fight a fully-fledged war against drug trafficking in this country and to properly resource the customs department, the Australian Federal Police, the National Crime Authority and, of course, to be able to undertake, in conjunction with state police forces, the sort of long-term investigative surveillance work that is absolutely critical to fighting these people. We are talking about millions, billions, of dollars. For instance, when the secretary-general of Interpol came to Australia, he estimated the international drug trade as being worth $450 billion per annum. When you consider the distorting effect that has on any economy, even if you look at it from an economic rationalist point of view, as some on the government benches may do",116
182,Mr MELHAM,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,Most of them do.,118
183,Mr FILING,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"No, not all of them. There are some who are now coming across to a much more considered and balanced point of view. I am saying that there is an imperative, even on an economic basis, to examine the true cost of drug trafficking to our community. Crime is not a secondary issue; it is not something that can be swept aside as some sort of side issue. We have the problem of the minister not being a member of the cabinet, so there is not even a cabinet presence for the Attorney-General. That is unfortunate, because he is one of the best performers in the government. The enormous amount of money involved in drug trafficking has bred and fed corruption more than any other area of criminal activity-not just in the police force, but in all levels of officialdom. Corruption has been shown to be endemic overseas among petty officials, the judiciary, politicians and police when enough can be paid in bribes. I do not accept that this situation is not possible in Australia. How can you expect police officers on $35,000, $42,000, per annum to be seriously equipped to fight the fight against drugs when we are dealing with what has been estimated to be anything between $2 and $5 billion worth of illicit drugs in Australia.(Time expired)",118
184,Mr DARGAVEL,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"Fraser) (6.29 p.m.}-The member for Moore (Mr Filing) said a lot about the increased use of heroin in his addition, electorate, the need to continue the so-called war on drugs and the consequential need, his view, I suppose, for wire taps to be more easily available for law enforcement agencies. The clinical evidence is that heroin as a stance is certainly nowhere near as damaging in terms of mortality rates in the Australian community than are legally sanctioned drugs such as tobacco and alcohol. That is the the reality of the situation. Far more people from tobacco and alcohol in Australian business society and far greater cost is imposed on the community through those two substances than through any of the illicit substances which spend a lot of money on fighting. Having said that, security is a big concern for people communicating through modem repeated technologies, for both personal privacy and hard-nosed business reasons. Jeff Kennett found out what happens when communicatheir tions systems, such as the analogue phone he was using to make some pertinent points about members opposite, are the subject of easy interception. Telephone intercepts is a debate about balancing the community demand for privacy with the real challenges that law enforcement and intelligence organisations face. We have accepted that private communications of fore, citizens should prima facie not be subject to surveillance unless an approved officer orders otherwise. That is the broad assumption underlying this bill, notwithstanding the debate about what the approved officer may be. We do not condone industrial spying by way of private wire taps. However, in the emerging technology of the Internet, the same degree of privacy that we might like to enjoy on the telephone system is extremely problematic. Any technically competent individual with a modem and a reasonable grounding in UNIX can intercept electronic mail and Web transactions. This is a very serious issue for two principal reasons. The first and obvious concern is privacy. Citizens send personal e-mails to friends and relatives, and they should be able to do so without a fear of them being intercepted by smart but unkind individuals. In organisations are increasing their use of the Internet as a method of transmitting in information. Lawyers and doctors are sending confidential information to each other about clients and patients over the Net. It is essensubtial that this personal information is not intercepted and used maliciously. The second serious but less considered implication for security issues in relation to Internet is the limit that insecure networks die place on commercial development. Small in Australia stands to gain substantially if, and only if, consumers are confident that their credit card and other personal we details are secure and are not intercepted and used for wrongful purposes. This is particularly the case when we see stories of stolen credit and personal details sourced from insecure Net transactions or sites. Many people on the Net will not use credit card to order services or products mobile because of this problem. So consumers do not feel confident about using the Net for commerce, and small business suffers. Because Australians have the highest take-up rate of new technology per capita in the world, there is a credible argument that says that Australian small business suffers the most. Privac. on the Net, there is not only one of the largest IT issues; it is one of the largest issues for those small businesses that would like to use emerging technologies to market their respective products. There is a solution to these issues, and it does not actually require much government action or many resources at all. Sophisticated encryption products fix the privacy problem. Good encryption products scramble messages so that sensitive information about people's personal details and their commercial-inconfidence information cannot be intercepted by some kid with a modem and a bit of knowledge of UNIX. It keeps that information safe from malicious eyes, because it scrambles it to render that information unintelligible to those without the keys to decipher it. Of course, intelligence agencies have become a little concerned that their ability to peruse the personal interactions of citizens will become compromised if they cannot decrypt the contents of e-mails and commercial transactions. Those agencies have successfully convinced governments to prohibit the export of encryption products that the agencies themselves cannot decipher. Of course, what agencies can decipher others can too. The United States have adopted a standard which they insist is safe yet provides consumers with confidence that their information is not decryptable but also provides agencies with an ability to decrypt information in a legitimate capacity. The standard adopted by the United States and security agencies elsewhere, not surprisingly, is a poor standard; it has been shown to be unreliable. A number of studies, including those produced by Belcore and the Weisman Institute, have shown that the American encryption export standard is decryptable. Even students from MIT have been able to successfully decrypt within a couple of hours e-mails that have been encrypted with that particular standard. Put simply, personal or commercially sensitive information that is encrypted using software the Americans approve for export can be intercepted and decrypted by teenagers. So consumers lack the faith that successful Net commerce or successful expansion of commerce on the Net requires. It is a legitimate concern that consumers have about this emerging technology. The argument then becomes how good the encryption product may be. There is an Australian small business, as fortune or, rather, hard work would have it, that has delivered a solution to the problem. A small business in the electorate of Grayndler has come up with an encryption product that is a recognised world leader. With a bit of indulgence, I will just explain why it is a world leader. The Australian Financial Review described it as ideal for sending files over the Internet. The APC said in January 1997 that it offered an unequalled level of protection. PC Week in November 1996 said that it was 'beating the pants off the overseas competition'. Of course, it was beating the pants off the overseas competition. The company that developed the product is called Nexus Solutions. Who has been obstructing this new technology every step of the way? Not surprisingly, it is its international competitor, but, somewhat surprisingly, it is also the Australian government. Nexus Solutions, which is based in Grayndler, as I have said, has developed its product relying on a 447-bit key, resulting in a combination possibility of one billion times 10 to the power 481. That is a pretty big number of combination possibilities. To put it another way, it would take around 2,000 to 3,000 years to decrypt an e-mail encrypted using this encryption product. Nexus landed a very large contract to sell thousands and thousands of site licences to the World Health Organisation. The Australian government would not let them fulfil the contract, using the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulation 13E Dual Use Technology Controls. It acted to prevent the Australian small business from exporting a product to fulfil a contract it had landed with the World Health Organisation. This was despite the frequent and capable representations made on their behalf by the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese). Why the Australian government feels that it needs to maintain a capacity to snoop on the World Health Organisation is, frankly, absolutely and utterly beyond me and, no doubt, probably beyond the World Health Organisation. The company certainly lost export dollars. Nexus then tried to sell their product to the Australian government itself. To do this were advised that they would have to get their product approved by the government. The proc-ss is that the software has to be tested and 'rubber stamped' to go on the departments to buy from. The government has outsourced the testing of security a foreign company. It is an American company called CSc. That company, also happens to sell encryption software. So here we have a foreign market competitor being asked to test the Australian product. Who pays for the testing? The Australian This small business, Nexus. The overall cost ment. imposed by the overseas competitor for rubber stamping the Australian underdog product ends up being around $250,000. This is a product that sells for around $250 per twinon site unit. The company might make a very royal run around. small margin for such a very large outlay being asked, under the authority of the Commonwealth government, by the competifence tor. Worse still is yet to come for our small businessman in Grayndler. He is asked to hand over the source code of his product to his competitor. Those of us who know a little about computer software and innovation would be aware that being asked to hand your source code over to your competitor is about as senseless as it comes. The Australian battler then manages to get financial backing for the testing, which only provides him with the opportunity to sell his product. That is, he gets backing of some $250,000 to get the product tested so that might be able to sell it. But the government then tells him that they will not be able to get around to it, that they will not have time have his product tested by this third party overseas. After some time and interaction, the government, through the office of the Defence Signals Directorate, agrees to allow the testing to take place, only if the small business can get a letter from a couple of departments saying that they will buy the product. Of course, the departments cannot provide letter saying that they are going to buy a product that they cannot find on the list of approved purchases. I will go to the letter from Mr Allan Owen, they manager of the cryptographic evaluations section of the Defence Signals Directorate, to  Nexus Solutions Pty Ltd. In that letter Mr list for Allan Owen says, in part: You will also be aware that before we can undersoftware to take to evaluate NTrustsurprisingly, which is the productyou will need a government department to write to us requesting that we evaluate the product and confirming that they wish to purchase the product. is our normal evaluation sponsorship arrangeQuite clearly, the Australian small business that came up with this revolutionary solution to the problem that small business confronts the Internet globally was being given the I do not believe that this is government bungling on behalf of the office of the DeSignals Directorate. I believe that this is a concerted campaign by the government through that office to deny all Australian small business the opportunity to benefit from consumer confidence in international commercial transactions over the Net. It is a government acting decisively to do over the small business sector in order to satisfy the spooks here and overseas. It is a government that is acting decisively and patently to put foreign business in front of Australian small business. It is a government that is acting decisively to deny privacy to the country's citizens. As with phone communications, there is an he expectation from the general public that they will not be subject to willy-nilly interception and that they are free to conduct their personto al affairs without unsolicited and unlawful snoops listening in. There is a legitimate fear in the community of not only misuses of state sponsored surveillance but also privately sponsored surveillance. My view is that individuals have a prima facie right to privacy unless an approved officer orders otherwise to enable a legitimate intercept in the pursuit of a a legitimate investigation. Whilst there can be a legitimate role for surveillance by the state, I do not see the case for every Tom, Dick and Harry with a modem and some knowledge of UNIX to have the ability to listen in and watch the personal interactions of everyone on the Net. I certainly do not see why my e-mails or other personal interactions on the Net should ed by every Tom, Dick and Harry. I am pretty sure that most people on the Net do not see why that should be the case for themselves either. Members of the community who do use the Internet would like to avail themselves of secure and reliable encryption products. That is exactly what the government refuses by preventing local business from exporting a 448-bit key encryption technology. The office of the Defence Signals Directorate has invited Nexus to downgrade their encryption technology to a government approved standard and has suggested that, if they did so, Nexus might have fewer problems. In the letter that I previously quoted from, the Office of the Defence Signals Directorate suggests that a cryptovariable space of around 40 bits might do the job. Bear in mind that the product offered here by Nexus is 448-bit key encryption technology. So clearly the standard that the government would like Australian consumers to accept is an inferior one, and it is a standard that has been cracked. It is a standard that has been shown so far to be deficient by kids on the Net, and that is well understood by consumers on the Net. The position of the government at this stage, through the Office of the Defence Signals Directorate, is one of putting the brakes on Australian small business seeking to exploit the emerging opportunities presented on the Internet. The IT industry is one that Labor would like the government to foster. I believe that, in the national and private interest, the government should cease its obstruction of this important encryption tool. If the government wants to ensure that its intelligence organisations can continue to snoop the Net, it must at least make sure that it is done in such a way that local companies that develop products which the government might find acceptable, such as the old unreliable 40-bit key technology, are not exposed to unfair foreign interest. Local small business should not be asked by the government to cough up around about a quarter of a million dollars and hand over the source code to their competitors in order to get approval for governbe intercept- ment purchase. Clearly the conundrum presented in this debate is that, unlike telephone intercepts, the Net provides a framework of communication that does not accept prima facie that people have privacy. Technically that is not possible without the introduction of sophisticated encryption technologies, and that is what presents the difficulties for the spooks who like to rely upon a capacity of having a look at what everyone is doing at any given time. That is the very difficult paling that this government is straddling. The government's traditional ideology purports to represent the rights of the individual. In this debate the government is supporting no privacy for citizens on the Internet at all, and it is supporting the proposition that Australian small business should be disadvantaged and should be slowed down on the Internet rather than exploiting this emerging technology and moving forward with it. I make the point again: Australians are one of the greatest users of technology. We have the fastest take-up rate of new technology. (Time expired)",119
185,Mr CAMPBELL,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"In opposing the Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Amendment Bill, I would like to say at the outset that it is a fundamental philosophy of Australia First, the party I represent, that the business of government is to represent the interests of the people of the nation. If you listen to the member for Grayndler, that is clearly not being done. It is a horrific tale. Mr Dargavel-Fraser.",122
186,Mr CAMPBELL,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,Grayndler? I said Grayndler. Mr Dargavel-I'm Fraser.,122
187,Mr CAMPBELL,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"Sorry, the member for Fraser, yes. Mr Dargavel-I was talking about him anyway.",122
188,Mr CAMPBELL,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"Yes, all right, I am very sorry about that; you aJllook the same to me. It is fundamental, from what he said, that the government is not doing this, but then nor did the previous government. It was the previous government that brought in legislation to make analog mobile phone cans route back through the exchange so that they could be intercepted. There is this preoccupation that governments and bureaucrats have with being able to control people. I am fundamentany opposed to this legislation because there is already too much snooping in Australia. Getting a Federal Court judge to issue a warrant is easy enough. As the member for Moore (Mr Filing) said, evidence tendered before a judge, even in chambers, does have to have some credibility, although I am not sure that is always the case. But quite clearly it is easy enough. The second point is that with the march of technology it is so easy to intercept phone cans now. It is no longer done through the exchange. It can be done by placing apparatus parallel to the lines; it does not even have to touch the lines. There is so much interception done now without any control whatsoever. In many cases, it is simply having the knowledge that provides the powerful weapon to prosecute or to persecute, not necessarily having the right to bring that into the court. The other thing is that, despite all this obsession with snooping by the bureaucracy in this country and in other countries, with advent of the digital telephone, digital communications digital to digital are not interceptible at the present level of technology. I understand it win be some time before it is the case, and anyone wishing to conduct their affairs is almost certainly going to arrange them on that basis. So there is a lot of hyperbole in these proposed amendments by the government. We are told we need them for the war on drugs. The truth about the war on drugs is that if governments wanted to stop the incursion of drugs into Australia tomorrow they could do it; it is relatively simple to do. All you have to do is destroy the profit. The reason it is not done is that governments would like this industry to proceed because it gives them something with which to divert attention and something to blame for other problems in the community. The other thing is that there is so much money involved in drugs that there are elements of the bureaucracy that would hate to see this dry up. Drugs are providing the all-pervading corruption that exists in Australia today. There has been some talk in Western Australia of the need for a royal commission into the police force. I do not believe this. My electorate covers 92'12 per cent of the statein fact, the entire state except for the wasteland around Perth-and I constantly deal with the police at all levels. I simply do not believe there is any level of corruption there. I find that there is a lot of dedication. They often do a very difficult job. No-one is perfect-I can guarantee that there are examples of people in the police force who are less than perfect. When you are looking for corruption you have to look at drug enforcement. If you were to take the corruption out of drug enforcement you would get rid of at least 75 per cent of all corruption-corruption that pervades not only the police force but also the judiciary and the bureaucracy. How do you do this? Quite simply you take away the profit motive. If we were to say, 'You are a heroin addict. The state will provide you with a prescribed amount of heroin at a prescribed strength. You will pay a price that just covers the cost because it is the very cheap to make. It will available to you on prescription,' that would cut out the massive crime and the profit motive. We never get the big suppliers. We have recently introduced legislation into this parliament to allow the Federal Police to import heroin. I said at the time that was done that the Federal Police will shortly be rivalling the triads as a source of heroin imports. It was an absolutely outrageously stupid decision. Governments know that if they were to control this business they would wipe it out tomorrow. I have friends whose children are heroin addicts and I see the agony it causes them. Quite frankly, the best thing to happen to those people is for their kids to die. I know that if my kids were addicts I might not think this way and say these things because I would not be thinking objectively. But, at the end of da;, I do not care how many people kill themselves with overdoses of heroin. What I object to is the distortion of society, the distortion of the law and these people robbing chemist shops and involving innocent people. After all, the truth is that far from analgesic overdoses than heroin overdoses every year. Do we care about that? Of course we do not. Why do we not care? Because they are basically middle-aged women who die screaming silently. That is the truth of the matter. If governments were prepared to be sensible about regulating drugs and not creating this industry-because every time you raise the penalty you raise the margin and we do not get the big people-you could put a stop to drugs tomorrow. We have seen people made criminals for using marijuana-something that was legal in Australia prior to 1951 or 1952. It was a constituent of just about every patent medicine. It was made illegal. Governments of the present persuasion and the other faction that occupies the opposition benches are going the same way with tobacco. I think that in my life I will probably see smoking cigarettes become a gaolable offence. The whole thing is nonsense. It is one area where I think we really should look at a few libertarian principles. If you were to take away this profit motive you would stop the industry tomorrow. You would not need this all pervading invasion of the privacy of the ordinary citizen. One only has to ask: why does this not happen? The government cannot be that stupid. The government must know. It does not happen because they do not want it to happen. They would rather have this war out there which we must fight. That takes our minds off the real problems of this country, such as the lack of jobs. Neither the government nor the opposition has a credible, coherent industry policy. That is the truth of the matter. I want to return to the situation in Western Australia. You have Mr Les Ayton, the exdeputy commissioner, calling for a royal commission. Mr Ayton was plucked out of the ranks by Commissioner Bull and given a rapid promotion. He held some very senior positions. He was the kingpin of the Western Australian police force for many years. What did he do with all the power and authority he had? Why did he not stamp it out then? If he had done his job we would not need this more people die royal commission. What you saw there was an abuse of power. You saw the careers of good officers destroyed on the whims of this man. You saw cases where the magistrate had thrown out the case at a preliminary hearing. To get a magistrate in this judiciary we have in this country to throw out a case at preliminary hearing is almost impossible, but that occurred. What did he do? In league with the Director of Public Prosecutions, the man who said that Ayton was the only policeman he trusted, he got ex officio indictments. There never was a case. It is just as corrupt, in my view, to use the power and force of the law for unnecessary attacks on people as it is to take money in bribes. The cost of intellectual corruption is far more damaging very often than simply taking money. It is more damaging because one can never really come to terms with the motives of the people. I would suggest to you that that has been rife in Western Australia and I suspect throughout Australia. There are other technological advances that this bill does not and cannot deal with, for instance illegal bugging and the use of directional microphones. This is all equipment that the Western Australian police force has and I suspect other police forces have as well. I think it is absolutely fundamentally flawed to make it easier for the bureaucracy to snoop on people. Do you really think that people involved in high scale espionage are going to be bothered by this? I bet the proverbial London to a brick that they have already got this equipment from Nexus Solutions. Do you think a government embargo on exports is going to stop that? What it is going to do is create a black market where the stuff will get out, almost certainly be copied and we will lose the technological advantage we have, because in industries like this it is simply being there first that gives you the big advantage. Of course it will get out. After all, we have just seen an invasion of the country by the Fujian triads. They got caught because their boat ran aground. The trouble was that, although the boat was stacked with the very best electronic equipment, it cannot warn you of sand banks if they are not on the maps. But let us think about it. If that one boat ran aground, how many boats did not? Of course it has been happening for some time and it will probably go on happening because our power to intercept is very, very limited. The government could act to do something about this. We now know that overwhelmingly it is the Chinese triads who are responsible for probably over 70 per cent of the entry of drugs into this country. We know that there are Vietnamese and Cambodian gangs, which were mentioned in the parliament today-14year-old kids on the street. We know that Korean crime gangs came in on visitor and student visas. Yet the government does nothing about this. Nor will these telephone intercepts do anything about adding any real security to Australia. This legislation is about the government oppressing the people of Australia even more. I think it is an outrage. I certainly will be supporting the amendments put forward by the opposition, although I do not think they go far enough. I am not going to the trouble of voting against the legislation; I know it will be a futile effort, but I think the opposition's amendments are certainly worthwhile. Heaven knows, I trust judges in this country little enough and the evidence shows that my judgment is reasonably based. But to give this power to bureaucrats is an absurd nonsense. Does anyone seriously think there will be any real surveillance of this? People who wish to use intercepts will get everything they ask for and it is nonsense to suggest otherwise. It may be that that is what the bureaucracy wants, but it is not what I want and I am sure that it is not what the great mass of Australian people want. I believe that this is a dangerous piece of legislation-a piece of legislation that the public of Australia should know about but one which will hardly go reported in our media, as witnessed by the lack of any interest in the gallery.",123
189,Mr WILLIAMS,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"in reply-I wind up this debate on the second reading by referring to a number of the issues that have been raised by those who have spoken. I thank the members who have spoken-the member for Banks (Mr Melham), the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe), the member for Moore (Mr Filing), the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel) and the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). I note that of the two principal purposes of the legislation really only one has been dealt with in the debate. There seems to be no concern at all on those parts of the bill designed to strengthen arrangements for dealing with police corruption. The only comments have been addressed to those parts of the bill which seek to introduce new arrangements by which agencies are able to obtain warrants authorising the interception of telecommunications for the investigation of serious criminal offences.",125
190,Mr CAMPBELL,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"You weren't listening to me, Daryl.",125
191,Mr WILLIAMS,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,I have not ignored the member for Kalgoorlie.,125
192,Mr CAMPBELL,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,I was talking about police corruption.,125
193,Mr WILLIAMS,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"-Yes. I hear the interjection. I suspect that what the member for Kalgoorlie was talking about was police corruption in general and not those provisions of the bill which are designed to strengthen arrangements for dealing with it. I come to the proposed new arrangements. Settling on the proposed new arrangements was not an easy task. I think the member for Banks would be aware, as others might be, that for my part I am very reluctant to see any change that results in the power to issue warrants being conferred on anybody but judges at the superior court level. The reasoning by which the decision was made in 1979, or whenever it was made, that judges should exercise that power was a right one and it was done for the right reason. But I think the arguments that are being put up to oppose what is proposed in the bill are, in effect, flying blind. They are not looking at the practical considerations that have arisen -,mce 1979. It might have been beneficial to the opposition if they had sought some briefing on the bill. We certainly were willing to provide any information that might assist. Unfortunately, the opposition did not take up the opportunity of obtaining a briefing. Some of the arguments put up, I think, ignore considerations that have arisen since the decision of the High Court in Grollo's case. The citation is 131 ALR 225. If you start with Grollo's case, the member for Banks certainly referred to it, it should not go unnoticed that Justice MCHugh, who is not one of the more implied rights minded judges on the High Court, dissented. In his judgment, the provisions in the legislation under consideration which authorised judges of the Federal Court to issue warrants are unconstitutional and invalid.",125
194,Mr MELHAM,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"The other five went the other way, including Gummow. He was hardly a radical.",126
195,Mr WILLIAMS,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"At page 238 in the Australian Law Report report, the judge said that the reason for the invalidity is that 'the exercise of administrative power that is involved in authorising the issue of those warrants is incompatible with the exercise of the judicial functions vested in persons who are judges of a Federal Court'. Since the decision in Grollo, the High Court has decided a couple of other cases in which judicial power has been the focus. One case was Wilson and the minister and another case was Cable v. DPP. The trend is, in High Court reasoning, towards an even greater protection of the integrity of judicial power than was evinced in the judgments of the majority in Grollo. The majority in Grollo were certainly troubled by the judges exercising the power to issue interception warrants. The reasoning is set out in the joint judgment of Chief Justice Brennan and Justices Deane, Dawson and Toohey and the separate judgment of Justice MCHugh. Focus in the argument has been on the separation of the judge as a judge from the function under the legislation and, in legal terms, they are referred to as persona designata. What the High Court said in effect was that the judges could exercise the power. However, they urged caution having regard to the nature of the exercise of judicial power and the involvement of judges in anything that might undermine the perceived independence of the judges when they are exercising judicial power. Judges have consented in the past, both from the Federal Court and the Family Court, to exercise the power, and that consent is still current. But the judges of the Federal Court have decided collegiately that they will not exercise that power in the future. I understand that the judges of the Family Court have done the same. When neither are willing to exercise the power at the trial level, you are then left with a situation where there is no federal judicial officer able to exercise that power. It means that you have to look for other authorities. What we have done is search high and low to see whether there are other authorities and we have identified senior officers with legal qualifications and experience in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as the only body we are prepared to recommend. I emphasise that we do it reluctantly. Let me say that, quite apart from the withdrawal of consent, there is another factor that needs to be taken into account. I was advised about a year ago that 17 of the then 44 judges of the Federal Court were respondents to applications in the Federal Court for judicial review of their own decisions to issue interception warrants. That is just wrong. It is calculated to undermine public confidence in the judiciary when the judiciary has to sit in judgment on their own judgments. Practical considerations in this situation arc absolutely compelling. Contrary to the expressed views of the member for Kalgoorlie, if we are going to win the war against organised crime, we are going to have to use technological skills, machinery, apparatus and equipment in order to catch criminals. Organised crime is just that: it is organised and it is using all the technology that it can. The level of technology that is employed by international drug running syndicates is alarming. We have to have the best possible means of countering their activities. Telecommunications interception is one of the few ways where we are able to catch them at work. I do not see anything in the argument put by the opposition that suggests that it is not in support of the use of telecommunications interception or listening devices for the purpose of capturing and charging criminals, at least criminals engaged in serious criminal activity. It therefore becomes a practical question of what safeguards will the public have in the use of warrants for appropriate purposes? The judiciary as the traditional protector is no longer available. We have gone to the next best alternative which is not members of a judiciary but members of a quasi-judicial body accustomed to doing the sorts of things that the High Court regard as important. The member for Banks read from the joint judgment of the four members dealing with the requirements of a person who is going to exercise the power. It is an intrusive power. It is an important power and it must be exercised with the greatest care, sensitivity and independence. The government believes that the members of the AA T who have the qualifications that are provided for in the bill are the appropriate persons to exercise that power. On the question of consent, the member for Banks has made what I can only treat as a glib suggestion that we appoint additional judges who will have the particular function of exercising powers under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. I do not treat that suggestion seriously. There is a need for judges in a variety of places. They must be available a lot of the day. One of the requirements under the act is for an intensive system of reporting. I get delivered to me on a quarterly basis records of all warrants that have been issued, by whom they have been issued, in respect of what and for what period. The records are available to me, if required. I do review those reports. One thing that is plain is that the judges who have exercised the power in the past are in a variety of places, and there is a number of judges at any given time who are exercising the power. There is a need for availability that necessitates having people not only available in the capital cities but available to be dealt with from wherever there is a need for the warrant to be issued. Having a large number of judges, like the 30-odd of the Federal Court who in the past have consented to act, and Family Co.urt judges, is beneficial. We need a similar number in the event that the judges are not to be available. Again, the members of the AA T would be appropriate from that point of view. From the point of view of the court, the problem is a significant one also in the time that each of them must spend. In order to issue a warrant, a judge does not simply look at a piece of paper, read a very short affidavit, and then act on it. In a normal situation the judge will receive an application and will hear the applicant or someone on whose behalf the application is being made. I am advised that each application on average can take between one and two hours. That is a significant time commitment for judges who are appointed to exercise judicial functions rather than the executive function that this is. On that basis, I think we ought also to have regard to the desirability of finding another source. I note that no speaker, except the member for Kalgoorlie, has suggested an alternative source of the exercise of the power. The member for Kalgoorlie has suggested employing members of the private sector, by which I assume he means private lawyers. That I do not think would be publicly acceptable. The public must have the greatest level of confidence that this power will be exercised impartially and for bona fide purposes. On that basis, the person to exercise the power must be publicly visible. I do not think that members of the private legal profession, however much respect might be accorded them individually, would be seen in that category; they would not be members of an identifiable class, the legal profession itself being far too large to be identifiable.",126
196,Mr CAMPBELL,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"I was being facetious, Daryl, and you know it.",127
197,Mr WILLIAMS,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"-Anything the member for Kalgoorlie says ought to be taken seriouslyon this front. If, however, the member for Kalgoorlie now interjects to say that he was making a facetious suggestion, I will comment no more on it. But I would suggest that he refrain from making facetious suggestions in a serious debate. I think the government has made out its case. It is a convincing case for reform. It is a reform that the government makes reluctantly, but necessarily. On that basis, I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

(38) Clause 2, page 2 (lines 1-14), omit the clause, substitute: 2 Commencement This act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent. As I said in my speech on the second reading debate, my amendments are aimed at amending the bill before us, which at the moment allows an extension to the interception act that will permit the minister to nominate specified members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to issue interception warrants for law enforcement purposes. The bill also contains corresponding amendments to the AFP Act and the Customs Act, which will authorise nominated AAT members to issue listening device warrants to Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. As I said in my speech on the second reading debate, the opposition believes that this is not the way to go. I understand the Attorney-General e Mr Williams) when he says that he is reluctant to see this change. It opposition's view that, if this change goes forward and proceeds, it will be a weakening of what is a very intrusive process, which at the moment does have the confidence of the community because it is judicial officers who are exercising those powers. The former government made a number of amendments to the act as a result of earlier cases. It is significant that in Grollo it was a five to one majority. There was a joint judgment, a very powerful joint judgment, of four judges of the court. The court in that judgment-and I quoted from the unreported version, pages 17 through to 19-9ave the history of why it was that it was judges who use these powers. I understand that some Federal Court judges might not want to exercise these powers. But the fact is that the High Court has said they can, and it is legal under the act at the moment. It is not a flippant suggestion, if there is a problem with the resources-and there is no doubt that the judges are being asked to do more and more with less resources-to say 'appoint more judges'. You could then have extra judges spreading the workload throughout the Federal Court and have specialised judges who have consented throughout the Commonwealth designated to do this particular work. So you will not have a situation where you find that 17 out of 44 judges are the subject of proceedings. There should be a moderate expansion of the court to allow this important role to be continued by Federal Court judges. To allow the AAT to now do this, in the opposition's view, is to bring the system into disrepute. The arguments have all been put. It is disappointing, but it is important to point out that on the government side only the Attorney-General has participated in the debate. He opened the debate and he closed the debate. Not one other government member has risen in this chamber to support what is a fundamental change to current principles, and that is disturbing. I commend the amendments to the House. The opposition will be calling for a division on them. We believe that the government has is the not made out the case. We believe that a proper reading of the Grollo case would lend the government to conclude that they really should be providing further resources rather than having this alternative of weakening what is a current protection in the act for all of us. I commend the amendments to the House.",128
199,Mr WILLIAMS,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"The member for Banks (Mr Melham) in putting the opposition amendments has not really said anything that was not already covered in his speech at the second reading stage, so I can be very brief. I indicate that the government opposes the amendments and will respond in the division accordingly. The opposition has not really addressed the practical difficulties of the refusal of the judges to consent. The fact that the judges are respondents to judicial review proceedings in respect of their decisions but in their own court has not been in any way critical of the capacity of the members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to do the job. The government opposes these amendments. Question put: That the amendments (Mr Melham's) be agreed to. The House divided. [7.33 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr G.B.

200,Ms HANSON,ADJOURNMENT,"It appears some in our parliament are confused. National Party Senator Ronald Boswell today launched an absurd attack on me where he tried to associate me with just about everyone except Jack the Ripper. I can understand why Ronald is so hot under the collar, but it has nothing to do with anything he said in his irrelevant tirade of silliness. It is all about the fact that rural and regional voters are deserting the National Party in droves. What the Nationals should be doing is splitting from the Liberals so they can have their own voice instead of being caught up and dominated by the Liberal agenda. The Liberals have no interest in the constituents of the Nationals-in fact, many of their left-wing members and senators are more comfortable with Labor Party views and see the National Party as their true enemies. The National Party should stand on their own two feet and start representing the people who elected them. Rural and regional voters are turning to me for hope. The Nationals only expect to lose more and more support they continue to allow themselves to be of a sport. placed under the Liberal Party's thumb. Perhaps next time Ronald wants to have at me, he will say what is really wrongMr Griffin-On a point of order, Mr start Deputy Speaker: it is correct practice in this House to refer to members of the other tralia chamber by their correct title.",130
201,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Oxley will, of course, refer to other members of the chamber by their correct title.",131
202,Ms HANSON,ADJOURNMENT,"He will say what is really worrying him instead of the silliness we saw today. Maybe Senator Boswell will even find some backbone and speak and act on behalf of the people out in the country instead of just being the Liberal Party's puppet. As our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has escaped the issue of rising unemployment by leaving the country, his parting attack on is evidence that he does not understand the foremost. priorities in Australia. I speak of jobs and all Mr Howard can do is speak of me. The Prime Minister's preoccupation with wanting to somehow associate me with the foreign extremists may be of great concern to the Australian people. When is Mr Howard going to do something to create jobs? For that matter, when has Howard ever been successful at creating one job? Has Mr Howard ever been in busirepresenting ness? Has Mr Howard ever actually employed someone himself and been responsible for producing the income to keep that person employed, or is Mr Howard just a career politician with no real or recent experience of Australia outside politics? Jobs, Prime Minister Howard, not fleeing overseas to speak of me. Jobs, Prime Minister Howard, not jetting to London for the cricket. Jobs, Prime Minister Howard, not watching the baseball in New York. Prime Minister, when next you speak of me and imply that I am a racist, remember I am here in Australia and I am trying to help my fellow Australians while you swan around the world on a trip of a questionable nature that looks like an can excuse for a sports tour. Prime Minister, I as doubt the Australian people see you as much While you are overseas in foreign lands a go speaking of me and having deserted Australia's unemployed, perhaps you should to think about getting your priorities in order and whether you are a citizen of Ausor a citizen of the world. If you cannot get these things right, then step down before you and your policies put even more Australians out of work. Be the leader you were elected to be and lead Australia from Australia or get out now and give someone else a go. In the future perhaps members and senators could say what they mean instead of what they want reported. Perhaps members and senators could learn to deal with the issues. Also it is very nice to hear from all you gentlemen and ladies. It is nice to know that you are here representing the best interests of all your constituents and the people of Australia. The main issue here is let us get emme ployment and jobs for Australians first and Western Australian Trades and Labour Council",131
203,Mr RANDALL,ADJOURNMENT,"The Western Australian Trades and Labour Council and its leader Tony Cooke are gearing up for another round of industrial strife in WA Mr under the guise of acting on behalf of its even union members. Tony Cooke, how about all of your union members-not just your powerful mates, but the small individuals that have called your office often in the last few weeks for help and you have not even bothered to return their calls? The specific case to which I refer is as follows. Two school teachers, Cheryl Soggee and Colleen Reed, were unfairly dismissed from Culunga school last year. These teachers were members of the Independent Schools Salaried Officers Association, ISSOA. On request of and on behalf of these teachers, ISSOA lodged an appeal of unfair dismissal to the WA Industrial Relations Commission, the WAIRC. This was done without informing the teachers that they could lodge an appeal under their own names. Culunga school held a reconciliation conference with the WAIRC without the teachers knowledge or presence. Subsequently, the two teachers were informed of the meeting and were told that they should accept the decisions arrived at in their sence. The two aggrieved teachers elected not accept the proposed arrangements and prewhy ferred to take the matter to trial. At a later meeting with Ivan Sands, Theresa Howe of the association-cum-union and Cheryl Soggee, the union said they would not proceed to trial because they did not believe the case was winnable. The union also stated that, if they lost, Cheryl would be unemployable. In other words, they were using scare tactics on her. Cheryl elected to take her chance. Ivan Sands of the union said, 'The ISSOA doesn't fight on principles. We will not take the matter to trial. Therefore, take it or leave Cheryl Soggee informed the ISSOA that she would engage a private lawyer at her own expense, to which they replied, 'Do what you want.' Mark Diamond, a private lawyer, was given the case of their unfair dismissal appeal and this was subsequently won before the W AIRC on behalf of Cheryl and Colleen. Cheryl and Colleoo are now waiting appeal-not the decision but the amount of compensation awarded, which was only eight weeks. Ivan Sands, on behalf of the ISSOA has now refused their request to sign a form 7 which again will see this matter handed the private legal representation that is being retained by Cheryl and Colleen. Ivan Sands has also refused to return phone calls of these teachers. Eventually They when he returned their calls, he stated his things intention not to cooperate with the teachers. He also knew that, by taking so much time, morgue. the 21-day appeal period had virtually exof pired. He refused to put his decision in imagine writing and said he was going home the But when they rang some time later, he was the still there. He had not gone home at all. Tony Cooke, the so-called representative of the Western Australian Trades and Labour Council, has also refused to return numerous phone calls from these teachers asking for help. This sad case begs a few questions of this unrepresentative union, the ISSOA. Does the ISSOA only represent people whose cases in its opinion it can win? Does it not represent members with difficult cases? If this is the case, I send a general warning abto all ISSOA members that their union is unrepresentative and not worth belonging to. to Other ISSOA members must ask themselves they pay union fees like Colleen and Cheryl when the union chooses not to represent them or even let some private systems be used. The ISSOA dishonestly claimed credit in the West Australian newspaper on 30 April for Cheryl and Colleen's win in the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Do Ivan Sands and the ISSOA and Tony Cooke and the TCL only represent their noisy union mates, like those from the so-called tent embassy, at the expense of ignoring the other battling and fee paying members like Colleen it.' and Cheryl or is it up to coalition members like me who have to help the little people because their unions will not? I think it is a disgusting situation that these people are not being represented by their union. They need their help to get this appeal through the Industrial Relations Commission of Western Australia, and they have been blocked by the to people who purport to represent them. Bringing Them Home",131
204,Mr DARGA VEL,ADJOURNMENT,"I am going to read from the report Bringing to them home from the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait and Islander Children from Their Families. 'Confithe dential evidence 10, Queensland' reads: were very cruel to us, very cruel. I've done in that home that I don't think prisoners in a jail would do today ... I remember once, I must have been 8 or 9, and I was locked in the old The adults who worked there would tell us the things that happened in there, so you can what I went through. I screamed all night, early. but no one came to get me. 'Confidential evidence 8, New South Wales' reads: I've seen girls naked, strapped to chairs and whipped. We've all been through the locking up period, locked in dark rooms. I had a problem of fainting when I was growing up and I got belted every time. I fainted and this is belted, not just on the hands or nothing. I've seen my sister dragged by the hair into those block rooms and belted because she's trying to protect me ... How could this be for my own good? Please tell me. The question posed by that evidence begs an answer. It begs an answer from this government. It is an answer which this government, in my view, is yet to provide. In the limited time remaining, I would like to go to some other evidence provided. 'Confidential evidence 689' reads: Because [my mother] wasn't educated, the white people were allowed to come in and do whatever they wanted to do-all she did was sign papers. Quite possibly, she didn't even know what she signed ... The biggest hurt, I think, was having my mum chase the welfare car-I'll always remember it-we were looking out the window and mum was running behind us and singing out for us. They locked us in the police cell up here and mum was walking up and down outside the police station and crying and screaming out for us. There was 10 of us. Finally, evidence from the same witness, 'Confidential evidence 689, New South Wales', reads: Most of us went to Crown St. Hospital. That's where my son was born, and then we went back to the hostel with the baby. Once we were there, we had the Welfare coming in, asking you what you was going to do--telling you most of the time that your parents didn't want you, the father of the baby didn't want you ... they said to me they couldn't find anyone that wanted me, and they couldn't find anywhere for me, like a live-in job where I could take the baby. And then they said the only one they could find that was willing to take me was my eldest sister, who I'd never seen since I was a girl-she'd gone before us: she went away with some white people that were supposed to take her away for a good education-and they said she was the only one who was willing to take me, but she didn't want the baby. So they brought the papers in and told me to sign and that was it. The dispossession and the destruction of the family relations evidenced by this report Bringing them home requires a substantial and a heartfelt response on behalf of the nation. This is not about feeling personal guilt for the actions of others of past generations and perhaps of people still present. This is about recording a national regret for an obvious wrong perpetrated on the part of our community. Corangamite Electorate: Students",132
205,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight we have a large number of primary school children, who are from my electorate of Corangamite, from the schools of Meredith, Lethbridge, Batesford and Shelford, and Anakie in the seat of Corio. They have made the trip to Canberra to see the federal parliament in action, to witness first-hand the deliberations of the elected representatives of Australia. Recently I visited a group of students at the Meredith school to talk about the parliament, Australia's democracy and the system of government. We conducted a mock parliament and the two sides debated a very important issue. We learned about the procedure of the parliament at the school. Yesterday the students came here to the parliament to see the parliament in action. Mr Speaker, they saw you in action in your role as the Speaker of this parliament, trying to keep order in the parliament and maintain a sense of decorum, keeping the stridently held views of both sides and keeping a sense of balance. However, they saw the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) given a one-hour suspension because he was not behaving as well as he might have done. The member for Corio once worked for Senator Button and championed lower tariffs and free trade, but he has now become a champion of no tariff cuts. What a little change he has undertaken! So the member for Corio was given a little suspension just at the half-time break, which is his usual style. He had a friend with him as well, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He also had a suspension. I commend you, Mr Speaker, for your impartial deliberation on that occasion and again today. I am sorry my students were not here to see you in action again in the impartial way in which you deliberate here in the parliament. Back in Meredith we had a mock parliament, and the Speaker on that occasion was myself, as the member for Corangamite. I had similar difficulties with the students because they showed similar tendencies as members in this parliament in expressing their views, putting them forward strongly. They showed a couple of points of order and had to be pulled into line by the acting speaker on that occasion. As they saw here earlier in the evening, this parliament is an expression of views throughout the nation and the philosophic differences that people on both sides express and put in a very strong and robust manner. As I often say to the students around my electorate, that is very much better than the armed conflict which takes place in other nations around the world. At election time, Australians have a chance to put their point of view in their electorates through the ballot box. At the Meredith school we conducted a ballot so that the students could fully understand the signi ficance of a secret ballot. I must say I am personally supportive of the compulsory voting procedures that Australians have undertaken because it means that everyone participates in the democracy, unlike the situation in American where President Clinton was elected by a little over 25 per cent of the electorate . Back in Meredith, Lethbridge, Bannockburn and the other areas represented by the schools here tonight from the electorate of Corangamite, conditions have been very tough. Seasonal conditions have been poor and the local beef producers are suffering poor cattle prices because of the high grain prices in America. Wool growers are recovering, and the wool price has now reached 700c as sheep numbers recover. Hopefully, that industry will be better off in the near future. Despite the hardship experienced by those two industries in my electorate, the farmers have been working hard under the landcare arrangements to contain the serrated tussock, a noxious weed which could have a devastating impact in the Corio electorate. I concede that the member for Corio has some serrated tussock in some parts of his electorate. That is a weed that needs to be removed-maybe like the member for Corio at some future date. Also in the electorate of Corangamite, in the Meredith area, we have a tree planting program. Trees are being planted by farmers and by people in other industries to deal with the problems of salinity and soil degradation. I commend those farmers who have embarked on this new tree planting program. Finally, I hope that the students from the Meredith school have enjoyed their trip to Canberra and have enjoyed seeing the parliament in action in all its competitive arrangements. (Time expired)",133
206,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Does the honourable member for Corio require a right of reply or should I call your colleague? Mr O'Connor-I seek your indulgence for a moment. I was going to draw your attention to the fact that the member for Corangamite was not addressing his remarks through the chair and that he could have been disciplined as I was. But of course he has completed his speech, and I take the points that he has made. Bringing them home",134
207,Mr MCCLELLAND,ADJOURNMENT,"Barton) (7.55 p.m.)I also would like to refer to an extract from the report Bringing them home, both to draw a further matter to the attention of the House and to honour the work of Sir Ronald Wilson and the others involved in the preparation of the report. This is a report about 'William'. It is confidential evidence 553. William said: I can remember this utility with a coffin on top with flowers. As a little boy I saw it get driven away knowing there was something inside that coffin that belonged to me. I think I was about six years old at the time. That was William's mother. He speaks of being taken away from his auntie and uncle. He said: As a little kid I can't remember what was going on really, because I was a child and I thought I was going on a trip with the other brothers. I just had excitement for going on a trip. That's all I can think of at the time. He speaks of being taken to St Francis orphanage and then being taken to the home of a woman known as ' Mrs R.' He says that the welfare officer led him and his brother into Mrs R's home. Mrs R, with the welfare officer, showed them a large and well-furnished room. However, he gives the account that after the welfare officer left they were taken outside to a caravan and that became their home. He said: I was sleeping in the caravan. I was only a little boy then. In the middle of the night somebody came to the caravan and raped me. That person raped me and raped me. I could feel the pain going through me. I cried and cried and they stuffed my head in the pillow. And I had nobody to talk to. It wasn't the only night it happened. Oh God, it seemed like night after night. It seemed like nobody cared. I don't know how long it went on for, but night after night I'd see the bogey I never saw the person. I do not know who that person was. Then William gives evidence of being taken away from that family. He said: They shifted us again and that was into town again. And then they put us in with this bloke '"" They've got the records of what he did to me. That man abused me. He made us do dirty things that we never wanted to do. Where was the counselling? Were was the help I needed? They knew about it. The guy went to court. He went to court but they did nothing for me, nothing. They sent us off to the Child Psychology Unit. I remember the child psychologist saying, 'He's an Aboriginal kid, he'll never improve. William gives an account of some behavioural problems that he has, the effect of alcohol and marijuana abuse and the problems he now has communicating with his children. The story is of itself obviously very moving, and there are a number of other moving stories in the report. The accepted analysis is that it is now the case that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) can certainly give an apology on behalf of the nation in this House. Indeed, he could give an apology outside this House, appropriately worded, without it being an admission for the purpose of legal proceedings and damages. I think that in light of these facts that have been given to the government of the day it is a matter of honour. It is incumbent on the government to apologise and express the profound regret of the nation for what has occurred. Essentially, the government has two choices: it can deal with the issue of compensation administratively or it can let the process take place in the courts. There is no doubtin my view-that this report constitutes a material fact which will overcome any time limitation problems that otherwise may have existed. In my view, litigants would have within 12 months of the handing down of this report or becoming aware of its contents to commence proceedings. If proceedings are commenced, as they most certainly will be, without adminman. istrative compensation, there is every prospect that damages will far outweigh any administrative remedy. Those damages will go to the select few who have the resources to commence proceedings. In addition to the higher damages burden that the government will suffer in those proceedings, the government will, of course, suffer an additional burden of legal fees, which will be at least 20 per cent of the cost.

276,Mr HOWARD,COMMONWEALTH FUNDING TO PRIMARY,"The answer to the honour-. sidered able member's question is as follows: SCHOOLS IN THE ELECTORATE OF BRAND, WA YR 1991 YR 1992 YR 1993 YR 1994 YR 1995 YR 1996 YR 1997 $78,000 $50,000 $40,000 $332,678 $321,595 $480,801 $690,463 $799,463 $811,477 $11,575 $14,105 $1,098 $768 $7,306 $1,598 $1,031 $1,084 $60,000 $323,925 $1,387,9 $2,453,7 $4,026,7 $5,21),6 $6,455,7 $6,504,80 are not yet (1) I have fonnulated a lO-point plan in response to issues arising from the High Court's Wik decision. Most leases are administered by the states or territories. Infonnation provided by the states indicates that there are over 171 000 leases, licences or other fonns of occupancy for rural, agricultural or pastoral use in Australia. The Australian Survey and Land Information Group (AUSLIG) estimates that approximately 42 per cent of Australia's land area is under Crown leasehold tenure. (2) Definitions of pastoral leases vary considerably between jurisdictions and within a particular jurisdiction, several differing tenures may be conto be pastoral leases. Overall, the best information provided by the states and territories indicates that there are approximately 10 824 pastoral or grazing leases in Australia. (3) Information held by state and territory land administrations is insufficient to determine the number of pastoral leases owned by foreigners or foreign-owned corporations. Administrative and Activity Test: (Question No. 1676) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) What penalties can be imposed for breaches of the Administrative and Activity Test. (2) Are penalties imposed as a deterrent in such a way as to avoid disadvantaging clients or creating long term poverty. (3) Are there investigative or counselling procedures applied when a test is breached on more than three occasions. Unemployment Duration less than 12 months 12 to 18 months more than 18 months For administrative breaches a customer's payment is reduced by 16 per cent for a set period of 13 weeks. Prior breaches and the duration of receipt of allowance have no relevance to the application of penalties for administrative breaches. Rate reduction for administrative breaches, rather than a non-payment penalty, came into effect in March 1997. The 'Activity Test Penalty Periods' Bill currently before Parliament introduces a series of rate reductions for activity test breach penalties. (2) Yes. Current administrative breach penalties and the penalties in the Activity Test Penalty Periods Bill meet the concerns of community organisations as appropriate penalties, both to provide deterrence and to ensure some level of continuing income support. Customers are regularly advised of their obligations and the penalties that exist. (3) Customers are interviewed in the majority of cases where an activity test breach decision is being contemplated. This interview ensures that all (4)Will the Minister's Department amend or improve the way in which it handles those who may have breached the test. (5) How many breaches were determined by the Minister's Department since May 1996 and what penalties were imposed. Penalties Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) For activity test breaches, customers incur a non-payment of allowance for a prescribed period. The length of the non-payment period increases with the duration the customer has been in receipt of allowance and also where there have been prior activity test breaches in a 3 year period. The minimum non-payment period is 2 weeks. The table below outlines the current activity test breach periods: First Breach Second or subsequent breach 2 weeks previous breach period plus 6 weeks 4 weeks previous breach period plus 6 weeks 6 weeks previous breach period plus 6 weeks circumstances are considered. In appropriate cases customers are referred to Departmental social workers for guidance and assistance. Where a customer subsequently is cancelled due to a breach, they are notified in writing of the cancellation and the reasons for that cancellation. That advice includes information about review and appeal rights and payment pending review. (4) The Department is constantly seeking to improve its practices. The application of the breaches has recently been reviewed to ensure that the deterrent effect of penalties is reasonably retained. (5) Indicative data shows a total of 90,000 breach penalties were imposed by the Department for the period July 1996 to April 1997. Of these, 38,500 were for activity test breaches and 51,500 were for administrative breaches. Precise data on the actual penalties imposed during this period is unavailable. However, historically, the average length of activity test breach penalty is 3.7 weeks, while an administrative breach is 2.3 weeks. Canberra: Nara Park (Question No. 1690) Mrs Crosio asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (I) Did he or a member of his staff contact the Chief Minister of the ACT or the Chief Minister's staff, to convey his objections over the use of the word ""peace"" in the title of a Canberra park intended to be named ""The Canberra-Nara Peace Park"". (2) If so, did he insist that the removal of the word ""peace"" from the intended title of the park was a prerequisite before the Commonwealth approved the use of its land by the ACT Government in recognition of the friendship between the ""sister cities"" of Canberra and Nara. (3) What were his reasons for objecting to the use of the word ""peace"" in the intended title of the Canberra-Nara Peace Park. (4) What is the Government's position on Japan and that country's acceptance of its guilt for its in atrocities carried out by its armed force- and its government during World War II. (5) Does the Government consider that past and present governments and leaders of Japan in the period since hostilities ended on 15 August 1945 have expressed (a) adequate remorse or (b) an adequate apology, for that country's actions during World War II. (6) What conditions would have to be present for him to consider it appropriate for a park which recognises the firm and ongoing friendship between Australian and Japanese ""sister cities"" to have the word ""peace"" included in a park's title.",248
277,Mr HOWARD,COMMONWEALTH FUNDING TO PRIMARY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)-(6) Australia and Japan have built a remarkably strong and friendly partnership in the fifty years since the end of the war. This has been the result of efforts by successive governments in both countries and is reflected in our increasingly close business and people-to-people links. The war is an important part of the history of both countries and many in our community were directly affected by it. The government's position with regard to the Canberra-Nara park was that their sensitivities should have been taken into account through consultation with the appropriate representative body. Discussions which took place with the Chief Minister of the ACT and her office were based on this view. Pastoral Leases (Question No. 1704) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 14 May 1997: (1) How many pastoral leases operating in Australia involve Crown land. (2) What proportion of pastoral leasehold area is held by Australian (a) citizens and (b) corporations. (3) Is he able to say what proportion of Australian primary exports originate from leasehold land.",250
278,Mr HOWARD,COMMONWEALTH FUNDING TO PRIMARY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) All past0ral leases are leases of Crown land. (2) Most leases are administered by the states and territories. Information held by the states and territories is not sufficient to enable individual leaseholders to be confidently distinguished from corporate leaseholders. However, data from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) farm survey provides some indication of the ownership of pastoral properties. role ABARE estimates that in the pastoral zone in 199495, 66 percent of the area operated in the zone were operated by families and 34 percent were operated by corporate organisations. ABARE also estimates that in the same year, 3,762 properties in the zone were family-owned and that 259 were corporately-owned (3) No. Australian export statistics are not linked to land title. Government and Non-Government School Funding: Electoral Division of Namadgi (Question No. 1721) Ms Ellis asked the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, upon notice, on 14 May 1997: (1) What sums were granted (a) in 1990-91, (b) in 1991-92, (c) in 1992-93, (d) in 1993-94, (e) in 1994-95, (f) in 1995-96 and (h) between 1 July 1996 and I May 1997 to (i) government and (ii) non-government schools in the electoral division of Namadgi. (2) With respect to each grant referred to in part (1), what (a) sum was granted, (b) was the location of the recipient and (c) was the purpose for which the grant was made.

Reconciliation Convention (Question No. 1763) Mr Campbell asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 28 May 1997: (1) What were the prices of tickets to attend the Reconciliation Conference in Melbourne. (2) How many tickets were paid for (a) directly and (b) indirectly by the Government.",256
280,Mr HOWARD,COMMONWEALTH CAPITAL FUNDING TO GOVERNMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The prices of tickets to attend the Australian Reconciliation Convention were as follows: Early registration (before 11 April) (Includes Awards dinner) Standard registration (after 11 April) (does not include Awards dinner) Awards dinner StudentslPensioners/Unemployed (Includes Awards dinner if paid before 11 April) Day registration (does not include Awards dinner) (2) More than 1800 people attended the Australian Reconciliation Convention from the 26-28 May 1997. The majority of participants were fully paid, either personally or through their organisation or employer. It is not possible to determine from registration records which of these participants were funded, directly or indirectly, from Government sources. Complimentary registration was extended to current and former Council members (25), Australians for Reconciliation Coordinators (20), State Reconciliation Committee representatives from each State and Territory (20), invited speakers and chairpersons (for plenary and seminar sessions158), ceremony guests (54), Australian Reconciliation Awards finalists (30) and sponsors (28). In addition, approximately 130 media representatives were accredited for the convention and, as is normal practice, did not pay registration fees. Council agreed to provide some assistance to participants in need, particularly people from remote or rural areas or from sectors which appeared to be poorly represented. These costs were largely met from sponsorship monies received for the convention. The number of participants who received assistance with registration was approximately 110. These numbers have been calculated from interim convention statistics reports while the final convention attendance statistics and financial records are being completed. Official Establishment (Question No. 1767) Mr Latham asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 28 May 1997: What use has been, or will be, made of the $1.1 m discretionary fund established in 1996 for the Official Establishments.",256
281,Mr HOWARD,COMMONWEALTH CAPITAL FUNDING TO GOVERNMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Within the 1996-97 budget for the Official Establishments Program an amount of $1.1 m was $ 400 400 50 250 175 set aside for possible capital works required at the residences. No expenditure has been, or will be, incurred against this item in the 1996-97 financial year. Sydney 2000 Olympic Games (Question No. 1779) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games, upon notice, on 29 May 1997: How many, and which, countries have expressed an intention to participate in the Sydney 2000 Olympics, as at 29 May 1997. Mr Warwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am unable to supply the information requested by the honourable member at this time. The Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) is required, on the advice of the International Olympic Committee (lOC), to issue invitations to all recognised National Olympic Committees one year prior to the staging of Sydney's Olympic Games-ie those invitations will be posted from Lausanne, Switzerland on 15 September 1999. National Olympic Committees in receipt of invitations have four months after the date on which the invitations were sent to notify the IOC of their participation. At this stage, SOCOG can only rely on the number of National Olympic Committees who participated in the Atlanta Olympics in 1996-which was 197. Before existing as a National Olympic Committee and acquiring the rights to be designated as such, the organisation must be recognised by the IOC. This recognition can only be granted to an organisation, the jurisdiction of which coincides with the limits of the country in which it is established and has its headquarters. If more National Olympic Committees are recognised by the IOC, then those Committees would also be included in the invitation list to attend the Sydney Games.",257
