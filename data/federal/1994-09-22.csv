2,Mr SPEAKER,BROADCAST OF PROCEEDINGS,"Both houses recently resolved to adopt new general principles which cover arrangements for the radio broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings on the parliamentary and news network. The adoption of the new general principles follows the recommendations of a report of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings, which I chair. The committee also indicated in its report that it would adopt new standing determinations which flesh out the details of the radio broadcasting arrangements. These were adopted by the committee yesterday. In general terms, the new arrangements retain the core principles which have characterised radio broadcasting of parliament since its inception in 1946. However, they incorporate changes to reflect current technical, procedural and community realities. They represent an important reform in this area of parliamentary broadcasting. More specifically, the major changes which will be noticed by members will be: first, a change to the allocation of the broadcastsMondays and Thursdays will be House of Representatives broadcast days; second, the radio broadcasting of weekend sittingsmembers will recall that there was no radio broadcast of the most recent Saturday sitting, last year, during the debate on the Mabo legislation-third, a greater coverage of proceedings by allowing the transfer of broadcasts from one house to the other and by allowing the broadcast of proceedings after 11.30 p.m. when they occur; and, finally, broadcasting of the adjournment debate. This brings the arrangements for radio broadcasting into line with those for televising. In accordance with the resolution of both houses, the new arrangements come into effect on 10 October 1994. For the information of members, I table a copy of the new general principles and standing determinations. NA Public Accounts Committee Report",11
3,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present the following report: Report 331: Advisory report on the Financial Management Accountability Bill 1994, Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994 and Auditor-General Bill 1994, and on a proposal to establish an Audit Committee of Parliament. Ordered that the report be printed.",11
4,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I am pleased to have this opportunity to table the 331st report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which is an advisory report on legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901and, of course, it is a very important advisory report for this parliament. On 29 June 1994, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) introduced a package of three bills into this chamber: the Auditor-General Bill 1994, the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994. For the sake of brevity, I shall refer to the bills as the FMA Bill, the CAC Bill and the Auditor-General Bill respectively. After their first reading in the House, the minister successfully moved that the bills be referred to the JCPA for review, with an advisory report to be presented to the House by 23 August 1994. However, the breadth and detail of evidence presented to the committee forced it to request an extension to the reporting deadline. On 23 August, the House agreed to extend the reporting deadline until today. Members will be aware that, on 28 June this year, Senator Robert Ray gave notice of a motion in the Senate to establish a joint standing committee to be known as the Audit Committee of Parliament. On 29 June, the Senate agreed that the proposed resolution for the establishment of an audit committee should be referred to the JCPA for inquiry. The Senate's motion of referral also requested the JCPA to give particular attention to the appropriateness of establishing a separate committee rather than conferring the functions of the proposed committee on the JCPA. The JCPA decided to combine its report on the three bills and the Senate's motion into the one report. Let me say from the outset that the JCPA has welcomed the opportunity to review the bills and consider the Senate's motion. The legislation to replace the Audit Act will the cornerstone of the Commonwealth's system of financial accountability, and the committee has taken its responsibility very seriously. We also acknowledge the spirit in which this legislation was referred to us by the Minister for Finance. The consideration of legislation by joint committees represents a new maturity in the way of making legislation. The committee's review has allowed many Commonwealth entities, and organisations outside government, an opportunity to comment on the bills before they become law. The committee received 65 submissions and held six public hearings with witnesses coming from as far afield as South Australia and Tasmania to give evidence. In addition, we spoke to the Controller-General of the United Kingdom, who happened to be visiting Australia at the time. The committee also invited the coalition, the Australian Democrats and all independent members and senators to forward their comments to the committee for consideration. The review process has been important and valuable. The committee believes that the constructive and bipartisan approach of all involved in the inquiry has led to recommendations that will enhance the quality of the legislation. Minister Beazley is to be congratulated on referring the legislation to the committee. As I mentioned earlier, we welcomed this opportunity. Before I detail some of the major recommendations made by the committee, I draw the House's attention to the JCPA's long involvement in moves to have the Audit Act replaced by more modem legislation. The Audit Act has been amended many times since 1901. However, despite the amendments and the flexibility provided through the extensive use of delegated legislation, the basic structure of the act has been unable to accommodate the demands of modem public sector management. The first recommendation made by the JCPA in its 1989 report on the Auditor General entitled Report 296: The Auditor General: ally of the people and the parliament-reform of the audit office was that the form Audit Act be repealed and replaced with legislation that allowed more effective and flexible financial management. This recommendation was accepted by the government in 1989. Thus the ]CPA has welcomed the introduction of these bills. I shall now focus on the committee's major recommendations on a bill by bill basis. The FMA Bill establishes an appropriate structure for financial management and accountability within Commonwealth agencies, and the committee has made only two minor recommendations for change. Recognition of the need for quality management has underpinned many of the recent public sector reforms. Unfortunately, the current legislative framework for financial management within the Commonwealth has not kept pace with these developments. The FMA Bill proposes to overcome many of the deficiencies in the current Audit Act. The committee is heartened to see the balance that has been struck between the devolution of authority to the chief executives of agencies and the need for a counterbalancing chain of accountability back to the parliament. I now turn to the CAC Bill. At present, the accountability requirements for Commonwealth authorities and companies are scattered through numerous enabling acts, company memoranda and articles of association. The CAC Bill draws these together in a single set of core reporting and accountability requirements. The committee welcomes the introduction of the CAC Bill, principally because it will enable parliament to view the accountability requirements of the vast range of Commonwealth authorities and companies as a whole. Furthermore, it will ensure that the accountability requirements are explicit and consistent for each class of Commonwealth entity. However, a number of recommendations have been made to clarify the interpretation of clauses in the bill and make them more consistent with standards set by the Corporations Law. In particular, the committee believes that the obligations and duties of directors of Commonwealth authorities should be consistent with the requirements placed on the directors of private sector companies. A matter of concern to a number of witnesses appearing before the committee is the penalty regime established under the CAC Bill for breaches of duty by executive officers of Commonwealth authorities. The committee acknowledges that the penalty regime for executive officers in the CAC Bill should not be so strict as to discourage appropriate people from sitting on the boards of Commonwealth authorities. Nonetheless, the penalty regime should also reflect the higher standard of duty and care that parliament expects of people undertaking public duty. Accordingly, the committee has supported the CAC Bill's penalty regime for executive officers who breach their duties but has recommended that the bill be amended to allow relief from prosecution in cases where there are extenuating circumstances. The Auditor-General Bill defines the powers, functions and role of the Commonwealth Auditor-General. The JCPA welcomes the introduction of the Auditor-General Bill and supports the principles behind the legislation. In particular, the committee welcomes the fact that the Auditor-General has been given an unambiguous mandate to audit the financial statements of all Commonwealth entities and almost as extensive a mandate to conduct performance audits. The decision to establish the AN AO as a statutory agency is also a positive step. However, the committee believes that the bill, as proposed, represents a limitation on the parliament's capacity to make informed assessments about the efficiency with which taxpayers' money is being used by government business enterprises. Clauses 14 and 15 of the bill only allow the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of GBEs at the request of both houses of parliament by resolution or at the request of the responsible minister. Although the bill does allow parliament to request a performance audit of a GBE, the committee believes that to require a resolution of both houses is cumbersome, time consuming and potentially impractical. It is important that there be easier mechanisms by which parliament can directly request the Auditor General to conduct performance audits of GBEs. The committee believes that the most efficient way of doing this is to delegate the parliament's authority to request a performance audit of a GBE to one of its committees. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the Auditor-General Bill be amended to allow an Audit Committee of Parliament to directly request the Auditor-General to conduct a performance audit of a GBE without the need to go through the responsible minister or both houses. The committee expects that this power would be exercised only rarely and after consultation with all parties involved, which would include the responsible minister. This is consistent with the second dot point concerning the duties of an audit committee. Furthermore, the priority for GBE performance audits would be those GBEs furthermost from the discipline of the market. Of course, the responsible minister and both houses of parliament should retain the right to request the Auditor-General to conduct a performance audit of a GBE. The committee has also recommended that the Auditor-General Bill be amended to allow the Auditor-General to negotiate the terms and conditions of staff of the Australian National Audit Office. As it stands, audit office staff continue to be employed under the Public Service Act 1922. This is consistent with one of the recommendations in the 1989 report of the JCPA, report No. 296. The committee has accepted that the Auditor-General's capacity to undertake his functions would be enhanced if he or she had greater flexibility to negotiate competitive remuneration packages. This should make it easier for the Auditor-General to attract and retain the highest quality staff. However, the committee believes that it should be possible to balance the Auditor-General's wish to have the freedom to determine competitive packages for ANAO staff with the requirement to protect their basic terms and conditions of employment. Accordingly, the committee has also recommended that the bill should include a proviso that the terms and conditions set by the Auqitor-General be consistent with government industrial relations and employment policies and the principles decided by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission from time to time. Furthermore, audit office staff should continue to be employed and appointed under the Public Service Act until such time as any new terms and conditions are agreed with staff. I now tum to the Senate's reference of the notice of motion for the establishment of an audit committee to the JCPA for inquiry. The government's interest in establishing an audit committee is particularly welcomed by the committee. The JCPA has long argued the need for an Audit Committee of Parliament and broadly supports the functions envisaged for an audit committee by the government. The notice of motion would create a separate Audit Committee of Parliament, a move proposed by the JCPA in 1989. However, the JCPA now considers that, for reasons of efficiency and effectiveness, the functions of an audit committee could be more appropriately conducted by the JCPA itself. The committee has come to this conclusion for several reasons. Firstly, the JCPA has a long history of liaison with the Auditor General. This has given the JCPA members a strong understanding of the issues affecting the Auditor-General and his office. Secondly, the JCPA has a statutory obligation to examine the reports of the Auditor General. JCPA members have developed a detailed insight into the Auditor-General's levels of activity and the efficiency with which they are carried out. With this information, the JCPA members are well placed to comment on the Auditor-General's proposed levels of future activity. Thirdly, the JCPA already acts informally as a conduit for parliamentarians to indicate aspects of public administration that they would like the Auditor-General to examine. If the audit committee functions were added to its responsibilities, the JCPA would undertake this task on a formal basis. The committee does not believe it appropriate for Australia to follow the United Kingdom precedent, where the House of Commons audit committee and public accounts committee are separate. The reason for this separation in the UK is that the chairman of its public accounts committee is, by convention, a member of the opposition. A similar separation is not necessary in Australia, given that the chair of the JCPA is always a government member. However, the JCPA believes that it is highly desirable that an Audit Committee of Parliament have statutory recognition to give the necessary permanence to such an important committee. The committee believes that statutory recognition can be most appropriately achieved by amending the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951. This act details the membership, duties and functions of the JCPA and should be amended to give the JCPA the additional powers to perform the functions of a parliamentary audit committee. The JCPA believes it is important that the JCPA's function as an audit committee should be clearly distinct from its traditional functions. To clarify the distinction, the JCPA believes that the Public Accounts Committee Act should require the JCPA to convene as the Audit Committee of Parliament when performing audit committee functions. It is also important that minority parties and Independents should be represented on the audit committee. This is most appropriately achieved by increasing the membership of the JCPA by one and reserving the extra position for a representative of any minority groups or Independents in parliament. The committee believes that these recommendations will give the parliament a strong and efficient audit committee that will strengthen the links between the Auditor-General and the parliament. In conclusion, I believe that the review process that has culminated in this report has been valuable and conducted in a constructive spirit. The legislation and the notice of motion to establish an Audit Committee of Parliament combined represent a landmark package aimed at improving the framework of Commonwealth financial administration and strengthening the accountability of the public sector to parliament. I believe the committee's recommendations will further enhance this package and lead to even more accountable and efficient public sector management. I look forward to the government's response to our report and to the upcoming debate on the bills. I would like to express my personal thanks to all those members and senators on the committee who have given so much of their valuable time to this review. It has been quite an extensive inquiry in the short time we have had and I really do appreciate the efforts that they have all put into their duties as members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I would like to thank the officers of the Department of Finance and the Australian National Audit Office who have assisted the committee, both formally and informally, in the course of the review. The committee also wishes to express its appreciation to all the other individuals and organisations that prepared submissions and appeared as witnesses before the committee at such short notice. The staff of the House of Representatives printing unit should also be thanked for their efforts in getting the report printed for us in time. Finally, on behalf of the committee, I would like to express our appreciation of the work done by all the staff of the committee secretariat during this review. They always work extremely hard and do a tremendous job; they put in a lot of extra work above and beyond the duty that we would normally expect of them. In particular, I thank Laura Gillies, Donna Christophers, Lorraine Partridge, James Catchpole and, of course, our secretary, Grant Harrison.",11
5,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEES,"by leave-As Vice-Chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts, I welcome this opportunity to comment on the 331st report, which is an advisory report on legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901. On the same day that the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) introduced a package of three bills-the Auditor-General Bill 1994, the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994-the Senate agreed that the proposed resolution for the establishment of an Audit Committee of Parliament should be referred to the JCPA for review. Report No. 331 combines the committee's review of the bills with the Senate's motion into one. I wish to focus my comments on the Auditor-General Bill and the role of an Audit Committee of Parliament. In particular, I will stress the importance of the role of the Auditor-General and the benefits that parliament can gain from having an effective audit committee. The Auditor-General and the audit office are fundamental to parliament's ability to keep government officials and instrumentalities accountable for the efficient and effective expenditure of public moneys. To achieve this, the Auditor-General needs to have the ability and resources to comprehensively report to parliament on the financial management of the Commonwealth. It requires a mechanism to ensure that there are clear channels of communication between the Auditor-General and the parliament. Furthermore, for the Auditor-General's audits and reports to be accepted as valid, it is essential that the Auditor-General should not be subject or suspected of being subject to pressure from the executive or the legislative arms of government to report in one way or another. For this reason, the Auditor General also needs statutory recognition of his or her theoretical or practical independence. The committee has broadly supported the Auditor-General Bill as it gives the Auditor General an unambiguous mandate to audit the financial statements of all Commonwealth entities and almost as extensive a mandate to conduct performance audits. It also gives parliament a limited role in the appointment of the Auditor-General and establishes the ANAO as a statutory authority. However, the committee has reservations about several aspects of the Auditor-General Bill. The main concerns focus on the way the biII restricts the Auditor-General's mandate to conduct performance audits of GBEs, makes no provision for the Auditor-General to set terms and conditions of ANAO staff and gives no recognition to the role of an Audit Committee of Parliament. One of the committee's major concerns is that the bill as proposed limits the capacity of the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of government business enterprises. Clauses 14 and 15 of the bill only allow the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of GBEs at the request of both houses of parliament by resolution or at the request of the responsible minister. The committee is concerned at the effect that this has on parliament's awareness of the operations of GBEs. The committee accepts that generally GBEs should operate at arm's length from government and the parliament, and that a GBE's performance should be judged on its capacity to achieve results in a commercial environment. Nevertheless, the committee believes that parliament has a right to be informed of the activities of all Commonwealth entities, including GBEs. As the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), has explained, the committee has recommended that, for the sake of efficiency, parliament delegate its power to request the Auditor General to conduct a performance audit of a GBE to a parliamentary committee-namely, the proposed Audit Committee of Parliament. Parliament would retain the right to request a performance audit by way of resolution. In this way, parliament will have a much more effective input into determining whether a GBE should be subject to a performance audit. After the three bills were tabled in the House on 29 June 1994, the Auditor-General tabled report No. 43 of 1993-94 entitled Parliament s right to know: Legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901, which detailed his response to the provisions of the Auditor General Bill in particular. One of the major recommendations made by the Auditor General was that the Auditor-General BiII should be amended to provide the audit office with the authority to establish appropriate terms and conditions for the employment of staff. Audit office staff are currently employed under the Public Service Act 1922, and this arrangement will continue under the Auditor General Bill as it currently stands. The chairman also referred to this matter in his remarks. The Auditor-General argues that he needs to be able to set terms and conditions for his staff that are competitive with their private sector equivalents and that would give him or her the flexibility to meet changing requirements. The committee believes that the Auditor General is in a unique position in the public sector, given his or her role in strengthening the accountability of the executive to parliament and improving public sector efficiency. To assist him or her to undertake this function, the Auditor-General needs the assistance of the highest quality staff. The committee believes that the Auditor-General's capacity to undertake these functions would be enhanced if he or she had greater flexibility to negotiate competitive remuneration packages. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the Auditor-General Bill be amended to allow the Auditor-General to determine the terms and conditions of audit office staff. However, the committee is aware of concerns that the terms and conditions of staff would be eroded if staff were no longer employed under the Public Service Act. Accordingly, the committee recommends that the terms and conditions set by the Auditor General must be consistent with government industrial relations and employment policies and principles decided by the Industrial Relations Commission from time to time. We also recognise that the process of establishing the terms and conditions of audit office staff is likely to be a complex and lengthy process involving negotiation between the relevant parties. For this reason, the committee recommends that audit office staff should continue to be employed and appointed under the Public Service Act 1922 until such time as new terms and conditions are agreed with staff. Another recommendation made by the Auditor-General is that former auditorsgeneral should not be able to take up further employment in the public sector. The Auditor General is concerned that there could be seen to be implications for the independence of the Auditor-General if an Auditor-General is reliant on the executive for future employment when his or her term of appointment is completed. The committee acknowledges that the position of Auditor-General is unique and has a special place within the system of government. However, inclusion of such an amendment to the bill would prevent a former Auditor-General from making a further and valuable contribution to Commonwealth administration. Accordingly, the committee believes that there should not be restrictions on former auditors-general seeking offices of profit under the Crown. The committee is also concerned that parliament is not adequately involved in the process of appointing the Auditor-General. The bill requires auditors-general to be appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the responsible minister. Before stage, the minister must consult the Minister for Finance, a nominee of the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, and the chairman of the JCPA. The committee agrees that parliament should have greater involvement in the appointment of the Auditor-General. In the committee's view, it would be preferable if representatives of parliament were given the right to veto a nomination for Auditor General. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the appropriate minister must seek the approval of the JCPA, an Audit Committee of Parliament and the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, or his or her nominee, before making a recommendation to the Governor General. The committee does not believe it is necessary that the finance minister be mentioned in the process, as it can be assumed that the finance minister will be consulted in the normal decision making process. I tum briefly to the functions and composition of an audit committee. The honourable member for Oxley has already outlined the additional functions that the JCPA envisages for an audit committee and why the JCPA has recommended that the functions of an audit committee should be conducted by the JCPA itself. I would like to stress three principles about the Audit Committee of Parliament that have arisen from the JCPA's recommendations. Firstly, the JCPA believes that it is highly desirable that an Audit Committee of Parliament have statutory recognition to give the necessary permanence to such an important committee. The JCPA, as has already been discussed, recommends that this be done by way of amendments to the Public Accounts Committee Act. Secondly, the JCPA believes that its function as an audit committee should be clearly distinct from its traditional functions. For this reason, the JCPA has recommended that the JCPA convene as an Audit Committee of Parliament when performing audit committee functions. Thirdly, the committee believes that minority parties and Independents should be represented on the audit committee. This can best be achieved by increasing the JCPA's this membership by one and reserving the extra position for a representative of any minority groups or Independents in the parliament. These recommendations will provide parliament with a strong and efficient audit committee that will strengthen links between the Auditor-General and parliament. In conclusion, the committee believes that parliament needs a strong Auditor-General with adequate powers and resources to carry out his functions. I believe that the committee's recommendations in to to will enhance the quality of the Auditor-General Bill 1994 and strengthen links between the Auditor-General and the parliament. The end result should be a more efficient and accountable public administration. I add my thanks to Grant Harrison and his team on the committee secretariat, who performed their duties admirably in a process that was strictly limited by the amount of time we had to review this report.",15
6,Mrs EASSON,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I am pleased to be speaking on the tabling of this report, which is an advisory report from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. As previous speakers have pointed out, it deals with a combination of three bills and the proposal to establish an Audit Committee of Parliament. As the chairman of the JCPA has already given a substantial overview, I will confine my remarks to the Auditor-General Bill 1994. This bill seeks to more closely define the powers, functions and role of the Commonwealth Auditor-General. The Auditor General's functions include auditing the financial statements of all Commonwealth agencies, authorities, companies and relevant subsidiaries. Performance audits are also the responsibility of the Auditor-General. Until this bill, the Audit Act has enabled the Auditor-General to hold office for any length of time subject to retirement at the age of 65. This bill establishes a term of office up to seven years. This gives flexibility government and allows for the appointment of a person for a lesser time should that be the arrangement between the government and the desired appointee. With this flexibility there exists the possibility of suitable candidates from private industry being able to be appointed. The public good is served by mixing the administrative cultures of both the Public Service and private industry. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts has spent a considerable time on the question of the appointment of the Auditor-General. The final say is in the hands of the government. But this bill requires that consultation shall be had with the Leader of the Opposition and the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. This consultation process is to be encouraged not only for the position of Auditor-General. Members will be aware that in the United States Congress the appointments to very senior positions, such as Auditor-General, are preceded by public hearings and questioning of the nominee by an appropriate congressional committee. This is a useful method for involving the legislature in the major appointments of the executive. Perhaps members of parliament should give some consideration to looking at the American system. This committee hearing system for senior appointments is especially correct for the position of Auditor-General, as there has been some discussion on whether or not the Auditor-General should be an officer of the parliament. Some people may see the consultation mechanism of this bill as being inadequate. Even with consultation, the system is very heavily weighted towards the executive. Ultimately, the government could consult with everyone in parliament and end up doing as it wanted. The House should remember that the Auditor-General is part of the accountability mechanism which parliament uses to hold the government accountable. With this fact, the House should look carefully at the question of the Auditor-General being an officer of the parliament. In discussion on this matter, it was proposed that one approach could be to of allow the parliament or its representatives to to the veto a nomination for appointment to the position of Auditor-General. It would be possible to confer the right of veto over an appointment by making the instrument of appointment a disallowable instrument. Another way would be if representatives of the parliament were given the right to veto a nomination for Auditor-General. Examples of this practice can be found in the New South Wales and United Kingdom parliaments, where the chairman of their respective public accounts committees has such a right. Members should be aware that, in the United Kingdom, the chairman of the committee of public accounts is a member of the opposition. This situation, allied with the existence of veto power, results in the appointment of an Auditor-General who enjoys the confidence of both sides of parliament. This is a desirable situation. The committee also discussed the question of the Auditor-General's remuneration. This bill will alter the way that the Auditor General is paid. Currently, the Auditor General's remuneration is pegged with the second tier of remuneration of departmental secretaries. This bill will now have the Auditor-General's remuneration determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. I suggest that this is not before time. A case can be made that it is necessary that the Auditor-General be paid at the level of those officers who are being audited. The committee's view generally recognised the importance of the office of the Auditor-General and thought it appropriate that this matter be dealt with as a specific case by the Remuneration Tribunal. In dealing with this bill, the House should emphasise the independence of the Auditor-General and take steps to enhance that position.",18
7,Mr VAILE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I want to make a few brief remarks about report No. 331 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. It is interesting to note that the committee, which is a joint standing committee with representatives from most political parties in the parliament, has been given the opportunity to comment on three very important bills being proposed. Those bills are going to have a profound effect on the way the Commonwealth's operations are run, particularly through its commercial enterprisesGBEs and the like. The Auditor-General Bill will have an effect on their accountability. It was timely that we were given the opporthe tunity to review the proposed legislation, because one of the sectional committees of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is welcome. currently coming to the end of an inquiry into the efficiency and effectiveness of government business enterprises. The report on that inquiry will be presented later this year. JCPA's report No. 296, which some time recommended a number of changes, was recommended probably one of the instigating factors in three bills being brought forward. It is relevant to comment on a few areas the chairman's foreword in report No. 331. says: The Committee believes that the Financial Managemendations ment and Accountability Bill will establish an appropriate structure for financial management accountability within Commonwealth agencies the Committee has made only two recommendaregardless tions for change. I think it would be fair to say that, during the deliberations of the committee, we reduced the number of recommendations we made for change. The foreword goes on to say: The Committee supports the underlying principles of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill and believes it is important to establish consistent reporting and accountability requirements for Commonwealth authorities and companies. There are a few recommendations in that regard. Most importantly, it says: The Committee also broadly supports many of the provisions in the Auditor-General Bill. However, the Committee has recommended that Parliament be given greater opportunities to request the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of Government Business Enterprises ... There are also a number of other recommendations. The committee consulted very broadlyon these bills with a lot of government business enterprises and government departments. Some people who gave evidence and who gave the committee submissions expressed some concern that there may have been a lack of consultation by the Department of Finance in doing its research before putting the bills together. We highlighted in the report that the responses we got from some government departments were less than satisfactory. Notwithstanding that, generally it has been a very good exercise. It has given members of opposition the opportunity to have input into the finalisation of legislation before it is debated in the parliament, which we certainly It is important to highlight a couple of the recommendations with regard to the Auditor General and the audit committee. As the The parliament would be aware, report No. 296 ago recommended-and it has subsequently been in other reports that have been the tabled-that the Auditor-General become an officer of the parliament. I think it is importof ant that the Auditor-General not only be It totally independent but also be seen to be totally independent. This issue was debated and discussed at length. Some of the recomin report No. 331 do not go that and far but certainly move in that direction. I and think it is important that we recognise that, of which side of the House we sit on. We had numerous discussions with all different sorts of bodies, including public accounts committees from other countries. The recommendation that is pertinent to the Audit Committee of Parliament is recommendation 37, which states: The Public Accounts Committee Act of 1951 should be amended by inclusion of a separate section empowering the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to perform the functions of the Audit Committee of Parliament. The amendment should: (a) change the name of the Committee to Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (b) list the functions to be performed by the JCPA when convening as the Audit Committee of Parliament and (c) confer the same powers and privileges to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts when carrying out its audit committee functions as when carrying out its traditional duties. Recommendation 39 states: Section 5 of the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 be amended to increase membership of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to 16 members. The Act should state that the extra position is to be reserved for a parliamentarian nominated by any minority groups or independents in the Parliament. If no such person exists, then the position should be filled according to the practice of the Parliament at that time for joint committees. It is important to note that we do receive all the audit reports from the ANAO now for review. The committee is established, and the view of the committee is that we do not believe it would be wise to establish another layer, another committee, above what is there now. The function can be easily fulfilled by the committee that exists. Certainly under the proposal in the current bill we suggest amendments to that clause. The positions that are there would logically be filled by nominations from the opposition and the government, by the members who are already on the public accounts committee now anyway. We urge the government to be cognisant of those facts and of the work the committee has done. In closing, I pay tribute to the staff of the secretariat, led by Grant Harrison, and the work they have done in getting this together and getting it ready. It is difficult to deal with a bunch of politicians who are spread right across Australia and get a consensus view on things. The secretariat has done an excellent job. We commend the recommendations in report 331 to the government and trust that it will take those on board in its deliberations and hopefully make the necessary amendments.",19
8,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I endorse generally the comments that have been made by the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), and by other members who have spoken in connection with the tabling of this advisory report on the three draft bills concerned with financial management and audit and on the proposal for an Audit Committee of Parliament. I also endorse generally the sentiments which have been expressed by them in relation to this matter. I want to concentrate my comments more on process rather than content. It was only at the end of June of this year that the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) referred the three draft bills to the public accounts committee. A motion which was in the process of being considered by the Senate concerning the possible appointment of an audit committee was also referred to the committee. The committee chose-as the chairman indicated-to deal with the three bills and the Senate motion at the same time. When the minister referred the bills to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for review, he emphasised that the bills were concerned generally with financial management and accountability. That initiative by the Minister for Finance represented a significant development. I believe the Minister Beazley should be commended for deciding to undertake this process. To my knowledge, this is the first exercise of this kind which has been undertaken by a minister, certainly in this House, in referring to a statutory committee of the parliament, consisting of members of all major political parties and of both houses of the parliament, the House of Representatives and the Senate, questions of this kind to review draft legislation which has been prepared by the government and, as was indicated in response to us by Dr Michael Keating, the Secretary to the Treasury, items of legislation which had clearly been examined in detail and carefully prepared. The minister, in his speech referring the bills to the public accounts committee, likened this process to providing an exposure draft. He also said that the matter required 'decent handling' by the parliament. In concluding those comments at that time he also said: As I have indicated, virtually by implication things that I have been saying, the government is not so proud of its authorship in this regard is going to take umbrage at getting additional advice from any sources and we look forward to the consultative processes yet in hand. That was probably the most significant, most important paragraph in the minister's contribution. Mr Les Scott-Hear, hear!",20
9,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"The chairman of the public accounts committee endorses that comment. That paragraph indicates that the minister was genuine. He referred the bills and in effect said to the committee, 'Make your recommendations.' This is a very important initiative as far as the operation of this parliament is concerned. In effect, the minister, by that decision, has injected a new process into the procedural continuum by which legislation is prepared, considered and enacted by this parliament. The usual players in that process are: the ministers and their immediate advisers, operty. ating within the context of a general framethe work of government policy; the bureaucracy, working with the minister and essentially preparing legislation to satisfy his and the government's policy objectives; parliamentary counsel to make sure that the legislation is appropriately constructed and phrased; viduals and groups who are consulted in that process; the government's own policy comestablished, mittees; cabinet; and then, finally, the undertaken. government's full caucus, which then has the responsibility for giving approval for the legislation to be introduced into this chamber. It is only at that stage that, in the past, opposition has been given a formal opportuniresponsibility. ty to become involved in the process. That has been in the past. This represents a very significant departure from that past practice. The minister, by this decision, has sought to involve all of the parliament in the cess-both government and opposition, both the House of Representatives and Senate, and all of the major political parties within institution in what effectively has become a new, pre-debate stage in the preparation and consideration of legislation. I emphasise that it is only a competent and in the confident government which could deliberately choose to pursue that course. This governthat it ment is such a government. This government and the minister by this process are showing respect for this institution of parliament and are giving evidence of a respect for and recognition of the contribution members can make through the structures of the parliament, which in this particular case is the public accounts committee, to the construction of good legislation. The number of recommendations-there are 39 in total, but not all of them are suggesting amendments to the draft legislation-should not be taken as renecting un favourably on the quality of the draft legislation. To my mind, the draft legislation is good, solid legislation. It is progressive, it is innovative and it is responsive to the need for reform in these areas with which it is concerned. Those three draft bills modernise and consolidate the important elements of government financial management and accountabiliThat was referred to by the chairman of committee in his tabling speech when he said that, in effect, they bring together regulations, memoranda, procedural principles and different items of legislation from a whole range of agencies and authorities as well as the core legislation which they will replace. indiTo my mind, this is the first time since Federation, when the federal Audit Office was that such an exercise has been However, in that context, Minister Beazley charged the public accounts committee with the task of reviewing that draft legislation. the We have done our best to discharge that I give credit to all of the members of that committee, particularly those who found it possible to participate fully in this inquiry. All of those members. I am talking about members from the opposition proand the government, members from the House of Representatives and the Senate, members from the three major political parties reprethis sented in this place-who participated made a genuine and bipartisan approach and applied a diligent level of effort to that consideration. I particularly want to commend the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Oxley. He is an outstanding chairman of the public accounts committee. He chairs the committee with tact and is able to encourage the best responses from members. He is ably supported by the deputy chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay). Mr Bevis-Another good Queenslander.",21
10,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"As the parliamentary secretary at the table reminds me, he is a good representative from Queensland and a member of the Liberal Party. He is also a good deputy chairman. So we have a good team. I also want to extend that commendation to a very professional and competent secretariat. In particular, I want to mention Grant Harrison and James Catchpole, who were the principal officers of the secretariat involved. I also want to commend all of their colleagues, four of whom have accompanied Grant here to listen and be available if we need them for final advice. We are very well served in this place by officers of the parliament. The secretariat's contribution was simply outstanding. As the honourable member for Fairfax pointed out, we have been charged with this responsibility only since June, and here is the report. There were many occasions when evidence was brought before the committee on which I did not feel confident to make a judgment, but the secretariat, because of its expertise, was able to show us where, in some cases, the evidence was in error or where it just represented simple confusion. The quality of this report depends greatly on people such as Grant and his colleagues. Mention has been made of the audit office, the Department of Finance, individual people, organisations, businesses, authorities, government bodies and departmental officers involved. All of them made a collective contribution to a very valuable and, indeed, essential exercise in the development of this report. We examined a large number of issues. I will not canvass them. My colleagues on the committee have already canvassed some. We will hopefully have the opportunity to look at some of those issues in more detail when the actual legislation is being debated here in the chamber. Apart from commenting on the three draft bills, I just want to refer to the question of whether or not there should be a separate audit committee. I think not. As the member for Fairfax and his colleague the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) have indicated, the audit committee would very likely consist of essentially the same people who are on the public accounts committee. There were, I believe, good reasons why the suggestion was made that a separate audit committee should be established. I think the case we have made in that report more than adequately disposes of those points. I hope the government considers those as closely as we expect it to consider the others. I am sure it will. We examined a number of possible models to allow the public accounts committee to convene as an audit committee. The one we came down on the side of resulted from very close consideration of the various options we had identified. I emphasise the point that I opened with. This process is a significant departure from what we have done in the past. I know the government would not have referred this draft legislation to us unless it wanted us to genuinely respond to it. We have genuinely responded. I know the government will give every consideration to those recommendations. It may be that the government cannot agree with them all. The recommendations have been unanimously endorsed by the· members of the committee. I accept the discipline necessary for the effective operation of political parties in this institution, which is the most important core of our whole liberal democratic framework in this country. The discipline of parties is essential. The government, having given honest and serious consideration to that report, will determine its position. It will do that through the normal forums and processes of the government. I will endorse that position. We all have to respect, understand and recognise that position. If we cannot understand, recognise and support that principle, then we may very well damage the motivation which lay behind that commendable decision by the Minister for Finance to refer those draft bills to a joint committee of this parliament. Public Accounts Committee",22
11,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present the following report: Report 332-the Australian Government credit card. Ordered that the report be printed.",23
12,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The public accounts committee is having a busy day. I thank my colleagues on the committee for their comments this morning in relation to the tabling of our previous report No. 331. I welcome this opportunity to table the 332nd report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which reviews two audit reports on the Australian government credit card. The first audit report was tabled in parliament in December of last year and a follow-up audit was tabled last June. Both reports attracted considerable public attention with occasional sensational articles appearing in the media. It was in this environment that the committee decided to review the credit card system and act, as it were, as the umpire. The committee considers that overall the Australian government credit card provides a useful purchasing tool for government agencies. However, there are areas at both the macro level, oversighted by the Department of Finance, and at the micro level, administered by individual agencies, where improvements can be made. Regarding the macro level, the committee recommended that responsibility for oversight of the credit card system should remain with the Department of Finance, as this fits well with Finance's role as administrator of the public account and overseer of financial management policy. Consequently, the committee does not support the Auditor-General's suggestion that the Department of Administrative Services be responsible for the management of the credit card system or be the sole supplier of training courses. At present, credit card bills are paid through a system of agency settlement accounts. Although there is evidence that the settlement account system is not working as well as it should be, the committee is not convinced that the system should be abolished. Instead, Report the committee considers that the current system should be made to work better. We have recommended that various options to improve the system should be developed, tested and trialled. At the micro level-the administration of credit cards by individual agencies-the committee has made several recommendations aimed at promoting tighter control. However, the committee found no evidence that the credit card system was subject to a greater level of fraud than any other method of payment. The current credit card contract expires in June 1995, and the committee considers it is opportune for the Department of Finance to obtain feedback from agencies concerning their experiences with the credit card with a view to incorporating improvements in the new contract. Finance should examine options for incorporating new product developments and improved statistical analysis and management reporting into the new contract. Also the contract should be flexible enough to enable the Commonwealth to take advantage of any product or technological improvements which may emerge over the life of the contract. The committee recognises that Commonwealth agencies operate in a devolved environment and are therefore responsible for administering the credit card system. Nevertheless, the committee considers that Finance, as the responsible central agency, should provide ongoing guidance and support to individual agencies to help promote the efficient and consistent use of credit cards throughout the Public Service. An example of the role that we believe Finance should play is to develop general guidelines on the appropriateness or otherwise of expenditure on items such as travel, hospitality, conferences and other staff related activities. I note that, until the Auditor-General decided to conduct an audit, the credit card system had not been evaluated since its introduction in 1987. Although the committee has not endorsed all of the Auditor-General's recommendations, I commend the audit office for focusing attention on this important issue. I believe that the work undertaken by the audit office has already resulted in significant improvements in the operation of the credit card system. I believe that our recommendations will produce still further improvements. I know that the JCPA's secretariat has been acknowledged today by other members, but I do not think we can thank those officers enough for their hard work and their usual draw attention. high standard of support for the committee members. I particularly want to thank Yolanda Campagna, Cliff Lawson, Ross Allen-who was with us for a while and came back on a couple of occasions to assist in finalising this report-John Carter, and secretary, Grant Harrison. I also thank staff in the House of Representatives printing unit who assisted us in printing this report promptly. I thank all my colleagues on the committee, especially the deputy chair of the committee, the honourable member for ant Fairfax (Mr Somlyay). I commend the report to the House.",23
13,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEES,"by leavements, Before I make a criticism of the use of credit cards, I want to make it quite clear that think both sides of the House would support the use of credit cards by government agendouble cies. The reason for that is that in the past governments have been notoriously slow paying their bills. Many members of parliaallowance ment have received complaints from constituthis ents in business who have had times for months and months before they are paid the smallest amounts. It is quite frustrattravel ing. This situation was brought home to many years ago when I worked for the then Minister for the Northern Territory. The secretary of the department, while driving from Darwin to Alice Springs on a familiariexpenditure sation tour, tried to buy some petrol with government voucher. The fellow at the garage said, 'No way, mate! Not in your life! I'm not waiting six months to be paid for a few gallons of petrol.' Credit cards overcome this problem. I think the Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland brought home to people the need for accountability, particularly with credit cards. Given the findings of Fitzgerald on the misuse of credit cards, I do not think anyone on the public payroll has any excuse not to know that the severest of penalties should apply to misuse of any Commonwealth funds. It is true that the committee received no evidence to indicate that the level of fraud associated with credit cards was greater than that associated with other methods of payment. However, there are two aspects to which I would like to The first is that credit cards are perhaps more open to fraud and misuse than any other means of payment. This is because the deciwho sion to purchase can be made by the card holder alone, and only after the payment has our been made are the agency checks activated. the This is in contrast with the cheque based system, where two or three people may be so involved before the payment is effected. The second aspect which is not covered in the report but which is nonetheless an importissue is expenses incurred by ministers and ministerial staff. The credit card is issued to ministers' offices by their home departbut when ministerial staff claim travel allowance they do so from the Department of I Administrative Services, a totally different agency. Thus there arises a real possibility of dipping-paying for travel related expenses on the credit card acquitted through in the home department and claiming travel from DAS. I have no evidence that has happened, but the system is open to to wait somethat sort of abuse. The issue of double dipping in relation to allowance has been addressed by one me of the committee's recommendations which advocates the use of the credit card for travel related expenses only where there are appropriate systems in place to check credit card against any travel allowance that a might have been paid. I think ministers' home departments should pay special attention to credit card expenditure by ministerial officers and liaise with DAS to make sure that double dipping does not occur. There is another aspect to be considered when ministers or staff use credit cards for accommodation or meals. I believe a fringe benefits tax liability could well be incurred. I believe agencies should monitor that carefully and make sure their obligations are met. I conclude by elaborating on a remark made by the committee chairman, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), concerning some of the more sensational reports in the media relating to unusual credit card transactions. The committee reviewed several of the purchases reported in the media-for example, expenditure on lingerie by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service for a patient undergoing hydrotherapy treatment; and the purchase of sunglasses, which caused quite a sensation and much media interest. The sunglasses were used by Australian troops engaged in United Nations peacekeeping operations in the Western Sahara. Expenditure of this type is clearly official and appropriate, although the fact that the legitimacy of these transactions was not immediately evident to the Auditor-General points to a deficiency in the audit trail. this sort of sensationaIised environment that the committee found itself in when it reviewed the audit reports. I think that, in supporting the use of the credit card, the committee has acted as a good umpire and should not allow itself to be innuenced by the roar of the crowd.",24
14,Mr VAILE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I want to make a short statement on report 332 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the Australian government credit card. I do not think anybody will argue against the benefits that accrue not only to Commonwealth departments in easing their operations but also, more importantly, to the people in the private sector that we deal with when settling the accounts of government purchases. The important elements in this report were highlighted by the Auditor-General. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), indicated, there was a certain amount of embellishment in some of the examples that were used in the auditor's report which, on inspection, were quite legitimate but they certainly made good reading in the national media for a few days. There were examples of larger items of expenditure and these made for good reading too. That scrutiny by the media also made for a bit more accountability and transparency in the process of the use of the Australian government credit card. A couple of the important recommendations in this report revolve around the education of the officers using the system, the issuing of the cards and the operation of the settlement accounts. Recommendation 2 of the report states: The Department of Finance should amend Finance Direction 30A to include specific reference to the need to ensure that appropriate initial and follow up training courses and procedures are in place on the use of Australian Government Credit Cards. That is very important. I think something like 16,000 or 18,000 of these cards are in use. To maintain control, and to maintain the level of knowledge of how these cards should be used, it is important we implement that process. Recommendation 3 states: It was All agency heads should ensure that: (a) training courses and procedures relating to use of Australian Government Credit Cards within agencies specifically target the requirements of new cardholders; high use cardholders; and Settlement Account administrators; These are the areas I want to touch on in my speech this morning. Recommendation 6 states: All agency heads should: (a) ensure that credit cards are issued on the basis of need rather than status; A very important element of the recommendations is contained here: the cards should be issued on the basis of need rather than status. Keeping in mind, on the one hand, the frequency of purchases of a particular department and, on the other, the fact that the private operator is providing a service or goods to the Commonwealth, the department should make sure that the accounts are settled within a reasonable time. Recommendation 8 states: All agency heads should: (a) ensure that Australian Government Credit Cards are used for travel related purposes only where there are appropriate systems in place to check against any travel allowance that might have been paid to the relevant cardholder and to check expenditure against entitlements; I know this point was raised by the previous speaker, the member for Fairfax, but it cannot be emphasised strongly enough that this be monitored, that the process-particularly in this area-be absolutely transparent and that there be accountability on those aspects. That is one area where many people in different states of Australia involved in government and the bureaucracy fell into a bit of a trap. This government should be very mindful of the pitfalls in that area concerning double dipping. The auditor highlighted that aspect as a possibility for abuse. The ministers and the departmental heads in charge of officers of the Commonwealth who have the use of an Australian government credit card should certainly watch for those pitfalls. The most alarming element in looking at the process of how a credit card is used; how the goods are charged; and how the statements come in, are checked and are passed on for payment concerned overdrawn settlement accounts, which were to the tune of $34 million during 1992-93. The system was not designed with the intention that settlement accounts be overdrawn. Anybody who has a private credit card, whether it is theirs or their spouse's, does not overdraw on it. The idea is to charge the goods and pay the account within one month so it attracts minimum interest. The banks would love such an overdraft. Part 2.14 of the report states: An ANAO survey of 419 Settlement Accounts for the month of May 1993 showed that about three quarters of them were out of balance after the May sweeping cycle. That means that after the time that those accounts should have been settled, 75 per cent of them had not been because the paperwork had not been done. The report continues: Of those out of balance, about two thirds were overdrawn, and one third overfunded. The total balance of overdrawn accounts was approximately $35 million, and approximately $1.3 million for overfunded accounts. The net overdraft balances of the Settlement Accounts averaged about $34 million during 1992-93. As I say, the system was never devised with the intention of those accounts being in that situation. When the cards are used, they should be at least square with the account when the reimbursement comes in. They should not be overdrawn. There is a challenge before the government. In progressing the educational process within departments about the use of the Australian government credit card, the challenge is there to make sure that the system works properly. The system is probably more cumbersome than the operation of a private credit card. But if the system is to work correctly and if the Commonwealth, and ultimately the taxpayers, are to get maximum advantage, we should ensure that the process is adhered to. As stated in the report, there is a challenge before the government. In closing, I acknowledge the hard work and diligence of the secretariat in putting this report together, and in assisting the committee in its deliberations on report 332. I certainly support the recommendations in the report and trust that the government will be cognisant of them. NA BILL 1994 Cognate bill: NA AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed from 21 September, on motion by Mr Lindsay: That the bill be now read a second time.",25
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"Mr Rocher)Order! Before the debate is resumed on this bill, I remind the House that it has been agreed that a general debate covering the Departure Tax Amendment Bill and the Departure Tax Collection Amendment Bill 1994 be allowed.",26
16,Mr BRADFORD,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"The Departure Tax Amendment Bill, together with the Departure Tax Collection Bill 1994, implements the government's decision announced in the 1994 budget to replace the existing departure tax with a passenger movement charge to achieve full cost recovery for customs, immigration and quarantine processing at Australia's borders and to achieve the cost of the issue of shortterm visitor visas. The cost of these services has been calculated at $27 per departing passenger. Today we are being asked to agree to this new system of collecting departure tax. We are also being asked to agree to the increase from $25 to $27 per passenger. To the extent that this is a budget bill, I understand the convention is that we will not oppose it. However, I want to say very clearly in my contribution to this debate that I am opposed to the continual imposition of new taxes on the tourism industry. I call this a because I notice the government prefers to call this a charge. The government has a history of calling taxes anything other than taxes. We have superannuation guarantee levies, training guarantee levies, and today we have the replacement of a departure tax with a passenger movement charge. But let us not be caught up in this. Let us not misunderstand the intention. We are talking about government revenue raising. We are talking about taxation. More importantly, from my point of view, we are talking about the taxation of the tourism industry. The tourism industry is very important to Australia. It has taken a long time for the government to realise how important tourism is to Australia. It is one of our greatest sourmany ces of overseas earnings, if not our greatest source-depending on how it is defined. The definition of the industry is of itself a problem. It is essentially an industry which earns export dollars for Australia, yet that has not been fully grasped. It is not digging things of the ground, cutting wool off the sheep's back or manufacturing and sending goods out of the country. Nevertheless, in effect it earns money for Australia by bringing tourists to Australia who spend their money here. It needs to be very clearly understood that the tourism industry is an export industry. The sooner we come to a full realisation of that, and come to grips with the implications of that, we will begin to treat the tourism industry as the important contributor to the Australian economy it really is. Tourism is the lifeblood of my Gold Coast based electorate. In 1992-93 the Gold Coast had almost two million domestic visitors and just over 500,000 overseas visitors. Those two groups of visitors combined spent almost 14 miIlion visitor nights on the Gold Coast. Tourism is very important to Australia, particularly to my electorate. The taxation impact on this industry is an important element. Today we are being asked to agree to a further imposition of tax on the tourism industry. That is contrary to the interests of an industry which is important to Australia. The total tax collected from tourists leaving tax Australia will be $140 million-not only from domestic tourists leaving Australia but also from foreign tourists leaving Australia. The effect of this measure on the cost to a tourist coming to Australia might be considered fairly marginal. But, in the end, how inelastic does the government think demand for tourism is? It obviously takes the point of view that it can continue to slug tourists who come to Australia in all sorts of ways. We are talking about the total taxes that visiting tourists have to pay. How far can we go before we reach the point where Australia is too expensive a destination? Our tourism industry is competing in a very competitive industry on a worldwide basis. We are attempting to attract tourists from Europe, Asia and America. And we are competing against other parts of the world that are equally concerned to gain as much benefit as they can from their tourism industries. There is no doubt in my mind that Australia has a fabulous product to sell. We ought not to undersell it. In many respects, we have out done that in recent years. We have undersold many of the wonderful attributes we have in this country. We have a marvellous tourism destination. I make no apology for saying that my electorate, the Gold Coast, is a worldclass tourism destination. That is not only reinforced by the number of Australians who go there-it is the most popular tourist destination for Australians-but also by the number of overseas tourists. The Gold Coast is certainly a world-class destination-not only because of what has been created there, with its attractions and its standard of accommodation, but also because of its marvellous natural environment, which we go to great pains to maintain. We have clean water that people can swim in, and we have a wonderful hinterland with national parks that border the Gold Coast. In that sense, it is a marvellous destination which we should not undersell. We need to be acutely aware that Australia is competing internationally for overseas visits. How far can we go in continuing to add costs to a ticket fare to Australia before we start discouraging people from coming here? Governments generally have always assisted primary industries. They have assisted mining and quarrying. They have poured money into developing our film industry. They have put money into research and development. Why? These are important industries to Australia. They are industries which have generated export earnings for Australia. The tourism industry has received very little assistance from the government. The tourism industry does not want government handouts, and it is does not necessarily want subsidies. It wants to be recognised for what it is-an export industry-and to be treated equally with other export industries. The huge raft of taxes which are imposed on the tourism industry-industry specific taxes-put it at a considerable competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis other countries which do not tax their tourism industries in the same way. I challenge the government to treat the industry as it treats other industries. Let me mention the most glaring and obvious matter that came up in recent days. The government has been prepared to go to enormous lengths apparently to rescue the Australian National Line. The shipping line is losing a fortune for Australia. It has accumulated losses on its balance sheet of, I think, $180 million. It is broke, as the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) told us. It is not even worth selling. The government has done a deal with the shipping line that it has not done with anyone else in Australia. The employees, members of the maritime union, for the sake of helping to rescue the line-lam not sure exactly how this does that-will not have to pay income tax in the future. The people who work for the Australian national shipping line will be the only people in Australia who, for some reason or another, will be exempt from paying income tax. That is hardly equal treatment. In spite of the recession which this country has endured in recent years, the tourism industry has continued to grow. Also, let us not forget that it suffered very badly as a result of the 1989 pilots strike. I might coincidentally, for the benefit of government members, contrast the way the government handled the pilots strike with the way that it handled the recent strike on Australia's wharves. Mr Sharp-Chalk and cheese.",26
17,Mr BRADFORD,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"As the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Hume, who is at the table, says, it was like chalk and cheese. The Prime Minister of the day did everything he could to inflame the pilots strike. The cost of the 1989 pilots strike to Australia's tourism industry would have measured in billions of dollars. The pilots were not the mates of the government. Mr Hawke said that. He called them 'glorified bus drivers', which of course was insulting; it inflamed the whole situation. When it came to the wharfies strike, the government rushed in. It could not help itself. Mr Forrest-Their mates.",28
18,Mr BRADFORD,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"The government looked after its mates. It has looked after its mates with an enormous amount of taxpayers' money. The pilots strike cost the tourism industry in this country dearly. The worse affect was not so much on destinations like the Gold Coast but on some of the more remote destinations. The member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) is in the chamber. If he were to tell us about the pilots strike, he would say that it cost the tourism industry in the Townsville area enormously. The pilots strike went on and on and on. There was no rush to do a deal, as there was when the wharfies went on strike. What was the difference? The difference was that the wharfies were the mates of the government. The tourism industry is labour intensive. It provides many entry level jobs, both fulland part-time, for both men and womenparticularly young men and women. For that reason, it is important to Australia-not only as an export industry. There has been a lot of discussion about the impact of taxes on the tourism industry-taxes such as the training levy, the superannuation levy, the wholesale sales tax, and the fringe benefits tax, which has gone absolutely mad. It is a plethora of garbage that nobody can sort their way through. The fringe benefits tax has an enormous impact on the tourism industry and the hospitality industry. It has gone from the sublime to the ridiculous. The government suddenly found that it had this fantastic way of raising money. I recognise that a review of the fringe benefits tax is going on at this moment-and rightly so. The fringe benefits tax has impacted heavily on the tourism industry. We have payroll tax, land tax, stamp duty, capital tax. We are almost taxed out of existence in this country. This morning we are being asked to approve another tax, or 'charge' as the government prefers to call it. Mr Forrest-It is still a tax.",28
19,Mr BRADFORD,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"It is still a tax. It is an extension of the government's tax and spend budget, the strategy of which has totally failed anyway because the government's whole plan was underwritten by its plan to sell government or taxpayers' or Australian owned assets for the sake of raising money to meet its commitments. The government seems highly unlikely to be able to deliver on that plan. This departure tax is predicated on and justified by, from what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) has said in his second reading speech, cost recovery. Cost recovery is a new concept but, once again, it is one that governments have readily rushed into as a way of collecting more revenue. Another neat little trick used by governments to collect more money is the concept of 'user pays'. The concept of user pays is quite rational. But in this and many other cases at federal, state and local government level where there is this great commitment to user pays government has decided to measure the cost of a particular service and then, of course, how much per taxpayer it will cost to recover that-hence user pays has been introduced. But governments do not reduce their other revenue. That is where we are tricked into perhaps accepting that user pays is a good idea. It perhaps would be if it were applied consistently and if the result were that less tax was collected. But that is not the case with user pays. We are often tricked into accepting user pays, because it is a rational concept, without realising that very often the net effect is that we end up paying more not only for what the user charge is for but for what we were already paying for in the first place. The concept of user pays is one of those things which we might ultimately consign to the same category of ideas as those covered by the statement Gareth Evans made-it was something that seemed like a good idea at the gains time-but which come back to haunt us. That is now the rationale for a huge range of new charges, as I say, often on top of the existing tax regime. The departure tax of itself may not be too objectionable in the sense that governments have to raise revenue somehow; they are always looking at creative ways of raising revenue, just as taxpayers, through their accountants, are looking for more and more creative ways to avoid paying revenue. I suppose that is a battle that will go on forever. We introduced this departure tax concept back in 1978-79; it was then $10. But it was never entirely hypothecated, to use that technical term, on tourism promotion. Tourism promotion was part of the rationale for the departure tax, and that is a fairly appealing sort of a concept too-the concept of what is called, technically, 'hypothecation'. I believe that more money needs to be put into the promotion of Australia as a destination; we need to do that to remain competitive. I recognise that the government has consistently put more and more money into tourism promotion, and the Australian Tourist Commission does a very good job in using those funds. But we now have the potential for this new passenger movement charge, which will be hidden in the ticket price. Nobody will know they are paying it. Mr Forrest-Another consumption tax.",29
20,Mr BRADFORD,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"Yes, it is a consumption tax. It is like wholesale sales tax-it is a hidden tax. We found, when we tried to expose wholesale sales tax and replace it with a visible tax, that such a visible tax is very difficult to argue for. People actually prefer not to know about the tax. People have difficulty when we try to demonstrate that wholesale sales tax is a huge tax which collects billions of dollars; it is a consumption tax which applies to just about everything. So we are going to hide the departure tax now; it will become a hidden tax. But I guarantee that, whilst it is $27 this year, it will go up and nobody will know. It will go from $27 to $30; it will be $60 within five years, and nobody will know about it. I am not suggesting that the previous method of collection was not difficult and I am not even advocating that we continue with it. I accept that there has always been a better method of collecting this tax. It has always been difficult for people departing the country to find the cash they need. Often they will get to the immigration point and find that their ticket does not have its stamp. There have always been difficulties with departure tax, but the one endearing feature it had was that it was visibleMr Forrest-And honest.",30
21,Mr BRADFORD,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"And honest and upfront, and we all knew we were paying it. My concern with this particular tax is that it will be hidden. I have no doubt-and Australian people, who are not silly, will have no doubt-that the government will now use this charge not to pay for what the government and the parliamentary secretary in his second reading speech have said it would be paid for, and which added up to the $27. The minister made it quite clear that it would be used to meet the costs of customs, immigration and quarantine processing at Australia's borders and the cost of issue of short-term visitors visas. The government added up the costsincidentally, without justifying them-of all those services. It assumed that those costs were somehow status quo and based on efficient practices. But putting that argument aside, which is a whole new ball game, the government assumed the status quo, divided that by the number of people leaving Australia and came up with $27. That whole mechanism is flawed. That is what the government did with fuel excise when it was first introduced. The government said, 'How much does it cost to maintain Australian roads; how many motorists are there, and how many litres of petrol do they use? This is what the fuel excise will be.' It was 5c a litre, but what is it now? It is 30c a litre and it is hidden. Every time we go to the petrol pump, we are not paying to maintain the roads that we use; we are putting money into the government's coffers. That is exactly what the government will do when it increases this charge, as it inevitably will. We support this legislation because it is a budget measure. But I hope that, in the remarks I have made this morning, I have made very clear my objection to taxing tourism. It is an export industry, it deserves to be treated better and, until we treat it better, it will not be as successful as it has the huge potential to be.",30
22,Mr LINDSAY,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (11.06 a.m.)-in reply-I thank honourable members for their contributions to this debate. In particular, I thank the  Morris), a very distinguished former Minister for Transport, and also the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), an expert in this field. The honourable member for Fadden raised the issue of pre-sold tickets. That issue is not a difficulty for airlines. The Customs proposal is that, for pre-sold tickets, the Australian Customs Service will maintain booths as a transitional arrangement only. As airline check-in clerks identify passengers who have not paid the $27 charge, they will refer those passengers to the booth to do so. Yesterday in my second reading speeches I canvassed at length the respective details of these two bills. This initiative is a positive measure in favour of the promotion of the Australian tourism industry and also promotes at the time of departure greater efficiency with the payment of temporary visas and the recovery of other costs identified in my second reading speech. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Lindsay) read a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 31 August. Second Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Lindsay) read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole. Proposed new clause (by Mr Cobb) negatived: Page 3, after clause 13, insert the following clause: Exclusion from collecting charge ""13A. After section II of the Principal Act the following section is inserted: Exclusion from collecting charge IIA. (I) Provision (whether by regulation, instrument or any other means) must not be made for any International air operator to collect charge for any international flight which departs from Australia on or before 29 October 1995. (2) In this section: ""International air operator"" means a person, organisation, or enterprise operating, or offering to operate, an international on which passengers are, or are to be, carried; ""International night"" means a flight that passes through the airspace over the territory of more than one country.'."". Bill agreed to without amendment. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Lindsay) read a third time. CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 29 June. Second Reading",30
23,Mr LAVARCH,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill provides for the classification of films, publications and computer games. The agreement of the states and territories to the bill proceeding provides a unique opportunity, on a cooperative national basis, to make Australia's censorship laws more uniform and simple, with consequential benefits to the industry and the public. The bill is the Commonwealth's contribution to revising the current legislative structure in cooperation with the states and territories. When enacted, the bill will not be able to be brought into force until complementary state and territory enforcement legislation is enacted. The model state and territory legislation is currently being drafted. Australia's censorship laws are in an unsatisfactory state. They comprise regulations under the Customs Act 1901 which, among other matters, establish the Censorship Board and the Film and Literature Board of Review, a Commonwealth administered Australian Capital Territory ordinance, and state and territory legislation. For many years, the Censorship Board has performed the classification function for films under state and territory legislation. There are considerable difficulties in administering the current laws flight as they are unnecessarily complicated and not uniform. With this background in mind, the Australian Law Reform Commission was asked to report on how the laws could be simplified and made more uniform and efficient while preserving the cooperative nature of the current scheme. The commission presented its report on censorship procedure in 1991 and the bill has been prepared in consultation with the states and territories, following the recommendations in that report. Reflecting the cooperative nature of Australia's censorship laws, the bill is for a federal act for the Australian Capital Territory under section 122 of the constitution. The Australian Capital Territory self-government legislation reserved to the Commonwealth the power to classify material for censorship purposes. This was to ensure that a national censorship scheme was preserved. The bill will establish the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board and set out the procedures for classification. Classification decisions will be made in accordance with the national classification code and guidelines to help apply the code. Both the code and the guidelines must be agreed between the Commonwealth, states and territories. Under the new scheme, it is proposed that state and territory legislation will adopt, in enforcement laws, the classification decisions made under the Commonwealth act. It is the state and territory legislation that will, in effect, govern the submission of films, publications and computer games to the Classification Board for classification. It will also deal with the consequences, in the respective jurisdictions, of the different classifications given by the board to films, publications and computer games. In recommending the structure reflected in the bill, the commission observed that it accurately reflects and maintains the balance of responsibilities that has currently been arrived at between Australian jurisdictions. It also recognises that, in relation to the classifibill cation criteria and categories, the Commonwealth, states and territories are equal partners and that policy on these matters is derived from agreement between all jurisdictions. The commission noted that the benefit of the new scheme was that 'there will be a single procedure, avoiding the overlaps and duplications that presently exist, and the classifiers will derive their powers from a single source, removing the difficulty that they sometimes face now of conflicting legislation from different jurisdictions'. The new legislative scheme is an excellent example of cooperative federalism. For example, the bill will only apply by its own force in respect of the Australian Capital Territory. The extent to which classification decisions under it have effect in other jurisdictions is a matter entirely for the state or territory concerned. The Commonwealth and the states and territories have equal voting rights in settling the criteria and guidelines under which classification decisions are made. The states and territories are given the right to be consulted about appointments to the two boards, and the states and territories will receive a guaranteed share of the revenue from fees collected to assist with enforcement. In case all states do not agree to adopt the classifications under the Commonwealth act in relation to films, publications and computer games, the bill, in order to preserve a national scheme, makes provision for the states and the Northern Territory to confer functions on the Classification Board under their own legislation in accordance with an agreement between the Commonwealth and the jurisdiction concerned. The bill is essentially procedural in nature and reflects the current approach to censorship matters agreed by the Commonwealth, states and territories. Under the bill, material will continue to be classified on the basis of the principles that adults should be able to read, hear and see what they want, that children should be protected from material likely to harm or disturb them, and that everyone should be protected from exposure to unsolicited material that they find offensive. The also introduces a new principle, namely, the need to take account of community concerns about depictions which condone or incite violence, particularly sexual violence, and the portrayal of persons in a demeaning manner. Despite the unsatisfactory state of our current laws, Australia is at the forefront of other comparable countries in its approach to censorship matters. The basic approach adopted is to give adults sufficient information, through the classifications given to material and the consumer advice provided, to make an informed choice about what they want to see, hear or read and what material they allow their children to have access to. I was interested to note from a recent Australian Bureau of Statistics survey, commissioned by the Office of Film and Literature Classification, that significant use is made of the classification system by adults in selecting suitable viewing for their children and themselves. In relation to the content of the material to be found in the various classifications, I and my state and territory counterparts are welI aware of the genuine concern in some sections of the community about the amount of violence in films and the possible harmful effects this might have on children and some adults. Governments have already taken positive action to address community concerns. The measures include the tightening up by censorship ministers of the guidelines for the M and R classifications, the introduction of the new MA classification, and a stricter regime for the classification of computer games. The question of whether classification decisions reflect community attitudes and thereby enjoy general community acceptance is ultimately dependent on the individual and collective decisions of the people who constitute the two classification boards. There is a need, recognised by alI censorship ministers, to ensure that the board members who make the classification decisions on behalf of the community are, as far as practicable, broadly representative of that community. I have been paying close attention to the composition of the current boards in consultation with my state and territory colIeagues. To ensure that board members remain aware of community attitudes, the Censorship Board has, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, a continuing community consultation program which includes arranging for ordinary members of the public to come in and review films and indicate the classification and consumer advice that they would award to them. This is supplemented by research projects on community standards, the results of which are made available to board members. As to the provisions of the bill already mentioned that it establishes the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board. It also contains procedural provisions relating to applications, decision making, the notification of decisions and the review of decisions. As the government intends to establish the Office of Film and Literature Classification-which services the two boards-as a separate business unit, there are also standard financial and accounting provisions in the bill to achieve this end. Under the new scheme, the current compulsory classification of alI films and videos will continue. In relation to publications, the Law Reform Commission recommended that the current voluntary scheme be replaced by a partialIy compulsory scheme, and this is reflected in the bill. Under this scheme, publications wilI be classified by the new Classification Board and not departmental officers, as at present. A partialIy compulsory scheme is achieved by, in effect, requiring publications that straddle the category 1 restricted classification, which is the lowest classification for restricted publications, and the upper end of the unrestricted category to be submitted for classification. Failure to do so will be an offence under state and territory legislation. This should result in many more publications being submitted for classification. In addition, the bill will enable the director to calI in publications that fall within this class-which are called submittable pUblications in the bill-for classification. Failure to abide by the director's request wilI be an offence. The bill also includes provisions to enable the classification of computer games. An interim scheme to enable computer games to be classified was introduced earlier this year through amendments to the ACT Classification of Publications Ordinance 1983, which is administered by the Commonwealth. FolIowing the decision of the states and territories to not alI ow 'X' or 'R' classified computer games to be available, the bill makes no provision for these classifications. It also clarifies the definition of 'computer game' in response to anomalies arising from the interim scheme that have been brought to the attenitself, I have tion of the government. Under the current arrangements, fees are levied under state and territory legislation, collected by the Commonwealth and shared equally between the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory. The biII provides for the Commonwealth to levy classification fees in the future. In return for the states and territories forgoing their fee powers, and in recognition of their enforcement costs, it is proposed that they each receive the average of their share over the last five years-a total of $600,000 in 1994-95. This amount will be adjusted in future years by changes in the consumer price index. The bill will also enable the Commonwealth to increase, over several years, charges for classification services so that there is substanReform tial cost recovery. This will be done by introducing charges for new initiatives and increasing existing charges to reflect the cost of the service provided, thereby providing savings to the Commonwealth. These changes will not only fund the government's initiatives to address the community need for readily accessible classification advice but also enable the provision of a more efficient and timely service to clients. The biII, as introduced, was discussed at most recent meeting of Commonwealth, state and territory censorship ministers. As a result of the decisions taken at that meeting, and other matters that have arisen since the biII was introduced, the government will be moving some miscellaneous amendments to the bill. I believe that this bill represents a significant advance in an area which has a daily impact on the Australian community. It is a welcome cooperative initiative between all Australian governments. I commend the biII to the House.",31
24,Mr REITH,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"The coalition does not oppose the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1994, although we do have a number of concerns about it and its operation. My remarks today are necessarily brief because the bill has been sent to a Senate committee. I understand that that committee will provide a report to the Senate on or before 10 October 1994. The concerns of the opposition and other members of the Senate can be properly addressed in that forum. The coalition parties will therefore say more on this subject when the report is tabled in the Senate. In particular, I have no doubt that my colleague Senator Vanstone, the shadow Attorney-General, who has carriage of this matter on behalf of the coalition parties, will speak on the issue in the Senate in greater detail. As the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) said in his second reading speech, this bill is the product of a cooperative approach between the Commonwealth and the states and follows the examination of this issue by the Law Commission, which culminated in its publication of a report entitled Censorship procedure. The bill proposes to establish the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board and sets out the procedures for the classification of publications, films and computer games. Classification decisions will comply with the national classification code and guidelines, which help to apply the code. When enacted, the bill will not come into effect until complementary state and territory the legislation is enacted. I understand that model state and territory legislation is currently being drafted. There is a range of concerns which, as I say, I know will be given greater airing in the committee. Very briefly, the sorts of concerns include those which relate to bulletin boards. I understand that the amendments foreshadowed by the Attorney-General, of which we have received copies, delete the exclusion of computer bulletin boards from the definitions of 'computer game' and 'film'. According to the explanatory memorandum, it will be on this basis: while the Government has not made a decision on the regulation of material on computer bulletin boards, the removal of this exclusion will allow the Classification Board to classify material on computer bulletin boards should there be a future requirement ... to do so. This move would appear to include bulletin boards in the ambit of the bill, although the explanatory memorandum states that, under the biII, there will be no requirement to submit material on computer bulletin boards for classification until there is some compulsion to do so-for example, through a Commonwealth, state or offence provision. A representation we have had from PD Software Services claims that the previous exclusion of bulletin boards is unfair, because game sellers who sold their product via bulletin boards would not have the burden of the classification fee. One question is this: what is the situation now, taking account of the amendments? Hopefully, that question can be answered in the Senate's inquiries. There are other issues relating to the definition of 'computer game'. It may be that it does not include the soundtrack of the game. That may be a matter of some contention, depending on the nature of that material. Furthermore, I am told that the Video Industry Distributors Association has made representations concerning the exemptions in the definition of 'film'. It apparently contends that the exemptions-business, accounting, professional, scientific or educational-should be extended to include classical music and sport. There has apparently also been a representation from a firm called Brilliant Interactive Ideas concerning sex education products. It produces educational CD ROMs. I understand that it is concerned that its products would receive the R classification and, thus, would be unsuitable for students. It has apparently been advised previously by the Office of Film and Literature Classification that: ... each item of software that contains elements which may be contentious will be examined on its merits in terms of the classification scheme. The question is how this will sit with the bill's definition of 'computer game' or 'film'. Again, it is a matter that I believe is appropriately dealt with in the committee. I take the opportunity of moving from the particular to the general. I am pleased that it was in the second reading speech of the minister that, in principle, adults should be free to read, see, or hear whatever they choose. However, this principle must be qualified and subject to some restrictions in the interests of community standards, the safety of people and, in particular, the protection of children. Subjects such as child pornography, bestiality, sexual violence, incitement to drug taking, terrorist activity and exhibitions of extreme violence should be completely banned. People also need to be properly informed about the material which might be available to them, with suitable warnings to advise people of material which might be offensive or harmful, particularly to children. So an information campaign must be an important aspect of Australia's censorship laws. This framework, which has been established in this cooperative way, attempts to deal with that issue. Of course, in modem times, technological advances have made a lot more material a lot more available. Video material has presented a particular problem because of the easy access to it by children. I have four sons and my wife and I, like many parents, sometimes wonder when the younger ones are off to stay with one of their mates overnight whether or not the parents require the same high standards as we do. This bill brings about a responsibility on politicians and our legal system to ensure that we have a fair and balanced approach to the availability of the material. Members of the coalition have been concerned for some years now that out of the ACT, for example, the federal government allows the distribution of X-rated material. I have been the lower House representative for the shadow Attorney-General only since the resignation of Mr Andrew Peacock, but I have held the position of shadow Attorney-General once before. This was a major issue six or seven years ago, so I got out the Canberra Yellow Pages this morning to see where we were at on the X-rated video debate. I can tell the House that X-rated material must still be very much in distribution, because there is page after page of it advertised. Of course, a lot of X-rated material was advertised as mail order. I think this is an area where members of the federal government are out of touch with community opinion.",34
25,Mr COBB,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,It wimped out on it.,35
26,Mr REITH,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"It is more than that; it actually believed that that material ought to be available. Rather than failing to make a decision, it has positively continued to support the distribution of X-rated material to make Canberra the porn capital of Australia. Recognising the various points of view on this issue, I say to the minister at the table, the Attorney-General, that he is out of touch with community opinion. Whilst I hold out no expectation that he will move on that issue, he should. It reflects very poorly on the government's attitude to this issue. In looking at these issues, ultimately one has to go back to basic principles. I have outlined very briefly the libertarian principle that people ought to be able to see, read and hear whatever they choose, subject to qualification. Qualification is important because a fair bit of evidence suggests that there is or may be a link between the material that people see and people's conduct. For example, television may reinforce attitudes, if not create them. Television may sometimes trigger a violent response in a person who may have had a propensity for such violence. We have seen incidents over the years referred to as copycat effects. The Hoddle Street massacre in Melbourne was one. The Hungerford incident was an English equivalent, where the perpetrator of a violent crime was wearing a Rambo headband. No-one can prove causal links, but the advertising industry spends billions and billions of dollars every year as it believes that, through the medium of television and advertising generally, people's behaviour can be influenced. Particularly when it comes to children, I do not think that we as a society can ignore the sense that there may well on some occasions be a link. That places a responsibility on us in the legislature to ensure that we have a proper framework for the adoption of proper standards. The coalition does not oppose this bill. We want to see a proper framework established. As I understand it, the framework that is being established will also allow the states by their own act, inject into the system their own views where they have a differing view from the national scheme. In other words, we have a national scheme, but I understand from my reading that that will allow some diversity. Provided that can be done in an efficient way and not add confusion to the system unnecessarily, then that is appropriate. I wish to contrast the proud boast of the Attorney-General of his cooperative attitude to this legislation and establishing this censorship regime to the attitude the Commonwealth takes on other matters when dealing with the states. We often hear it said that these debates are all about human rights versus state rights. It is a very glib and easy thing to say but, of course, it betrays a much more substantial debate which is ongoing in Australian society; that is, the debate about who should make decisions, the debate about the distribution of power. When it comes to censorship decisions, a government of a state may have a different view from that which we in the national capital have. But it seems to me quite reasonable that we should have a system whereby-subject to some other considerations, but as a general rule-when people in a particular state have a particular view, their views can be reflected in their state parliament and in their local laws. I think that is a good idea. Not all wisdom resides in Canberra. That would not only give us a more diverse society but also go to one of the absolutely fundamental characteristics of Australian society-one which I hope will be stronger and not weaker in the future, and that is certainly my aim and, I believe, the aim of people on this side of politics-which is that we are trying to build in the future a more participatory system of government. We want people to be involved in government. I have been here for 10 years and I have great respect for all my colleagues. They are wonderful people and my policy is a very simple one: we love them all. But they do not always get it right. If we can have a political system where decisions are made by the people most affected by them, we will have a far better political system. It is very important that we have a cooperato, tive approach on a matter such as this. I welcome the attempts of the state ministers to ensure a cooperative system. It is in very sharp contrast to what the Attorney-General said yesterday when I asked him on a different matter-constitutional arrangementswhether or not he would consider it a live option for the Commonwealth, in establishing a republic, to actually put up a referendum to knock off a state's constitution against the wishes of the majority of its electors. Mrs Crosio-It has nothing to do with this bill.",35
27,Mr REITH,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"It has everything to do with it. It is a pity that the member does not appreciate how these issues are linked. If we are ultimately to have a society in which people are involved and where people no longer feel the great cynicism they do about politics, we should continue to work to have cooperative approaches and not the heavyhanded grab for political power which you people are so intent upon. I conclude my remarks by saying that the coalition does not oppose this bill. There are aspects of it which we believe deserve further consideration. We are pleased that the bill is therefore going off to a Senate committee. There will be an answer back within the first couple of weeks of October and I am sure that we will have some more things to say about the bill in the Senate at that time. In expectation of the amendments being moved, I say that we will not stand in the way of the amendments but may offer some further comments, including on those amendments, at a later time.",37
28,Mrs CROSIO,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (11.40 a.m.)-I am very pleased and very proud to stand in this House today and support the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill. My personal view is that the bill is very timely. I would like to say to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), that when one talks about the heavy-handedness of government one cannot with one breath say we should intervene in what the ACT government is doing as far as its censorship laws are concerned and then say that we should not intervene in the problems of Tasmania. I suppose what I am really saying to him is that you cannot sit on the fence, you cannot have a bite here and a bite there, and not be involved all the way. The bill before the House, in providing that legislative framework for the Australian Capital Territory, will form the centrepiece of national uniform legislation. Federal, state territory governments all have powers over censorship of films and publication. For its part, the Commonwealth has relied on the customs power derived from section 51 of our constitution for legislation to control the import of material which might prove offensive to the general community. But this division of power has developed a complex network of laws between the jurisdictions. Hardly surprisingly, shifts in community attitudes and increasingly sophisticated technologies have created a further overlay of problems for regulators. In recent years it has become apparent that a need exists for a national unified approach in this sphere. In formulating this legislation, our government has been guided by recommendations from the 1991 Law Reform Commission report, research findings of the Commonwealth Office of Film and Literature Classification, which is referred to as OFLC, a Senate select committee and the Standing Committee of Censorship Ministers. With variations on each other's findings, including that there is a high degree of public concern about the impact of video games on children, the gist of those groups' recommendations is that children should not have easy access to offensive, violent and sexually explicit material, that there should be a national c1assi fication scheme to overcome some of the difficulties and shortcomings in regulating certain aspects of computer technology, in particular, and that the provision of warnings relating to films and literature apply equally to computer games. Given the nature of the many games where players are able to participate actively, legislation to impose stricter classifications is relevant. Against that background, our federal government has acted, remaining mindful of the importance of maintaining a balance of responsibilities between jurisdictions. Our government has always been cognisant of the need to respect people's rights to freedom of expression and privacy. To be a responsible government, we must ensure that our children are protected from material likely to harm or to disturb them and that people are protected from exposure to unsolicited material that they may find offensive. But the mere and hint of censorship becomes very tricky indeed, invoking spirited and heated debate. It can be a particularly vexed issue, irrespective of the stance that one might take. Writers and playwrights find it difficult at times to get it right. Conveying their true messages is not always easy to do without offending somebody. Civil libertarians might note, however, that the argument these days is about more than just the reading of Lady Chatterley sLover. Some computer games involve serious depictions of violence, such as Knight Trap, where players seek to defend a group of college students from being molested and mutilated by a group of zombies or, another one, Mortal Kombat, where the player pushes the opponent off a ledge and impales him on a sharpened spike, having the option of electrocuting the opponent and then either ripping out the still beating heart or tearing off the head and holding it aloft with its spinal cord dangling. These are games that our children have available to them. Another very bad one is Custer's Last Stand, which involves the rape of American Indian women by uniformed soldiers. Often pornography centres on the hatred of women. It is not uncommon, therefore, to see women physically immobilised and abused, bound, trussed, gagged and mutilated. Little wonder that community concern has increased. Phillip Adams, who is renowned for his civil libertarian stance, was reported in the Age on 23 April 1994 as expressing dismay at the escalation of nastiness he sees in both popular media and in high art, especially in film, as technology goes on providing bigger and more convincing thrills. Sources from the video industry itself acknowledge a need for guidelines. Speaking on the ABC Lateline program on 14 June 1993, the managing director of Sega-Ozisoft, Kevin Burmeister, said: We've currently introduced censorship teams within our own organisation, but that's as an interim measure. We are hoping to work with the censorship authorities to make sure that we do develop that action that we are taking, but we are crying and looking for some guideline. That is from the people who put these games together. Video shop operators may complain that censorship rules will detrimentally affect business. So what? Conceivably though, the classification system may be the industry's only hope of continuing successfully in the face of such widespread public concern. Video games are pervasive. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures-again I refer to April 1994-commissioned by the Office of Film and Literature Classification of film, videos and computer games, reveal that, of households with children aged one to 12, 58.1 per cent of the children had watched a videotape and 46.4 per cent had played a computer game in the previous fortnight. In households that have 13to 17-year-olds, 54 per cent of the children had watched a videotape and 50.5 per cent of the children had played a .computer game in that previous fortnight. A high percentage of parents interviewed held serious reservations about the content of the games. Importantly though, that survey showed that a large number of adults used a classification system in selecting appropriate material for their children. Parents and guardians, I believe, are entitled to know what their children and young teenagers are watching or participating in. Consumer information is available on the packets of all kinds of other products, so why not on these goods as well? Research about community standards commissioned by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and the OFLC showed clearly that people wanted a clearer distinction between M and R classifications. Many people wanted a scheme which would advise what level of sex, violence or coarse language to expect. For television, 89 per cent of the population agreed with this statement while, for film and video, the figure was 87 per cent. Arguments on censorship have raged since Socrates' day between the libertarian and authoritarian perspectives. Contemporary arguments centre on the correlation between violent and sexually explicit material and the violence expressed. Critics of video games, I know, charge that many are violent, sexist out and racist, providing negative role models for children. A recent study by the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia indicates that teachers found that many of those video games encourage emotional detachment and promoted questionable values and unacceptably negative responses in real life situations-these are our children they talking about-of the shoot 'em down, bash 'em up ilk. We do not know how an adolescent's concept of sexuality is shaped while gazing at pornographic videos. In the past 30 years a number of psychologistsZillmann, Bryant, Malamuth and Donnerstein are the most prominent-have conducted hundreds of laboratory experiments into the effects of pornography. Overwhelmingly, this research has demonstrated that a diet of either violent or nonviolent but degrading pornography has a profound and negative effect on the sociosexual attitudes of our young population. It has also shown that male university students who are exposed to such kinds of pornography become desensitised to sexual brutality. They become more aggressive and callous towards women, more willing to believe that women are responsible for their own rapes, more tolerant of rapists, of rape fantasies in themselves, and so on. Many statistical indicators link the consumption of pornography and the commission of sexual crime. According to one study of 36 serial killers in the USA conducted by the FBI, 29 were attracted to pornography and incorporated it into their sexual activity, which included serial rape-murder. Another study of more than 35,000 sexual offenders conducted again in the USA by the Michigan Police found that in 41 per cent of all sexual assault cases pornography was involved in, just prior to or during, the act. A Chicago Police study found that pornography was incorporated in one way or another in almost 100 per cent of the paedophilia cases that they dealt with. Sexual serial killer Ted Bundy, executed in America several years ago, described reaching a point where pornography only went so far and wondering 'if maybe actually doing it would give you that which is beyond just reading or looking at it'. Such evidence may not be conclusive, but it surely must be of interest and concern to us, the legislators. Former head of the Australian Institute of Criminology, Professor Duncan Chappell, who chaired the 1990 study by the National Committee on Violence, says that the causes of violence are extremely complex and that are simple answers are not always available. The solution itself does not lie just in banning violent television programs, films, videos and video games outright but in helping our children become more discerning consumers. I believe the classification scheme contained in the bill before the House will assist us as parents to make informed choices about the games our children play and participate in and will certainly ensure that our children are not exposed to material deemed unsuitable. Under the scheme, computer games will be labelled in a general viewing category ranging from G to MA. Because of the nature of interactive computer games, the level of violence attracting an M rating in film and video would be likely to be rated MA in computer games. This is reassuring. Similarly, the computer game equivalent of a film that might be borderline between MA and R will now be covered by a Refused Classification rating. This legislation can work well and we must make sure it does. Cooperative agreements are in place, recognising that the Commonwealth and the states and territories are equal partners and that policy on these matters is derived from agreement between those jurisdictions. As has already been stated, the bill will not be brought into force until complementary state and territory enforcement legislation is enacted. As well, the new legislative scheme allows for a range of cooperative mechanisms between the Commonwealth government and the states and territories. These are: the appointments to the classification boards, voting rights, classification decisions and apportionment of revenue collected in-this is important-a flexible framework administered by each jurisdiction according to its particular needs. That the bill allows for continuing community consultation on the censorship board and for ordinary members of the public to be represented on classification boards, in line with the Australian Law Reform Commission's recommendation, I believe is testimony to the consultative approach of our government. Further, as with films and videos, the Commonwealth will classify material according to an agreed classification system. Each jurisdiction, however, will decide which classifications it will admit. The legislation before us does provide remedies for people concerned that particular computer games on the market that I am referring to have not been classified. Such games can be called in by the censorship authorities, and so they should. Penalties are in place for anyone deliberately not presenting a game for classification. These safeguards are necessary for many reasons, not the least of which is to help protect our most valuable asset, our children. I am happy to support this bill before the House. I certainly hope and trust that when the Senate committee deals with this bill it will look realistically to what the community is asking for and, particularly, will recommend little alteration to the bill. It can only improve-we can only go from strength to strength-but at least this bill provides the framework on which we can build as a Commonwealth and as a nation. I commend the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), I commend all those who have been involved in a lot of years of work in bringing this together and I hope and trust the legislation has community support.",37
29,Mr MCGAURAN,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1994 is one of the most important bills to come before this House, dealing as it does with the potential for children and young adults to be exposed to moral degradation through advances in technology. The high technology of the times presents a new social problem and creates a new issue for the pari iament to consider. The huge advance in the availability of offensive and violent material is simply frightening. These days it is possible for a child or young teenager to tum on the computer and call up the sort of material that was previously only available as a 'video nasty'. The thing we in this House must remember is that we are dealing with an increasingly complex problem. I suspect that this is not the last time the House and the community at large will be considering just how to combat this problem of access by young people, unbeknown to their parents or guardians, to violent and sexually explicit material. However, it does need to be said that the parliament is facing up to its responsibility and is coping with the issue as best it can, at this stage at least. We are not dealing today with a problem that is static; we are dealing with today's problem and a future problem because technology will continue to march on and access to all sorts of material, both educational and destructive, will become easier day by day. For that reason we must now take a strong line and do something that will deter those in the community who take advantage of youthful vulnerability or curiosity. Of particular concern to me is the potential for misuse of the home computer. On making inquiries in response to concerns by particular constituents but also in response to concerns already prevalent in the wider community, I have found, as have so many other members and of course the government-hence the legislation-that pornographic, violent and other immoral material is distributed through what are known as computer bulletin boards. This is the name given to a centralised pool of computerised information-pictures, moving images and games. Generally speaking, access is available to anyone who has a computer and a modem, provided the user knows the passwords and codes. With computers so common in homes now, it is no problem for children highly skilled in the use of computers to access this information. The gravest concern I have is that bulletin boards can be used to convey images of pornography, including the basest forms of pornography, and violence and to give information about drugs. A major problem of this potentially out of control use is that normal parental control is often circumvented or limited by the technology available. Many parents do not have the knowledge required to even see what their children have access to, let alone to make an evaluation of its content and suitability for children's viewing. What is more, many parents do not, at the moment, regard computers in the same light as videos and television. To many parents, the computer is a new way of doing homework. So many parents do not yet realise the deleterious effect the computer can have on their children if misused. For example, a recent survey showed that in households containing oneto 12-year-olds, nearly 80 per cent of parents had a close look at a video before they allowed their children to watch it. It is very commendable and very reassuring to see that 80 per cent of parents take their responsibilities so seriously. But, sadly, only 45 per cent of parents were involved in choosing computer games. We cannot blame parents for that; there is yet to be a widely held apprehension about the potential misuse of computers. As children get older the problem increases. In households with 13to 17-year-olds, that is, teenagers coping with or, in so many cases, struggling with emerging adulthood, only 28 per cent of parents were involved in choosing computer games. This means that, in many cases, teenagers and younger children virtually have free rein on computers without the capacity for parents to control what they do and watch. Another point that must be made is the interactive nature of many computer games. It is one thing to watch a violent video; it is another thing altogether to be involved in the violence. That is what computer games can allow-the actual involvement in the assault or, in some of the worse cases, the rapes of the images on the computer. By way of example, let me draw to the attention of the House, as have other speakers earlier in this debate, a game called Mortal Kombat. According to reports, this is the goriest and most explicitly violent video game ever to go on sale. I have not seen the game. The Canberra Times recently reproduced an article from the Independent in the UK which described one scene of the game as follows: ... an enemy is punched off a ledge and impaled on a sharp spike-the player has the option of electrocuting the opponent and then either ripping out the still beating heart or tearing off the head and holding it aloft with spinal cord still dangling! I trust the House will tolerate my explicit recitation of that monstrous game called Mortal Kombat, but It IS very necessary to illustrate the potentially dangerous effect on children. That decision whether to electrocute or dismember the opponent has to be made by the player. This decision could be made by someone who is as young as nine, 10 or 11 years of age. The worse part of this obscenity is that the game is at present, and has been for some time, readily available in Australia. It is my strong view, and, I believe, the very strong view of the general community, that these sorts of games should not be available in Australia. We already know that the media, television in particular, has a very powerful influence on young people. In fact, it is somewhat trite to make that comment because previous members, particularly the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), have cited numerous studies which draw the link between violence on television or videos and an individual's behaviour. We would have to be completely oblivious to what is going on around us if we did not recognise, from our own experiences and our own readings, the link between the obscene and violent material available publicly and the effect it has on people. I say 'people' because it is not just young children who are susceptible to this material; it is also adults. Imagine for a moment a 10or ll-year-old watching Mortal Kombat. Although there is perhaps no empirical evidence that would satisfy everybody, you would have to believe in your own mind that that child must grow up with a lesser value for human life than he or she should. Nothing, no pop psychology or psychologist beating a different drum, will convince me that it will not have some effect on a child. Heaven knows, I do not want to watch Mortal Kombat for fear that I, myself, would be desensitised in some way. I will not be distracted today by violence on television even though I believe this parliament has been played on a break by the networks. A couple of years ago, at the urging of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), we raised the need to review the viewing times of violent movies on television. The networks made all the right noises and for a short while they shifted some of the violent movies on a Sunday night to 9.00 p.m. or 9.30 p.m., but when the clamour died down, sure enough, the worse of the violent movies were back to prime time viewing at 8.30 p.m. We cannot rely on the television networks in this country for self-regulation. As I say, we will save that for another day. This House has to be resolute in these matters. Self-regulation is an ideal principle, particularly in industry, but when it comes to the communications sector I have very grave doubts that it will ever do anything except put the buck first and community sensitivities and responsibilities second. A recent South Australian education department submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in relation to violence in schools stated that a range of violent behaviour in schools is becoming more complex and varied, often influenced by film and video. There is a welter of evidence that children cannot cope with the images they see portrayed through media outlets, including, naturally, the issues before the House dealing specifically with computer games. The parliament and the government must then ensure that adequate protections are in place when it comes to accessibility of unsuitable videos and some computer games. As I said earlier, we have to think not only of today, but also of tomorrow. We must ensure that adequate restrictions are placed on the production and circulation of this material within Australia and we have to ensure that high penalties are in place for those who try to foist those games upon us. I am therefore very disappointed and concerned that the contentious subject of bulletin boards is not included in this legislation. As I said earlier, I am sure we are going to be back here to deal with further advances in technology. I would hope that the bill, having been referred to the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies for further examination will deal with the issue of the need to control bulletin boards. The committee's report is due, I understand, on or around 10 October and will be very carefully considered, not just by the government but by all members of this parliament. This is an ongoing issue. The legislation makes a good, if somewhat tentative, start. But I am very glad to see the government starting to take the lead in this issue.",40
30,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill is an important piece of legislation for this House, our children and our society. I commend the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), for his stance on this bill. It is essential that a bill which is important to our future has everyone's support. I would like to begin by reading an article written by Adrian MCGregor in the Sydney Morning Herald on 10 February 1990: It was a crime which shocked a nation and violated an idyllic community. On November 27, 1987, Sian Kingi, 12, was abducted from near her Noosa home, raped and murdered. There were no witnesses, few clues. Yet two weeks later John Watts was jailed for life, damned by the testimony of his wife Valmae Beck, herself imprisoned for her willing acquiescence. The article goes on to say: Sian Kingi, 12, emerged from a hot bread shop at Noosa Junction, told her mother, with whom she had been shopping, she would see her at home and rode off on her bike. Home was only a kilometre away. Sian's mother, Lynda, walked across nearby Pinaroo Park, Shan rode around, nying on her prized possession, her 10 speed, yellow, girl's Repco racing bike. Her other prized possession, her long, straight, blonde hair streamed out behind. She rode out of sight and with every pedal a thread linking her to her mother stretched, thinner and thinner, until abruptly it snapped. In their white, 1973 HQ Holden station wagon parked in a bay on the perimeter of the park sat Barrie John Watts and Val mae Fay Beck, an ill matched couple from Western Australia who had recently arrived in Queensland. They had been driving around Noosa Heads, Sunshine Beach and Tewantin all afternoon seeking the object of Watts's obsession-any pretty young schoolgirl, no more than thirteen, nat chested, didn't matter about the hair colour. But she had to be a virgin who Watts intended to rape. Every time he saw a potential victim, she was with friends or parents, or passersby would happen along. Beck was tiring of the wait. They had parked for 15 minutes when Watts suddenly whispered to Beck, ""There's a girl coming on a bike. Stop her. Talk to her."" Sian filled Watts's fantasies. Exceptionally pretty, blue eyed, tanned skin. Though only aged 12, Sian was already 167 centimetres tall. She was gentle, charmingly shy and very popular, with a brilliant smile which lit a pixieish quality in her personality. She liked sport. She was a true daughter of sunny, carefree, friendly Noosa. Beck called out to Sian asking if she had seen a little white poodle with a pink bow. Sian slowed and stopped. No she hadn't. Beck continued to attract Sian's attention. Watts crept up behind, slammed a cloth over Sian's mouth and dragged her with him onto the back seat of the station wagon. Sian's screams were muffled. Beck's blue healer, Rajah, leapt out, excited, barking. Sian's bike fell over. Beck frantically fetched the dog, stood the bike up, jumped in the driver's seat and sped off. The article goes on: It took perhaps thirty seconds and was so brazen that one glance from a witness would have saved Sian. People in a service station 150 metres away. Had they been looking, they might have seen. Passing cars, just 50 metres off had full view. I use this terrible case to provide background to the legislation which we have before us today. Now that honourable members have heard some of the facts of the case I will draw to the attention of this House some of the things that motivated that awful act. Adrian MCGregor addresses them in his article, when he states that Barrie Watts and his wife: ... argued, principally over Watts's fantasies about schoolgirls. He told her that if she valued their marriage, if she loved him, she would help him get rid of his aggression. He told her that once he had sex with someone for the first and only time-a virgin-he would never look at another woman in his life. In early October 1987, they drove to Queensland, via Melbourne, and rented a house in Lowood, a small farming town 50 kilometres west of Brisbane. Here is the crux of the matter: Watts had a bent for pornographic videos mostly to do with teenage prostitutes. The availability of this material to Watts caused, motivated and stimulated him to act out his sick fantasies on a poor, unsuspecting, innocent child whom he raped and murdered. The bill we are debating will, in cooperation with the states and territories, form the basis of a uniform approach Australia-wide to the classification of publications, films and computer games. Whilst it may not prevent the availability of the type of material outlined in the bill, it will make sure that it is regulated to a certain category and treated in a uniform manner across the nation. There have certainly been examples of materials slipping from category to category between the states. This legislation will prevent that happening. There are currently a number of difficulties in dealing with the nation's censorship laws. They are far too complicated and tota1\y lack uniformity. This bill is a result of a report from the Australian Law Reform Commission. It was asked to provide information on how classification laws could be simplified and given greater efficiencies whilst still maintaining the cooperative nature of the scheme. A major provision of this bill is that it sets up the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board. It also spe1\s out the procedure that is to be adopted for the classification of publications, films and computer games. This board wi1\ determine the classifications in accordance with the national classification code and guidelines. A1\ of this must be agreed between the states and territories. This bill will be fruitless without the cooperation of the states and territories. Complementary legislation must be enacted in each state and territory parliament for the provisions of this bi1\ to work. From what I have heard this morning, I hope that my colleagues opposite will go to their co1\eagues in the states and territories and ask for an assurance that they will comply. We need bipartisan cooperation on this issue. One of the most important aspects of this legislation is that it provides for compulsory classification of computer games, which we have heard quite a lot about today. Computer games wi1\ be treated for classification purposes just as films and publications will. This is very important as some video games are moving into the realms of explicit pornography and very worrying levels of violence. I am particularly pleased, in the amendments to this bill, that the Classification Board will be empowered to act on material available on a telecommunications network. This will mean that the 0055 telephone service will be correctly regulated. The Classification Board will be able to provide advice in response to complaints about this material. I have personally had a number of complaints from my constituents about the 0055 service. The service is questionable because the material is loaded with sexual innuendo. The Classification Board will now provide an avenue for complaint and regulation. One worried mother in my electorate brought me no less than 26 or 27 0055 numbers. I took the opportunity to call one of those numbers to check it out. We have to consider the innuendo involved in the material. It should not be available to anyone who can pick up a telephone. We have to do something about it. This is a good bill. It is a common sense bill which will finally do away with the complicated and difficult to regulate system which now exists. Make no mistake: we have a duty to classify all material of this nature. To illustrate this point, I would like to quote from an article by Louise Robson in the Canberra Times of 22 August 1994. The articles states: Melbourne: Almost all classes contained a child whose combination of anti-social tendencies and the taste for violent entertainment made them a possible risk to society, a conference on effects of electronic media was told yesterday. La Trobe University Professor of clinical psychology Margot Prior said that more than 1000 research papers had clearly shown links between television violence and aggressive behaviour. Professor Prior said research showed watching violent media in combination with existing aggressive and anti-social tendencies produced of violence in childhood and adult life. The findings were also true for movies, video and computer games and Internet, a computer buIletin board network through which children could gain access to violent and pornographic material. 'A vivid example was seen just last year in the case of the murder of the Bulger child in Britain two 11 year olds,' she said. Toddler James Bulger was lured to his death by two boys found to have been influenced by a horror movie. 'A history of problem behaviour along with some influence of violent video watching were influential in creating a situation in which these very high risk children could go on to engage in such horrific behaviour,' she said. Professor Prior warned of many more potential aggressors. 'I want you to know that there are numerous children in our society who have these at risk characteristics. Perhaps one or more in any classroom,' she said. A typical at risk child had aggressive parents who used harsh and inconsistent punishments. The parents applauded media violence but paid little attention to their children and failed to nurture them or encourage learning. These vulnerable children were rejected by their peers because of their anti-social behaviour and were driven away into more anti-social pastimes and more TV watching. Professor Prior went on to call for laws in the public interest to tighten controls over the availability of material. I believe that we consider some of those laws today. Bear in mind that the burden for this is not solely a legislative or government one. Professor Prior called for TV networks to program responsibly. This must occur. There is also a burden on parents and society to regulate access to this sort of material. Last year, and during this year, I was involved in the report by the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on violence in schools. It was a very concise report. It has been well received in my community, and I hear that is the case in other communities. One of the areas that we looked at was how violence in schools might be affected by media and entertainment industries. I want to quote some of the findings and information that we received during high levels that report. The report states: The influence exerted on children by the media and the entertainment industry in general, was overwhelmingly identified in evidence as a contributor to the acceptance of, and use of, violence by children. ... Evidence from the Australian Children's by Television Action Committee stated that on average, by the time an Australian child was fourteen or sixteen years oldthis is what is astoundinghe or she would have seen some eighteen thousand murders on television. They referred to three thousand studies which identified a connection between the impact of media violence and the instigation of later violence. That is an indictment of our society-I8,OOO murders witnessed before a child is 16 years of age. Where are we going to? The report also states: The clear view expressed to the Committee a broad spectrum of submissions was that untion monitored television and video viewingI emphasise 'unmonitored'was commonplace and had the effect of desensitising our children ... The behaviour was reinforced when children dressed up and/or pretended their special hero, such as Batman, a Mutant Turtle or OJ. Joe. Teachers in particular identified the effect of programs which justified violence portrayed demeaning attitudes as clearly identifiable in schools. For example, teachers referred to changed playground behaviours, such as kicking and punching by primary pupils, which coincided with the televising of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I have a prime example of that behaviour in my own family. After viewing that particular program, my two nephews were extremely aggressive in their behaviour towards each other and their friends in their younger years. These programs have to have some effect on what happens to our society.",42
31,Mr FILING,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,Did they take the elixir?,45
32,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"The honourable of member opposite jests, I hope. The report the education committee further states: The Australian Council for Children's Television stated: We are not making the claim that mass media violence is the cause of violence in schools nor the cause of mounting violence in society. we are saying it is a statistically significant socially significant contributor to violence expressed by the young. The committee heard a lot of evidence, and there is a lot more in this report. I commend this rep@rt to those in the House who have read it. It is very enlightening on violence its effect on society. After looking at that report, the committee recommended that the Minister for Communications and the Arts Clay (Mr Lee) commission a national research project to examine the effects of television, video, film, and video games on the learning outcomes and behaviour of Australian children-and in the future Australian adults. I conclude with one thought: this is a good bill and those opposite are saying a similar thing. It will give us a uniformity which we have not had before. But never forget that from every citizen has a role to play in the regulaof this material. That is what is extremely important. Future regulations will obviously come in line as time changes. Therefore, I commend this bill to the House.",45
33,Mr FILING,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"I to be appreciate the opportunity to speak to the Ninja Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill. Due to the dynamics of and this House, things changed before I had the opportunity of speaking to the bill. I acknowledge that some amendments to the bill have been circulated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan). Those amendments have responded, in a way, to some of the bill's criticisms in relation to computer bulletin boards. If that is the case and the government has responded to such criticisms, I commend it for doing so. I am a little dismayed that the government has been somewhat short-sighted in regard to the real need to control violent and sexually explicit material within the community. I suppose that, in a sense, it has been in danger being left behind due to the inadequacy of of the clause in the bill dealing with computer games and images. That is likely to change when the parliamentary secretary deals with Films and that matter in a short time. The bill is flawed in a number of other ways. Firstly, the bill in its current form But cannot be used until the states and territories and enact complementary legislation. I understand that there are indications of some concern from the states of Western Australia and Tasmania in relation to their position on some of the classifications. The bill specifically not embodies an opt-out clause for states and and territories which enact legislation and later decide that it does not meet their needs. To a certain extent, I suppose there is a tons aspect to the bill. It is designed to give the impression that the government is going to do something about the problems associated with sexually explicit and violent material in this country. Possibly, as a result of that particular provision, it may not be able to achieve what it is setting out to do. I urge that there should be more lengthy consultations with the states which have indicated concerns with the classifications. Secondly, the definitions contained in the bill are woefully inadequate to provide any real protection. As we have already heard, as far as computer games software is concerned, the bill's definitions fail to acknowledge the possibility that such a game, unlike a book or a slide show, may well contain audible material on the soundtrack which could be deemed pornographic or in other ways offensive. The legislation specifically refers to computer games. If you stretch the definitions included in the bill, child pornography could be seen as a publication of some kind. The bill classifies 'publications' as any written or pictorial matter but does not include a film, computer game or advertisement for a publication, film or computer game. So a single pornographic picture may come under this definition. Computer games are moving pictures often accompanied by sound effects. As I have said, nowhere in the definitions of the bill is the soundtrack of a video game mentionedunless the parliamentary secretary can satisfy me as to that. It would be possible then, within the confines of this bill, to produce a game with acceptable graphic images but which contains profanity of the worse possible kind and have it classified purely on the basis of the definitions provided. This point in itself is reason enough to send the bill away for redrafting. It could be argued that the use of obscene language in the context of a computer game is as unacceptable as actual physical depictions of cruelty, very gross sexual behaviour, sexism and pornography. Thirdly, the bill, until the indication circulated amendments, will prove useless as a tool of classification with regard to many computer games that would otherwise be refused classification and, subsequently, sales. The bill however is based on the presumption that the authors of works, in this case computer games and/or pornographic material, will voluntarily submit them for classification because of their desire to sell them within Australia. That seems like a reasonable way of approaching business but the presumption that items, games and the like are always produced for sale and profit in the new age of computers is as old fashioned as some of the clocks of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It does not hold for a great and increasing number of authors of computer games in this country and around the world. I will speak shortly about the danger this bill poses as regards accessing unsuitable material by our children through the rapidly growing information superhighway. Firstly, let me inform members that there is a growing tendency for software authors to produce programs and games that require no payment. This type of product has already been classified without the government's help. It is called 'freeware' and, occasionally, 'shareware' or even 'crippleware'. In these cases, the authors are not driven by the dollar; they do it for the experience, to prove they can do it and often just for the sheer delight they can cause through the effects of their programs. Often the author is just exhibiting his largess by giving away the fruits of his hard work at the computer keyboard. Often the finished product just is not worth the trouble of pushing it in a very competitive market and, occasionally, it stems from the same philosophy which brought us computer viruses and graffiti vandalism. More importantly, there is a trend to authors of simply placing the item in a public place for use by anyone without his or her name being associated with the product simply, as Sir Edmund Hillary is quoted as having said of climbing Mount Everest, 'because it was there'. I will address this issue in more detail in a of the moment. It is a problem which effectively renders this legislation useless in controlling the distribution of a huge proportion of computer games and other suspect software in this country. Because of this, the bill should be sent to the appropriate committee where it can be examined and given some more teeth. Despite the softness of the bill, however, I have concerns about the legislation if passed as it is now particularly, as I have indicated, where it applies to the area of computer and video games. These are areas of the publishing industry which are set to explode in number and variety over the next few years, and certainly in the next decade. As a society, we have had enough experience by now to know where to draw the line regarding the issues of pornography and violence in relation to books and other hard publications. As far as films are concerned, there is a system in place which offers scrutiny and effective censorship in some areas in the public interest. Occasionally the censor gets it wrong, like in the situation regarding the film Saio, which was reclassified with an R rating on appeal after being refused classification on its release in 1984. This was a film of such depravity and debauchery that it is difficult to imagine the depiction of its litany of inhuman acts of violence and degradation. The film should have been completely banned in this country. The fact that such a film is available for viewing under any circumstances is a reflection of the inadequacies of the current classification system. But that is another matter entirely. At least the film was the subject of some scrutiny and comment. It was a physical item which could be viewed by a group of people charged with protecting the community from that type of material. If it had been a computer game it could have been, and will continue to be, distributed quite effectively without ever having been subjected to that sort of scrutiny. Here is the nub of the problem as far as computer games are concerned. More often than not young people use computer games and other computer software unsupervised. Access to information by children and other persons via computers is increasing in scope and variety at a rate which is of concern. It is a meteoric rate of increase. In a sense, this is the information superhighway: a highway on which our children can play but which is no less a dangerous place than, in some instances, a physical bitumen roadway teeming with loaded vehicles. What parent would leave an unattended child in the middle of the Hume Highway on a Saturday afternoon? But more and more parents feel safe to leave their charges in front of a computer screen, behind which are information and images that could damage them in ways far more seriously than a traffic accident. We hear a lot about this information superhighway these days but very few of us get to ride on it. Mostly we are content to take the benefits it brings without realising that with those benefits also come many dangers. Like technology generally, to many of us this 'cyberspace', as it is called by many young computer enthusiasts, is a mystery because it is not immediately visible like a book or a photograph. Even video games while they are not being used are inert uninteresting objects, just data on a storage device. But the information superhighway has the potential to make a mockery of ill considered bills like the one before us today. If the government misses the boat on this one, all manner of material, desirable and undesirable, will flood into this country without any effective controls. It is precisely because of the government's inability to reaIly foresee any of the problems which will be created in a few years by the burgeoning of electronic networking that I am less enthusiastic of its ability to control or combat the threat when it arises. Even if my concerns for what may happen in the future do not move me to oppose this bill in its present form, the biIl as presented is flawed in several areas, which would make it less effective and less useful. It is time the government looked deeper and sent this bill to the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies for a complete overhaul to ensure that it addresses the problems which may arise. This may not be a simple task either. The information superhighway is not only invisible to the government to a certain extent but also unseen by many Australians. Many members of this place may not even be aware what the term 'information superhighway' means. In the next couple of minutes I will indulge them. The electronic superhighway is the increasing web of technology which allows computers, television, telephone and all manners of electronic communications to link up across the world and give access to information and other data instantly at ridiculously low costs. Instead of leaping in with a knee-jerk bill like this one, the government should take the opportunity to embark upon a detailed scrutiny of the potential that the unseen web of electronic telecommunications connections will soon weave in our society. There is a view that the information superhighway needs some policing. With that type of scrutiny or oversight, the information networks can potentially provide enormous benefits for our community, but abuse of the systems may cause disaster. In the United States, President Clinton has indicated that he supports all Americans having access to the information superhighway by the year 2000 through schools, libraries, hospitals and clinics across the country. Several states in the United States have indicated some concern at the speed of these changes. In fact, the National Conference of State Legislatures adopted a policy at its 1993 annual general meeting that stated: Since states share regulatory responsibilities with the federal government, a co-operative approach is necessary ... the federal government must recognise that states have unique priorities that state and regional specific solutions. While much of the problems perceived by the American states were connected with the cost of telephone services, local competition and infrastructure standardisation, the important point to be made here is that the American government has clearly identified the information superhighway as important and that it must be regulated to a certain extent to be of most benefit to its citizens. By comparison, the Australian government seems to ignore the growing inevitability of the problem, although, as I have indicated, there are some changes; I have already given the parliamentary secretary the benefit of praise for those changes. The government somewhat tries to pretend that the webs of this type of interconnectivity are not growing at the rate at which they are. In Australia, the Aarnet, which is this country's door to the global 'Internet service, currently links 110,000 computers to other users around the world. Traffic volumes grew by a staggering 130 per cent in 1993 alone. By 1996 it is estimated that more than 450,000 users will be regularly accessing the Internet system. Anyone with a computer and a modem can access the Internet-man, woman or child, regardless of age, race or religion. To the computer, all operators are equal. Though this may sound like some form of egalitarianism, it has with it some inherent problems. Children, for instance, are treated no differently from other users and can have access to the same files, data, images and games as their adult co-users. Often the children, having grown up in the computer age, are able to far outstrip their parents and other peers in their ability to be able to navigate through the information superhighway. As I have already indicated, in many cases, parents are content to leave their children to their own devices on computer networks and bulletin boards in the belief that the inert computer and the fact that the children are generally quiet and well behaved will do them more good than harm. As I indicated earlier, that may well not be the require case. Computers can be powerful tools when used as teaching aides or when used to spark a child's imagination but, as baby-sitters, they display some particularly schizophrenic features. At this point, lest anyone form the impression that I am forming a case against Internet or any similar computer network, I make it quite clear that I am talking here about the unknown-something that none of us are in a position to really be able to quantify or estimate accurately. Much of what goes on in Internet is uncontrolled. This is the very essence of the attraction of accessing networks like Internet. In the 'net', as it is called, there is a certain freedom from observation provided, in the main, by anonymity. The Internet is not the only place where this freedom can be found. The Internet is not the only system of network communications that can be accessed by children and adults. There are more than 200 registered private bulletin boards in Australia and many times that number which do not register their operations. Recently, Australia's first arrest was made of a computer systems operator using his equipment to distribute child pornography. Last year, an interdepartmental inquiry was set up by the Attorney-General's Department to look into the use of computer bulletin boards by paedophile networks in this country. As a member of the Joint Statutory Committee on the National Crime Authority, I have proposed an inquiry into the extent and the way in which paedophile networks are infiltrating and spreading across this country. To date the minister has refused to release the findings of the interdepartmental inquiry. If this legislation is similar to some of the types of responses we have had on this important issue, the question of commitment becomes an important one and the subject of some concern. Leaving aside the question of how this government-any government-can effectively police the type of exchange on the Internet, there is the question of the profusion of private bulletin boards across the world. Like the Internet, this private system can be accessed by anyone with a computer and a modem. Unlike the 'net', however, these bulletin boards have little or no surveillance or control on what is placed on them and what can be removed; they are almost completely autonomous. Anyone could set one up and distribute the appropriate telephone numbers, giving users access to any files, messages, games and other data which the operator cares to put forward for public consumption. To be fair, many bulletin boards in this country are run by scrupulously honest and attentive people who ensure that copyright and/or pornographic material that may be uploaded by a user never makes it to an area where it could be retrieved by children or people with less than honourable intentions. It is worrying that many others embody the philosophy of the computer 'hacker'. 'Hackers', for those members who may not know of them, are computer users who revel in some of the extra freedoms that I have alluded to. They do not accept society'S rules. In the nuid thing that is cyberspace, they find an environment which does not require them to adhere to society's wishes. To control these types of elements in society will be an enormous challenge in future years for the government of this country-to be able to achieve the very delicate balance between individual freedom and the interests of protecting people like minors, children and others, from the sort of offensive, sexually explicit or violent material that can be distributed through that medium. I was going to point out that it was time for the government to address this situation. I now find, of course, that it has done so. It is good to see that those amendments have come other about. They have come about partly as a response to some of the concern that has been raised publicly about the effectiveness of the legislation. Under clause 5 in the definitions of the bill-line 5 of page 3, paragraph (a)-a bulletin board is omitted from any definition of computer game. I understand that now a computer bulletin board will not be excluded from the scope of the act. I see the parliamentary secretary nodding. In other words, a computer bulletin board will now be drawn within the scope of the legislation. That is a good thing. There are other 'products' on the information superhighway which are worrying. How many members, for instance, have heard of computer demos? A demo is not a computer game; it is not a static picture either. As far as I can tell, the definition in this bill does not cover it. No input is required from the user. It could not be referred to as an advertisement for a book, film or computer game. Therefore, while it is not a book, film or game, a demo could be circulated without restriction. A demo is a computer program which, once started, shows off the coding or programming skills of its creator. These demos are often wondrously colourful and interesting with breathtaking computer generated effects-such as movement, threedimensional images and words. The images are often accompanied by involved soundtracks. You do not actually have to use a demo. It is just there to look at, to listen to and, in some instances, to be amazed by. Many of these demos push the limits of taste and sensibility. A member of my staff has informed me that, on one occasion, he was able to download from a bulletin board a highly pornographic disk, which contained a throbbing soundtrack based on a then popular song, accompanied by digitised images of nudity and oral sex. That was out there on the open information superhighway. This is a fact. Any child with access to the appropriate computer equipment could have got hold of this type of material and viewed it. The item itself would almost certainly not have been considered as the subject of the classification guidelines and definitions, as outlined in this bill-unless the parliamentary secretary can convince me otherwise. I think that members concede that this bill does not even begin to address that issue. No doubt, if this bill is passed, we will all be called back to this place to debate other amendments as the bill proves to be less effective than the task it set out to achieve. In conclusion, there are a number of matters of concern in the bill-notwithstanding the amendments that are to be proposed by the parliamentary secretary and which have already been circulated. I reiterate that some issues of the computer or information superhighway, networks and bulletin boards still need to be looked at more thoroughly. It would be good for the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to release the findings of his departmental group in relation to the issue of networks, bulletin boards and paedophile networks.

34,Mr NEHL,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"I am very pleased to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill. The classification of publications, films and computer games, as conveyed in this bill, is vitally important to the moral fibre of our society. I must say at the outset that I am not one who leaps onto the bandwagon of censorship. In a free society, censorship is something to be avoided at all costs. However, I do not believe that there can be any dispute with the proposition that there should be classification of all of these activities so that people who are confronted with the possibility of using, hiring or buying them know exactly what they are getting. It is particularly pleasing that the states and territories have agreed to this bill. That shows an increasing maturity in Australia's federalism. We need to have many more examples of the states, the territories and the Commonwealth acting together in concert in areas where we need to have a similar, if not an exact, legal system for particular areas. That does not mean there is not some benefit in having separate streams of development in other areas. Many times state and territory governments have to go their own ways. This legislation is a great step forward because there is absolutely no doubt that Australia's censorship laws have been in a totally unsatisfactory state. The current laws are totally and far too unnecessarily complicated; they are not uniform. It was very appropriate for the Australian Law Reform Commission to be asked to report on how those laws could be simplified. The commission presented its report entitled Censorship procedure in 1991. It is now 1994. I suppose a degree of criticism could be levelled at the length of time that the report has taken. Nonetheless, I think it would be unkind to embark on that criticism. It is very pleasing that this bill, after consultation with the states and territories and following the recommendations in the Australian Law Reform Commission's report, is now before the House. The bill will establish the Classi fication Board and the Classification Review Board and sets out the procedures for classification. An essential priority is that there should be a review board as well. Once the national classification code and guidelines have been completely established, classification decisions will be made in accordance with those guidelines. The commission in its report noted that there: . .. will be a single procedure, avoiding the overlaps and duplications that presently exist, and the classifiers will derive their powers from a single source, removing the difficulty that they sometimes face now of conflicting legislation from different jurisdictions. I totally agree with what the Attorney-General (Mr lavarch) said in his second reading speech: The Bill will only apply by its own force in respect of the Australian Capital Territory and the extent to which classification decisions under it have effect in other jurisdictions is a matter entirely for the State or Territory concerned; The Commonwealth and the States and Territories have equal voting rights in settling the criteria and guidelines under which classification decisions are made; That is the way it should be. There is still the let-out provision for the states and territories. If they do not agree to adopt the same classifications, they can legislate the classifications which will apply in their areas of jurisdiction. Having started by saying that I am opposed to censorship, I reiterate and reinforce that I am totally in support of the classification provisions put forward in this bill. Adults should be able to read, hear and see whatever they like. Equally, as a foundation of my belief of the way that censorship laws should apply, children should be protected from any material that is likely to do them any harm or to disturb them. I believe that all Australians should be protected from unsolicited material of a sexual or violent nature. The bill takes account of community concerns about video activities or whatever which either accept or try to incite people to violence, particularly sexual violence; it is totally unacceptable. I am certain people do use the classification system. I have spoken to quite a large number of people about this. If you go into any video shop around Australia, you will see people making choices on the basis of the classification of the video. I am very happy indeed that there will be a strengthened form of classification so that there will be little opportunity for kids to get hold of and see material they should not see which their parents have taken out. The depiction of violence on television, I believe without any doubt, has an impact on some-but not all-people. We are fed a stream of violence in our television news. I, for one, object to the gratuitous depiction of bloodstains on footpaths and things of this nature. It is totally unnecessary. It adds nothing to the story. It just satisfies some form of-dare I say-bloodthirstiness on the part of the people in the television stations and networks. I do not think we should be pandering to anybody's desire to see pools of blood on the road. I think it is totally unnecessary. I have also been told when talking to people around Australia that a great many people-perhaps people who are unemployed, unfortunately-are becoming TV or video addicts, seeing up to five videos a day. In a free society, if people want to, they should be able to do that. This is an area where the administration of this bill could have some worthwhile activity. I repeat that the important thing about Australian classification and censorship laws is that adults should be able to make their own decisions without big brother government telling them what to do. The classifications and the content of that material should be clearly stated so that nobody can be inadvertently exposed to something they do not want to see. The indicator of a civilised society is how it treats its children. I hope this bill will ensure the rights of children not to be exposed to violence and all sorts of perversities. The protection of children should continue to be strengthened. We should be protecting our children at all times.",50
35,Mr WILLIAMS,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1994. The bill originated in report No. 55 in 1991 entitled Censorship procedure of the Australian Law Reform Commission. In the report the commission recommended that the current state by state legislation dealing with the classification of films and publications be rationalised into a national legislative scheme. The national scheme was to consist of a federal act establishing the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board and it was to set out procedures for classifying films and publications. There was to be attached to the act a code containing the criteria for classification. It was envisaged that the code would be agreed to by the Commonwealth, states and the Northern Territory. Finally, the national scheme was to be completed by state and territory laws adopting the classifications made under the federal act and restricting the dissemination of films and publications. The Law Reform Commission recommended that the states and territories retain their existing responsibilities for regulating the dissemination of classified material. The bill, to this extent, adopts the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and does not purport to do more than provide for the classification of material within its purview. It does not regulate the exhibition, sale or advertising of classified material. I will return to this point later. Between the delivery of the Law Reform Commission report and the introduction of this bill, the issue of the classification and distribution of video games and computer games came to some prominence. Excessively violent computer programs became available for use in the form of computer games. Programs containing material that is sexually explicit, pornographic and demeaning to women also became a feature of some computer game programs. These computer games and the technology for getting access to them-for example, over telephone lines-have become readily available to children. In many cases children are so adept at using computers and computer technology, and their parents are not, that their exposure to unsuitable material is not screened by the protection of parental control. Beyond computer games, there is the issue of so-called bulletin boards. Anyone with a home computer and telephone modem in Australia, with the appropriate inexpensive equipment, can have access through a bulletin board to material from all over the world. Bulletin boards have been used to spread extremely offensive and often illegal material, such as child pornography or defamatory information. This material flows in unobstructed by any form of censorship. There is an urgent need to address this problem, and I will return to it later. The Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies looked at the issue of computer games in 1993. In its report handed down in October 1993 the Senate committee recommended a scale of classifications for video games. The classifications ranged from G for general, through G-8 for games suitable for children over eight years, to M for games suitable for persons over 15 years. The Senate committee also recommended that an MA classification be introduced for computer games that should not be sold or hired to persons under 15 years unless they were accompanied by an adult. The Senate committee further recommended that amusement arcades operating coin operated games should be restricted to offering the G and G-8 categories only. I have said that the bill does not purport to legislate for control of classified material. It therefore does not deal with this recommendation of the committee. As a result, computer games that are classified as unsuitable for viewing by a person below the age of 15 years unaccompanied by an adult, or below the age of eight years, will be excluded from amusement arcades only if state and territory legislation imposes such controls. The bill therefore leaves a heavy burden of responsibility to the individual states and territories. The Senate committee also recommended that a community committee be included in the classification scheme. The Senate committee in its report envisaged the formation of a committee of community representatives including parents, teachers, church groups, academics, women, youth, and Aboriginal and ethnic representatives. The community committee was to have input in the decisions of the classification board and the review board. This contribution would be particularly useful, for example, where the review board varied a decision of the board to refuse to release a film or computer game. There is no reason why this should not extend to publications also. The bill has not adopted this recommendation. The community has a vital and direct concern in matters of censorship. This is an appropriate matter for direct participation by the community in making classification decisions. For my part, I would urge the government to reconsider and to amend the legislation accordingly. When enacted, the bill will not be able to be brought into effect as a national scheme until complementary state and territory legislation is enacted. The state and territory legislation will also have an opting out provision which allows the state to classify material separately from the Commonwealth. This means that the one piece of material could have different classifications around Australia. The effect of this is to detract from the notion of a truly national scheme. With reference to the issue of computer bulletin boards, I have had the benefit of seeing the amendment proposed to be moved by the government. This amendment removes the exclusion of bulletin boards from the definition of computer games and therefore means that the provisions in the bill relating to classification of computer games will apply to bulletin boards. There are still no specific provisions dealing with bulletin boards. Due to the specialised and unusual nature of bulletin boards as a form of electronically supplied information, there is a need for specific provisions. I urge the government to deal more closely with the matter of bulletin boards before this bill is passed in order to avoid the need for future amendment. The definition of computer games is also deficient in that it does not include the soundtrack to a computer game. This could allow a visually innocuous computer game with an obscene and explicit soundtrack or verbal commentary to be classified G. This also should be dealt with before the bill is passed. The national classification code is in the schedule to the bill. It is not clear whether code comprises only the principles set out at the beginning of the schedule to the bill, or whether it also comprises the table set out in the schedule. This should be clarified in the legislation. Amendment of the code is to be done by the Attorney-General reaching agreement with the censorship ministers of the relevant states. The bill does not require the amendments to be tabled in parliament, nor is there an opportunity for them to be disallowed. This method of amendment of what is im important part of the proposed classification scheme is an inappropriate delegation of the Commonwealth's legislative power. The exercise of legislative power is not sufficiently exposed to the scrutiny of the parliament by the process proposed by the bill. It is made mandatory by clause 9 of the bill for the classification board to make classifications in accordance with classification guidelines. However, clause 12, which provides for the Attorney-General and the censorship ministers of the relevant states to make classification guidelines, is expressed in permissive rather than mandatory terms. The 'may' should be changed to 'shall'. Clause 27 provides that a classification decision of the board takes effect on the day on which notice of the decision is given to the applicant under clause 25 of the bill. However, clause 25 does not make it clear when notice is 'given' or deemed to be given. Clause 25 merely says that the board and the review board must give written notice of the decision to an applicant or to a person having an interest in the classification decision-for example, the publisher. The notice must be given as soon as practicable and, in any event, within 30 days of the decision. A copy of the classification certificate is sufficient notice. The question that then arises is whether notice is given for the purposes of clause 25 only when it is received by the addressee of the notice. This should be cleared up. The bill was formulated with the benefit of the advice provided by the Senate committee in its report. However, the Senate committee, which acquired some expertise in the field, has not had the opportunity of considering the the bill. I would commend a reference of the bill to the Senate committee.",51
36,Mr DUNCAN,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"In summing up, I simply want to compliment each and everyone of the speakers who has spoken in the parliament on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1994. As this is a broadcast day, I might say that very often the media have it that the parliament is an exercise in cut and thrust in which very little cooperation takes place. However, one could clearly see and hear from the debate this morning, and now this afternoon, that this is a matter on which there is a large degree of agreement between the opposition and the government. That agreement has arisen from the fact that the processes involved in dealing with this matter started in the report of the Law Reform Commission in 1991. Through various means the bill has been finetuned and honed to the point where there is now a large measure of agreement on this matter, not only between the parties here but also between the Commonwealth and the states and territories through SCAG, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. I think that this indicates a good example of an area of legislation where, through the proper processes, a large measure of agreement has been reached. As I have said, I want to thank the members who have participated in the debate for their thoughtful and interesting contributions. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.

SOCIAL SECURITY (1994 BUDGET AND WHITE PAPER) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Cognate bill: SOCIAL SECURITY (NEW ZEALAND AGREEMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 31 August. Second Reading",53
37,Mrs CROSIO,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (1.12 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill introduces a range of important reforms in the social security portfolio, ming primarily from the 1994 budget and the government's 1994 white paper on employment. ment and growth. The white paper has provided a valuable opportunity for a fundamental review of the income support system for unemployed people. The current system has been outpaced by social and labour market changes and the changing structure of employment-changes such as a higher incidence of long-term unemployment, greater participation by women in the work force, increasing part-time and casual work, and a decreasing gap between low wages and income support. The income support changes made in this bill are among those that will make the unemployment system responsive to the realities of the labour market of the 1990s. Further measures contained in the white paper will be included in social security legislation to be introduced later in these sittings. Changes to commence in March 1995 will broaden the range of work related options that the long-term unemployed, and those at risk of becoming long-term unemployed, can pursue while continuing to receive income support. These options will include developreasonable. ing and participating in group or cooperative enterprises, more courses of study ing approved by the Commonwealth Employment Service, and a wider range of voluntary unpaid work such as on environmental prosteps jects or community and cultural activities. Also, eligible clients will be able to continue to receive income support for up to 12 months while developing self-employment opportunirange ties. A further important reform is the introducthe tion of two advance payment options for ence eligible jobsearch and newstart allowance clients. After three months on payment, clients will have access to an up-front lump sum payment of up to $500 to assist in jobsearch and other activities finding paid employment. For the long-term unemployed, and those risk of becoming long-term unemployed, there is an option to take an advance of their the income support of up to $1,000 for activities approved by their case manager as assisting stemtheir return to work and included in the client's jobsearch or newstart activity agreeIn either case, the proportion of payments to be advanced will be limited to 14 per cent of the rate of the allowance, not including remote area allowance. The period over which future payments may be advanced will be up to six months for the $500 option and 12 months for the $1,000 option. The remaining fortnightly payment will be paid in the usual way. There will be no interest charged and advances will be available only to clients who can show that they have the ability to manage their finances while taking up this option. To qualify for jobsearch or newstart allowance, a client must satisfy the secretary that he or she is taking reasonable steps to comply with the terms of a jobsearch or newstart activity agreement. It is also generally necessary to satisfy the activity test either by actively seeking and being willing to undertake paid work that is, in the secretary's opinion, suitable for the person or by taking reasonable steps to comply with a requirement to undertake certain activity. There have been broadly varying decisions made about what constitutes suitable work and what steps are As a result, the application of the legislation has lacked uniformity and has and traincaused confusion for clients. This bill rectifies this inconsistency by codifying the suitable work and reasonable issues. In future, the emphasis will be altered to create a presumption that any paid work is suitable unless the secretary forms the opinion that it is unsuitable for the person. A of circumstances will be prescribed to establish that the work is unsuitable, such as client lacking the requisite skills, experior qualifications for the job; the existence of a pre-existing illness or injury that would be aggravated by the conditions of work; and the wages of a job not covered by an existing award being below the minimum related to rate for comparable work. The reasonable steps issue will be addressed at by a new provision that deems a client not to have taken reasonable steps to comply with activity test or the terms of a jobsearch or newstart activity agreement. This will apply if the main reason for failing to comply involves a matter that is within the control of the client or if the circumstances which prevented the client from complying were reasonably foreseeable by the client. This bill makes the jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowance liquid assets test more equitable. This test is essentially a deferral of payment to a client whose liquid assets-that is, cash and readily realisable assets-exceed established thresholds. First, the liquid assets waiting period will apply to clients only once in any 12-month period instead of each time a claim is made. Secondly, allowance will be made for a client's liquid assets to be reduced by anyone-off lump sum payment of nonhousing related debts such as clearance of a car loan. Also, the proceeds of the sale of the client's home may be deducted as long as settlement occurred in the last 12 months and the money is to be used to buy another home. Lastly, avoidance of the liquid assets test will be prevented by having it apply to both the client and the client's partner. This bill relaxes the residence requirements for refugees applying for certain social security pensions. The qualification criteria for most pensions require a period of qualifying residence or a continuous period of being an Australian resident. As a result, refugees cannot qualify for most pension payments. It will now be possible for refugees to satisfy the residence requirements as long as they reside in Australia and hold a class of visa approved by the Minister for Social Security. Provided that other qualification criteria are satisfied, refugees will have access to Australian pensions. More equity is being introduced into the payment of additional family payment outside Australia. At present, additional family payment can continue to be paid for up to 13 weeks if the qualified person is absent from Australia, as long as the child remains in Australia with the other parent. The unintended effect of this on sole parents is that they lose additional family payment as soon as they leave Australia, because they have no partner in Australia to care for the child. In the case of a couple, it also precludes payment of additional family payment if both parents leave Australia. This restriction is being relaxed to allow for additional family payment to continue to be paid for up to 13 weeks to a qualified person who is outside Australia, whether or not the person has a partner who remains in Australia with the child. It will still be a requirement that the child remain in Australia. This bill closes a loophole in the provisions that allow the value of certain employer provided fringe benefits to be taken into account under the family payment income test and the parental income test for jobsearch and sickness allowance recipients aged under 18. Some employees may be paid rental or mortgage subsidy payments that are not captured by the fringe benefit provisions in the Social Security Act because they are cash payments. Amendments are now being made that will result in these payments being treated as income for the relevant income tests, if the payments made by an employer to an employee are to assist the employee to meet costs associated with a housing loan or rental payments. However, this bill also includes special measures for Defence Force members so that low cost housing or a housing rental payment is given a lower fringe benefits value. The Social Security Act contains definitions that refer to certain sections in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 relating to the calculation of an undeducted purchase pricethat is, a UPP. Amendments to these social security definitions are necessary in the light of recent amendments made to the calculation of UPPs under the tax act. They will ensure that there is not an unintended tightening of the income test treatment of pensions and annuities taken out on or after 1 July 1994; that is, the status quo will remain for social security purposes. This will be achieved by applying the pre-l July 1994 income tax definition of UPP for social security purposes so that social security clients with superannuation investment products purchased with eligible termination payments will be treated the same irrespective of when they purchased these products. I commend the bill to the House. SOCIAL SECURITY (NEW ZEALAND AGREEMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 The Social Security (New Zealand Agreement) Amendment Bill 1994 provides for the incorporation into the Social Security Act 1991 of the new social security agreement that was signed by Australia and New Zealand on 19 July 1994. In 1943, Australia and New Zealand signed a 'host country' social security agreement under which each country agreed to pay pensions to residents who had come from the other country. Reimbursement arrangements have gradually been introduced to ensure that the arrangement can withstand imbalances in migration patterns between the countries. During the latter part of the 1980s there was a significant net intake of New Zealanders into Australia. The new agreement takes account of the ease with which people may travel between Australia and New Zealand. It means that neither country will suddenly face an excessive burden in paying pensions to people who have spent most or all of their working lives in the other country. Under the new agreement, New Zealand will reimburse Australia for pensions paid to people from New Zealand with less than 10 years residence in Australia during their working life. Australia will similarly reimburse New Zealand for the pensions it pays to people from Australia. The level of reimbursement in these cases will be based broadlyon the percentage of a person's working life spent in each country. The new agreement provides a far more equitable sharing of the cost of pensions paid to people who move between Australia and New Zealand. These new cost sharing arrangements are to begin from 1 January 1995, the date the new agreement comes into effect, and will cover all new arrivals from that date. The arrangements will be phased in over five years for people who arrived after 1 January 1983. Reimbursements by New Zealand to Australia are likely to triple over the next years and then rise to around $90 million a year as arrangements are phased in under the new agreement. The agreement does not cover reimbursement for benefits to the unemployed or family allowances. These benefits are not normally included in the scope of cost sharing agreements. I commend the bill to the House.",54
38,Mr RUDDOCK,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"Berowra) (1.23 p.m.)When it was suggested that the Social Security (1994 Budget and White Paper) Amendment Bill 1994 and the Social Security (New Zealand Agreement) Amendment Bil11994 be cognate, I indicated the opposition's reluctant concurrence with that course of action. One may wonder why we would be reluctant in relation to this matter, but it needs to be understood that originally these bills were to be one bill. The government sought the cooperation of the opposition and, presumably, of other, minor parties in relation to the handling of the matter and said that it wanted two bills. The reason it wants two bills is that it is a little uncertain as to what course may be adopted in another house in relation to the way in which the major bill-the budget and white paper amendment bill-might be dealt with. The government is concerned that there may be items contained in that which would require further detailed examination and referral to a parliamentary committee for elaboration. In seeking our cooperation, what it wants now is to have its cake and eat it too. It wants two bills but it does not want two debates. Of course, the cognate arrangement truncates the discussion. One may wonder why I am emphasising that when, ultimately, we will not oppose the legislation in either bill before the parliament. The fact is that each bill raises major issues. The budget and white paper bill, in particular, raises a whole host of issues, all different. Each of the eight or so different propositions that are involved in the legislation could require a debate. I will deal first with the Social Security (New Zealand Agreement) Amendment Bill. It is a relatively short bill that has annexed to it a new agreement with New Zealand. However, the Parliamentary Secretary to the three Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) failed to detail some of the history of this matter, because that agreement had been in place for about 40 years. It was negotiated some time ago before migration patterns between Australia and New Zealand changed, such that many New Zealanders saw a virtue in retiring to Australia. Of course, if they do retire to Australia, under the existing agreement, their pensions are fully paid in Australia by the Australian government. This bill also provides for a new arrangement in relation to reimbursement. The fact is that, under the existing arrangements, there is about a $500 million shortfall between the amount of money that we are paying to New Zealanders in Australia and the amount of money that is being paid to Australian pensioners retiring to New Zealand and other beneficiaries in New Zealand. This is a very significant shortfall. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) flew off to New Zealand last year and said that he was going to do the right thing by Australia and renegotiate agreements to remove that disadvantage. He told us that he would at least be able to redress that shortfall substantially. we look at the briefings that were given to the press in advance of the Prime Minister's visit-he was undertaking a little buIly boy exercise to New Zealand-we will see that he expected to get back $70 million to $80 million per annum from that exercise. They are the amounts that were being reported in the news at that time. What have we got as a result of the efforts of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin)? We now have an agreement which will be phased in over five years. In the first year it will recoup 15 per cent of pensions granted before 1 January 1995; in the second year, 40 per cent; in the third year, 60 per cent; and, in the fourth year, 80 per cent. After the fifth year there will be full reimbursement on the basis of certain calculations as to the proportion of time that people were in the work force in each country. Some benefits will be the subject of recoupment action and others will not, as explained by the parliamentary secretary. The savings, as outlined by the parliamentary secretary, resulting from this exercise are estimated to be $2 miIlion in the first yearwhat happened to the Prime Minister's $70 million to $80 miIlion?-$16.7 million in the second year and $34.2 million in the third year. When you look at the outcome that is to be achieved, it means that the Prime Minister's assertions have been totaIly blown. I think the government ought to be held accountable when it builds up expectations in that way and then walks away from them in agreements of this sort. I think it demonstrates the paucity of the government's negotiation skills. It also demonstrates the extent to which it leaves Australia hostage to the advantage that other countries-in this case, New Zealand-have been able to obtain. I also object very much to the way in which the minister, in particular, deals with this matter when he attempts to explain it to his constituents, the constituency being the members of the Australian community reliant upon income support through pensions and benefits. The Department of Social Security publishes a document caIled Age Pension If News. The September 1994 copy has a banner headline which reads 'New Zealand and Australian pension agreement signed'. The writer goes on to say that many pensioners, including age pensioners, who move from Australia to New Zealand and from New Zealand to Australia can be 'assured of continuing support foIlowing a new agreement'. What an outrageous proposition to put: that, if this agreement had not been concluded, pensioners from New Zealand in Australia, and vice versa, would have been without support, and that the existing arrangements would have faIlen to the ground! There is no cause to sow that sort of fear in the minds of the most vulnerable people in the Australian community and to hold yourself out to be a big feIlow for having been able to negotiate an agreement which recoups a very smaIl part of the shortfall that the Australian taxpayers have to make up at this time. This issue has been outrageously handled, and all because this country's Prime Minister wanted to make a few cheap points before he went on a trip to New Zealand. That is what the issue is all about in relation to this legislation. Sure, we do not oppose the agreement. It is the best the government could do. It gets a little more money for the Australian taxpayers, so we are not going to vote against it. But it ought to be understood that it is grossly below the government's own expectations, that it is grossly below the significant disadvantage that the Australian taxpayers now suffer and that it has been compounded by the outrageous proposition that the existing agreement was somehow going to fall to the ground if this new agreement were not negotiated. The second bill we are to discuss is the Social Security (1994 Budget and White Paper) Amendment Bill 1994. This bill, again, is one in which the provisions, while they can be debated, will not be opposed by the opposition. Because I want to put clearly at issue the question of unemployment, which this bill is meant to deal with, I now move the following amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not opposing the provisions of the Bill. the House is of the opinion that the Government should be condemned for(1) its policies which have created record levels of unemployment; (2) its inability to address the associated social inequity and hardship which has resulted; and (3) its failure to solve the ongoing unemployment crisis. in particular. the problem of long-term unemployment"" . That amendment is seconded by my colleague the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser). The issue needs to be debated every time we look at the measures the government puts in place which are designed to ameliorate the pain of the unemployment that it has created. Of course, the measures will be supported; but those who are culpable for producing the highest rates of unemployment that this country has seen since the last depression should remain accountable for them. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that sight is not lost of that issue, which is the major issue that needs to be addressed every time we look at these palliative measures. This is the first of three bills to be introduced in this session that give effect to measures announced in the 1994 budget and also in the white paper on employment and growth. Once again, the government having introduced an omnibus bill, we are debating eight separate measures. I want to make it clear that, when the bill introduces amendments which modify the liquid assets test waiting period applicable to jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowance recipients, that measure will not be opposed. The bill makes a number of changes, some of which benefit the revenue. We will test the liquid assets of both partners in a relationship but, where people are in and out of unemployment, we will not liquid assets test them each time in a year that that might occur. Those reforms seem sensible enough to us and not of a controversial nature. They are designed to provide for a fair and more equitable system and, while one might want to talk about liquid assets issues in relation to unemployment, it seems to me that, in the context of the amendments that are before us, it is not appropriate to oppose them. The bill, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security said, relaxes the residential requirements for refugees to enable them to access certain social security payments. Currently the qualification provisions for social security benefits can vary between periods of five and 10 years, depending upon whether it is a pension or other forms of benefit. If people are continuously resident, they can access benefits. As a result of provisions of that sort, refugees-people that we have brought here because of their situation in relation to the international convention that requires them to have protection that cannot be provided elsewhere and who in most cases do not have families in a position here to support them and on whom they could rely-ought to be able to be granted benefits. They can in fact be granted benefits in certain circumstances, but we are of the view that it is inappropriate in relation to refugees-and we have always taken this position-that they should be disadvantaged in relation to being able to access, because of their refugee status, benefits that other Australians would be able to access. So, in a situation where a refugee resides in Australia, holds a visa which evidences that he or she has been granted refugee status and meets the residence criteria, in our view the amendment is one worthy of support. It takes into account the plight of refugees, and we do not oppose it. The bill will also ensure that additional family payments will be made in certain circumstances, even if parents are temporarily absent overseas. It is interesting that the government is proposing an amendment in relation to this, because recently, when we proposed an amendment to another bill dealing with a like matter-accessing the home child-care allowance-the government was not so minded to adjust its legislation to take account of those people who might be overseas and who, if they were receiving the dependent spouse rebate, would have been able to access that benefit. However, the government saw fit to introduce provisions which emulated those that operate in relation to the family payments. Now it is going to ameliorate the harshness of that in this legislaforgot tion. But, in my view, the government should look at this question generally, because people sometimes go overseas as aid workers, sometimes for the government, or in a policing role such as was recently announced in relation to Haiti. In each of these situations there needs, in my view, to be a basis upon which some accommodation can be made to continue support to the Australian families where their parents are carrying out a task which can sometimes be for the benefit of Australia. This amendment will mean that, where children remain in Australia, the benefits will still be payable, after a 13-week period, to parents who might otherwise be required to be here. That, I think, is a measure that should not be opposed, but it ought to be judged against the lack of consistency by this government in relation to these matters, even when the problems have been clearly brought to its attention. There is another matter relating to the closing off of loopholes in relation to accessing family payments. Recently the government, with our support, moved to close off loopholes in relation to fringe benefits which are paid in the nature of salary where they relate to housing benefits. The view was formed that if, when we were income testing people's eligibility for family payments, somebody had a fringe benefit in the nature of salary then that ought to be added to the salary and taken into account for the application of the test. That is a reasonable proposition. The government did not catch everything, because it said it wanted to deal only with the big payments. I assumed it had done the job properly. What do we find here? We find an amendment to now extend it to cover other forms of housing payments. So what is it telling us? The government is slipping through an amendment designed to remedy a significant defect-some might be generous and say it is an oversight, a mistake, an error-in legislation that was designed to address this question and which we dealt with a mere six months or so ago. Quite frankly, the government to cover the cash payments that might cover housing costs. We will not be opposing the amendment, but government members need not think that when they make mistakes of that sort I will not draw attention to them. Other changes were made recently to the tax act, dealing with superannuation payments, and this bill brings the social security legislation into line. We will not oppose that. The other matters that I want to deal with are the measures for the amelioration of the hardship of unemployment, the major issue that I think ought to be debated in respect of this legislation. The amendments deal with compliance with activity tests and activity agreements, and we will not be opposing those measures. Enabling an advance payment of jobsearch and newstart allowances to be made in certain circumstances is a measure we will not be opposing, although one of my colleagues will be raising in the course of this debate the way in which the administrative arrangements might be applied in relation to these matters. If you are going to give people an advance of their benefits to enable them to buy a suit or to get some tools to undertake a job and it achieves its objective and they get a job, how are you going to recoup the money later on? You need to be sure of a reasonable prospect that these advances will be properly administered to prevent abuse and to ensure that the advance payments will be recouped if no further payments are to be made. We do not oppose the principle, but those administrative arrangements need to be addressed. One of my colleagues will be raising that matter. I think the new activities that will be available to jobsearch and newstart agreement clients are reasonable. In fact, I have advocated that course of action. The sort of activity that ought to be tested and available for people to choose should include voluntary work and training programs. You can go through the variety of activity that might be appropriate in proper cases beyond just mindlessly seeking employment opportunities where none exist. Of course, these agreements between the unemployed and the government will be supported by us. But it is interesting that agreements, or contracts-that is what agreements are-are being negotiated with the most vulnerable people in the Australian community, the unemployed, when the legislation provides that you can be punished if you do not adhere to the contract. Yet this is the same government that tells us that in relation to less vulnerable people, those that are in employment, agreements of this sort are taboo and the government will have no part of them. So the government will trot them out for the unemployed but, for everybody else, it will largely ignore them. My colleague the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) will deal with these matters because I know he takes a personal interest in them. The fact is that these amendments are merely bandaids for the problem that has been of the government's creation. That is what these amendments highlight. These amendments are designed to ameliorate the hardship that people suffer, but they do not solve the problem. In the course of this debate I want to draw attention to a number of papers. There was a paper released recently by the Catholic bishops, Putting people first: a word in support o/the unemployed. I think it is a very important paper. In chapter 4, 'What can we do about unemployment?' the paper makes a number of points against certain principles and values. It states: ... any worthwhile unemployment policy should seek: to help generate more jobs than might otherwise be available, and ideally, enough jobs to absorb all those experiencing involuntary unemployment to try, through training and other means, to match the skills of the unemployed members of the workforce (and new entrants to the workforce) to the requirements of jobs likely to be available ... meanwhile, to support (financially and otherwise) and offer comfort and counselling to those unable to find jobs ... It then makes a very simple point when it says: The White Paperthe governmentfocuses heavily on the second and third of these objectives and many of the initiatives are to be commended. It is arguable, however, that the policy framework in place will not produce the forecast five per cent unemployment rate by the year 2000. In any event, Australians should aim to regard such a level of unemployment as unacceptable. Justice demands that the aim should be to have no involuntary unemployment. That is a very simple statement, but what the church is telling us is that the white paperthat is, the government-does not have in place policies to generate more jobs than might otherwise be available. That is what the church is telling us. The paper does not go further and say the government should be condemned for that, but I think that is the course that should be taken. It is interesting that even the government's own advisers now tell it that that objective cannot be reached. I refer to a report in the Australian of l3 September where it is stated: The secretary to the Treasury, Mr Ted Evans, yesterday said it would be 'extraordinarily difficult' for the Federal Government to achieve its goal of getting the unemployment rate down to 5 per cent by the end of the decade. The report further stated: Mr Evans said Australia had not seen the necessary investment levels since the end of the 1980s. 'We have not had continllolls growth for a very long time' he said. 'We need continuous growth over the decade we are to get unemployment down ... It talked about getting unemployment down to that level which the government tells us is its objective. As honourable members know, this is a government that is seriously divided in relation to the way in which these matters are to be addressed. It cannot even get people to come into this chamber and participate in this debate. I notice only one government member is listed to follow me on this matter. I would like to know where the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) stands in relation to this debate, because I noticed that in the media he has had some things to say about unemployment. Of course, the member for Fraser, in the book that he has released, makes it very clear that the unemployment rate is likely to remain above the eight per cent level for the remainder of the century unless government policy is changed. That is what the government's own members are saying, but one could not get agreement in relation to it. I watched a debate last night on Lateline involving the former finance minister, Peter Walsh. Of course, he said the prescription of the member for Fraser was wrong. He said that the member for Fraser, who is advocating that we should increase taxes to deal with the situation, should not be followed. What I thought was particularly germane was that this man said in the Financial Review last week that growth is the key and, as new alarm bells are sounding for deficits, he made it very clear that, while government continues to oppose mining projects that are important for Australia's future in the way in which it does, it will not be able to address the employment question, the investment question or the deficit-the debt question. I think that was particularly poignant. Helen Hughes, a very eminent professor, indicated when she spoke here on the unemployment question that if we embark upon another period of recession-and they do seem to come round every so often-with unemployment levels at eight per cent, at the next recession we can expect them to be at 15 per cent. She was saying that the fundamental changes need to be made now in a period of if recovery or growth, and that if you do not get it right you are storing up hardship for the future, hardship for our children's future. She was also saying that you have to look at the United States-the government does not like to hear that because that means you might have to have a more flexible labour market-and you need to look at the way in which it gets investment and uses investment. In America the machines wear out because they are often run 24 hours a day. We invest in new plant and equipment that remains as new because it is hardly ever used. It is interesting, is it not? It is not just the Asian tigers that roar and manage their economies effectively to give low levels of unemployment. In the Financial Review of 7 September we saw a report on the world competitive indexes. That report showed that it was not some low labor cost Asian country that was winning-although those countries were doing pretty well-nor the low cost ones such as Japan and Singapore; it was the United States of America that headed the list. And where was Australia? Australia was 15th. The government tells us that it knows and understands that fundamental reforms of the sort that were outlined in our paper The Things That Matter are essential. It says we should not worry, because it is doing the job. But the fact is that it is not doing it fast enough to deal with the fundamental problem that faces Australia-the future of our young this people, the people who are unemployed, the people who have had to suffer as a result of this government's policies. The measures are there; the examples are there. We all know what needs to be done. But we are in a foot race where we are coming 15th. We could be at the top of the pile if we had people who were courageous and prepared to give real leadership to this nation. (Time expired)",57
39,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,Is the amendment seconded? ,62
40,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"In this cognate debate I wish to make some comment on the Social Security (1994 Budget and White Paper) Amendment Bill. The effect of that bill is to implement in part some of the measures adopted by the government in the recent Working Nation statement. I commence by quoting some of the points made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) in her second reading speech: This bill introduces a range of important reforms in the social security portfolio, stemming primarily from the 1994 budget and the government's 1994 white paper on employment and growth. That is, of course, the Working Nation statement. The parliamentary secretary went on to say: The white paper has provided a valuable opportunity for a fundamental review of the income support system for unemployed people. The current system has been outpaced by social and labour market changes and the changing structure of employment-changes such as a higher incidence of long-term unemployment, greater participation by women in the workforce, increasing part-time and casual work, and a decreasing gap between low wages and income support. The income support changes made in this bill are among those that will make the unemployment system responsive to the realities of the labour market of the 1990s. Further measures contained in the white paper will be included in social security legislation to be duced later in these sittings. The second reading speech goes on to say that some of the changes in this particular bill will include measures to broaden the range of work related options that the long-term unemployed and those at risk of becoming long-term unemployed can pursue while continuing to receive income support; in particular, a wider range of voluntary unpaid work. Those are the measures that I wish to speak on. Members opposite will understand that the philosophical approach of the government's Working Nation statement was one of 'growth plus'. That shorthand phrase is code for a need to maximise growth in the economy. We do that by ensuring that the economic parameters are right, and I will come to that in a moment. But if long-term unemployed people are to benefit from the recovery then we need to take special measures and additional steps to ensure that they share in the benefits which flow from economic recovery. I will start by drawing attention to some of the current economic parameters and unemployment statistics. I refer honourable members to the most recent set of labour force figures, the August ABS labour force figures, which show that the number of people out of work in Australia has fallen to just over 830,000, the lowest level since August 1991. The unemployment rate in the same set of figures remained at 9.5 per cent. The encouraging statistics behind that figure were indicated in the press release of 8 September 1994 by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). In the preceding two months employment had grown by over 50,000, while over the year employment growth had been 'a healthy 266,000 or 3.5 per cent.' The next important and very encouraging point that the minister makes in his press release on that day is the continuing fall in long-term unemployment, which is now 290,000; down from a peak of 366,000 in March 1993.  the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), both opposition members present, will be particularly interested in the figures for our intro- own state, Western Australia. Unemployment has fallen to eight per cent, from a high of 10 per cent a couple of years ago. Richard Court happened to arrive at the scene at the right time, but none of Richard Court's policies have had anything to do with increasing employment in Western Australia. On the contrary. I will not divert myself by giving the two honourable members opposite a lecture on the benefits which have come to the Western Australian economy as a result of the fundamental changes made by this government over the last 10 years. The sheepish smile on the face of the member for Forrest tells me there is no need to continue on that particular line. So far as some general economic parameters are concerned, it is important to remind members opposite that, as the Treasurer (Mr Willis) has been saying for some time, we now have the best set of economic fundamentals that we have seen in this country for some time. We are on a budget deficit reduction program, to bring it down to less than one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. We are 30 per cent more competitive than we were a year ago. Our economic growth to March of this year was five per cent, and we continue to do better than our trading partners in terms of inflation. The last inflation figure, from memory, was about 1.7 per cent, and the trend line for inflation continues to go from just over two to about 1.9. In addition to that, we have consolidated low inflationary expectations. Our exports continue to thrive, particularly the increases in services exports and in elaborately transformed manufactured exports. Despite the efforts of Premier Kennett in Victoria, we have had the lowest industrial disputation in this country for about 60 years. We have the highest levels of business confidence in 30 years and the highest levels of consumer confidence since those figures were taken. In the growth equation, I referred to our philosophy on this side of the House of 'growth plus'. There are further steps in the white paper to maximise economic growth but the fundamentals are already there-low inflation, low inflationary expectations, business confidence, consumer confidence, productivity, international competitiveness, low industrial disputation and increasing exports. The white paper incentives for business to invest bring to almost $3 billion for the 1994-95 financial year the amount of incentives for business to invest. Some of the incentives for business in the white paper include: increased access to capital for business, particularly small business; the coordination of the full range of government assistance programs and services for business under one agency, which is AusIndustry; the suspension of the training guarantee levy; a training wage for adults and juniors; reform of the CES and private competition for the CES in the case management area; a more effective government purchasing policy; increased access to business to research and development tax concessions to develop good Australian ideas; further measures to encourage exporting companies; and measures to further enhance trade in our region. We see from these measures that the central aim of the white paper is to build stronger industry in Australia and to maximise the capacity and potential for economic growth because continuing strong rates of growth are essential to job creation in this country. On this side of the House, we are committed to the view that long-term sustainable jobs can come only from the private sector and that is why the white paper provides further real incentives to business to invest and to create jobs. The other aspects of the white paper package are on the plus side. These are special measures taken to ensure that long-term unemployed people reap the benefit of economic recovery. For the long-term unemployed, the purpose of the white paper is essentially to break the cycle of long-term unemployment and to do that through work opportunities, work experience and training. A central measure in the white paper, to ensure that long-term unemployed people are picked up, is the job compact. The purpose of the job compact is to break the cycle of long term unemployment. As the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), wearing that cap before him have said, it is about making long-term unemployed people more productive and more adaptable. It is not about 'make work' schemes; it is about giving the long-term unemployed a helping hand, not a handout. In return for those special measures, we find in the white paper the reciprocal obligation measures that this bill in part refers to. The long-term unemployed will have an obligation to take all reasonable steps to accept work or to accept government offers of a placement in the compact. So the compact guarantees to a long-term unemployed person of over 18 months one of the following measures: provision of the training wage; private sector job subsidies; new self-employment opportunities; public sector work experiences; new work opportunities in the voluntary community area; training and placement opportunities for unemployed young people who immediately leave school; and further voluntary work options for people to take in the voluntary community section. In addition to that, we have the changes which again are, in part, reflected by this bill. There are changes to make sure that the social security system, and its mix and its match with low income families, provides a greater choice to ensure that there will always be a reward to take a low wage job rather than relying on income support or welfare. What attitude and approach do those opposite take to the white paper and what is their solution to long-term unemployment? The first categorisation that one needs to make is that those opposite would not have spent any money on the white paper measures. So the first thing we need to understand is that the measures here would not have gone ahead under those opposite. The second categorisation that one needs to make is that those opposite went to the last election with very firm commitments in this area. Their solution to unemployment and long-term unemployment was threefold: to tip people off the dole after nine months; to slash $800 million out of outlays for labour market programs and the unemployed; and, their central focus, to slash wages. That is their ever-present solution to all perceived ills-to slash wages. I will come to the question of wages and those opposite shortly. On this side of the House, the Working Nation white paper reflects our commitment to ensure that we do not have an underclass in Australia comprised of long-term unemployed people. The measures which those on the other side would adopt would have that effect. We stand for taking special measures to pick up long-term unemployed people. The effect of the measures that those opposite are handcuffed to would be to create an underclass in Australia-a permanent underclass. There is a key point to be made about jobs. Jobs are, of course, vitally important to our quality of life-not just to reduce unemployment but to provide long-term, secure, better paid jobs. Our philosophical commitment goes to ensuring that we see an Australia which is a high wage Australia, a high productivity Australia, a high growth Australia, a high employment Australia and a low inflation Australia. That will see the provision not just of jobs but of better paid jobs. In addition to the effect of the measures that those opposite would adopt, being to create a permanent underclass in Australia, their policy on wages would see, effectively, a working poor in this country. I want to make some comments about the national wage case which came down yesterday and to contrast the response of the government to the national wage case with that of those opposite. I refer to the report in today's Financial Review, Thursday, 22 September. The front page article on the national wage case by Mark Davis says: Yesterday's decision also awarded in full the ACTU claim, supported by the Federal Government, for a wages ""safety net"" worth a total of $24 a week to protect real living standards of workers without the industrial muscle to secure enterprise deals. There are two key points there: firstly, the government's commitment to the safety net; and, secondly, the government's commitment to ensure wage increases for those workers not covered by enterprise bargaining arrangements. A subsidiary point is referred to in a block on the front page of the Financial Review which refers to an inside story at page 10 by Mark Davis. I simply quote the block on the front page, where Mark Davis says: Forget ""$24 pay rise"" headlines ... the news is how little yesterday's decision will add to the nation's wages bill. That is an important point which those opposite have comprehensively failed to understand. Those points become crystal clear if one turns to the coverage of the national wage decision in today's Australian. I quote from the front page story in the Australian: The Industrial Relations Commission yesterday opened the way for hundreds of thousands of workers to receive pay rises of up to $24 per week. It goes on to say: The federal Opposition, conservative States and employer organisations bitterly attacked the decision to grant the wage increases ... It continues: The commission reaffirmed the award system would remain the appropriate safety net of wages and conditions ... The Federal Government and the ACTU yesterday welcomed the decision ... In its decision, the commission found the national economic recovery was ""well established"", with a strong potential for growth. I think that just about summarises the attitude that we on this side of the House take and the attitude of those opposite on the question of working people in this country getting a fair share of economic recovery. Those opposite oppose the $24 safety net. We never hear from them when the question of executive salaries is raised, but whenever there is a national wage case we always hear them opposing it. Honourable members opposite should indicate to us the last occasion on which they supported a national wage case increase for workers. You have got to go back a long time to find it-if, indeed, you can find it. Workers in recent years have worked harder and with greater productivity; they have worked longer and have restrained their wage claims. Yesterday's national wage case is a welcome acknowledgment of the sacrifices that those workers have made. On this side of the House, we believe the decision is a responsible one. It recognised the sacrifices made by workers in recent years in the interests of job creation and of making Australia more internationally competitive. This is basically a decision for those who are industrially weak and who cannot access enterprise bargaining. If those opposite had their way, over time, those industrially weak workersfor whom we support a safety net and a $24 increase-would basically be working for slave wages, and would become working poor in this country. The philosophical commitment on this side of the House is twofold: economic recovery is also for the long-term unemployed and for low-wage workers as well. It is not an economic recovery for the top end of town. Those groups are entitled to responsible wage increases and to their fair share. When we summarise those differing philosophical approaches, as far as this side of the House is concerned, when it comes to long-term unemployment and the policies that we adopt to help the long-term unemployed, our philosophy is reflected in Working Nation, and in the bill before the House: it is to maximise economic growth but to take special measures to ensure that those groups are picked up. Those on the other side of the House have an approach to long-term unemployment which says that such people ought to be tipped off the dole after nine months, and that we ought to slash outlays for labor market programs and for the unemployed",62
41,Mr TUCKEY,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. There is an obligation in this place to tell the truth; and the member for Perth, in referring to that nine months, told a lie.",66
42,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,It is a negation of the lie.,66
43,Mr TUCKEY,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,Do you deny it is a lie?,66
44,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,Order! The honourable member for Perth has the call.,66
45,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"I take it that you have asked him to withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. Thank you. Our philosophical approach to long-term unemployment is to maximise economic growth and then take special measures. On the other side of the House, the policy to which they were handcuffed at the last election was to tip unemployed people off the dole after nine months and slash $800 million from",66
46,Mr TUCKEY,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. We know that you were Secretary of the Western Australian Labor Party when all that money was flowing around. My point of order is that I have raised the question once before. We never did tip people off the dole at nine months. We never said we would tip them off the dole at nine months. We had other provisions, and it is time he stopped perpetuating the lie.",66
47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"Order! The honourable member for Perth did withdraw, if he has made that allegation.",66
48,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"I have withdrawn nothing. The policy of those opposite in the last election was to tip people off the dole after nine months, to slash $800 million out of labour market programs, and to slash people's wages. That is what members opposite stood for at the last election. (TIme expired)",66
49,Mr RICHARD EVANS,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"I rise in support of my colleague the shadow minister and member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) and his amendments. I want to make a few comments about the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith). I want to address a couple of things that he said in his last speech and question a few of the points that he brought forward. Firstly, he said that, at the last election, we would have been tipping people off the dole at nine months. That is quite a fabrication; it is nowhere near being the truth. Later on I will be explaining how the Labor government will in fact be tipping people off the dole with its job compact, and I will be giving some evidence for that particular case. The member for Perth also spoke about the $24 increase to salaries that was announced yesterday. I wonder whether he actually understands the concept of small business. A $24 increase in salary may in fact be okay, but he does not seem to realise the on-costs associated with such an increase. It will not just be $24; it will in fact be more like $72 a week in costs to the employer. So this feeling about it being 'only $24 a week' should be seen in the total context of on-costs associated with applying this $24 increase. He also said that unemployment was coming down. He stated a lot of figures associated with the long-term employed-and I will go through them-and how the great unemployment hoax is being perpetuated. If that is the case and if the government is creating all these jobs, why do we still have over 800,000 people out of work? If it has created 250,000 jobs in the last period, why are there still over 800,000 people out of work? He said that business confidence was up. I do not see a lot of business people, in particular small business people, saying how wonderful the economy is now. People who listened closely to the member for Perth would get the feeling that there is absolutely no unemployment problem in Australia now. Everyone is so confident; everyone is so happy; everyone is so wonderfully pleased about the current situation in Australia now. If you had listened to the statistics that government members continually talk about on the other side, you would come to the notion that there is no problem. Unfortunately, there is a problem. Over 800,000 Australians are out of work in Australia right now-and this is not a problem that should be addressed by parliamentarians in this place; it is a problem that should be addressed by the whole community. We all should be working together, not ignoring the problem. This particular bill is an omnibus bill and is fairly typical of how the Labor Party handles legislation through this place. It couples together a number of aspects of legislation, hoping that the whole thing will be discussed at anyone time. It leaves us limited time to be discussing certain elements of it, thus forcing the parliament to approve it, as we will be doing. The effect of this is to reduce the whole concept of parliamentraising issues in parliament and bringing those issues home to the community-and not to allow proper debate. The bill primarily addresses the white paper. It attempts to amend the bill, apparently to fix some administration problems associated with applying the white paper concepts. Let us have a look at the white paper since its release. If we look at what has happened in our economy since the release of this great white paper, Working Nation, what has actually happened? Nothing has happened. We have still got high unemployment. We have still got a lack of small business confidence, although the government will quote figures that business confidence is going up. Talk to any small business people and what will they say? They will say that it is pretty hard doing business out there right now. So business confidence is not really improving at the moment in small business areas. Let us look at the current status of Australia with regard to jobs. I saw some press reports recently which stated that there was a low level of trades personnel in Australia right now. There are fewer trades men and women in Australia than there have been for a long time. What that means is that we need apprentices in Australia to overcome the shortage of skilled labour we are going to have in a couple of years time. Looking at the current apprenticeship level, we have the lowest level of apprenticeship that we have had for over 10 years, in fact over 20 years. The figure for apprentices as a proportion of the labour work force is 1.6 per cent, which includes trainees at the moment. That is the lowest figure since 1968. That is from the ABS labour force statistics. So apprentices are down. Tradespeople are down. We are going to have an ongoing shortage of skilled tradespeople in the near future. The Labor government talks about university places being up. It says they are up 30 per cent. That is true. They are up 30 per cent but new students going to university are down. So what does that mean? Mrs Crosio-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The previous speaker made references during the social security bill debate to unemployment. I assumed then that this speaker was going to refer to that. He did say in his opening remarks he would make a few comments. The previous speaker did not refer to university places. The bill before the House is social security.",67
50,Mr TUCKEY,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the member for Perth did open this debate up into these areas without protest from our side. If university places are not associated with employment and unemployment, I would be astounded.",68
51,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,Order! I do not believe that there is a point of order. I have been listening very closely to the honourable member for Cowan. I call the member for Cowan.,68
52,Mr RICHARD EVANS,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) has been in parliament long enough to understand that there is a wide ranging debate on unemployment at the moment, and I am covering a number of issues which the government continually perpetuates in this place. The government says that university places are up 30 per cent. That is in fact true. Why is there this 30 per cent increase? Because people are staying at university, and therefore younger people still cannot get places in universities. The youth of our country are being denied the opportunity of tertiary education, therefore they are trying to find work, and therefore there are more of them unemployed. The unemployment rate for our youth in Australia is over 30 per cent. The parliamentary secretary was trying to deny me the opportunity of talking about the youth of Australia, which is typical of the ALP's attitude towards our future. There does not seem to be any development of Labor direction towards the information age and transferring unskilled work into this particular area, and there does not seem to be any idea of the long hours worked by people who do have employment. There is a continual growth in the number of people in employment working longer and longer hours; yet youth unemployment, as I said before, is at its highest levels. The unemployed in Australia are currently being subjected to a cruel hoax. They are one of the most disadvantaged groups in Australia. They are the most at risk people in Australia, because they have children themselves. This country has an obligation to them to enable their children to grow up in an environment where there is proper employment. We have, as a community, a social crisis. This government has deliberately gone out of its way to hide the true state of long-term unemployment in this country. Mr Cleeland-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The honourable member for O'Connor raised several points of order during the speech from the honourable member for Perth, raising the question of lies being told in this House. Lies are now being told in this House, and I believe the speaker should be brought to order and told to tell the truth.",68
53,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,Order! There is no point of order.,68
54,Mr RICHARD EVANS,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"That is the worse slur on me that I have ever heard, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I would hope that the honourable member for MCEwen learns a bit more proper etiquette in this particular place. But I will quote, for the honourable member's benefit, some facts. I have a fact sheet called 'The great unemployment hoax'. The first fact is that unemployed people will be dismissed from receiving unemployment benefits. As evidence of this I wilI quote from the statement by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) in the House on 24 August. He said: Failure to enter into a case management activity agreementread 'performance contract'or to abide by the conditions of a case management activity agreementread 'performance contract'will have the same effect for the job seeker as failure to enter into a Newstart activity agreement or a job search agreement or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of those agreements. In other words, it will lead to a loss of allowances for some period of time. Is that taking people off unemployment benefits? The answer to that is clearly yes. Page 116 of the Working Nation policies and programs document says: long-term unemployed people will be under an obligation to accept a reasonable offer of a job or lose entitlement to income support for a period. Is that taking people off unemployment benefits? Answer: yes. The second fact is that unemployed people will be required to sign performance contracts. No-one else in Australia, no working person who comes under an award system, is required to sign a performance contract, yet the ALP government wants our unemployed people to sign a performance contract. The evidence was stated by the minister on 24 August 1994. He said: Case managers will work with the job seeker to negotiate a case agreement activity agreementread 'performance contract'This will set out a course of action tailored to particular needs of a job seeker and agreed between the case manager and the job seekera performance contractAs part of delivering case management services, a case management activity agreement will be developed and agreed by the case manager and the job seeker. The third fact states that the signing of a performance contract is compulsory and that unemployed people are required to sign a job compact. The job compact will apply to all people who have been in receipt of a jobsearch or newstart allowance for 18 months or more. That is on page 117 of the Working Nation statement. Mrs Crosio interjecting",68
55,Mr RICHARD EVANS,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"I am talking to the amendment, parliamentary secretary. The fourth fact states that if people do not perform, if they do not accept a job offer and if they do not keep the job they will lose their benefits. On 24 August the minister stated: The case management activity agreement will require a job compact client to accept any offer of suitable paid work or any offer of a placement under new work opportunities or the new enterprise incentive scheme and case managers will have a responsibility to monitor a job seeker's activity against his or her agreement and provide relevant information to the CES. The white paper is nothing but a hoax. After six months of being on the jobs compact, the unemployed are guaranteed a job offer, if not a training program. To support this claim, page 116 of the white paper, Working Nation, states: The Government will offer an employment place to people receiving NSA who have been on allowance for more than 18 months. As I said before, if people do not take a job offer, they lose their benefits. Imagine a person living in Manly in Sydney who has been offered a job in CronulIa. Say that person is 45 years of age, has no car and has been offered a labourer's job. If that person does not take that particular job, he or she is off the benefits. Is that dropping people from the dole? Yes, it is. Page 115 of the Working Nation document states: An offer of a job is the core feature of the ""Job Compact"" which the Government is providing to those who have been on unemployment allowances for over 18 months. We are talking here about a job offer, not a job. If a person does not take the offer, he or she can go onto a training program such as the LEAP program. Let us work our way through this. If people go on the LEAP program it lasts for six months. If they go on a subsidised training program, it lasts for six months. There is no guarantee that that subsidised job will be there after six months. What happens after six months? Clearly, they go back on the dole. Wow! That might be exciting. But the point is that they do not go back as a long-term unemployed person, they go back as a new unemployed person. They lose all the benefits of being long-term unemployed. The ALP says, 'Look at this: the number of long-term unemployed is coming down'. Let me tell members why it is coming down. It is coming down because people are being put into subsidised jobs or a LEAP training program for six months and that takes them off the long-term unemployment figures. When they have finished that, they go back on the unemployment figures. It is a great hoax; the great myth of the ALP. This is how the government is fixing long-term unemployment; it is moving people from one end to the other end. The government is dealing with figures but, in Australia, unemployed people are in fact people. They are fellow Australians and we as a community have a duty to these fellow Australians. Why do we allow statistics to be mentioned that claim that there is no problem with the unemployed in Australia, that the country is growing through the roof and that we are all getting the benefits of that? Do benefits exist out in the community now for the 800,000 or more unemployed, including those of our youth who cannot get into university or into jobs? Why do Australian males who are under 25 have one of the greatest suicide rates in the world? Why are these young men suiciding? Does it have anything to do with the current economic situation? Does it have anything to do with the unemployment situation? Does it have anything at all to do with loss of hope and direction? Does it have anything at all to do with the blase way in which the ALP has been treating our people in Australia? Does it have anything to do with those factors at all? The answer to that is yes, it probably has. We sit here and listen to those in the Labor Party tell us all these wonderful stories about the way things are going in our community. And do you know what? The press and other people in this place believe them. But the community as a whole, certainly in my electorate, does not believe them any more. We have had these stories for 11 years. Remember the great recovery we had in 1987, how well it was all going? No, interest rates were not going to go up! They are saying the same thing now. Remember unemployment back in 1987? It was not 10 per cent or nine per cent; it was more like three or four per cent. Then we went into a downturn. Those in the Labor Party created the most significant crisis this country has faced in the last 60 years. They are now saying exactly the same thing as they said in 1984, 1985 and 1987and, as a community, we are beginning to believe it. It is time we said, 'No more!' It is time we said that this government has to stand accountable. We are talking about 800,000 of our fellow Australians out there-they are not statistics; they are unemployed. What they want is a job. They want opportunity and they want hope. This Working Nation statement has nothing to with that. It is all about making people jobs-ready, about jobtraining people, getting people off the long-term unemployed list and putting them back at the start of the whole employment cycle again. This is the way those in the Labor Party work-they fudge the figures, and we begin to believe them. But there is a growing anger out there about the lack of opportunity for our youth. They do not have the same opportunities we had 20 or 30 years ago. They do not have the choice of jobs that we had 20 or 30 years ago. They cannot get into university. They cannot get jobs. Who is responsible? Is it the employers who are responsible? Is it the churches who are responsible? Who is responsible? The government is responsible. The government is made up of the ones who are responsible. We have people like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), who has been in parliament for so long, yet she is still a parliamentary secretary, stating that social security is the preferred option. People do not require social security; they require a job. With this government, they cannot get the jobs. Employers have no incentive to employ. Those opposite say, 'Look, it's not a problem; we've just increased salaries by $24.' Has that affected payroll tax? Mr Deputy Speaker, what if you as an employer have a payroll limit of $400,000 before you have to start to pay tax of five per cent? If your payroll is $380,000 at the moment, would you employ an extra person who will take your payroll over that limit necessitating the payment of tax on the entire $400,000? The answer is no, you would not. If you were to employ an extra person, suddenly five per cent of your profit would go out the door. Yet here we are trying to encourage the Labor Party, the government, to use some sort of common sense, bipartisan approach to create some jobs for our 800,000 Australians who are out of work. It is time that those in the ALP stopped this ridiculous playing with figures-statistics and damned lies-and addressed the problem and created some work. The only way they can create work is to give the incentive to employers to employ people. Yet, if we listen to their debate, all they talk about is social security and dragging people back down to the bottom line-lowest common denominator stuff. Do not rely on those in the ALP, the government, to get us out of this mess, because it will not. It will create a bigger problem. The people of Australia need to start recognising this because it is a community problemnot a political problem, not a parliamentary problem; it is a community problem. It is time for those in the community to say, 'No, let's fix this problem and start giving our people work.' That is why I commend the amendments to the House and believe that they should be agreed to. Debate (on motion by Mrs Crosio) adjourned. NA Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee",69
56,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present the committee's advisory report on the Employment Services Bill 1994 and the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",71
57,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I am pleased to present to the parliament the advisory report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the Employment Services Bill 1994 and the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994. On 25 August the committee was asked to consider the bills, including amendments and new clauses moved on behalf of the government, and to prepare a report. This is the third advisory report on proposed legislation prepared by the committee. The purpose of the bills is to give effect to changes announced in the Working Nation white paper. The bills introduce an innovative approach to the delivery of services to unemployed people. This approach involves harnessing the expertise available in the public, community and private sectors to assist unemployed people to gain new skills and find jobs. The case management process established by the bills will provide individually tailored assistance to eligible job seekers registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. Widespread support for the bills was expressed during the committee's inquiry, and most groups welcomed the government's introduction of the case management system. The Employment Services Bill, or the main bill, introduces three major changes. The first change is the introduction of competition into the delivery of case management services. The second major initiative is the establishment of the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, or ESRA, whose role is to set up and regulate the case management system. Lastly, the bill provides for the establishment of Employment Assistance Australia, which will be the government's main case management organisation formed from part of the Commonwealth Employment Service. Report The Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill amends certain acts consequent upon the enactment of the main bill. These include the Employment, Education and Training Act 1988, the Privacy Act 1988, the Freedom of Information Act 1982, the Ombudsman Act 1976 and the Social Security Act 1991. The report I am tabling today makes 28 recommendations which are aimed at clarifysoon ing aspects of the bills. The main issues addressed by the committee include the regulation of the case management system; privacy and the protection of confidential information; the extension of the administrawhen tive law package to organisations outside the public sector; and the amount of detail includthe ed in disallowable instruments. The committee has paid special attention the needs of job seekers who could be coninterim, sidered as the most disadvantaged in their search for work. The committee is keen ensure that people in rural or remote areas have the same opportunities to access these new service delivery arrangements as all other Australians. ESRA is responsible for the regulation of the case management system, which will involve an accreditation scheme, the introducjobsearch tion of codes of practice, and certain investiremove gation and monitoring powers. The committee is of the opinion that the powers given ESRA by the bill are appropriate and neces1994. sary for it to ful til its role. The case management system requires that substantial amounts of personal information are transferred between organisations. To ensure that this information is treated propThe erly, the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill allows for the extension parts of the Privacy Act and the Freedom of payments. Information Act to all contracted case managers. The committee is satisfied that personal privacy will be protected, but believes it essential that an education and training stratmatter egy is implemented to ensure that contracted case managers are aware of their responsibilithe ties under these acts. Much of the detail of the bill is contained in disallowable instruments. This issue engendered much discussion and was investigated by the committee. The bill allows for 13 disallowable instruments to be created either by the minister or by ESRA. The committee believes that the main bill would be clearer and more effective legislation if some of information contained in the disallowable instruments was included in the bill. However, the committee also understands that it is necessary to implement these initiatives as as possible and that a certain amount of flexibility may be required in the early stages of operation of the case management system. The committee has therefore recommended that the situation be reviewed in 12 months, the case management system will be more established, with a view to including in act much of the information that is contained in the disallowable instruments. The to committee also recommends that, in the the government release drafts of the disallowable instruments prior to the passage to of the bills through the parliament. On 7 September, after the public hearings of the inquiry had been conducted, the committee received an additional set of amendments to the consequential amendments bill. These amendments relate to the reciprocal obligations of people in receipt of the or newstart allowances, and partly the effect of amendments to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act to 1994, which came into effect on 12 July The amendments to the Social Security Act provided for an additional two payments to be made to job seekers whose allowances had been deferred due to a breach of obligations. amendments to the consequential amendments bill before the committee remove the of requirement to make these two additional The committee did not have sufficient time to consult widely on the effect of these is amendments, which involve a complex policy that the committee could not investigate fully. The main issue to be addressed is amount of notice that is given before income support payments are deferred due to a breach of obligations. The committee is of the opinion that it is essential that due warning be given before payments are deferred. The amendments that remove these two additional payments are not consequent upon the introduction of the Employment Services Bill. The committee accepts, however, that the such provisions are not outside the broad scope of the long title of the consequential mendments bill, which is to amend laws 'in onsequence of the enactment of the Employent Services Act 1994, and for other urposes'. The practical necessity of the amendment must be recognised, but the committee does not consider that it is acceptable practice to introduce amendments by means of a bill that deals with a related act. Proposed provisions that affect the rights of individuals and are significant in terms of policy should be introduced to the parliament by way of a biIl intended principally to amend the relevant act. The case management system begins operation on 1 January 1995 and the community, the government and members of parliament, including committee members, are anxious to have the legislation in place as quickly as possible. The committee believes that this new system will help unemployed Australians to reach their full potential and contribute to Australia's international competitiveness. I pay tribute to the secretariat and the person seconded from the department who assisted in the preparation of this report. professional attitude has enriched the report. I commend their efforts to the parliament. I commend the report to the House.",71
58,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is an advisory report on the Employment Services Bill 1994. The committee took considerable evidence in a fairly rushed period with regard to the government's decision to establish Employment Assistance Australia and the Employment Services Regulatory Authority. Whilst the original government decision was not canvassed by the committee, I know that some of my coIleagues are in doubt as to whether this is an appropriate response to meet the government's claimed objective of giving assistance to the long-term unemployed and disadvantaged job seekers. Be that as it may, our job as a committee was to examine whether this was an appropriate process and whether the legislation before the parliament was an appropriate process to meet the government's objectives. All in all, I would have to say that we felt that, to a fair degree, the government's goals have been met by this legislation but that there are shortcomings in significant areas. The haste with which the process was being prepared-with multiple amendments appearing in the House even whilst the committee was in session-does not indicate that there has been a well thought through process. The fast-track proposal by the government to lobby to the parliament a framework of legislation and then attach disaIlowable instruments to it is not a very appropriate way to have the parliament, in an inteIligent manner, consider what it is doing. So the disallowable instruments come in at some later stage and mayor may not meet the goals of the parliament. In order to make changes, the parliament cannot amend but must disallow hoI us-bolus. That becomes a very difficult process for members and senators and it is one that both houses of parliament have tended to reject. The parliamentary committee reflects the views of the members of that committee and the members of this House who do not like being given an option Their to suck it and see. They want to know the detail. They are responsible people acting on behalf of their communities. Flexibility in some instances of job programs needs to be maintained. I think we all acknowledge that. You may suddenly find a group of people that you unexpectedly assess do not fall within the scope or ambit of a program, and you may need to move to bring them into provide assistance to them. I think that everyone here understands that. But, in the view of the committee, 13 disallowable instruments attached to a framework of legislation is undesirable. Recommendation 18 of the committee's report states: . .. in general, substantive matters should be included in primary legislation so that the content of the scheme is clear. The inclusion of such matters in disallowable instruments should be the exception rather than the rule. In this instance, I think the government is inviting a fair degree of hazard in what it is proposing to do. This bill-and subsequent amendments to other bills-was approached with a lot of goodwiIl by members of the committee. They understand the government's goals. They questioned whether another statutory authority was needed, whether all of the carry-on that is attached to this legislation was needed and whether the programs could be delivered in another way. One new thrust here is that private individual counsellors and people expert in providing information to job seekers wi\l be involved. That is an innovation. All of us who have been involved in jobclub, skillshare programs, NIESS programs or the like understand that there is expertise in charitable, hospitable organisations in the community and amongst private practitioners. They are excellent people who ought to be turned loose and given the opportunity to assist the unemployed equip themselves to gain employment. We all endorse that. The objectives seem to be clear, but there is a lot of unthought out substance between where we are now and where the government would like us to be. Things such as conditions of employment, case loads and the role of private counsellors or case managers are lacking in the framework that we as a House are considering. Even the priorities given by private case managers are lacking. These are some of the things that the committee came to grips with. It was the view of the committee that we should not delay the commencement date of 1 January. That is commendable. We all want the scheme to start up. However, I believe that the government has to go like biIlyo to get things right. The committee has made its recommendation. If the government does not follow this recommendation, it is buying trouble. It must have before the houses of parliament the disallowable instruments in full and complete written form before the House passes the legislation. To do otherwise is to accept that somewhere back in the bureaucracy or in the minister's office there is all wisdom and it has all been sorted out and finalised, and we pass the legislation and hope it goes right. I think that a lot of people in this place are very closely involved in their communities, know what problems can arise and are fearless in giving advice to the government about how they can be prevented. So, in the view of the committee, the government must present the drafts of the disallowable instruments arising from the Employment Services BiIl to be circulated before the passage of the biII through the parliament is completed. There are other matters in the legislation. It has been a very interesting inquiry. I would like to thank my coIleagues who are part of that committee. We believe that the privacy factors have been well attended to. It was an area that concerned some of us. There has been reasonable effort to prevent any breach of privacy or information about groups of individuals through data matching or about single individuals through private matters becoming known. So, with the recommendations adopted by the government, we believe the legislation should go ahead.",73
59,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"by leave-First I would like to commend the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and its staff. The fact that there was in so little time such a comprehensive report produced is largely a tribute to those who have spent far more time in the consideration of these issues than I confess that I have, although I am a member of the committee. Judy Middlebrook and those with her deserve great commendation, as does the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham). I want to look at what we have and where we are going and to register my concern at the way the legislation on which this advisory report is presented has come into the House with inadequate consideration. The genesis was the green paper presented at the end of 1993 after about six months of deliberations by the government on what all of us see and what the government should recognise as a major social and economic problem, that is, continued high unemployment and its fallout and the way the far too many long-term unemployed are finding difficulty in getting jobs. Nearly fi ve months later, in May 1994, the white paper Working Nation was presented. It was followed very shortly by this bill, the Employment Services Bill, on which this advisory opinion is presented. The difficulty I have is that the government, if it had acted in the way that it should have, would never have got itself into the dilemma of presenting a totally inadequate piece of legislation to the parliament. It should not have been necessary for the committee to go through, as it has, a number of recommendations which suggest that when the government has worked out just what those other adjuncts to the administration of the biII are, which are going to come in by way of disallowable instruments, they should become part of the bill. Recommendation 28 essentially says that the disallowable instruments in clause 53 should be reviewed in 12 months to determine whether the definition of case management documents and case management rules can be incorporated in legislation. In my mind they should be in the legislation and the legislation should not be presented in the first place in a totally inadequate form. I have several fundamental concerns. The first is with respect to the running and operation of unemployment services. While Hilmer may well be a base by which you can induce efficiency-although I remain to be convinced-I am concerned that the Employment Services BiII is going to restructure the Commonwealth Employment Service in such a way as to provide yet another field for bureaucratic intervention. There are some very good people in the CES. All of us as members have regular contact with them. I remain to be convinced that setting up yet another agency, in this instance Employment Assistance Australia, will provide any better service to the unemployed. I want to help the unemployed. I am not there to help the instruments that provide help. I want to get the unemployed genuinely into employment. I remain to be convinced that the Employment Services Regulatory Authority and Employment Assistance Australia are the vehicles we should adopt. At other times in other places I have expressed strong views about Mrs Joan Kirner having been appointed as chairman of the Employment Services Regulatory Authority in view of the fact that she apparently applied on the grounds of ill health to get an additional payout from the Victorian parliamentary superannuation scheme. If she is not well enough to be a member of parliament, in my mind, responsibility as the chairman of ESRA should also be a matter for which she should have a health clearance. I am not aware that she did so. On the actual detail, the only other thing I wanted to refer to is a letter that came as one of the submissions to the inquiry. It has been accepted as submission No. 22, and is from the Brotherhood of St Laurence under the hand of Mr Ian Brain, director of the central highlands region. He makes two points. The first is that it is absolutely important that, if case management is to be introduced, you look at the extent to which case management is going to follow the long-term unemployed through the term of their search for employment and then eventually their employment in what is meaningful employment. In his letter he picks up the fact that there is worry at the moment about the way in which labour market programs such as LEAP and jobskill are treated as employment, meaning that perhaps the case manager will lose contact with the person entering so-called employment when in fact it is not continuing, unsubsidised employment. I would have liked to have seen that letter given greater prominence in the report for, to my mind, the whole basis of this report is to help the long-term unemployed more properly into full-time, unsubsidised employment. The government has introduced various devices to conceal the numbers of unemployed. Case management may be a way to help those who are unemployed into employment, but I remain to be convinced of the whole process. I commend the report to the House. It does have a number of recommendations which I think will improve the legislation, but I suggest that next time the government should introduce the first draft of the bill with a little less haste and attend to the detail without having to rely on a parliamentary committee to try to correct it.",74
60,Mr WILLIAMS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak brieOy on the report. It is another example, now the third, of the benefits of reference of bills to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. In this case, issues outside the normal range of issues considered by that particular committee were considered. The bill involves the significant innovation of involving the private sector, bodies other than the Commonwealth Employment Service, bodies outside the Commonwealth Public Service, in the management of long-term unemployed. It gave rise to consideration of new issues, such as how to apply the normal safeguards relevant to dealings between citizen and government, such as rights of privacy and the like, in this context. It is an experiment in many respects. No-one could disagree with the objective of i the legislation. It is simply to get the long term unemployed into jobs. No-one could disagree with the objective of getting that done as quickly as possible. I say that because it is only on that basis that the form lation which leaves important matters to delegated legislation, as yet unwritten, disallowable instruments, could be in any sense acceptable. The committee has sought by its recommendations to ensure that what is properly the subject of acts of parliament is dealt with in acts of parliament and not in delegated legislation. In the course of its work, the committee has given some consideration to another bill, a legislative instruments bill introduced in the Senate but not yet debated. This is also an important piece of legislation and, in my view, could properly be the subject of a further reference to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I would urge the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) so to move. The Employment Services Bill is an experiment. I hope very much that it is an experiment that works. If it does work it will mean that many long-term unemployed will actually get a job. If it does not work, I hope that the government takes prompt action to amend the bill to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that it does work. I commend the report to the House and join with other speakers in expressing my appreciation to the secretariat, who worked hard and long to ensure that the report was produced on a timetable set by the government.

61,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Order! It being not quite 3 p.m., I take this opportunity to respond to a matter of privilege that was raised by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) on Tuesday. The honourable member raised as a matter of privilege actions apparently taken by Australian Electoral Commission officers in Victoria. The honourable member informed the House that when proposed new electoral boundaries for Victoria were released in August members of parliament and other persons were given an opportunity to object and to submit amendments to the proposed redistribution. The honourable member said that one of legismember of the House had made such an objection and proposed new boundaries. The member had been told that his objections could be considered only on 20 September-a sitting day. The honourable member for Lalor pointed out that this requirement appeared to disregard the obligation of members to attend the House when it is sitting. Section 14 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act provides, inter alia, that a member may not be required to attend before a court or a tribunal on any day on which the House of which that member is a member meets. The honourable member for Lalor said that he believed that a prima facie case of breach of privilege existed, but on the information available to me I do not consider that a prima facie case has been made out. Nevertheless, this issue is an important one and I have written to the Australian Electoral Commissioner, forwarding a copy of the honourable member's remarks and drawing attention to the needs of the House in respect of the attendance of its members.

63,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the only thing which will help stock farmers in Australia when this drought is over will be the number of sheep and cattle individual farmers manage to save? While he did not address this matter in his statement yesterday, his government must have given it great thought over the last few tragic months of the drought. Will the Prime Minister indicate to the House and the rural community his analysis of the current national inventory of existing stock feed available for purchase? What is his advice as to that position if the drought continues until Christmas?",77
64,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is an attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to try to drag out a policy which has now been massively discredited by the farm community.,77
65,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,77
66,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You do not realise how much on the nose the National Party is out there. When you go around the farm community, you are held in utter and complete contempt. This is what farm leaders had to say about the National Party and the opposition's policy on fodders. The policy director of the National Farmers Federation said: I think the farmers certainly wouldn't have a widespread fodder subsidy as their top priority. He went on to say: Well, it is a bit disappointing in that the farm organisations collectively haven't been involved in the formulation of this policy. I think that is evident in the priorities not being lined up with what industry sees as being most important. Mr Tim Fischer-Is this your best quote?",77
67,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, there are better ones. Let me go on. He goes on to say: In 1982 a lot of benefits did not go to the sufferers of the drought. It went to people selling fodder. The President of the Cattlemen's Union, John Purcell, said: We have concerns over the possible market distortions that such a scheme could cause. We prefer to see a well-controlled concessionalloan scheme ... Let me just repeat that for you: Drought We prefer to see a well-controlled concessional loan scheme rather than a subsidised fodder scheme because it removes the concern over possible distortions of the market. There are people around who would abuse a subsidised fodder scheme, so it has to be well controlled. You are not doing too well at this point, are you? Mr MCGauchie, the President of the National Farmers Federation, said: Fodder subsidy schemes in the past have not been effective in terms of using the money most effectively and targeting those people who need the assistance most. Under the provisions that exist, if the rules are applied properly you can target the assistance to people who need it. There is one quote after another. Mr Banano in Queensland said: Theirthe coalitionpriorities might be the wrong way round. The article goes on in those terms. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order No. 145. The question related to the inventory of existing stock feed and the likely prospects of further stock feed between now and Christmas. It was a fair question. I ask that you direct the Prime Minister to answer that question.",77
68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is answering the question.,77

74,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister has the call.,77
75,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the National Party and the Leader of the Opposition should have the decency to say what the government did yesterday in relation to extending income support to families, turning RAS into a demand driven scheme for exceptional circumstances and increasing the limits on the subsidies paid to farmers to $100,000 within a year and $300,000 over five years. Mr Tim Fischer-We have acknowledged that.",78
76,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is the sort of support that farmers have asked for, but you have not been listening. Mr Anderson-We welcomed that.",78

79,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The leaders of the farming community's peak organisations such as the National Farmers Federation, the Grains Council, the Cattlemens Union and so on have a better idea than anyone of you will have about what is available for stock feed for farms and how their membership may best procure that on terms most acceptable to them. What we have done is back-in farm families and what you are trying to do is back-in fodder owners and sellers. That is difference. Mr Anderson-Wrong! You are wrong.",78
80,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Your policy was so utterly discredited. Everywhere I went in the bush in the last couple of weeks they were bagging you up hill and down dale. You were held in utter derision. You were held in utter facilities. contempt. Mr Tim Fischer-Two states.,78
81,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You absolutely hate it when the Labor Party, as it always has to do, comes to the rescue of the Australian farm community. You wince and cannot stand it. You put out niggardly press statements and make nasty comments on radio instead of getting above it all and looking at the needs of the farm community. You can never see the public value of going to a community that needs support. You are basically into nitpicking and trying to run a policy which is dead and so discredited that every farm leader in the country has bagged it. Drought",78
82,Mr SIMMONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister and I refer to the severe drought now being experienced in rural Australia. What are the implications for regional Australia and the farm communities that will flow from the measures which he and his colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy announced yesterday?,78
83,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government has had under review the difficulties which have been occasioned by the prolonged drought and its impact on farmers and farms, particularly in exceptional circumstance areas. As a consequence, the government said it would consider an approach to policy to deal with the problems of the drought on a systemic basis. It has very clearly honoured that promise. I said a couple of weeks ago that we would not leave those in trouble in the farm community behind. We have made good on that commitment. The five major elements of the package announced yesterday are: income support; looking after the education of children of farmers in drought; providing additional the financial assistance to farmers for carry-on finance and increasing dramatically the limits for maximum levels of assistance; improving the ability of farmers to access RAS without first selling off-farm assets or liquidating legitimate superannuation and other retirement assets; and the development of incentives for the provision of farm storage and water This is a very comprehensive package. It costs about $164 million over two years. Because it is essentially demand driven, if the exceptional circumstance areas are extended, it will end up costing the budget more than what was announced yesterday. The change to income support is being sought by many farm families. Even though they do not have an income from their farm, because of the assets test, they were unable to get the bsearch allowance. The payment made nder the jobsearch allowance was incapable f being paid as the assets test debarred many rmers who had substantial assets but no come. A new payment, the drought relief payment, will provide farm families with sufficient cash for basic necessities and services. Payments will be made to farm families, and exceptional drought declared areas will not be subject to the assets test but will be subject to the JSA income and offfarm assets tests. One of the great concerns of the drought is that it is putting at risk the whole notion of the continuation of family farms and rural society. People are leaving farms and their children are not taking up farming. We want to keep farmers on their farms. By giving them income support and farm finance, they will have the chance to stay on their farm and carry on. The other concern that farmers expressed to me, to Senator Collins and to other ministers, was that children, because of financial necessity, have needed to be withdrawn from schools. From yesterday, to overcome this problem and to assist here, the existing Austudy farm assets test will be removed for all families in exceptional drought areas. The current Austudy income test happens to be more generous than the jobstart allowance income test. The Austudy income test is the one that will apply, not the assets test. That will mean that many children from farm families will be able to remain in schools and in secondary education. In relation to farm finance, as I said a few moments ago, the changes to the rural adjustment scheme will be demand driven. At the moment, it is cash limited. Even though somebody may succeed in an application for support, that person is often not fully paid because the scheme does not have enough money in it. We have now topped that up to make it demand driven. Eligible people will now get the full amount due to them-up to 100 per cent interest subsidy for viable farms. With the 100 per cent interest subsidy farmers can make the decision to either go on and put in another crop or use the subsidy to help manage the debt they have picked up in the meantime. I mentioned a moment ago that we have increased the limits under that farm finance RAS assistance from a maximum annual assistance of $50,000 to $100,000, and we are lifting the cumulative limit from $100,000 to $300,000. Under that arrangement between $1 million to $3 million worth of debt could be handled. In addition, we are excluding bona fide retirement assets. Many farmers have bought themselves a house in town or a house on the coast so that when their children take over the management of the farm they have somewhere to live. Under existing RAS arrangements, they had to sell those properties before they could receive RAS support. We are excluding bona fide retirement assets and offfarm assets of that nature from the RAS assets test, and that will make a tremendous difference in the capacity to qualify. To help farmers in the recovery phase, we are extending these arrangements six months beyond the end of the declaration of exceptional circumstances. As well as that, we are looking at the development of a set of incentives, the provision of farm storage and water facilities, a generous investment allowance and possibly faster depreciation. But we want to work this out with the peak farm bodies. As a package, it comes down to these five things: giving income support, looking after the education of children of farmers in the drought, providing additional financial assistance to farms for carry-on finance and increasing dramatically the limits for maximum levels of assistance, improving the ability of farmers to access RAS without first selling off-farm and retirement income assets and developing an incentive for the provision of farm storage and water facilities. All those things add up to a very large change in public policy which has been adopted by the government for the support of the farm communities. Instead of the coalition cavilling at all of these changes, it should have been supporting them. Rather, the first question the Leader of the Opposition asked today was about his fodder subsidy. I hope this will really be of material assistance to Australian farmers and Australian farm families. As a consequence, they and their peak bodies will believe that their consultations with the government have been real and worthwhile. Drought",78
84,Mr WAKELIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Yesterday the Prime Minister announced a drought package aimed at drought stricken farmers in Queensland and northern New South Wales. He would be aware that South Australia is also experiencing one of the driest years on record, which follows on from two years of rain damage, mouse plague and frost. With this in mind, what assurance can the Prime Minister give to South Australian farming families that the federal government's drought package will be extended to South Australia?",80
85,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The principles behind the package are the principles which have been articulated to us by peak farm leadership groups over time. That is, we have in place the 1992 drought policy, which my colleague the present Minister for Employment, Education and Training negotiated and put into place. But with the exceptional circumstances, with droughted areas being consistently droughted for three and four years in a row, we found that there needed to be a policy that dealt with the exceptional circumstances that happen to apply. If certain shires of South Australia were declared to be exceptional drought areas, they would qualify for this assistance. Were they not to be, they would come under the normal provisions of the 1992 drought policy. The policy is there for farmers in South Australia. In the event that the drought and the circumstances see certain shires declared as exceptional areas, this assistance will be there as well. I notice that today's Adelaide Advertiser has a very paltry headline, which we have come to expect from that newspaper. The article failed to communicate to the farm community the strength of the policy changes adopted yesterday and to indicate they would be available to the South Australian farm community in the event that the drought conditions were similar to those that apply in parts of New South Wales and Queensland. I hope this policy change will receive additional treatment in newspapers in the next couple of days so at least people in the country can understand what the policy changes actually mean. Drought",80
86,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. In view of the severe effect of the drought on large parts of Australia, can the Treasurer advise the House what impact it will have on the overall economy? Does the government still expect the economy to grow at 4112 per cent this year?",80
87,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. While the drought is a matter of enormous importance and severity for those people who are directly affected by it, it also has a wider effect on the whole economy. The significance of the drought is such that we are now seeing a quite significant impact on the whole of the rural sector in terms of its overall performance. Farm incomes are forecast by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics to fall by about 27 per cent this year, with gross farm product down 16 per cent and net farm product down 28 per cent. The grain crops in particular are very severely affected, with wheat production to fall by 38 per cent and barley by 50 per cent. Of course, with effects like that in the rural sector, the overall economy has to feel the impact as well. When we put the budget together, we had made some allowance for the drought but, in the months since, it has become much more severe and therefore the impact on the overall economy has to be altered. As calculated by the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, the overall effect of the drought now will be to reduce gross domestic product by about 0.5 of one per cent. That one-half of one per cent effect is on top of the effects that we had built into the budget, so we are looking at a significant impact on economic growth this year but still, having started at 4112 per cent, having substantial underlying growth. That is the direct effect; on top of that, we must expect secondary effects. Farmers who have less income spend less; therefore, there is a flow-on effect to other people in affected areas, and so one has an impact which is accentuated in that way. The package that the Prime Minister announced yesterday and expanded on today is going to cushion that effect to some extent. We will also be cushioned, in terms of the effect on the overall economy, by other developments since the budget and, in particular, by what is happening in the world economy. I will take the time of the House to mention some aspects of that. We are particularly looking at economies like the United States, which marked up its growth for 1994 considerably from earlier this year-from three per cent to four per cent. Japan has marked growth up slightly, and much more significantly for 1995. Germany, which originally expected growth this year of less than one per cent, is now expecting growth of almost two per cent and 2'h per cent next year. So growth for the OECD overall is expected to be one-half a per cent higher than originally expected for this year and much higher in 1995. The overall effect of that for us is to push up our commodity prices. ABARE now forecasts that total international commodity prices will rise by five per cent in 1994-95, and the price of our rural commodities will rise by 11 per cent. Despite the drought, this will give us, according to ABARE's predictions, a record level of rural exports of $19.1 billion. I emphasise that, despite the drought, we will have a record level of rural exports. Mr Tim Fischer-But half a billion less than would otherwise be the case.",80
88,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is certainly true. A major factor in that record level is that wool prices are 30 per cent higher than last year, on the forecast, therefore giving us that outcome. Other commodity pricesminerals-are also expected to be higher. Overall, we are seeing this as an offsetting factor of some considerable significance. The overall effect of the impact of the drought dragging growth down and the international recovery lifting growth up is expected to be that we will see growth for this year not at 4'h per cent but about 4'/4 per cent-a decline of roughly a quarter of a per cent of GDP. That is not an official forecast at this stage. ABARE's forecast is 4.3 per cent, and I think the view of the government at this stage would be that that is pretty right. So, despite the impact of the drought, we can see that the economy is fairly well cushioned from the overall effects, although there will be some impact of the order that I have mentioned. In the case of underlying features like employment, we are already seeing stronger growth than that which was forecast in the budget. There is no reason to expect that we will not do much better than the budget forecast on unemployment. We are already at the 9'h per cent rate that was forecast in the budget. By the end of this financial year, we its can expect to be well below that level. Severe as the drought is and important as it is for the rural sector, the overall impact on the economy is not going to be too severe as we see it at this stage. Tariffs",81
89,Mr CLEARY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. The industry minister, Senator Cook, was recently quoted in the Australian as saying your government might offer tariff concessions on TCF imports in return for special market access for Australian exports. If the paper The rebirth of Australian industry as cited by Tim Colebatch in today's Age is correct in arguing that sectoral policies not tariff cuts were responsible for the alleged rebirth of Australian industry, are we to conclude that Senator Cook's version of industry policy, which he described as the 'next generation of industry policy', is simplistic and will do no more than bring uncertainty to the TCF industry and diminish rather than increase jobs in a significant Australian industry? Finally, if trade-off tariff cuts are record now government policy, is it you and the industry minister and not the former Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, who should be wearing the Captain Zero tag?",81
90,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not read that article in any detail; I saw the headline on it this morning. There is no doubt that industry policy in Australia under this government has had two elements to it. The first element removed the notion that there is a right to easy profits and protection through the tariff barrier provided by tariff levels with effective rates for some industries in the 250 per cent area. It was believed that this was too large a burden to shoulder the Australian consumer with because there was not a decent trade-off in wages and employment for the kinds of costs which were imposed upon them, and that by removing the tariff wall we would introduce competition, competitive breezes, so that our industry was not only competent at import competition but also the whole notion would be supportive of the government's anti-inflationary policy. We have seen a very large change in tariff levels already, and the removal of tariffs is no doubt playing a role in maintaining inflation at a low level. The most important role of our industry policy is to change the psychology of industry. A notable member of an industry group came to me a week or two ago and said, 'I'm a member of the 180-degree club.' I asked, 'What's that?' and he said, 'I'm one of those people who thought tariffs were 100 per cent right and I now think the policy has produced changes I could never have contemplated, with enterprise changes at the work place, people on the job looking for productivity improvements, and a changed attitude amongst executives. I have turned 180 degrees in favour of the government's policy. I never thought I would ever say that.' That is what I think has changed. The support the government has given to particular sectors where it thought there was an opportunity for improvement has also helped. You can see this in shipbuilding, with the launch of the ANZAC frigate this week, with the Collins class submarine when the government wanted a defence industry created, with the dual hulled aluminium catamaran ferries and with other lighter categories of ships, and in the computer software area. These things have made a difference, but I do not think you can argue that that is the reason why industry policy has changed. I have great respect for the person who wrote that article, but he does have a little to grind about tariffs and industry policy. I do not believe that an analysis of what has happened in Australia could lead anyone to conclude other than that the most telling policy change has been not the sectoral industry assistance plans but the removal of tariffs. That has been the primary change, and well it might have been. I was asked further about what trade-offs Australia might give for any removal of barriers elsewhere around the world. We have been principally through that with the GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the World Trade Organisation arrangements coming out of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. So that is behind us. Of course, Australia's changes went far and away beyond anything that we might have been required to offer in the round. In APEC, we are speaking about a GATTplus set of arrangements. There is some prospect over time that, with a declaration of free trade in the Pacific, we could get to a point where there is a lot more market access for Australian industry. That may involve certain trade-offs at that point. If this ever happens, which I think it will, it is a long way off. What has certainly happened is that we have seen an enhanced investment in the TCF industries. The growth in exports from TCF industries has been really quite profound. The fact that for the first time in decades we are now getting a real wave of quite strong investment in the TCF area means that the policy has worked. Those industries which the honourable member concerns himself withand not unreasonably-and which went through a fairly substantial period of structural adjustment, particularly in Melbourne, have now stabilised themselves and are growing. They are finding that, with their new investments, they have more capacity to grow further. I think success breeds success. Rather than fear any further change, what we want is a more pro-competitive, pro-trade environment. In essence, that has been the government's policy. We extended that in the GATT; we are extending that through into APEC. Were that to be the case, I am sure the axe Australian consumer would be better off. We would have lower prices but more volumes, and we would have an even stronger set of TCF industries in Victoria than we have this very day. Enterprise Bargaining",81
91,Mrs EASSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer to the decision yesterday by the Industrial Relations Commission to grant a pay rise to low paid workers. Is the decision of the commission consistent with the government's intention to ensure that all Australians benefit from the economic recovery and is it consistent with enterprise bargaining principles?,83
92,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government welcomes the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission yesterday to grant three $8 a week safety net pay rises. The decision is clearly consistent with enterprise bargaining principles and with the continuing low inflationary recovery of the economy. The first $8 is for those workers who have not received a wage increase as a result of enterprise bargaining since November 1991. November 1991 was some time away, yet we have seen an enormous pick-up in the economy and a huge pick-up in profits. It is not only sensible but just that such a wage increase should be agreed to. The second pay rise is available from today at the enterprise level. It is subject to a number of tests, including that the union has genuinely sought an enterprise agreement and has been unsuccessful; in other words, that the union has not been able to access the enterprise bargaining stream. The third $8 be available at the enterprise level from 22 September 1995. That will be for those without an enterprise bargain. This is a set of very just and sensible arrangements in a wage system which has served the country well for over a decade. Its safety net quality is such that, if an employee were to have received, say, a $20 a week enterprise bargaining related wage increase, he or she would be entitled to $4 under the safety net. In other words, this arrangement of its essence a safety net, as the government said. When the legislation was introduced, the minister made clear why we think it is the sort of policy that holds together the award system as the guarantee of that safety net and, he want? at the same time, why it allows for enterprise bargaining to go on. At the same time, the commission has decided that it will develop a set of detailed principles by which awards can be reviewed through a pilot award review program. Where necessary, awards will be changed to make them easier to understand, easier to adapt to the needs of the enterprise, and nondiscriminatory. Justice O'Connor said: We have decided to introduce a range of measures to make the award system more flexible so that they are suited to particular needs of the enterprise. These measures will mean the effective use of enterprise flexibility clauses, facilitative provisions and majority clauses. In this process, the enterprise and its needs must be taken into account as well as consideration of an adequate safety net of award wages and conditions. So there you see, Mr Speaker, the commission comprehending the general view that the government has put and where we have seen these affordable increases come through. They add about half a percentage point to the national accounts based AWE for the year. They are already factored into the 1994-95 estimates. I was disappointed that the decision met with opposition from the employer groups. You have to ask them what they want after there having been no wage increase for these people since 1991. Would you deny anyone who had received nothing since November 1991 a wage increase of $8 at a time when we have seen huge profits in the economy, will the highest profit share in our history and executive salaries blowing their brains out? Mr Costello-A new industrial relations policy.",83
93,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"National accounts AWE includes on-costs. But I do not expect you to know that. As a consequence of this, I was disappointed with Mr Noakes. Mr Noakes seems to oppose everything that comes out of the is commission. After all, we are looking at the broadest measure of inflation: the non-farm GDP deflator in the national accounts two weeks ago at 0.8 per cent for the year. We have profit share at record levels. What does The opposition industrial relations spokesman has said that the decision makes a mockery of any suggestion that the awards are not still all-powerful and that it makes a mockery of changes made last year. That is not true. The awards are there as a safety net. The enterprise bargains can then be undertaken on a productivity related basis. I say to the opposition spokesman that something must be working because the inflation rate is under one per cent in its broader measure and between one and two per cent. Mr Downer-Because you left behind the unemployed.",83
94,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, how come you had 800,OOO-odd people out of work and you had double digit inflation in 1983, when you were helping Mr Fraser in his office? You were obviously a great help at the time. This is a very good outcome. It is a fair just outcome that keeps the wage system relevant and working. We are now in our 11th year in the accord. The accord has now met with substantial acclaim around the world from the OECD and other bodies and, indeed, from a lot of industry groups in this country. Yesterday'S decision is a very sound one. It is really about time that the opposition in this country understood that there has to be a bit of public decency for people on low incomes. You should not take the view that wherever you hear the term 'wage rise' it is like garlic to a vampire and that you do not want to hear about it. The fact is that this was a just outcome. In the face of the bounty which the economy is providing in terms of the growth of executive salaries and profits, who could reasonably deny people on these levels of income a topup wage increase of these dimensions? Native Title: Uranium",84
95,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question, which is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, relates to my trade portfolio. Does the minister's concept of Aboriginal self-determination include the Aboriginal people of Koongarra, who have expressed the view that a uranium mine should be allowed to proceed at Koongarra in the Northern Territory? Will the minister support the vote for an end to the absurd and iIIogical three-mine uranium policy at the forthcoming national conference of the Labor Party? In fact, which vote will he support? Will he vote with the Left or with Aboriginal self-determination relating to his portfolio? Mr Costello-Don't get self-righteous.",84
96,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Certainly not. Mr Downer-How are you going to answer this question?,84
97,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition. The minister has the call.,84
98,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When we are talking about Aboriginal affairs, Mr Downer, you ought to be a bit quieter.",84
99,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Especially given the way he has been knocked around on the matter.,84
100,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think so. When this and question was asked by the honourable member for Gippsland-it was almost the same question-about three weeks ago, I made the point that the member had unmitigated gall to come into this place and ask a question about Aboriginal affairs. To have a question come from the Leader of the National Party on an issue relating to the rights of Aboriginal people-I mean, you ought to hang your head in shame to come into this House",84
101,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,84
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister might wait for a moment. Those on my left on the front bench will cease interjecting. The minister has the call.,84
103,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Coming from a member who more than any other member of the coalition has sought to attack and undermine Aboriginal rights, I find that question most extraordinary. If the Leader of the National Party read the Hansard, he would know that an identical question was asked three weeks ago. I stand by the answer I gave three weeks ago. Mr Keating interjecting",84
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, Prime Minister; do not involve yourself. Veterans: Aged Care",84
105,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Has the minister seen reports in some of today's newspapers which suggest that veterans will be encouraged by the government to 'share housing'? Can the minister comment on these reports? Can the minister also inform the House what measures are being undertaken to improve access to aged care service for veteran sponsored facilities?,84
106,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Perth for his question. Approximately 340,000 veterans receive some sort of entitlement from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Their average age is 73 years. Of those 340,000 veterans, approximately 40 per cent are aged over 75 years. It is envisaged that, by the year 2004, almost 70 per cent of them will be aged over 75 years. Interestingly enough, some 30 per cent of all males in this country over the age of 70 are, in fact, veterans. As a result of this, access to aged care is a very big issue for the veteran community. I have been told that there are some problems in terms of veterans getting appropriate aged care hostel places and nursing home places in certain areas. For instance, the War Widows Guild in Western Australia has a million dollars that it wants to spend to set up an aged veterans' home in Como in Western Australia, but it is unable to do so because there are not sufficient beds allocated to that region. I have discussed this matter with the Minister for Human Services and Health and we have agreed to set up a task force of members from both the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Human Services and Health. That task force will report back to me and the minister in February next year to see whether we cannot improve access, given that the demand for aged care services in the veteran community will increase by something like twice the rate of that in the general community. Turning to the first part of the honourable member's question, I have seen this morning's reports. I assure members of our veteran community that the government is not encouraging them to reside together. We are not saying that they should share housing. I think that the appropriate newspapers got it wrong-quite innocently, I would suspect. However, a number of people",85
107,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was not the Adelaide Advertiser, was it?",85
108,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was, actually. Mr Costello-It was the Adelaide Advertiser!",85
109,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Don't give him a lead.,85
110,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was quite an innocent mistake in this case. A number of veterans say to me that they have a preference for veterans' homes where they can talk about their common experiences, discuss matters and be in a friendly atmosphere with people who are their peers. They want to be able to get into homes such as the RAAF memorial homes at Bullcreek in Western Australia, where residents have independent living before going on to hostel accommodation, frail aged care and then into the nursing home-all in the one community. That is what we are talking about. It seems that there is a demand for that sort of thing by the veterans, and that is what I am specifically being told. I want to make that point very clear because I think it is important and we do not want to frighten any of our veterans. Finally, I thank the honourable member for Perth and the honourable member for Lilley, both of whom have given me a great deal of support in setting up this task force. I can say that their interest is very genuine because, in one case, his father is a living veteran and, in the other, his father was TPI. I thank them and I hope that this report comes out with something good which will help the veterans. Australian Electoral Commission",85
111,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the minister acting for the Minister for Administrative Services aware that in a recent investigation the Australian Electoral Commission discovered in a political party's electoral funding return two discrepancies, one for 3c and the other for 38c? As the commission is obviously so thorough, and given the revelations concerning apparent large scale corruption in the Western Australian branch of the Labor Party, will the minister now instruct the Electoral Commission to conduct a full inquiry into the misuse of money? Will the minister also ensure that the investigation includes the role played by the current federal Minster for Human Services and Health, who has admitted today on radio that she has knowledge of this matter, and the former state secretaries who are now in the federal parliament?",85
112,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the Electoral Commission might have a passing interest in the Liberal Party's fundraising in your electorate, which is now the subject of constant police investigation, including a couple of your state colleagues. No doubt as time transpires there will be a great deal that will intrigue the Electoral Commissioner arising from those inquiries. I am afraid, old son, that when you go down the particular track that you have sought to go down in the last few days you never know where it is going to end up. If I were you I would think really carefully about it. I also note that in the returns that were put in place by the various political parties in the course of the last election campaign the Liberal Party received something like $8 million more than the Labor Party. I also note that you were dragged absolutely kicking and screaming into disclosure legislation in this place and in Western Australia you have still not proclaimed the legislation on declaration of interests. As it happens, the particular member to whom you referred is a state member. Statements have already been put out by the various people who have discussed this that quite clearly indicate the nature of the contribution in that area. If the Electoral Commissioner has an interest in those matters no doubt he will take that into account, as he is an independent officer of the Commonwealth, and will interest himself in the matter. He is obviously very welcome to do so. As I said, there will be from time to time a load of things come out of interest to the Electoral Commission on party donations. Just make absolutely certain, when you get in this place and sling mud, where it is likely to end up. Economic Recovery",86
113,Mr CLEELAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Minister for Finance aware of claims that Australian economic recovery is being held back by uncertainty and lack of confidence in economic management, particularly the government's management of budget outlays? In light of these claims, is it the intention of the government to alter the budget settings? If not, why not?",86
114,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of those claims. They emerge from that wonderful document, which only we discuss now in this place, The Things That Matter. You hear nothing from the opposition about the policies in that area. In that document they say, 'Labor's policies are creating uncertainty and concern about the future and undermining the confidence needed to invest.' The public has no confidence, according to that document, in the management of the economy by the government in its budget strategy and therefore it does not invest by implication. We have some evidence recently about precisely what the public does think about those various heads under which outlays appear as to whether they are better handled by the government or the opposition. We had the Newspoll the other day which said that for the first time in the history of this government in every single area of policy covered by budgetary matters the government has the confidence of the public as opposed to our opponents. In 'who is better able to handle budgetary policy related to unemployment?' we win 39:28; in health and Medicare, 45:26; in environment, 34:21; in family issues, 39:26; in welfare and social issues, 44:23; in interest rates, 40:28; in inOation, 40:29; in taxation, 39:30; in balance of payments, 36:32; in women's issues, 39:20; in industrial relations, 44:26; in immigration, 34:30; and in Aboriginal native title issues, 40:21. I notice that the opposition leader's parliamentary secretary said the other day in an article that he also wrote in the Australian that 'it is also untrue to claim that most voters do not know what the Liberal Party stands for'. I suppose you have to say, after looking at a survey like that, that he is probably right. Campaign Funding",86
115,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services. At the trial last week of former Western Australian Deputy Premier, David Parker, on charges of stealing donated campaign funds, the President of the Senate and former ALP state secretary, Senator Beahan, stated that the Labor Party had used campaign funds to pay the gambling debts of a Labor candidate. Yesterday, the Western Australian shadow Attorney-General, David Smith, on resigning from his shadow portfolio, was reported as saying that it was not true that the party had paid his gambling debts, that in 1991 and 1992 he had borrowed $40,000 from the Labor Party and that the loan had not come from campaign funds but had been borrowed by the party from a bank. Senator Chris Evans, another former ALP state secretary, is also reported as saying that the Labor Party had lent money to Mr Smith.  using campaign funds for private purposes, and in view of the conflict between the testimony of Senator Beahan on the one hand and the statements not under oath of Mr Smith and Senator Evans on the other, will the minister ask the Australian Electoral Commission to investigate the matter in order to determine whether the moneys came from campaign funds, from borrowings or indeed from public funding?",86
116,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are a couple of points that I would make. You above all  has been charged with other offences and his situation is sub judice. You above all members ought to know that it is entirely improper to canvass those matters in this place. That is the first thing. The second thing is that I made exactly the points you made in answer to the question asked by the previous questioner from your side. I cannot make the same response to you. As far as I know, the affairs of the Liberal Party in your electorate are not under police investigation, unlike the situation in his electorate. Nevertheless, the issues raised, to some extent, go to how parties are funded. I point out that, if funds are raised for administrative purposes or are secured by party operations for administrative purposes, different issues apply to them. I am sure that, if the Electoral Commissioner feels that there is something raised in this area that is a matter of interest to him, he will investigate it. That is entirely a matter for him. Legal System",87
117,Mr QUICK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General. What steps has the government taken to make the legal system fairer, more efficient and more effective? In addition, what steps are being taken to increase access to justice for all Australians and their ability to protect their rights? What alternative approaches have been suggested?",87
118,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Members will be aware of a great deal of effort which is going on in the Australian community in terms of the question of access to justice. Clearly, these are important matters. In May we had the report of the Access to Justice Advisory Committee-1 10 submissions have been received in relation to that matter-and then in August there was a forum in this chamber in which a range of people spoke, including the Prime Minister. I suppose there are two streams to be considered in this broad issue: the first, questions of access to our courts and exercising one's rights through there; and the second, the state of the substantive law itself and how adequately that actually provides for people's rights. Being very keen on the further consideration of these issues and knowing that the font of all wisdom does not always rest with the government, I have looked for alternative approaches. The first document I looked at, from which I was hoping to get some guidance, was The Things That Matter statement. I am sure members will recaIl, if they dredge into the back of their memory, that particular document. Obviously, in this area, things did not matter too much because the statement had very little to sayan the issue of law and justice, although it did make some interesting statements about commitments to individual rights and freedoms. So I went a bit further afield to find guidance on this matter and discovered the Liberal Party platform. This is a document with which I know honourable members will be very familiar. A section under the heading 'Justice and Law Reform' says, in part: The rule of law is fundamental to an assurance of justice without discrimination or partiality ... This principle protects the individual against arbitrary interference. The Liberal Party believes that the Commonwealth should give effect to these principles byand then it lists some dot points, one of which states: protecting the civil liberties of the individual society, including the recognition of civil, political and social rights according to international conventions adopted by Australia ...",87
119,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You heard that, did you? He is not going to oppose it.",88
120,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is in the Liberal Party platform. I am delighted that members of the shadow cabinet have actually put their minds to this. They have decided not to support measures in this respect, but not to oppose them either. That is a nice little nuance of opinion.",88
121,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is a great display of strong leadership there.,88
122,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister mentions strong leadership. It is good to see that the Leader of the Opposition is obviously attempting to assert some control over the shadow cabinet. But apparently the issue has to go to the Liberal and National Party rooms. As I understand it, from the last report that I had when question time started at 3 o'clock, it seems that the debate is continuing. Maybe I am behind the times on this matter, but the issue has not been resolved.",88
123,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are a bit behind.,88
124,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is not surprising that the debate has not been resolved. We have seen the Liberal Party having more positions on this issue than are illegal under the Tasmanian criminal code. First we had outright rejection on the basis of states rights. That was the original position of the opposition. That changed when a press release was issued saying that there would be four principles against which any mechanisms would be judged; they would be ticked off and it would be seen whether they offended those principles. Then we had statements to the Tasmanian branch of the Liberal Party, particularly to the Premier of Tasmania, indicating very strong support for our colleagues in Tasmania and those laws which they advocate. But now, apparently, some sort of reason has come over it. Maybe the Chamber of Commerce got to the Leader of the Opposition and told him to change his view. Maybe he came across a corroboree and decided to change his view. in Who knows what led to it, but at least we are delighted that, even if there is not going to be support, there is not going to be opposition. These are fundamental issues for this parliament. It will be interesting to see how the National Party responds to this and how all these various segments of views, which try to coalesce in one party, actually draw themselves together. You cannot be serious about a system of justice and fairness unless you are willing and able to address these points and put behind you the view that governments have rights. It is individuals who have rights. The Liberal Party should understand that. It should support these measures absolutely and not be mealy-mouthed and say that it will not oppose them. Campaign Funding",88
125,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will be aware of federal legislation relating to public funding of political parties and the need for the utmost propriety in the expenditure of such taxpayer provided funds. This week, Prime Minister, you advised your caucus of your concerns relating to the corrupt practices in the WA branch of the Labor Party. As a member of federal executive, will you, this weekend, recommend the use of the ALP federal powers of intervention to conduct a full inquiry to root out all those who have been involved in or have endorsed these corrupt practices?",88
126,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I made no such reference in the Labor caucus-none whatsoever.,88
127,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why did you not deny it when it appeared in the papers?,88
128,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will return to his seat.,88
129,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But I can sit here.,88
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But not to interject.,88
131,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am denying it now. The reference I made was to the standing of the Labor Party in the state of Western Australia as a whole-that is, the federal and state branches of the Labor Party. I did not refer to corruption at all. Mrs Bishop-Why not?",88
132,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I could have referred to the fact that, at one stage, most of the Queensland cabinet was in the Boggo Road gaol. I could have referred to the fact that O'Connor! Tom Bums wanted to be the leader of the chain gang and he wanted to see them chained up along the street-you know, Don Lane, 'Shady' Lane, gaoled; Brian Austin, gaoled; Leisha Harvey, gaoled; New South Wales minister Terry Metherell, tax evasion and sacked; Tim Moore, corruption in apfront pointing sacked Metherell to a government job; Matt Singleton from the National who had an undisclosed interest in a development when he made representations on the developer's behalf, sacked from the ministry; Phil Smiles, the Assistant Treasurer, commitgave ted tax breaches and was sacked; Wal Murray, who in New South Wales created a climate of corruption, according to the with the north coast land development; Ian attention Causley, from the National Party, who created a climate of corruption with the north coast land development; and Tony Packard, who illegally used a listening device and had to resign. You know all about it over there. You are the specialists. You wrote the rule book. Only for one very friendly juror, we would have had Joh behind bars for his role in running the most corrupt state in the history of the Commonwealth. So, before those in the Liberal Party start talking about corruption in state governments, they ought to look at National Party in Queensland and New South Wales and all those people who, in the great tradition of the coalition parties, have had resign their position or spend some time Her Majesty's pleasure.

Might I suggest that honourable members refrain, otherwise I will Party, take appropriate action.",89
140,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is directed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs. It relates to an answer she yesterday concerning complaints by consumers about the lack of decent dispute settling systems in the home building indusICAC, try. Have Victorian consumers drawn her to a report on this issue, as it affects them, which has just been completed by the Victorian Parliamentary Public Accounts and Estimates Committee? Does this report severely criticise the operations of the Victorian housing guarantee fund and especially its failure to look after home builders' interests? Can the minister advise honourable members what action she can take in the interest of home builders to deal with the problems revealed by this report?",89
141,Ms MCHUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I did answer a question yesterday in relation to the problems the faced by consumers with the home building industry. I mentioned last year's TPC report, which recommended that the states do someto thing to solve this problem. We now have a at report which has just been tabled in the Victorian Parliament by its Public Accounts and Estimates Committee which shows that in Victoria consumers are really up against it. The report by the Victorian parliamentary committee shows that the Victorian housing guarantee fund, which is set up to guarantee domestic building work, is inadequately supervised, has an inadequate system of settling disputes and fails to provide sufficient information to consumers about the competency of builders. I will give just one example of the problem. The committee found in one case that a kitchen building company which failed to register probably more than 750 contracts with the fund-which breaches the housing contracts guarantee act-was allowed to back register more than 600 contracts without payment of registration fees and was not prosecuted by the Victorian office of fair trading and business affairs, which believed that a warning was probably appropriate. This Victorian parliamentary committee found quite properly that the office of fair trading should act immediately in these matters. The committee made some strong recommendations to the Kennett government to establish an independent building disputes tribunal, which is exactly what the TPC has recommended, to increase the monitoring of the housing guarantee fund, to abolish compulsory arbitration clauses-the cause of so many of the problems-and to provide plain English contracts. There are many more recommendations. The Victorian Law Reform Commission was well on the way to developing just those sorts of answers to these problems-a uniform fair trading contract for home builders-which would have solved these problems, but the Kennett government has abolished the Victorian Law Reform Commission. So now we do not know where we stand on this issue. Yesterday I recommended that states follow this matter through; that, when the next ministerial council on consumer affairs meets, the states report that they have done something in this area for Australian consumers. I certainly hope that this report by the Victorian parliament will get some action going in that state.",89

153,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,94
154,Mr FILING,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In answering a question during question time, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) mentioned that there was a police inquiry into Liberal funds in my electorate. It is an inquiry into an allegation that an individual raised funds in the name of the Liberal Party and hung on to them. That person has no official position, is not a member of the party and was rejected for preselection to the party when he tried to contest the seat of Moore. NA Drought",94
155,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received letters from the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) and the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 107, I have selected the matter which, in my opinion, is the most urgent and important; that is, the one proposed by the honourable member for Page, namely: The need to recognise the comprehensive array of initiatives by the Federal Government to assist farmers and their families in rural and regional Australia to cope with the severe drought. I therefore call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More thall the number of members required by the standing orders having risell ill their places",94
156,Mr HARRY WOODS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Page) (4.32 p.m.)It is fairly well demonstrated that opposition members· really do not want to talk about drought and their policy on it. They are ashamed and embarrassed by their policy. Ms HenzellWhich policy?,94
157,Mr HARRY WOODS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Which policy? That is welI stated. They do not have a policy. They are ashamed. They have pulIed every antic and trick to try to get out of this debate. But here they are and here we are to talk about drought, which is a matter of national importance and of great concern to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator ColI ins) and the whole caucus of the Labor Party. It is a matter we have treated seriously. We have consulted and come out with a program of policies that has been extremely welI received throughout Australia. I want to deal with the way that that policy has been accepted throughout Australia. It demonstrates very clearly where the opposition stands with farmers and farm organisations. The Australian Council of Social Service said: This much needed initiative will be applauded by the whole Australian community. That is true, because not only country people but also people who live in cities are applauding it. It shows the way that community members in Australia support each other. It is also demonstrated in the 'Farmhand' campaign that the Australian government-the federal Labor government-is supporting. The Queensland Farmers Federation president, Lex Buchanan, said on radio 4BC that he was very pleased with the package. National Farmers Federation president, Mr Donald MCGauchie, said that the extra measures were significant and that they would be of enormous benefit to farm families in severe drought. He said: The NFF and our member bodies will work closely with the Government to develop final proposals in these areas. The Grains Council of Australia president, Ian MACFarlane, said: Drought stricken farmers have been given new hope for the future with today's commitment by the federal government. He also said: ... PM and Bob Collins have done an extraordinary job in assisting droughtstricken farmers ... quite outstanding ... far better than (we) could have hoped for ... closed off no avenues ... gave a clear message there is hope ... farmers can look forward to the future. New South Wales Farmers Association president, John Crawford, said: A very significant step ... The government has taken an extraordinary step ... a giant leap forward to solving a major problem. The Prime Minister is to be applauded. The editorial in the Canberra Times stated: All reasonable people will applaud the drought relief package but especially the decision to abolish the assets test for assistance. I wanted to go through these examples to show the sort of reaction we get from the opposition. Mr Garry Goucher said on 31 August in the Canberra Times that the opposition was a bit out of step with the industry. That was not a really strong statement. He understated the position. He also said that the centrepiece of the coalition's policy of a subsidy for fodder was riddled with problems. What sort of reaction did Garry Goucher, the director of policy for the NFF, really get? A person who is normally conservative and as straight and honest as they come was labelled an idiot by the office of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello). In other words, if you do not agree with the opposition, you are an idiot. This morning, Ian Causley, the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, said that groups which have supported the federal government's policy are out of touch with the farming community. In other words, what he is saying, and what you are really saying, is that the Australian Council of Social Service, the Queensland Farmers Federation, the National Farmers Federation, the Grains Council of Australia, the New South Wales Farmers Association and others are out of touch. In other words, you are the only ones in touch. You come up with this line all the time. You say that the Labor Party does not understand and that the Labor Party is out of touch. But now you have gone that one step further. The Liberals think everybody else is out of touch with the farming community. The fact is that the Labor Party, all those farming groups and social service groups are not out of touch; the Liberal Party and the National Party are. Why did Ian Causley come out with that reaction? Because Donald MCGauchie made this statement in his press release: It is now up to the statesonce again, an understatementto meet their responsibilities ... He also said: Farm organisationsincluding the NFFwill be monitoring states' contributions closely. That is why we got the reaction from Ian Causley, the New South Wales state agriculture minister, and that is why you have labelled all these groups as being out of touch with the farming community. So how do you develop your policy? Do you develop it through consultation and with integrity? Do you make it well constructed? No. Let us have a look at how you do it. A report in the Australian of 9 September states: The chairman of the Coalition parliamentary primary industries committeein other words, the bloke in my position on your sidefirst knew of the policy on the morning of its release. Embarrassingly, Andrew was later asked to sit next to Anderson during the press conference. Little time was spent debating the policy in the shadow Cabinet of August 29, despite the potential fiscal size of the package, although one proposal from Anderson for concessional loans-to help reconstruct the sector after the drought ends-was sent to a special shadow Cabinet sub-committee. Mr Anderson-Has it ever occurred to you that the papers sometimes get it wrong, Harry?",94
158,Mr HARRY WOODS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We get squeals and squawks from those opposite all the time. There is a certain tunefulness about them. One, two or three of them are squealing along with Alexander's ragtime band, but most of them are in tune with 'Shakin' all over'. You can see that by the way that they have reacted to this MPI. They shake and shiver because they have no policy to answer it. It took those opposite just over one week to develop a drought policy after shadow cabinet first asked for one. There was no consultation. What did they do with all those groups that they are now criticising and saying are out of touch? Apparently, that is how the coalition's policy making process works these days. It has to be said that the Nationals have gone back-if they ever left it-to the good old days of pork-barrelling and unfunded campaign promises with the blessing of the Liberals. Mr Anderson-Tell us about the wharfies and ANL.",96
159,Mr HARRY WOODS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Here we go again. As soon as they are hurting a bit, it is rattle, rattle, rattle-a death rattle. That is the connection I want to make. I want to explain it to them. They have not consulted with all the peak farmer bodies such as those in New South Wales. They have not consulted. If they had gone through the proper process of developing policy, they would have come up with a policy very much like ours. But, no, the centrepiece of their policy is the old fodder subsidy, the oldest credited fodder subsidy, a fodder subsidy that provides a disincentive for producers to prepare for drought. Fodder subsidies tend to jolt demand, sending fodder prices through the roof. You have heard the Prime Minister today telling you about the corruption in the Queensland National Party in the past. You had a fodder subsidy up there in the 1980s of which 75 per cent-three-quarters-went to 16 per cent of the farmers. That is what you want to bring in again. It is no wonder all these peak body groups, which you say are not representative of farmers, are saying that they support our policy and not yours. There is absolutely no doubt that they are very focused in the way they say it. That includes the Cattlemen's Union as well, which has backed away from lending its support to a fodder subsidy scheme. The new president of the Cattlemen's Union, John Purcell, said he had concerns over the possible market distortions which such a scheme could hold. There you are over there still holding on to that fodder subsidy idea. You have slunk away from rural people like a dingo would slink away from a chicken pen. The Nationals",96
160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. Mr Anderson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I really think the honourable member should withdraw that. There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that I slink away from rural people. I spend a great deal of time moving around.",96
161,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. The honourable member for Page might withdraw.,96
162,Mr HARRY WOODS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I have not likened them to a dingo; I said that what they have done is similar to the actions of a dingo.",96
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In the circumstances, the honourable member might withdraw so that we can continue the debate. Mr Anderson- Mr Deputy Speaker, he is saying that I am a coward when it comes to confronting rural people.",97
164,Mr HARRY WOODS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Perhaps it is uncomplimentary to dingos, so I wiJI withdraw it.",97
165,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, without quali fication.",97
166,Mr HARRY WOODS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw it. The Nationals and the Liberals are in an absolute policy void. Here we have a $164 million program for farmers and they say that we are not representing farmers and that we do understand them. Yet all farmer organisations say we do. The policy of the landscape of the opposition is devoid of anything visible; in other words, it is barren. Perhaps the opposition could apply for drought assistance. You should not have too much trouble getting eligibility. After all, your last crop of policies was released in Fightback nearly four years ago and there was no pay dirt in that. It seems that every possible recruit to your parliamentary party is finding greener pastures outside the Liberal Party. I did see the drought policy of coalition members start to germinate a couple of weeks ago but, after just a few hours in the harsh light of day, it quickly shrivelled and returned to dust. Their policies are worthless. They have none. It is as simple as that. In comparison, the measures that we have introduced have been applauded throughout Australia by the peak bodies and by other bodies that you now say do not represent farmers. The drought relief payment will provide farm families with sufficient cash for basic necessities and services. Payments under DRP will be available to farm families in areas assessed to be in exceptional drought and will be subject to the income and off-farm assets tests that apply to the jobsearch allowance. The existing Austudy farm asset tests will be removed for all families in exceptional drought areas. Mr Bruce Scott-When wiJI we have that definition?",97
167,Mr HARRY WOODS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Here we have the $3 billion man interjecting-the fellow who is going to go out and influence community leaders by offering them $1 billion or $3 billion for infrastructure projects. He says, 'It doesn't matter what figure we have. We will allude to some proposal process.' In other words, let us go out and promise the world. It does not matter whether we get there or not. In relation to farm business support, there will be an additional $74.25 million for the RAS over 1994-95 and 1995-96. Your policies are absolutely discredited. We will provide counselling and support services and drought preparedness. In addition to that, the government will examine the possibility of providing further funding through its labour market programs to address land degradation. I conclude by complimenting the Prime Minister, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the cabinet of the federal Labor Party and the whole caucus on their support for this policy, this program, this new direction. The Prime Minister went out and saw the farmers and consulted with the farm bodies, as did the primary industries committee-some members of the committee are present-as did the cabinet and the minister. We put a lot of work in and, as a result, we got a well constructed policy. Where is the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer)? What happened to him? The last animal he saw sneezed in his face. Whilst he was wiping the stuff off, he muttered to the journalists, 'I hope you didn't get a shot of that.' Whilst doing all that, he managed to keep the silver spoon firmly implanted in his mouth.",97
168,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a cause of some regret to me that a member for whom I have always had a certain regard should seek in recent times to degenerate in two areas in a way that I think is unfortunate. The first area is in personal abuse-we saw that today-and the second is that he deliberately misconstrues our position, implying that there is but one aspect to our policy when I know for a fact that he was corrected on that yesterday. He was brought right across our very comprehensive and long standing policy position in a whole range of areas. You, my friend, belong to an outfit that has essentially gutted many things when it could have prevented a lot of the heartache now in place. You come in here and ask us to pat you on the back for having returned some of the vital drought assistance measures that you yourselves gutted 10 years ago. You want to be congratulated for recognising the drought years after it got serious in many parts of this country. You want to make out that you have paved a new way when, in truth, all you have actually done in many areas is match the coalition's long established relief measures, without yet matching the thing you keep talking about-preparing farmers for drought in the future. You want us to call you the saviours of the bush when it is your policies that have so crippled the capacity of the bush to cope with this mess and it is your policies that are increasing the cost burdens at the very time that we need to be reducing them. An amount of $164 million over a couple of years might be quite a bit of money, my friend-and we have welcomed the package as far as it goes-but let me remind you that that is for two years. We have just seen a three-quarters of a per cent rise in interest rates which will cost $120 million across the farm sector. We have warnings that there will be another one per cent rise in interest rates before Christmas, so that will cost another $170 million. Strike a light, I think you have a hide, my friend: you have a hide. I have made it quite plain that we welcome the package as far as it goes. Of course we welcome the package as far as it goes. In terms of the relief it provides, it neatly es the essence of our package for relief. You want to focus on just one aspect of what we have put up. You want to highlight one bit that has engendered a bit of debate, but we actually set out our policy quite clearly in terms of three Rs. The first was relief, which covered the need to provide effective quarantining from assets testing. Farmers facing decimation could not access what other Australians have been able to access for so long. You claim it is a big thing to finally put farmers in the package in the same bracket as others after years of hardship. You are beyond belief. That was No. 1. We put that up clearly. It has been there for a long time. The second was retention. It was about retaining as many of our viable farmers as possible, with as much of their farm infrastructure as possible. You have gone some way towards addressing that. You have gone a long way down the very way we recommended. The third is recovery. You have said you will talk about that as well. Welcome to the club, my friends. But we were there before you. You talk about consultation. You forget something. Where are all the farmers on that side? It just happens that a lot of us on this side are farmers. It just happens that some of us never stop moving amongst farmers. It just happens that some of us run farm businesses in some of the worse drought affected parts of this country. We have put up with the sort of economic environment you have imposed on us year after year. You have expected us to cope with the chill winds of every market force available, while you have quarantined and pork-barrelled your mates. You are outrageous. We have been fair enough to thank you and to acknowledge the value of what you have put in place. You might at least acknowledge the broad basis of our own policy approach. I will not back off that point. We move around a lot. Our policy has been in place for quite a while. I recall visiting Toowoomba, Queensland, about 18 months ago. When I was in Toowoomba one of the things that particularly disturbed me was that I heard matchstories about food parcels being needed all over the place. I had it put to me that there was a family tragedy being played out there and that kids in particular were suffering. That was 18 months ago. I came back into this place on 11 May 1993-you can find it on page 516 of the Hansard of 11 May-and said: As I stand here now, much of rural Australia faces nothing short of economic and social ruination. Huge areas of the continent now lie in drought, some 38 per cent of Queensland, some 23 per cent of New South Wales-and a lot more by the end of this month at the rate we are going-and many farmers are now in their third successive year without income. Coupled with disastrously weak commodity prices and the appalling economic environment in which they have to operate, created by this Government, the future now looks extremely bleak for many of our nation's farmers . . . much of the trouble the farmers face is the responsibility of this Government. What is more important is that the capacity of our rural industries to survive and return to prosperity will be determined largely by what the Government does from this point on. It must act and it must continue to act decisively to secure the future of the nation's rural industries. It must do so not just for the sake of affected farmers and their families but also for others. This is a matter of the survival of the towns and the villages that service the bush and, in the end, it is a matter of vital national economic importance. There are literally billions of export dollars at stake. Almost every sector out there in the bush faces agonisingly difficult circumstances. I went on to outline what was happening. That was 16 months ago. Then I warned of the personal tragedies when I said: Lately I have been moving around a little bit, and I would like to ponder a few of the grim realities, the personal tragedies, that are taking place out there. I outlined quite a few of those and went on to talk about the impact on families, about stress and suicidal despair being a reality. I pointed out that this was backed up by the comments, widely reported at that time, of the Reverend Noel Parke, director of Lifeline for south-west Queensland. Despite this, we have waited another 16 months for the government to act, and then it appears it only acted because of some marginal seats. As Tim Stevens of the Australian pointed out in his article of 17 September: The story of how Keating came to be kicking dirt for evening news bulletins is also the story of a drought catching everyone by surprise-politicianssome politiciansbureaucrats, even farmers. It is a story of how social and economic imperatives on the government to act eventually dovetailed with Labor's political imperative-winning marginal seats in nonmetropolitan Australia. He cannot have been talking about our side of politics because we have been talking about this issue for a long time and we have had a policy in place for a long time that broadly and comprehensively covers drought. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has only just woken up to the severity of the problem. Only four or five weeks ago in Townsville he said, 'Drought is a naturally recurring feature of the Australian environment and it is a farm management problem.' He dismissed it. But he suddenly discovered that he was way out of touch with where Australians were at. He found that he was condemned the length and breadth of the land. You talk about criticism by some people of one aspect of our policy, but your leader, the Prime Minister of this country, was rightly condemned the length and breadth of this country for his outrageously callous and misdirected remarks. It was only when he was shamed into it by the reaction of the Australian people to what he had said that he realised he had made a massive political mistake and reversed his position. Then he goes out into the bush and spends two hours with farmers. How long did he spend at the fashion parade in Sydney? He is an expert on farmers now. He knows them inside out. He can come in here and tell them what they think of the National Party. We have had a very solid drought policy for some years. I can wave it right here now if you want it. Had that policy been in place at the beginning of last year, when the election was held, the relief part of our package would have prevented a great deal of the heartache that we have seen. Remember? Relief was the first part of the package that we put forward. What is so amazing is that the difference between the rhetoric and reality in this place is obscuring the facts. You make out these vast differences. The relief part of your package simply catches up with the essentials of our program. You are still a long way from matching our farm retention and recovery package. I wish to make a couple of observations on direct comparisons. Firstly, the coalition's policy for a long time now has been that it would provide immediate family farm income relief by revamping the farm household support scheme and suspending the assets test on welfare payments. The government effectively has achieved the same thing, the same sort of relief, the same sort of outcome, the same sort of dimensions. Secondly, the coalition for years has been calling for children from rural areas to be given equal access to education by suspending the assets test on Austudy during times of extreme hardship. What did the government do yesterday? It did the same thing. Thirdly, the coalition has called for greater flexibility in increased funding under the RAS for farmers experiencing drought exceptional circumstances. While the government has allocated more money for RAS and eased requirements for the sale of non-farm assets, which is welcome, the basic eligibility criteria remain unchanged. We have yet to see just how many more farmers will get assistance under this package. Let us see the 1's crossed and the i's dotted before we get too excited on eligibility. Fourthly, the coalition has long recognised the need for assistance to cope once the drought breaks. We welcome the government's adaptation of this principle by allowing farmers to apply for RAS exceptional circumstances up to six months after the drought declaration is revoked with as yet unspecified assistance available for a further 12 months. That again is the direction that our policy clearly went in. But you accuse us of not wanting to debate these issues when you refuse to even acknowledge that it is in there. Let us come briefly to the question of the fodder subsidy, which was a new issue we raised. Shock, horror! The question of our national breeding flocks and herds is a very important national economic issue. It will not go away. There is a lot of misinformation going around. I note that it has died down a little. But the so-called escalation in prices that will result has happened. Over the last 12 months graziers have found that the price of wheat has gone from around $100 to $200 and they cannot afford it. It is virtually capped now because it is getting very close to world parity pricing. We still have a massive problem determining how we are going to keep our breeding flocks and herds alive. This is an issue that is not going to go away. Let me quote a few people who have differing views on this. Here is the flagship of Rural Press in this country: It's all very well for Primary Industries Minister, Bob Collins, and the National Farmers Federation to dismiss fodder subsidies as a flawed concept but the mounting evidence suggests no other aid measure will achieve the very necessary result of preserving the productive base of our livestock industries. Mr Harry Woods-Who wrote this?",97
169,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will Jet you take that up with rural press. You quote the Australian at us. Good grief! I happen to think Rural Press knows a little about rural Australia. There is a real dearth of people over there who understand rural Australia! The article continues: Unless this is achieved, Australia can say goodbye to its future as the world's leading apparel wool producer, which in tum will hasten the demise of apparel wool as an international fibre of contention. It will also put at risk Australia's hard-won position as premier supplier of beef to North Asia. An article appearing in Queensland Country Life-Queensland is the worse affected statestated that Senator Collins had thrown in the old red herrings but that a well-managed system of monitoring drought fodder assistance and usage would achieve a great deal of value for this country. Those opposite are selective quoters. A news release of NSW Farmers states: The Coalition drought initiatives just released are vital in order to address both the immediate problems and long term effects of the drought. The Government should be encouraged to adopt the measures put forward by the CoalitionMs Henzell-Nice photo in Queensland Country Life.",100
170,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"How about a bit of respect. Just hear me out. I know that you do not want to hear it. I repeat: The Government should be encouraged to adopt the measures put forward by the Coalition in a bipartisan solution to the drought problem that threatens every Australian, whether in the country or city ... Mr Leo MCLeay-What date was that?",100
171,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It was after the release of our package. The President of the New South Wales Farmers Association said yesterday on Country Hour: We still have to confront this vital issue of our national flocks and herds. It will not go away. It must be addressed. It must not be shirked. Those opposite might not understand this because they do not have much contact with farmers and do not seem to know much about rural industries. They ought to hear what the farmers are saying about the desperate plight they are in and about the importance of keeping their stocks and herds alive.,101
172,Mr SIMMONS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On 30 August I gave notice of a motion in our caucus, asking the caucus to give consideration to the suspension of the assets test for social security purposes and Austudy. Last Tuesday I was delighted when caucus unanimously endorsed that proposal. Obviously, in the time between 30 August and when the decision was reached yesterday by the cabinet a lot of work had been done, including a very successful visit by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to some drought ravaged parts of Queensland. It was interesting to hear the comments of the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), on who understands rural Australia. There is no doubt that the people on this side of the House understand what rural Australia is all about. We represent the largest country party in Australia, which has been the case for a number of years. We currently occupy some 28 seats that represent rural and provincial Australia. The Deputy Leader is suggesting that there is a real dearth of people on our side who understand rural Australia, but I think the facts speak for themselves. People have successively supported this government over a number of years, including the period between 1983 and the last election. It is interesting that the number of seats we hold in rural and provincial Australia remains the same. There is a downward trend in the support of the Liberal and National parties not only in their policy issues but also in their representation in this House. It is significant that the Liberal Party, this so-calIed once great party which is this year celebrating its 50th anniversary, is rapidly disappearing from rural and provincial Australia. Not too far behind it is the National Party. I am sure the next time an election is held that same trend will be repeated. We have heard comments this afternoon on the benefits of a fodder scheme. I was also fascinated to read the article by Tim Stevens. Like the Deputy Leader of the National Party, I do not necessarily believe everything that appears in newspapers to be absolute fact, and I acknowledge that. I thought the article by Tim Stevens on 9 September was interesting. He began by saying: It is not often that a conservative politician bearing $90 million in gifts is shown the door by farm leaders, yet this was the reaction from coalition backbenchers and the National Farmers Federation to the release of the opposition drought policy last week. I ask members to contrast that with the very laudatory and, I might say, well-deserved statements made yesterday by the farming organisations-not just by the National Farmers Federation but by a range of organisations throughout Australia-in response to the drought policy. The President of the Grains Council of Australia, Ian MACFarlane, who accompanied the Prime Minister during his visit to the drought ravaged parts of Queensland, last week said: Drought stricken farmers have been given new hope for the future with today's commitment by the federal government. The Prime Minister and Senator Collins have stood by their commitment to help drought stricken farmers. These commitments, given during recent drought tours, had given the rural community great expectations, which have now been met. That is a very significant comment. Let us get back to the fundamental issue: the benefits of the fodder subsidy. This matter was also raised by Tim Stevens in his article in the Australian of 9 September. He gave the policy perspective a real big serve-he is not the only one. An opposition Senate colleague from Western Australia came to the same conclusion. In a debate in the Senate on 31 August this year, Senator Panizza, a Liberal Party senator from Western Australia, said: I come to the point Senator Collins made about the stupidity of putting subsidy on fodder itself. I confess that I argued against that yesterday. Senator Collins-It's got some problems.",101
173,Senator PANIZZA,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, it has got some problems. I argued against it yesterday because I believe it should go on to freight instead. It is interesting that, even amongst their own team, coalition members cannot get their act together. Yet this group of people come in here and suggest that we do not understand the issues that affect rural Australia. It is significant to point out some of those measures in the course of this debate. In my belief, the principal one was the notion of a drought relief payment, which will provide farm families with sufficient cash to be able to purchase the basic necessities of life. I have had drawn to my attention examples-I am sure honourable members on all sides have had similar examples drawn to their attention-of often quite embarrassed women from farming communities going to a Social Security office and saying, 'For goodness sake, do not tell our husbands we are in here getting some form of welfare assistance.' I have made the point time and again that farmers and their families should be no more embarrassed about accepting social security payments than should a disadvantaged worker in a manufacturing plant in Sydney or Melbourne. They should be no more disadvantaged than anyone else that is there to be captured by the safety net that is social security. The real trap has been the assets test, which has been a real barrier to allowing those payments to be accessed. I make no bones about it: I believe this was overdue. That was the reason I felt strongly enough to get up and argue the case in caucus. I was confident that, following recent events in the cabinet, by Senator Collins and more latterly by the Prime Minister, a motion along those lines would enjoy very strong support. It is an important issue. This payment, through the range of measures, will mean that a farmer, his wife and a couple of kids will have upwards of $25,000 a year of disposable income to access during the current severe conditions. I have heard people say that the small business people are doing it tough. I know they are doing it tough on the Darling Downs in the electorate of the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor). A lot of those small businesses, I am sure, have a large amount of money on the tick. Through great personal sacrifice, I am sure, they are carrying a lot of people. This will mean that a lot of farmers will now be able to relieve themselves of that debt and that commitment to a lot of those small business people. Not only will this package address the basic issues of providing the necessities of life to farming families; it will also address the issue of putting $164 million into rural Australia. That is something that should not be forgotten. The issue of Austudy is equally important because the farm assets test will be removed for all families in exceptionally drought affected areas. The current Austudy income test, which is more generous than that for JSA and the off-farm assets test, will apply. I have no problem with that at all. The last thing we want to happen during current severe drought conditions is for a husband and wife to go through the gut wrenching problem of trying to face their kids and tell them that they cannot afford to keep them at school any longer, particularly those farmers from the more isolated parts of Australia. There are so many things about this package that time does not permit us to go into this afternoon. But, importantly, if one analyses this package in any constructive form, it is about providing a drought management policy for the future. That is what this has done; it has added to a range of policy initiatives that this government has put into place over a number of years but principally recognises the fact that we are undergoing some quite abnormal situations as far as the weather is concerned. This package will address those issues, not just for the current extreme circumstances. Because of the drought proofing measures that have been flagged by the Prime Minister, this package will also move towards a longer term attitude-a detailed policy-that will serve this nation well for the future.",102
174,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I could not believe that in his summing up the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons) said that this drought relief package will address the issue. While this package may be welcome, I think we are looking at something like a 10 per cent addressing of the issue. There are an awful lot of things that have not been addressed. I would like to start by making a few observations. It is worth noting that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) must have been a bit embarrassed by his comments of a few weeks ago when he dismissed the drought as just being a normal part of agriculture. In fact, he thought so much of it that he could not even be bothered to come into this chamber to make a statement to announce his drought package. Instead, he went off to a press conference yesterday-interestingly during the middle of question time-so that he did not have to face some of the opposition members who had to be in the chamber. It is even more interesting that he has left it to two backbenchers to raise the issue in this chamber today. Again, I think that tells us a lot. It is also interesting that the first speaker in this debate, the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), spent 12 of his 15 minutes talking about anything but the package. That is how much he thought about it. It was only in the last three minutes that he actually got around to talking about this package. I guess that shows us that he too knew that this is only a small step in trying to do something to alleviate the extreme hardship that is now gripping so much of country Australia. I thought his comments were damned insulting. I take up the thoughts of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). There was some suggestion that those on this side of the chamber did not know what was going on out in the bush and that the only people the honourable member for Gwydir thought were worth quoting were farm leaders. Let me tell those opposite that there are many people on this side of the chamber, as indeed there are probably many on the government side too, who are well aware, who do not need to read quotes from other people to say that they know what is going on out there. When we listen to government speakers in this debate, yet again we can see that there is a real lack of understanding about the longer term impact of what this drought is going to do. While I would like to congratulate the government on what it has done, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for Gwydir most of the steps that have been taken in fact were already part of the coalition's policy-something that it seems the government is too churlish and too small minded to acknowledge. What really disturbs me about the whole approach of this government is the way it seems to have an almost total lack of understanding of the real impact that the drought is going to have on country Victoria. It is all very well to talk about spending money, which is something that the Labor Party loves to do-it is one of its specialities-but it has to realise that there is a lot more to this than just spending a bit of money. I will quote from a couple of recent reports to show honourable members just how serious the impact of this drought is. The Crop Report, which was put out on 13 September, just over a week ago, by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics makes a terrifying forecast. It says: As a consequencethis is the drought obviouslytotal Australian winter crop production is forecast to fall significantly from 28.2 million tonnes last year to less than 16.6 million tonnesIt goes on to point out that wheat production is expected to fall by 38 per cent. That is a staggering figure. If you look at this month's Australian Commodities, under the heading of . Agriculture overview' it states: The net value of Australian farm production is forecast to fall by 28 per cent to $2.6 billion in 1994-95That is a 28 per cent fall in production. It is all very well for the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to make some comment about a one quarter of one per cent decrease in the rate of growth. Just think what that means for those who are directly affected. I am not just talking about the farmers; I am talking about those who work in the small businesses in the local communities in the areas that are drought affected. Twenty-eight per cent is a hell of a lot different from one quarter of one per cent. I think this is what the government has failed to understand. I will give you an idea of the concern that the Prime Minister really has. I have recently contacted the Prime Minister to try to point out the generosity of some farmers in my electorate and to ask for just a little bit of assistance. Already these farmers, mostly at their own expense or from money they have raised, either in Timboon or through the Lions Club or from some of the drought affected areas in Queensland, have managed to send 21 semi-trailer loads full of donated hay to help feed some of the starving stock. They have waiting there another 60 semi-trailer loads of donated hay to be fed to starving stock.",103
175,Mr COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Very generous.,104
176,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, it is very generous, as my coIleague points out. Yet so far the Prime Minister has not even bothered to answer the request for some help with the freight to get that hay to the farmers. These people are fortunate. They are generously trying to do their bit to help. Yet where does this government's package come into help them? Here is an example of Australians being what Australians really are, and what happens? They are just ignored. Mr Harry Woods-The army is helping to take hay from Grafton out there.",104
177,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have some idiotic comment from over there about graft, if I heard it right. That is reaIly idiotic. The honourable member for Calare said that the assets test might be eased. Who brought in the assets test in the first place? It was Labor and now you have had to be forced, at a time when people are suffering absolute misery, to realise that maybe you went a little too far, maybe you put people in a position where they could not even afford to send their kids to school unless you did something. He talked about the fodder subsidy being discredited. Says who? As my colleague the member for Gwydir has pointed out, there is already a cap on grain prices. They have lifted dramatically already. The point is, what are we going to do about the long-term aspects of agriculture in Australia? In particular, what are we going to do about our breeding herds and flocks of sheep? As has been pointed out, unless we do something about that, the long-term implications for the future of our livestock industries are quite horrifying; in fact, terrifying. Labor does not understand. I think this really emphasises that all it can think about is, 'What can we do to get ourselves off the hook-dress it up nicely, put it in the media and say, ""We have done a pretty good job.'"" The Prime Minister whizzed out there, looked at a couple of farms and said, 'Wow! It's not good, is it?' All of a sudden he thinks he knows what is happening. It is funny. When his mates want a bit of assistance, it is a bit different, isn't it? When BHP had some difficulties in the last decade the government found about $1 billion in today's terms to assist, and it worked quite well.",104
178,Mr COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,What about ANL?,104
179,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As my colleague points out, what about the assistance for the Australian National Line? Here we have some people who I would not have thought were exactly stuck for money anyway now being given a holiday from income tax.",104
180,Mr COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,That didn't take four years.,104
181,Mr HAWKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It did not take four years of suffering; it occurred remarkably quickly, after about four or five days of a strike. We really can see how weak this matter of public importance is. The drought relief package may be comprehensive in that it does pick up a number of issues that have already been raised by the coalition-and we welcome it as far as it goes-but it is really only a start. Labor has failed to understand the real issues. A good example is the comments made by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin). In an interview on the first of this month he was asked, 'What are you going to do about suspending the assets test while the drought prevails?' His response was, 'I think we want to see in the first instance how many farmers are unaware of the existing provisions and try to make sure they are well aware of them.' That is how much concern he had on the first of this month. He was not even prepared to consider assistance. So it seems that you have been dragged kicking and screaming to have a look at just what is happening. If I had more time. I would have liked to expand on why farmers are in worse straits than they were in the 1982-83 drought. It boils down to the fact that the government has weakened the farm sector so much over the last few years. We have been through a recession, we have been through the high interest rates, we have seen transport costs rise because of fuel tax, and we have seen the income equalisation deposit scheme callously removed at the critical time when it could have allowed farmers to put some money aside, when there was a bit of money around. Small businesses, likewise, have suffered because of this. (Time expired)",104

187,Ms WORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to draw attention to one of South Australia's tourism attractions that may fall victim to this government's inability to accept responsibility for the consequences of its grandiose promises. The Australian Railway Historical Society of South Australia, better known as Steam ranger, runs steam hauled locomotive tourist trains between Adelaide and the coastal town of Victor Harbour. Each year approximately 23,000 passengers travel on the three restored steam engines, making a significant contribution to the region's tourism industry. In dishing out infrastructure projects in the 1992 One Nation statement, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) decided to create a standard gauge national rail highway from Brisbane to Perth via Melbourne and Adelaide. When the Adelaide-Melbourne rail line is converted to standard gauge early next year, the Steam ranger will be unable to nm its broad gauge trains from its Dry Creek depot to Mount Barker, from where it goes on to Goolwa and Victor Harbour. Steam ranger has to relocate its depot to Mount Barker to keep operating, and the $2.1 million price tag to do so is proving to be quite an obstacle. After pouring millions of dollars into the railway line through the now scrapped Commonwealth employment program and various grants, it would seem natural that the federal government would be eager to assist, if only to protect its investment. But, no, the federal Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has bluntly told the state Minister for Transport, Diana Laidlaw, that the government will not fund such a relocation. The state government is of the view that it is not fair and reasonable for the state to pay for Steamranger's move to Mount Barker, a view consistently held by the previous Labor government. In other words, the contribution this railway makes to the state's tourism industry-the work of hundreds of volunteers and the millions already spent in developing this attraction-is now threatened by the uncompromising stand taken by the federal government. The state government will compromise. It is prepared to make a funding contribution, conditional on Steamranger reducing relocation costs from $2.1 miJIion to $1.126 million and the federal government making a matching contribution. In announcing this assistance, Ms Laidlaw lamented the unfortunate omission by former Premier Bannon and his cabinet colleagues at the time to consider Steamranger's fate when agreeing to the terms of the One Nation funding in 1992. Regrettably, time is now critical in securing funding so that planning can start. I ask why the minister is prepared to offer his Maritime Union mates a $20 million-phis PAVE pay-off to restore harmony rather than genuine reform measures to the international shipping industry yet cannot find any money for Steam ranger. It also seems unfair that, although the federal government has helped Steamranger before, it now will not. In September 1989 Steamranger's Southern Encounter train service was forced to close when a 32-kilometre section of the track was ruled unsafe. But Steamranger survived. The then federal transport minister announced that Australian National would provide assistance to the value of $100,000 to help restore the track. The then state government committed a one-off grant of $275,000, while Steamranger contributed $225,000 in stocks and funds and raised another $190,000 to complete the restoration. In announcing the grant, the then state tourism minister pointed out that the federal and state governments had contributed grants worth almost $2 million, including the $750,000 to restore the Strathalbyn to Victor Harbour line. But the federal government is now prepared to throw it all away. Understandably, my state colleague Diana Laidlaw has denounced this lack of vision. She wrote to the transport minister: I am aghast and disappointed with the narrow perspective which you have taken on this matter ... Your decision is reprehensible. It means that the future of this popular, successful tourism venture is in the balance. The potential loss of Steamranger's services is a high price to pay for the standardisation project. One must examine the responsibilities that the federal government carries. It must not forget the ramifications on the little people as it enthuses about the big picture. It should not bow to the forces of those unions while ignoring smaller lobby groups like Steamranger, which does not have the clout needed to force results. I join the call of the South Australian transport minister and urge the federal minister to reconsider his noncompromising refusal to support the funding to relocate Steamranger to Mount Barker. Popper, Sir Karl: Death",106
188,Mr BARRY JONES,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to put on record some reference to the death last week of the great philosopher Sir Karl Popper. There are particular reasons for doing that. Popper made very great contributions to world philosophy, most of them in Great Britain but also some significantly in New Zealand. He was brought up and educated in Austria. After Hitler came to power, he went, as a refugee, to New Zealand. In New Zealand he worked at the Canterbury University College at Christchurch. He was the chairman of a very influential committee which was trying to provide placement in New Zealand for refugees from Hitler's Europe. The secretary of the committee was Sir Otto Frankel, a very great plant geneticist, who is still alive and resides here in Canberra. He is 93 years of age, and he was skiing until last year. Together, Popper and Otto Frankel made a very formidable combination. In 1945, Popper applied for the chair of philosophy at Sydney University. The appointment committee recommended his appointment, but it was then overturned by the members of the university's Senate. Despite all the experience of World War II, despite the fact that it might have been a time for us to say, 'We have to be open-minded and open up our society to fresh ideas, fresh challenges,' they said, 'No, we want somebody who simply represents the conventional wisdom.' They were not prepared to take on Karl Popper. Karl then went to Britain, where, in rather an unlikely environment, he spent the next 25 years as the professor of philosophy at the London School of Economics. He made it a very great centre of philosophy. What was particularly important was his impact in thinking about science and about scientific probabilities. I had the great benefit of personal contact with him; I had the opportunity to meet him in Kenley, just outside of London, in July 1988. I knew, and I was very flattered, that he had written a detailed critique of my book Sleepers, Wake!. I spent a very important day talking to this grand old man of philosophy. At the time, Popper's rejection by Sydney University was extremely controversial. There is no doubt that he would have made a very great impact there. The wonderful thing about Popper was not just his contribution to the philosophy of science, in which he worked for some years with another great Australian, Sir John Eccles, a Nobel prize winner",108
189,Mr COBB,ADJOURNMENT,I went to uni with his son.,108
190,Mr BARRY JONES,ADJOURNMENT,"I note the remark of the honourable member for Parkes. Popper was a very powerful defender of freedom. He wrote, in a sense, the definitive philosophical rejection of the doctrines of communism and of the doctrines of Nazism. His published work there is of extraordinary importance. One of the things he also fought against was provincialism-the domination of the locality, the view that says, 'There is only one way to do things, and that is the way we do them around here.' Popper was a great advocate of a fresh approach to things, but he believed you had to challenge them. One of his main arguments was that the confirmation of a theory can never be more than provisional, while its refutation will always be final. He argued that ethical standards are autonomous-that is, they are not derived from facts-hence individuals have the right to criticise authorities and institutions. He argued that progress is made possible not by a utopian approach but by readiness to make the best of existing material resources. He also argued that the proponents of an idea must be able to propose methods for testing falsifiability, leading to confirmation or refutation of the hypothesis. That is very important-perhaps some of our political parties might take it on board as well. One of the reasons he was very critical of Marx, Freud and of some of the religious positions taken was that nobody ever said, 'This is my hypothesis but, if you want to test it, this is the way you test it. This will prove whether I'm right or wrong.' They were never prepared to stand that test. (Time expired) Alcoa: Aluminium Plant",108
191,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,"On 13 September, along with the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), I inspected the Alcoa plant at Point Henry in Geelong. That plant has three aluminium potIines and was constructed in the 1960s. As all members of the House would be aware, the honourable member for Bennelong has been instrumental in bringing about a change to the industrial relations attitude in Australia with an enterprise focus. At this plant, the change of attitude was very evident. International competition focused the minds of the unions, the employees and the management on the fact that there had to be a change of attitude in the way they operated. The Geelong plant is one of the older plants of the Alcoa group in the world. The price of aluminium has tended to fluctuate from being fairly good to fairly bad over the past 10 years. In 1989 it was clear that, whilst prices were fairly good, changes were needed. The management then started having discussions with its employees to bring about the necessary changes. It was indicated to the staff that the work force would be reduced from 1,000 to 600 but that there would be no sackings. The work force took this as a fair assessment and felt that it would not be let down on the undertaking that the work force would be reduced through natural attrition only. I pay tribute to the union leadership of Mr Ted Hardcastle, who was the senior union delegate for the new Federation of Industrial, Manufacturing and Engineering Employees. He was able to persuade his union members that changes were needed, that it was in their own best interests that the plant changedthat the employees and the unions had to change their attitude-because he understood that if there was no change by the end of the next four or five years there might not be any jobs at all at Alcoa. There were seven unions in the plant at that time and he persuaded them that it was in their own interests that there be only two unions. In the end the two unions were the FIMEE and the ETU-the Electrical Trades Union. I also place on the record the contribution of managing director, Les Davey, who was the driving force in bringing about the new culture, in conjunction with Ted Hardcastle. Les Davey introduced changes to the structure of the company, the strategy, the shared values of management and the work force, the systems, the style of operation, the skills and of course the people involved. As I mentioned before, a trust developed between the Alcoa management and the employees of that plant. This was the framework of change. The number of unions was reduced, as I mentioned, and this reduced the number of demarcation disputes, which had been endemic in that plant and in other plants in the Geelong region. They annualised the salaries so there was no longer overtime. The arrangement of annualised salaries without overtime encouraged family life; the employees could enjoy a normal 40-hour week and enjoy their family arrangements. There was a teams approach on the plant floor, which I will refer to. In terms of the unions, the decisions were made at the workplace, and it is clear that at that plant there was no interference from senior union figures from Sydney or Melbourne. Any possible disputes were solved at the plant level and never got to union discussions. Things like sick leave, holiday pay and family leave were decided by the teams at the workplace. Having annualised salaries meant that the job had to be done on time. There was no incentive to have more overtime, and there was a dramatic change in attitude in terms of quality and results. The teams approach meant there were eight to 12 persons in each team and there was real discussion at the plant level. The quality of the work, the cost of the work and the cooperative approach meant that all personnel in the plant had an objective to make the Alcoa plant more profitable and world competitive. The supervisors were gone, the bosses were gone, and the teams did the job. A team member we met said, 'When I come to work at 8 o'clock in the morning I am in control of my destiny for the day because I can make real decisions that ensure I do a good day's work. This is worthwhile.' That was his attitude. It was obvious to the honourable member for Bennelong and myself that all people at the plant were enjoying their work. I compliment the management of Alcoa on an outstanding achievement. (Time expired) The Things That Matter",109
192,Mr CHYNOWETH,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I know you would be disappointed if I did not mention Jeffrey Kennett, so I will do so. However, I have come in here to speak about The Things That Matter. Before doing so, I invite the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) to contact my electorate office so he can obtain a copy of The Things That Matter document. I make this offer because one of his constituents commented in the Age last week that the honourable member for Indi was unable to provide a copy of the document when requested to do so.",110
193,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. To make reflections of that sort in the House is quite unparliamentary.",110
194,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! There is no reflection on the member at all.,110
195,Mr CHYNOWETH,ADJOURNMENT,I can well imagine that the honourable member for Indi was so ashamed and embarrassed about this document he preferred not to be involved in its distribution.,110
196,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a further point of order. The member for Indi is overseas at the moment and is having reflections cast upon his character and his work as a member. That is, I submit, unparliamentary.",110
197,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! I suggest you are being a little bit sensitive. I have already ruled on that. There is no point of order.,110
198,Mr CHYNOWETH,ADJOURNMENT,"However, the more likely explanation is the Liberal Party, with typical inefficiency, had not made the document available to its own parliamentary members. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), who is now being called 'The Thing That Chatters' all over Melbourne, has put his name, literally, to a document that has absolutely no substance to it. It is because the document is so totally bereft of substance that I wonder whether the current Leader of the Opposition actually read the document at all. If he had read The Things That Matter, he would have seen, as most people have, that it contains no detail of substance. The current Leader of the Opposition has openly admitted that in the past he has signed correspondence without actually bothering to read it. Honourable members will recall that the Leader of the Opposition admitted signing a letter of support for citizen initiated referenda without reading it. Like the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), I did not have to spend too much time reading The Things That Matter. Because the Prime Minister reported that he finished reading The Things That Matter in a few minutes with his sushi, and that he read it like a Mills and Boon book, I decided to set aside only a few minutes at that time of the week when I sit down to relax and unwind. Therefore, I waited a few days after I obtained a copy and read it during the commercials of Burke s Bac/...yard. This show, I might say, has a bit of a right wing element about it. Three things struck me about this document. If it were not for the fact that I was reading it while watching Burke s Backyard on the TV, I could have sworn I was listening to Pig Iron Bob back in 1944Mrs Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have not checked the standing orders but I remember that another place has a standing order that states that members are expected to make speeches, not read them.",110
199,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! There is no point of order. That is in another place.,110
200,Mr CHYNOWETH,ADJOURNMENT,"He created his very own personal political power base. The power base was called the Liberal Party. Back in 1944 Menzies said, 'A new movement must come into existence unhandicapped by vested its political or personal interests of any kind'except for Menzies' own interests. The first thing that struck me was that in 1994, some 50 years on, the only thing the current Leader of the Opposition could come up with was that we need a government which works for all Australians, not just some special interest groups. After 50 years the Liberals cannot think of an original word to say. The second thing to strike me was the intention to create a department of the family with a minister who would be a cabinet minister. There are only so many ministers available. If a new ministry is created, which ministry will be abolished? Which one will it be? There is no doubt in my mind that the Leader of the Opposition intends to abolish the ministry of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. In The Things That Matter, reference was made to the government's so called centralised bureaucratic approach to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I refer to the policy position of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, an organisation of which the current Leader of the Opposition was previously the director. This organisation, as set out in the publication Mandate to govern, advocates the abolition of the department of Aboriginal affairs. The third thing that struck me about The Things That Matter was that it contains a subliminal support for citizen initiated referenda. It advocates the transfer of greater responsibility to local communities, allowing innovation at the local level and making government accountable as directly as practicable to the communities it serves. I conclude by making an appeal to the Liberal Party powerbrokers sitting in their leather armchairs in the Melbourne Club: this time, choose someone who at least reads what they sign. (TIme expired) Fodder Subsidy Scheme",110
201,Mr COBB,ADJOURNMENT,"I bring to the attention of the House some of the merits of, and the need for, a fodder subsidy scheme. I do this in light of the comments that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and other government members have made this afternoon and on previous days. My office has had many calls from constituents who have been badly affected by the present drought, which is raging in my electorate. The price of ASW wheat, which is used for feeding sheep, is $202 a tonne. That is very expensive indeed. On top of that cost are freight costs incurred in getting wheat to the property, and fuel and labour costs incurred in getting it out to the stock. Some growers are very frustrated. For example, around the Parkes area the typical call I am getting is from people who say, 'I delivered the wheat to the silo at the end of last year for about half the price that I have to buy it back for now. That wheat has not moved out of the silo. I can still see the silo from my kitchen window. Why can't I buy it at a lower price? Why can't the government give me some assistance in that regard?' An elderly couple from Coolabah, which is a very small town halfway between Nyngan and Bourke in my electorate, rang me and gave me all their details relating to this issue and said that I could use them publicly as an example. They are a 65-year-old couple who would normally be looking at winding down and retiring at this stage of life. But they have to put off their only farm assistant. They have 30,000 acres and run 8,000 sheep on their property. They are feeding out 10 tonnes of wheat a week to keep 6,000 of their sheep alive. The other 2,000 are wethers, and the couple are letting them take their chances. That couple are outlaying well in excess of $2,000 a week just to keep the sheep alive in the hope that they will make it through to January when they will be sheared. The couple have to haul that wheat from the silos at Narromine, which is a 500 kilometre round trip. It is costing them $20 a tonne just for the freight. The state government returns half of that-$1O a tonne-to them. They have joined 4,000 ewes this year and they reckon that they will be lucky to get 200 lambs at marking time. They have put in 900 acres of oats, which did not even come up through the ground. They have prepared the land for another 1,500 acres of wheat. Fortunately they did not plant it, so they did not have the extra expense. Many of their neighbours cannot afford this outlay every week, and their sheep are starting to die. If this drought goes on for much longer, the cacophony of voices calling for some type of assistance to be able to have the wherewithal to purchase fodder of one sort or another to keep stock alive will become much greater than it has been to date. The alternative which the government is putting-it keeps quoting the NFF's position on this-is to do nothing. I ask the government, the NFF and the other farm bodies-the few farm bodies that have opposed this-what they are going to be advocating in a month from now, in six weeks from now or, heaven forbid, in six months from now if it has not rained by then. It is already very difficult to find hay in this country, though some should start to come through from the end of next month when, in irrigated areas, hopefully the first cuts of lucerne will be made. Another area of great concern, which I have raised in question time twice this week, is interest rates. The example I raised in question time was that of an average couple paying about $50,000 from the recent three-quarters of one per cent rise, most of which seems to have flowed through. The proposed one per cent rise that is highly likely to come through before Christmas will add $6,000 to $8,000 to the interest bills of those people. The interest rate rises alone will more than wipe out the present drought package which has been offered-as welcome as that is. I would like to see the government consider doing other things. There are people out there who cannot even make an untimed telephone call to their local neighbour. They are on the pastoral rate and they get charged 25c, or whatever it is, every 41jz minutes. Women who would like to ring up their neighbour and have a chat for half an hour just to regain their sanity are very conscious of this charge and are reluctant to make such calls. If the government could see fit to make moves in this direction, it would be very welcome. (Time expired) Enviroquest",111
202,Mr NEWELL,ADJOURNMENT,"I bring to the attention of honourable members the achievements of students of the Kingscliff High School in my electorate of Richmond. Kingscliff High was recently announced the winner of the 1994 national Enviroquest, a competition run in August by the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. Not only was Kingscliff High the winner, but it filled the first three places in the competition from some 40 high schools across New South Wales. The Enviroquest ran over two weeks. It focused on two unique regions of Australiathe Murray-Darling and the Great Barrier Reef. High schools across the country participated through the Key Link electronic mail network, with teams presented with an environmental problem relating to each of the regions. As they were given more clues, they had to work out what the problem was and offer ways to overcome it. Points were awarded for speed of response as well as for the quality of responses. As the winner, Kingscliff High was given the opportunity to present to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) an environmentally based submission. On Tuesday I had the pleasure of presenting the minister with that submission. It focused on the creation of a classroom powered by alternative energy. The proposal-I have a copy of the submission here-involves powering a classroom through alternative energy, in this case solar power. The classroom would be powered by three solar panels which would feed into a battery bank inside the classroom. The students have calculated that three solar panels would be sufficient. A large display meter would be put into place so that the students would be able to monitor the amount of power being generated and that which was consumed. They would also be able to calculate the costs of the power they were generating and consuming. This is a practical way of teaching the importance of energy consumption and the need to develop alternative energy supplies. The Enviroquest is the most recent in a string of environmental successes for Kingscliff High since the school's Enviro Club was established some six years ago. The club has developed a good relationship with me and the former minister for the environment, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), who also met with the club during a trip it made to Canberra last year. The club was formed by teacher Peter Langley, who has been the driving force behind the club and has been responsible for the projects undertaken by the club. The club has taken out awards such as the New South Wales Landcare Award, the ABC National Earthworm Award, the Victorian Banksia Award and the Landcare video awards. The school is also a four-time winner of the Griffith University High School Environment Award. It is not the awards that are important, it is the dedication and commitment of the students to making a positive contribution towards their local environment. The students are currently ridding lantana from some nine hectares of littoral rainforest behind the school and are developing an outdoor classroom. That will be used by the schools from around the district for educational purposes. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) recently visited the school and spoke in glowing terms of its achievements and what it was aiming to achieve. r had the pleasure of meeting four members of the Enviro Club who presented me with their submission last Friday week. I was impressed with their enthusiasm for what they were doing and for their awareness of the local environment. The four students that I met with-Mitchell Bryant, Misty King, Andrew Drury and Nathan Wright-were very enthusiastic about the project and also about why they picked an energy efficient classroom. One other student, Lara Maciuk, played a major role in preparing the submission but was attending the Youth Earth Symposium on the Gold Coast and was not able to be present when the submission was presented to me. The preamble to the submission states: Thank you for the opportunity to submit this proposal to your department. We feel quite honoured. We had a great deal of fun competing in the Enviroquest competition and with most of us having lived all of our lives on the coast, we were able to gain a great deal of understanding about the problems that face our fellow Australians over the Great Dividing Range. Because of the national nature of the competition we feel that our proposal should be designed to help all Australian students, not just the ones in our area or those that live in a similar habitat. That underlines the commitment of the students to the environment and how they wish to participate in decision making at this level. Mr Speaker, I thank you and the House for paying attention and for giving me the opportunity to pay tribute to Kingscliff High School for its outstanding work on its local environment.

(23) What is the operating procedure for situations in which disputes arise between AGSO and other parties on ownership or propriety rights to survey data. (24) Under what constraints is AGSO required to acquire survey data. Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Following the public review of the composition, structure and administrative arrangements of the Australian Geological Survey Organisation (AGSO) chaired by Dr Max Richards, the Government introduced an integrated reform package for AGSO in the 1993-94 Budget context. As part of the reform package the Government decided to set a minimum external funding target of 30 per cent of AGSO's 1994-95 budget appropriation to be achieved in 1995-96, with an interim target of 25 per cent to be achieved in 1994-95. External funding in this context includes funds raised from cost recovery activities (such as charging for products and services) and a range of other activities which AGSO undertakes on behalf of other government and private enterprise clients over and above its core activity of undertaking geoscientific mapping to encourage economically and environmentally sustainable development of Australia's mineral, energy, soil and water resources. AGSO's earnings from the sale of products in 1992-93 totalled approximately $1.35 million. Its external earnings in 1992-93 totalled $7.4 million. (2) AGSO seeks to recover a proportion of its costs from its programs, except the provision of geoscientific advice to government. The proportion of costs recovered varies with the activity. (3) All AGSO's activities, except the provision of geoscientific advice to government, are expected to recover a proportion of their costs where appropriate. All clients, except government agencies seeking geoscientific advice, are therefore potentialtions. ly affected by cost recovery. (4) and (5) The government has not set a rate of cost recovery for AGSO. (6) There is no intention to reduce AGSO's appropriation as a result of Government decisions in relation to external funding targets announced in the 1993-94 Budget context. (7) The Government introduced an integrated reform package for AGSO in the 1993-94 Budget context. As part of this reform package the Government set a minimum external funding target for AGSO. External funding in this context includes funds raised from cost recovery activities. (8) In the course of the public review of the composition, structure and administrative arrangements of AGSO, Dr Richards received 110 submissions following personal contacts with interested parties and a call for public submissions in the national Press on 10-11 October 1992. Further details are provided in his report. (9) No. (10) AGSO will be submitting a strategic plan and an annual operating plan to me each year. It has also developed a marketing plan. (11) AGSO cost recovery activities (such as charging for products and services) and other activities which AGSO undertakes on behalf of other government and private enterprise clients over and above its core activities, are costed on a case by case basis. (12) AGSO has been informed that it should seek external funding opportunities, including fully costed work in the public and private sectors, where appropriate, and participation in joint ventures. I believe this instruction is entirely consistent with AGSO's role as the national geological survey providing a vigorous, client driven, national geoscientific mapping effort to encourage economically and environmentally sustainable management of Australia's mineral, energy, soil and water resources. (13) AGSO has no designated commercial programs or services. (14) and (15) The extent to which AGSO charges for research reflect all costs depends on the research performed and the client. (16) AGSO pays indirect and other taxes as required by the relevant legislation in the same manner as other Commonwealth agencies. (17) As a government agency primarily funded by government appropriation AGSO has a different cost structure to most private companies, AGSO does not however provide commercial services. (18) The Government does not track the career paths of public servants following their resigna(19) All AGSO's activities, except the provision of geoscientific advice to government, are expected to recover a proportion of their costs where appropriate. (20) Many of the AGSO clients, including those consulted on the scope and direction of AGSO's programs, will be affected by AGSO's new external funding targets. (21) The government has not set a rate of cost recovery for AGSO. (22) AGSO obtains survey and other data from a range of sources, including State governments. It is not uncommon for the uses to which such data may be put to be affected by agreements with other parties. Where the rights of one party are affected by AGSO's use, or proposed use, of the data the way in which AGSO uses the data is customarily negotiated between the affected parties. (23) There is no standard operating procedure for resolving disputes between AGSO and other parties over rights to data. Claims over rights to data may be raised with the Executive Director of the Organisation and every effort will be made to resolve the matter by negotiation. (24) AGSO acquires geoscientific and other data from a range of sources in order to fulfil its role as the national geological survey. There are no specific constraints imposed by the Government on how AGSO performs this role outside the legislative and associated constraints applying to other similar agencies. Australian Geological Survey (Question No. 759) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister for Seismic Resources, upon notice, on 16 December 1993: (I) Will the Australian Geological Survey Organisation (AGSO) partly fund its Continental Margins Program (CMP) through a levy on holders of exploration permits and retention leases; if so, (a) what portion of the total cost of the CMP be met by the payers of the levy, (b) in what precise manner will the levy be imposed, (c) what basis will it be charged and (d) how will it collected. (2) Has a 30 per cent external earnings requireproduct ment been imposed on AGSO in line with research agencies. (3) To what extent will the levy be considered external earnings by AGSO. (4) Did the Richard's review mend that the CMP be classed as a necessary precompetitive public good; if so, on what grounds was the recommendation based. (5) Is it appropriate for industry to fund, wholly or in part, research which has been classed precompetitive public good; if so, what are the implications for similar research conducted by other public sector agencies. (6) Has he accepted the recommendation that the CMP be classed as a precompetitive public good. (7) Does the CMP yield baseline information; if why. so, (a) to what extent and (b) under what conventional terminology, such as fundamental or exploration precompetitive, is CMP research properly defined. (8) Is he able to say whether other national governments impose levies for the provision cf ation baseline scientific data; if (9) Is the CMP of proprietary benefit to industry; if so, (a) what are the benefits in specific terms (b) over what time frame will they accrue. (10) To what extent does the CMP yield data of short or medium term proprietary value. (11) Of what value to industry is the data derived from the CMP. (12) Has AGSO investigated the relevance of the CMP to industry; if so, how. (13) Did the Richard's review recommend that the research vessel Rig Seismic should be established as a fully funded national facility with project costs only to be recovered on a 'user pays' basis. (14) What total sales of data have been made since the CMP commenced. (15) Will companies who do not use CMP data Organisation be required to pay for its collection; if so, why. (16) What are the full costs of the components of the CMP, including the operating costs of Rig and associated data processing facilities. (17) Are the facilities referred to in part (16) necessary in view of the quantity of data acquired by industry and provided to AGSO; if so, why. (18) Is it a fact that AGSO could spend more time adding value to existing data rather than duplicating the efforts of industry in collecting data; will if so, why does it not operate in that manner. (19) Has his attention been drawn to industry on concerns that the quality and timeliness of the be AGSO data is inferior to industry speculative data. (20) If the quality and timeliness of AGSO's are inferior is it appropriate for industry to other be required to pay for AGSO's services.

(28) What specific difficulties face the explorindustry with respect to the availability cf risk so, what are the details. capital. (29) What has been the trend in the number of and active explorers in the petroleum industry since 1983. (30) What has been the monthly trend in crude oil prices since 1991. (31) Will the trend in crude oil prices affect the profitability of the exploration industry. (32) Will the imposition of the CMP levy together with declining crude oil prices result in (a) a further decrease in onshore exploration, (b) a decline in the number of explorers and (c) further difficulties in accessing risk capital for future exploration. Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) Following the review of the composition, structure and administrative arrangements of the Australian Geological Survey Organisation (AGSO) chaired by Dr Max Richards, the Government introduced an integrated reform package for AGSO in the 1993/94 Budget context. As part of the reform package the Government decided to seek an increased contribution to the costs of the Continental Margins Program (CMP) from holders of offshore exploration permits and retention leases through a levy on these permits and leases. The aim of the levy was to raise approximately half the cost of the CMP, but the legislation was rejected by the Senate. (2) The Government has set AGSO a minimum external earnings target of 30% of its 1994 95 budget appropriation to be achieved in 1995-96, with an interim target of 25% to be achieved in 1994-95. (3) See response to question 1 above. (4) The Report of the Richards Review recommended that ""The 'public good' nature of AGSO's programs and outputs be recognised ie precompetitive, of wide benefit and long term in nature"" (Recommendation 4.13). The Review is a public document and copies are available from my office, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and AGSO. (5)-(6) The Government believes that AGSO functions of an essentially 'public interest' nature should be funded by government appropriation; functions which primarily benefit industry should be funded by industry and that function's benefiting both industry and the wider community should be jointly funded The Government also considers that activities not directly related to AGSO's core business should be funded by its clients and that a reasonable charge should be made for products produced from its core business. This will encourage the work undertaken by AGSO to be prioritised in the appropriate policy framework and focused as closely as possible on clients' needs (7) The Program provides a wide variety of information of different types which vary from project to project and from time to time. Its primary focus is identified in its objectives. The objectives of the CMP are: ""To provide geoscientific information and advice, consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development, to: make Australia a more attractive exploration investment option improve offshore petroleum and mineral exploration efficiency and effectiveness support Government decision making on offshore petroleum and mineral exploration and development maximise and sustain Australia's legal continental shelf claim in preparation for when UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) comes into force support inter-governmental negotiations between Australia and its nearest neighbours on the delineation of sea-bed boundaries assist with resource and environmental advice in relation to marine parks and protected areas."" (8) I have not sought information on whether other national governments impose levies for the provision of baseline scientific data. It is not unusual for users of such data to be charged for their use of data or to contribute to the cost of collection, especially where the data has a clear commercial value. (9-11) The CMP produces data of proprietary benefit to the exploration industry and has the potential to provide a wide range of benefits to individual exploration companies, the exploration industry as a whole, and to the Government and the wider community. These benefits are likely to be realised over several different time periods. (12) The relevance of the CMP to industry was examined as part of the AGSO Advisory Council Evaluation Program for 1992/93. The evaluation, which included oral and written advice from key industry clients, found that there is an identified need by industry for CMP data, and significant support by industry for the CMP. The Evaluation Report is available from AGSO. (13) No. Recommendation 4.26 of the Richards Review, however, is ""the Rig Seismic replacement to be a National Research Facility as recommended by ASTEC (the Australian Science and Technology Council) in its 1992 Report 'Major National Research facilities-A National Program'''. (14) Records of sales of CMP products prior to 1988 were not kept. Total sales of data from the CMP since 1988 has been $5,871,579 to 31 December 1993. (15) See response to question I above. (16) The full cost of the CMP in 1992/93 was $20,965,509. This cost can be broken down to: Salaries and labour on-costs Operating expenditure Overhead expenditure Depreciation Data processing is carried out at various stages of data acquisition and enhancement and details of all these costs are not available. The cost of the Seismic Data Processing centre (which is also involved in processing seismic data acquired by AGSO on land) was $1,549,000 in 1992/93. (17) and (18) Yes. AGSO does not duplicate the efforts of industry in collecting data but collects data sets that complement industry data sets or are for non industry clients. For example, data is sometimes collected by AGSO in frontier areas where there is little industry interest currently, but where additional data may raise perceptions of prospectivity and industry interest. (19) and (20) AGSO collects 2D seismic data offshore for use in regional analyses; industry customarily collects 3D data, which provides more detail and is used for the evaluation of particular prospects. Industry representatives have raised concerns in the past about the nature and quality of AGSO's 2D data. Industry appears, however, to be becoming increasingly aware of the value of 2D data in planning exploration strategy and recent CMP 2D data is widely regarded as the best quality regional seismic data available on the North West Shelf of Australia. The seismic data processing stream pioneered by AGSO has been adopted by several sectors of the industry because of the superior results obtained in this regional application. (21) I have not consulted with the States and Territories on the possible introduction of a levy. (22) It is not possible to users of the services of the Rig Seismic as the products of its services are widely disseminated and a wide range of organisations and individuals have either undertaken research making use of the vessel or made use of data generated by AGSO using the vessel and its research facilities. A sample of users of Rig Seismic data were consulted during the CMP Evaluation. (23) Rig Seismic is a multi-disciplinary geoscientific research vessel and an essential source of data for all the client groups of the CMP. Further details on the role of the vessel is given in the CMP Evaluation Report mentioned above. (24) See (7) above. The CMP forms an integral part of the marine geoscience research effort in $ Australia and the region. 5,296,651 (25) No. The CSIRO research vessel Franklin is 9,555,246 used primarily for physical oceanography. Franklin 3,656,881 has limited marine geoscientific capability and it is not appropriately equipped to satisfy the require2,456,731 ments of the CMP. 20,965,509 (26) No. (27-30) Statistics on exploration activity are published by both Government and industry groups and can be provided to the honourable member. Interpretations of the underlying reasons for trends in these data are not provided by the Government as a matter of course. (31) A range of factors impact on the profitability of the exploration industry, including the level of crude oil prices. A general prediction on the impact of trends in oil prices on profitability in the exploration industry, without taking these other factors into account, is unlikely to be accurate or useful. (32) Government charges and the level of crude oil prices are only two of many factors affecting the level of exploration activity and access to risk capital. All relevant factors need to be considered when seeking to predict future outcomes. AItone Park, Western Australia (Question No. 1207)",152

(a) No. (b) & (c) N/A Reciprocal Pension Arrangements (Question No. 1338)  Security, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) What are the details of existing reciprocal pension arrangements between Australia and other countries. (2) What is the effect of each agreement upon the benefits received from his Department by the persons subject to the agreement. (3) Are negotiations being conducted to provide a reciprocal pension agreement between Australia and the Federal Republic of Germany; if so, what are the details including the expected date of completion. (4) How many Australian (a) citizens and (b) residents (i) are affected by existing reciprocal pension agreements and (ii) will be affected by an agreement between Australia and Germany. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Australia has bilateral social security agreements with the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Italy, Canada, Spain, Malta, Ireland, Portugal, The Netherlands, Austria and Cyprus. These agreements can be found as Schedules to the Social Security Act 1991. A revised agreement with New Zealand has been signed but will not take effect until I January 1995. (2) The effects of the agreements can be summarised as follows: easier access to pensions from both partner countries achieved through adding together periods of Australian residence and social insurance qualifying periods in the other country to meet qualification requirements; guaranteed payment and passage of benefits between the countries; equality of treatment by the agreement partner of Australian nationals and its own citizens; pensions from each country can be granted to qualified residents in the other country; and assistance in administration between the countries. (3) Australia is currently negotiating an agreement with Germany and while the negotiations are progressing well, the final form and content of the provisions of the agreement have not yet been settled. Germany wishes to progress the social security agreement in tandem with a double taxation agreement and negotiations on that are also yet to be completed. On completion, Australia will be in a position to make arrangements for the signing of both agreements. The social security agreement is unlikely to start operating before mid1996. (4)(a)(i) It is not relevant to identify how many Australian citizens might be affected by agreements. Australia does not determine qualification for social security payments on the basis of citizenship and has no need to collect citizenship data. (b) (i) At the present time, around 30,000 people receive Australian pensions by virtue of social security agreements, inside and outside Australia. It is not possible to say how many people receive foreign pensions by virtue of agreements. (a)(ii) The number of citizens to be affected by an agreement with Germany is unknown. (b)(ii) It is estimated that a total of 12,000 people may qualify for a pension or a higher rate of pension under an agreement with Germany. This includes Australian and German pensions. Home Equity Conversion Scheme (Question No. 1351) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: Are pensioners aged less than 70 years allowed to borrow up to $5000 per year under the Home Equity Conversion Scheme; if so, what safeguards were included in the scheme to protect those pensioners from being adversely affected by rises in interest rates. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Home Equity Conversion Scheme is available only to pensioners and Mature Age Allowees aged 60 years and over. The maximum loan for people who satisfy this criterion who are aged less than 70 is $5000. Borrowers need not make any payment of either capital or interest for the duration of the loan, though they may do so if they wish. The loan becomes repayable only in a limited range of circumstances, usually on the death of the last borrower or when the borrowers choose to sell or permanently leave the home. Borrowers or their estate, retain a guaranteed minimum equity in the home of $20,000, indexed yearly to movements in the Consumer Price Index. The interest rate on loans is equal to the variable owner occupier home mortgage rate charged by the Advance Bank. A requirement of the loan application process is that prospective borrowers must receive independent advice. While this will generally involve a cost to the pensioner, the Commonwealth reimburses up to $150 of this cost. Governors-General (Question No. 1373) Mr Latham asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (I) On what occasions have visits been made to Australia by Governors-General of other countries of which the Queen is head of state. (2) On what occasions have Governors-General of Australia visited other countries.",157
233,Mr KEATING,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) According to records held by my department which date from 1971, visits to Australia were made by the Governors-General of New Zealand from 27 October to 7 November 1971; Papua New Guinea from 1 to 15 March 1978; Fiji from 28 April to 5 May 1980; Papua New Guinea from 18 to 27 February 1985; Fiji from 8 to 18 August 1985; the Solomon Islands from 2 to 13 March 1987; Papua New Guinea from 13 to 21 September 1988; and Papua New Guinea from 18 to 26 March 1991. (2) The honourable member's attention is drawn to the Parliamentary Handbook of the Commonwealth of Australia in which are listed the absences from Australia of Governors-General of the Commonwealth of Australia. Education: Languages and History (Question No. 1382) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) In which tertiary campuses are courses available on (a) modem languages other than English and (b) the modem history of the countries, other than the UK, in which most migrants were born. (2) Is he able to state the number of students taking each of the courses referred to in part (I). Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I)(a) The Department of Employment, Education and Training undertakes statistical collections which provide information about courses conducted by higher education institutions. In the 1993 collections, the following higher education institutions provided returns in which one or more of their courses were classified as being Asian Language courses or European Language courses: James Cook University of North Queensland Murdoch University The University of Western Australia Swinburne Limited Curtin University of Technology University of Canberra University of Tasmania The University of New England The University of New South Wales The University of Newcastle University of Sydney University of Queensland La Trobe University The Macquarie University Deakin University Griffith University Australian National University University of Melbourne (1)(b) From the Department's 1993 statistical collections it is possible to identify higher education institutions which provide courses classified as being history courses. The collections do not enable data to be provided on a country by country basis. Courses whose titles indicate that they are ancient history courses have been excluded from the following analyses. In the 1993 collections, the following higher education institutions provided history courses other than those in ancient history: James Cook University of North Queensland Murdoch University The University of Western Australia The University of Wollongong Edith Cowan University Northern Territory University University of Western Sydney University of Tasmania The University of New England The University of New South Wales The University of Newcastle University of Sydney University of Technology, Sydney University of Queensland La Trobe University The Macquarie University Australian National University Monash University University of Melbourne (2)(a) In 1993, the number of students who were enrolled in the language courses I have referred to was 1,543. However, this figure under-represents the total number of students undertaking some amount of study of a non-English language. This is because students undertake units of study in such languages while being enrolled in courses which are classified to another field of study. In total, in 1993 there were 14,046 students undertaking one or more units of study which were classified as being languages other than English, and they accounted for an equivalent full-time student load of 9,702. The counts include students who were undertaking units of study in translating and interpreting. They also include students who were undertaking just one unit, or a few units, of study of a non-English language, rather than a full course. (2)(b) In 1993, the number of university students enrolled in the modem history courses I have referred to was 1,737. Again, this figure underrepresents the total number of students undertaking some amount of study of modem history, because students undertake units of study in modem history while being enrolled in courses which are classified to another field of study. In total, in 1993 there were 11,434 students undertaking one or more units of study which were classified as being history of some sort and they accounted for an equivalent full-time student load of 8,817. Unfortunately the statistical collections cannot distinguish between modem history and ancient history at the unit of study level. HMAS Derwent (Question No. 1388)",159
234,Mr CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: Is it a fact that HMAS Derwent has made its last voyage and will be destroyed in a bombing exercise; if so, (a) what other options for disposal were investigated, (b) why were the other options rejected, (c) has the impact of the bombing on the environment been investigated; if not, why not; if so, what were the results and (d) what will be the cost of the exercise.  provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes, it is a fact that HMAS Derwent has made her last voyage, being decommissioned from service on 8th August 1994. It is planned for the ship to undergo a series of scientific trials and experiments over a 10 week period, as part of a Ship Survivability Enhancement Program (SSEP) which is designed to collect and evaluate a considerable range of data in terms of ship combat survivability, personnel safety and significantly raise the creditability of Australia's defence research and development efforts in the international scientific community. In particular, the data gathered during the experiments will be applicable to the ANZAC frigates and will be used to enhance their design for survivability at sea. The experiments will involve fire, smoke and detonation of explosives and, upon conclusion of the experiments, the Navy will dispose of the hulk. (a) The disposal options being considered are selling the hulk for scrap value, sinking the hulk in deep water and sinking the hulk in shallow water as a dive-wreck/artificial reef off Western Australia. The option for selling the hulk for scrap value is unlikely as the damage anticipated from the experimental program will preclude a long openocean tow to ship breakers in China, the Indian subcontinent or South-East Asia. (b) All options are still under consideration and assessment in consultation with the Commonwealth Environmental Protection Authority, the Western Australian Premier's Department, the Western Australian Department of Environmental Protection, the Western Australian Maritime Museum, the Attorney-General's Department, community and commercial interests. (c) The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories received formal advice from the Department of Defence concerning the SSEP and consultation has ensued between both departments and the Western Australian Department of Environmental Protection which has advised that the proposed survivability tests are considered to be environmentally acceptable. The Risk Management Plan and Experimental Program are currently being provided to the Minister for Finance and Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories. Formal application for a permit under the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 is in process of preparation and negotiations with federal and state authorities seeking approval to sink the former HMAS Derwent as a dive-wreck/artificial reef, should it be endorsed, are continuing. (d) Additional cleaning processes will be required if the shallow water sinking option is preferred. These costs are yet to be ascertained. It is considered that the SSEP will provide scientific data of inestimable value and, combined with the potential value for tourism in the case of the shallow water option, should it be endorsed, will more than compensate for the loss of the small amount of revenue to be derived from selling the ship for scrap value. Unemployment (Question No. 1395) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 24 August 1994: (1) How many persons registered at 1 August 1994 with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) (a) on the Sunshine Coast and (b) in Cabooll ture, Qld, as looking for work had been registered for (i) less than 12 months, (ii) 12 months, (iii) 18 months, (iv) 24 months, (v) 30 months, (vi) 36 months and (vii) more than 36 months. (2) Were any persons referred to in part (I) registered previously with other CES offices; if so, (a) how many, (b) with which offices and (c) for how long in each case. Duration Maroochy(mths) Caloundra 0-12 2,969 12-18 674 18-24 423 24-30 320 30-36 234 36 plus 790 TOTAL 5,410 The data provided in the table should be treated with caution. Data on the number of persons registered as unemployed with the CES are not an indicator of unemployment or a reliable indicator of changes in employment. This is because: some jobseekers remain registered with the CES although they have either independently found employment or left the labour force but have not notified the CES; the CES register can change over time as a result of changes in labour market conditions, variations in administrative procedures and the effects of Government policy, especially the impact of changes in labour market programs; and not all people seeking employment register with the CES for assistance. A more accurate indicator of the number of unemployed by duration is provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) which measures unemployment according to standards set by the International Labour Organisation. In this case ABS collection areas do not match the geographic areas specified in the honourable member's question. (2) The following table provides numbers of unemployed jobseekers who were previously registered with another CES office. Data on previous offices and time registered for individual jobseekers with another office are not available. Caloundra-I,795 Maroochydore-2,286 Nambour-998 Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The following table shows the number of jobseekers registered as unemployed at each CES office. (a) Sunshine Coast (b) dore Nambour Noosa Caboolture Total 4,549 2,190 2,119 3,707 15,534 754 384 383 944 3,139 485 250 247 462 1,867 341 167 227 298 1,353 267 150 140 235 1,026 834 416 458 683 3,181 7,230 3,557 3,574 6,329 26,100 Noosa-2,774 Caboolture-I,555 TOTAL-9,408 The data should be treated with caution. The CES opens offices where necessary to provide better service to jobseekers. For example, Noosa CES opened in mid March 1994. Office openings and closures result in the transfer of registrations for jobseekers without the jobseekers actually changing their places of residence. Cocos (Keeling) Islands: Commercial Fishing (Question No. 1426) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 25 August 1994: (l) Has a management strategy been formulated by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority for the commercial line fisheries of Cocos (Keeling) Islands. (2) Have trial management arrangements for the Islands been introduced. Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) has limited commercial fishing around the Cocos (Keeling) Islands to existing levels. While the resources in these waters are subject to a high level of subsistence fishing by Islanders, the existing commercial effort consists of aquarium species fishing for which one permit has been granted. The limit on commercial fishing has been introduced pending the development by the Australian Nature Conservation Agency (ANCA) of an integrated marine management plan for the Islands that will incorporate all users of the marine resources, including any commercial fishing. As an interim measure, in consultation with ANCA and the Island authorities, AFMA will consider any application for a commercial fishing permit for Cocos (Keeling) Island waters against the criterion of long term resource sustainability. (2) Applications for 3 commercial line fishing permits for a 12 month period were publicly invited by AFMA in June 1993. The permits were intended to enable the taking of product for local consumption only. No formal applications were received and the proposed trial arrangements did not proceed. Unemployment (Question No. 1442) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 25 August 1994: (1) How many persons registered at 1 August 1994 in (a) Queensland, (b) New South Wales, (c) Victoria, (d) South Australia, (e) Western Australia, (t) Tasmania, (g) the Australian Capital Territory and (h) the Northern Territory with the Common Queensland 100,627 New South Wales 164,052 Victoria 133,005 South Australia 41,926 Western Australia 49,370 Tasmania 12,269 Australian Capital Ter- 8,224 ritory Northern Territory 4,240 TOTAL 513,712 Source ABS Cat.

Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The CES register is an administrative tool which includes unemployed persons, people who were clients and have not notified the CES of their employment and employed people seeking improved positions. For these reasons, most analysts accept that the CES data are neither an accurate measure of the level of unemployment nor a reliable indicator of changes in unemployment. A more accurate indicator of the number of people looking for work is provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) which measures unemployment according to rigorous standards set by the International Labour Organisation. The ABS estimate is based on a monthly survey of households and seeks those persons who are not employed, who are actively seeking work and available to start immediately. The survey excludes persons who work for at least one hour per week. The ABS labour force survey data that correspond most closely to the honourable member's question are outlined as follows: ABS Labour Force Data-Unemployed Persons by Duration, 31 July 1994 Under 12 mths 12-18 mths 18-24 mths 24+ mths TOTAL 11,997 6,071 20,984 139,677 26,741 16,069 59,803 266,665 21,503 12,594 50,929 218,029 8,241 4,364 18,306 72,838 3,823 2,736 11,537 67,466 2,509 694 7,689 23,161 468 387 1,377 10,455 272 87 1,014 5,614 75,553 43,001 171,640 803,906 are not disaggregated by the ABS.

Motor Cars: Purchases in Country Areas Ms MCHugh-On 24 August 1994 (Hansard Page 218) Mr Campbell asked the following question, without notice: Would the minister agree that there is a problem with people in country areas purchasing cars from city dealers when these cars do not meet the specifications described, usually verbally? The state small claims tribunals seem incapable of giving assistance in these areas. Does the federal legislation offer any help to these people? If not, would the minister consider taking up the matter with the states and discussing the means of strengthening the small claims tribunal provisions so protection can be afforded? The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: If cars do not meet the specifications of purchaspeople ers, there can be a number of remedies available to the purchasers, under both the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and the fair trading legislation of the various States and Territories. The Trade Practices Act, in particular, provides a comprehensive regime of protection to consumers. It confers rights upon consumers who suffer loss as a result of misleading or deceptive conduct by businesses, or as a result of breaches of other more specific prohibitions of unfair trading practices. These provisions are enforced by the Trade Practices Commission, or consumers themselves can take action to seek redress for contraventions. Where goods are faulty or mis-described, the Act also provides consumers with contractually enforceable rights against the seller of the goods, as well as statutory rights which can be pursued against the manufacturer or importer of the goods. Consumers in remote areas, of course, can be faced with special difficulties in seeking to enforce their legal rights. The Government is aware of the problems facing the community in obtaining adequate access to justice and will be seeking to address many of the important issues in its Justice Statement later this year. One of the most effective ways of safeguarding consumer rights, however, is to ensure that consumers themselves are fully informed of their rights. The Government has recently undertaken several initiatives in this area of relevance to the matters raised by the honourable member. Consumer education is an important means of ensuring that all consumers, especially those in country areas, have access to information to help them make better purchasing decisions. The Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs and other government consumer protection authorities manage a comprehensive consumer education program which aims to promote a greater awareness of consumers' rights and responsibilities. For example, in the last year the Bureau has collaborated with the former South Australian Department of Public and Consumer Affairs to manage a consumer education program entitled Don t Get Ripped Off: You Have Consumer Rights. This program targeted indigenous in central Australia and aimed to make them more aware of their consumer rights and responsibilities in relation to motor vehicle purchases, life insurance and second hand goods. The Commonwealth Financial Counselling Grants Program administered by the Bureau supports financial counselling agencies in many rural areas around Australia including Alice Springs (Northern Territory), Derby (Western Australia), Rockhampton (Central Queensland). These agencies provide services to disadvantaged consumers on financial matters including major consumer purchases like motor vehicles. The State limits on the jurisdiction of State and Territory small claims tribunals would usually be exceeded by the value of a new car. However, in the cases of a minor failure to comply with specifications, the cost of adjustment might often be well within the limits of the relevant tribunal. The jurisdictional limits of the State and Territory small claims tribunals are matters for the States and Territories. If the honourable member believes that there is a problem in a particular State or Territory, it might be appropriate for him to approach the relevant State or Territory Minister.",163
