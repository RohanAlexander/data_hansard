2,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present the committee's report course entitled Report on the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",11
3,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I am pleased to table the report of the committee's inquiry into the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994. This report is a detailed examination of the legal and policy issues arising out of the Legislative Instruments Bill. The bill sets out a comprehensive regime for the making, publication and scrutiny of delegated legislation. It is the government's response to the Administrative Review Council's report Rule making by Commonwealth agencies, which makes recommendations for improving the quality of, and accessto, delegated legislation. The bill was introduced into the Senate and read a first time on 30 June 1994. It was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. That committee presented its report to the Senate on 17 October 1994. The committee endorsed the q,bjectives of the bill and generally supported its main principles. The government's response to that report was tabled on 8 November 1994. The bill was read a second time in the Senate on 9 November 1994. Consideration of the bill by the Senate in committee of the whole was deferred, and the government agreed that it would not proceed until the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs reported on the bill. On 10 November 1994 the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) asked the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to report on the bill. The committee was also asked to report on the proposed government amendments, some of which responded to recommendations of the regulations and ordinances committee report, and any related matters. The Attorney General, in referring the bill to the committee stated: Notwithstanding the Bill's consideration by the Report Senate Committee, the shadow Attorney-General has raised the desirability of your Committee also examining the Bill, before its passage through the Senate. I have agreed that this is an appropriate of action, since the Bill is a major legislative project which affects th- making, pUblication and scrutiny of Commonwealth delegated legislation. This committee has taken a broader approach to the bill than did the Senate committee, which had narrower terms of reference. The committee has endeavoured to avoid duplication of work, but this has not always been possible. The volume of delegated legislation is increasing and is having a greater impact on all Australians. The objects of the bill are to regulate the variety of delegated legislation, to improve its quality by encouraging consultation before it is made and to improve access by users of delegated legislation. Almost all evidence received by the committee expressed support for the objectives of the bill. The committee supports the thrust of the bill. The bill will play an important part in the process of improving access to justice. Nonetheless, the committee has made 38 recommendations in relation to the bill. Most of these are designed to enhance what is already in the bill. The Administrative Review Council, in its report Rule making by Commonwealth agencies, highlighted a number of problems with existing delegated legislation. These included a proliferation in the number of delegated legislative instruments and the different kinds of instruments; the poor quality of drafting of some delegated legislation; the inaccessibility of some delegated legislation; an element of chance in the application of the tabling and disallowance procedures of parliament to delegated legislation. The ARC was also critical of the lack of consultation requirements for making legislation and the absence of a sunsetting regime. Sunsetting is the practice of providing f-r legislation to cease to have effect on a specIfied day or after it has been in force for a designated period of time. The ARC report made the following r-com­ mendations to address the problems that It had highlighted: a new act should b- enacte- to prescribe procedures for the makmg, p-blI-a­ tion and scrutiny of all delegated legIslatIve instruments; the Office of Legislative Drafting should be given responsibility to ensure that delegated legislation is prepared to an. app!opriate standard; all delegated legIslatIve instruments should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny by way of tabling .and d!sallo-ance; a register should be establIshed m WhICh all delegated legislative instruments should be published. The ARC also rec-mmended - he introduction of mandatory publIc consultatIOn for the making of all instruments and for all instruments to be subjected to sunsetting. The bill gives effect to the ARC's reco-­ mendations that were intended to deal WIth the problems of the increas.e in. the .vo!ume and variety of delegated. legIslatIon,. Its m-c­ cessibility, its poor draftmg and the I-consls­ tent application of parliamentary scrutmy. The bill will have the effect of integrating all delegated legislation of a legislative c-ara-ter into a single class, to be known as legIslatIve instruments, regardless of how they are described by the act under which they are made. The committee supports this approach. However, the committee has recommended that the definition be broadened so as to ensure that all the instruments of a legislative character that were intended to be caught by the bill are caught. The bill establishes an electronic register existing and future legislative. instruments. Such instruments must be regIstered to be enforceable. The register will be accessible to the public. Members of the public will be able to scan the register and print out a cop- of any legislative instrument. The commIttee regards the establishment of the register.as a significant improvement on the current sI.tuation, where a good deal of delegated legIslation is inaccessible to all but a small sector of the community. The committee has made a number of recommendations designed to improve public access to the register. The bill establishes the office of Principal Legislative Counsel within the Attorney General's Department as the office responsible for ensuring delegated legislation is of a high standard. The committee supports the establishment of this office and expects that the drafting quality of delegated legislation will be improved as a result of this. The making, publication and parliamentary scrutiny of legislative instruments will be carried out largely in a uniform manner. The bill will replace the existing regime operating under the Statutory Rules Publication Act and part XII of the Acts Inter-retation Act. - he committee supports the parlIamentary scrutmy regime proposed by the bill. To. further improve access to the law, the commIttee has recommended that documents incorporated by reference into a legislative instrument should be registered and tabled in the parliament. An exception will be made for large volume documents. The bill departs from the recommendations in the ARC report in that it does not provide for consultation in relation to the making of all instruments, nor does it provide for automatic sunsetting. Instead, it limits consultation to proposed legislative instruments that - ire-t­ ly affect business. At present consultatIon IS, in most cases, at the discretion of the relevant Commonwealth agency or department. Instead of sunsetting, it provides for the backcap-re of all delegated legislation. That is, existmg delegated legislation must be entered on the register but it need not be remade. The committee has concerns about consultaof tion being limited to matt-rs that direct-y affect business. The commIttee supports m principle consultation in relation to all legislative instruments and has recommended that general consultation requirements be introduced as soon as possible. Similarly, the committee also supports in principle sunsetting and has recommended that as-setting regime be introduced as soon as pOSSIble. The committee has carefully considered clause 7 of the bill, which provides for the Attorney-General, in cases of uncertainty, to issue a conclusive certificate as to whether instrument is legislative or not. The committee supports the proposed government amendments whereby such a certificate will be a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46B of the Acts Interpretation Act. Judicial scrutiny of a decision of the Attorgovernment ney-General is available: namely, review by the High Court in its original jurisdiction conferred by paragraph 75(v) of the constitution and review by the Federal Court under section 39B of the Judiciary Act. The committee considers that decisions by the Attorney-General to give a certificate under clause 7 should also be reviewable under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. It is of the view that parliamentary scrutiny and judicial scrutiny can coexist and that it is not appropriate to exclude the more accessible means of judicial review. For similar reasons, the committee has recommended that decisions under part 3 of the bill relating to· consultation should be reviewable under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. The committee supports the government's plan to have a review of the legislation in three years. The committee has recommended that the Administrative Review Council, or another body independent of government; undertake the review. The bill is clearly in the right direction. Critics of the bill maintain that it does not go far enough, especially in the areas of consultation and sunsetting. The committee regards the review of the legislation as an essential element in maintaining the momentum for better quality and more accessible delegated legislation. The implementation of the committee's recommendations will have some initial cost and resource implications for departments and agencies. The committee considers that the long-term benefits flowing from the recommendations must be taken into account. They will result in greater legitimacy for delegated legislation in the eyes of the community at large. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the work of the committee secretariat. The committee secretary, Judy Middlebrook, and the inquiry secretary, Michael Wright, and other an staffStephen Gisz, Mearl Price and Vicki Somlyay-all made significant contributions to the inquiry and to the writing of the report. On behalf of the committee, I thank them.",11
4,Mr WILLIAMS,COMMITTEES,"by leaveTwo desirable features of modern democratic are that the government consults the people in its decision making and that it accounts publicly for its actions. In the making of delegated legislation-generally the function of the executive rather than the parliament-these two desirable features are notoriously absent. The Legislative Instruments Bill 1994, the subject of this report, seeks to remedy the deficiency in relation to delegated legislation in one major respect: it will require the executive to consult the public in relation to proposals for secondary legislation. It is also a desirable feature of good government that legislation be published so that the public has ready access to it. The bill also contains some proposals for reform of public access to delegated legislation. The report is based on the 1992 report of the Administrative Review Council entitled Rule making by Commonwealth agencies. It is based on, but does not fully implement, the recommendations of that report. The ancient traditional role of parliament in protecting individual citizens from oppressive actions of a step the executive has long ago become almost impossible for parliament to achieve. In modern times, and particularly in Australia during the 1970s, this has resulted in the development of a range of measures to provide other means for review of government decisions. This range of measures is sometimes referred to as the new administrative law. The initiatives for· these measures were largely initiatives of coalition governments. I refer to the introduction of the administrative appeals procedure through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The legislation for that established the Administrative Review Council, which had a leading role in relation to legislation. The measures also involved the administrative decision""s judicial review process, the freedom of information process and, a little later in the process, the establishment of the range of offices now grouped under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The reforms proposed by the Administrative Review Council that resulted in the Legislative Instruments Bill have the potential to become another pillar in this new administracourse, tive law system, another pillar in the regulation of the relationship between the government and the governed. Regrettably, however, the reforms proposed by the ARC will not all be picked up. In preparing the legislative proposal, the Attorhey-General's Department has plainly encountered resistance from other departments to the introduction of a requirewhat ment of consultation. The result is that the proposes that the consultation requirements relate only to legislative instruments that affect business directly. The Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has accepted this limitation of the implementation of the ARC recommendations. Certainly in my case, and I think in· the case of other members of the committee, this is done on an assumption that it is government policy that the reforms will in due course apply across the board to all departments. It is important that a culture be developed right fr0111 the commencement the operation of the reforms so that it is seen simply as the start and not as the. end of process. The reforms relating to business will be most welcome but there are equally, if more, pressing reasons why the public should be consulted about measures that affect other than in the business context. Another recommendation of the ARC in report related to the sunsetting of delegated legislation. The ARC recommended that all delegated legislation should have a limited life. Again, the government, particularly Attorney-General's Department, has encountimportant ered resistance to the implementation of this measure; although it was not to any great degree evident before the committee. It suggested that the resources required to review all existing delegated legislation would be such that it would not be practicable in short term. Surprisingly, one of the reasons put forward was that it may not be possible even to find all the delegated legislation that impacts upon the citizens. Again, I think the committee accepted somewhat reluctantly that there will be a phased introduction. In my view, it is important that the government develop a culture across all departments right from the start that sunsetting will, in due be introduced and applied across the board. Another feature of the bill which was not part of the ARC recommendations is the introduction of the certificate of the Attorney General. Apparently, it was considered that some decision makers on delegated legislation would have difficulty in determining whether was proposed was legislative in characbill ter or merely administrative. Rather than simply rely upon legal advice to the departwill ment, the mechanism of the introduction of a certificate of the Attorney-General to determine whether a proposal was legislative in character or not was introduced. This is somewhat anomalous because it puts a decision of the Attorney-General, which is basically a legal opinion, into the form of a certificate stating that something is fact. I think it is rightly recommended by the committee that the certificate should be subject to judicial review by the Federal Court of under the ADJR procedure. It is important that a quickly developed body of rules, if not the laws, be developed which enable the departments and other bodies involved in delegated not legislation making to determine quickly whether what they propose is legislative in them character or merely administrative. There are a number of other measures in its the proposals on which the committee has commented and on which I would like to comment, but I will save that for another day. I simply say that, yet again, the report of the the committee vindicates the process whereby an bill is referred to a House of Representatives committee for detailed inquiry and report. The committee report is unanimous. was The recommendations are significant and should be carefully considered by the government. The spirit and the principle of the bill the are maintained, but the improvements recommended would make it a better bill. I join with the committee chair in commending the secretariat on promptly undertaking a detailed exercise. It is not an area which is readily understood by many people, and the work of the secretariat was commendable and expeditious. I commend the report to the House.",13
5,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The comments made by my two colleagues the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) and the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) in regard to delegated legislation would leave most people in the community at a loss to know what the parliament does. The thought of delegated legislation and legislative instruments is mind-boggling. The inquiry by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the Legislative Instruments Bill was a very worthy project. I pay tribute to the member for Tangney for raising this matter with the committee and for using strong powers of persuasion to encourage us to conduct this investigation. It has proved an invaluable exercise. The parliament makes something like 1,605 decisions of a legislative type. These decisions relate to rulesMr Rocher-Every year?",15
6,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,"Every year. For the interest of my honourable friend, from 1990 there have been about 1,424 decisions of a legislative type. These have not passed through the parliament. They are usually placed on the table and, if anybody objects, they are debated and discussed. But usually they are just flicked through the House and nobody is any the wiser. Professor Curtis, a former senior officer of the Attorney-General's Department, drew attention to the problem of the large number of forms of secondary legislation. He said that this is in contrast to the earlier practices of using regulations made by the Governor General as the basic form of delegated legislation and departing from that only in special circumstances. He asserts that many forms that the delegated legislation now takes means that the convenience of the bureaucracy has been allowed to transcend the convenience of the public. I would have to agree with that. In many instances it appears that ministers, in order to gather power and ease of administration, have allowed to develop some practices that are not in the best interests of the community. This legislation-full credit to the government-seeks to redress that to some degree. In considering the government's bill and how the parliament should deal with rules and ordinances and regulations that we would not normally look at, the committee examined the legislation and has made a number of recommendations. Mr Speaker, as you would realise, part of the problem with delegated legislation or legislative instruments is that the scrutiny by the parliament is poor. It is very difficult to make amendments to any of the regulations or rules. Mostly you have to dump the lot; in other words, oppose all the regulations or accept all of them. You cannot make minor changes. That has distressed both the House and the Senate from time to time. Then again, a lot of the rules and regulations relating to delegated legislation are not available to the public for scrutiny. They are not even printed by the Government Printer. No list is kept anywhere. Nobody knows what is going on. It is a very powerful weapon to keep people uninformed and under the control of the Public Service. We considered this matter and have some significant recommendations to make to the government. Some of those recommendations state that the government ought to allow full and open consultation in the rule making process so everybody knows what is going on and can have a say. That occurs in both the New South Wales and Victorian parliaments, and the committees of the parliament that have been conducting the scrutiny process have been very impressed with the change in attitude of the Public Service and ministers. Good ministers flourish. Ministers who want to manipulate and hide things do not flourish when you shed a light of revelation and information on what they are doing. For those reasons, the committee supports the legislation but feels that it does not go far enough. The argument was used before the committee that the Public Service has to get used to the change in this process. The committee was told that there will be a lot of resistance to it and that some will want to contest the way in which it is going into operation. The attitude of the committee was basically that that was too bad. The Public Service has to learn adjust to a more open climate and be prepared to make changes, as the community wants transparency and an attitude of excellence in what is done by the Public Service. In regard to clause 19 of the legislation, committee made a number of recommendaHouse, tions about not excluding from scrutiny budgetary processes or those deemed by government to be urgent or those about which consultations have already taken place. Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) can claim that he has consulted a whole range of people, he has not fully done that and the House wants to consult different people. I commend the work of the committee. However, we struck trouble-which I believe is yet to be resolved-with regard to the take note of. decisions of the Commissioner of Taxation. I notice that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) is in the chamber. I know he will have more to say about the of taxation commissioner, and I will defer to for comment.",15
7,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"by leave-As others before me have done, I would like to commend the scrutiny that the Standing Committee on Legal and Constituall tional Affairs has been able to give to Legislative Instruments Bill 1994. In particurevised lar, I commend the honourable member for expire. Tangney (Mr Williams) for the initiative he took in suggesting that we have a look at legislation. The proliferation of what now are to be defined as legislative instruments has been of great concern. Over the years, the extent of what previously were regulations that went before the scrutiny of the Executive Council, and consequently had some prior analysis before publication, has been such that today there are many the existence of which few are aware. As my colleague the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) has just identified, their number is such that they do intrude very much on the lives of citizens, in many instances having been introduced without parliamentary scrutiny or public comment. However, over the years the Senate Standto ing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances have done a very good job, each within its terms of reference. While it has been suggested that a similar committee be constituted in this place, I doubt the the wisdom of that. Given the nature of this I suspect that a detailed inquirywhich would be the obligation of such a the committee-would be unlikely to meet the demands the public rightly have that legislaThe tive instruments be publicly examined and that their nature and character be ensured. It yet seems to me, therefore, that one aspect to which references are being made in the committee-that is, whether or not the terms of reference to Senate committees might be extended-is something the government might I turn to the conclusions within the report. Several conclusions have been mentioned that I wish to discuss. First, I think the registration legislative instruments is an excellent idea. him Whether that is the same as sunsetting is a matter of some doubt. We had some discussions and received some evidence on the matter. I believe there would be a considerable advantage in setting a timetable by which regulations before a particular date were the required to be revised. If they were not by a certain date, then they would Instead of that, the registration procedure, the to which this bill refers and about which reference is made in our committee, is seen as an alternative. It has been said-and I guess it has some validity-that sunsetting whilst desirable is expensive and might be a little hard on the bureaucracy. Frankly, I did not find that sufficient. So we recommended, in recommendation 23, that a sunsetting regime be introduced to all existing future legislative instruments as soon as possible. I believe that is desirable, although I accept that the registration procedure allows the public to have at least some idea what legislative instruments will apply to them. I turn to a number of administrative decisions. There has always been some doubt as to whether they are administrative or legislative in character. Some reference is made in the report to the public rulings of the Australian taxation commissioner. To my mind, there are now far too many public rulings for any taxpayer to· have a reasonable opportunity to understand or be aware. One needs only to look at the volume of taxation legislation to see just how difficult it is to be reasonably informed on the nuances and finer points of tax law. For that reason, when such legislation is extended to the degree that it is by public and private rulings of the A TO, it becomes even more difficult. We gave some thought to whether public rulings should be considered as legislative instruments. To have done so would have given them a legislative character; it also would have denied the capacity for them to be examined in the courts, as they now can be. lt was on that basis alone that I and my colleagues were persuaded that, at this stage, they should not be given the nature of a No.4 legislative instrument. We certainly feel this area should be looked at by the ARC in its review. We suggested a number of matters which the ARC should examine, and that is one of them. I think the review provides a better piece of legislation than that which was previously before the House even after the scrutiny of the Senate committee. I pay tribute to the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), and its No.5 secretariat. I think this inquiry has been worthwhile. I believe the government should consider the report. After such consideration and, hopefully, after modifying it accordingly, I believe it should be introduced with amendment into this House and passed by the parliament. Motion (by Mr Melham)-by leaveproposed: That the House take note of the report. Debate (on motion by Mr Cobb) adjourned.

8,Mr ELLIOTT,COMMITTEES,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. These amendments to the Life Insurance Bill 1994 follow the discussion we had in the House last year on the bill. Since that time, the industry has made representations on a few technical issues. The amendments were declared then discussed, proposed by the government and agreed to by the Senate. They clarify some of the elements of the bill about which the industry was concerned. There certainly has been conflicting advice as to whether the definitional or technical issues that are referred to are absolutely in need of amendment. But, to the extent that the Life Insurance Bill represents a new era in respect of the prudential arrangements for the life insurance industry, the government and the Senate agreed that they were amendments that should be considered and adopted. They provide, amongst other things, clarification that life company business includes the investment, administration and management of statutory fund assets, and a variety of other definitional questions relating to what represents the business of life insurance and, therefore, the commissioner's rules applying to those provisions. So I do not think the amendments need a great deal of discussion. The Life Insurance Bill has had a very extensive period of consultation both prior to its presentation to the House of Representatives and since then. The fact that these amendments have been picked up reflects the fact that both the practitioners in the industry and the regulator now have a new regime for the life insurance industry which is very much of a contemporary nature and ensures that we have a strong prudential arrangement but also, I hope,a very dynamic industry into the future. On matters dealing with some of the consumer protection issues, it is the government's intention to bring those matters back into the parliament later in this session as well. I know that the Minister for C()llsumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) is in the chamber and that the consumer side of the bill will again form an integral part· of this package relating to the life insurance industry when the final package of measures is adopted by the parliament. So, with those few words, I commend the amendments to the House and present the supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the amendments.",18
9,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMITTEES,"The opposition does not oppose these amendments. There has been a full and frank exchange of views both in this place before the Christmas recess as well as in the Senate in recent days. The importance of this legislation is obvious. It is a fundamental reform of the Life Insurance Act 1945 and many people, especially in the industry, would say it was sorely in need of that reform because·it is a very long time since it was seriously looked at by the parliament. I think we would all agree that the social contribution to Australia over many years by the life insurance industry has been of fundamental importance. It is worth noting that, according to the industry, it was through life insurance that Sir Robert Menzies, when he was the Prime Minister of Australia, was able to achieve a rate of investment of some 59 per cent of Australia's total capital needs, domestically, through life insurance.",19
10,Mr COBB,COMMITTEES,It's less now.,19
11,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMITTEES,"That is significantly less now and we are far more dependent both on equity finance and on loan raisings overseas to meet our basic needs. So the whole purpose of this insurance reform legislation, I hope, will be to put in place a regime which will, in a sense, resuscitate the industry. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) has made the point that he hopes these changes will see a 'more dynamic industry'. But it is fair to point out to the House that over recent years the industry has been decimated-and that is not too strong a word to use. In fact, only four companies are now in the marketplace for life contracts. There has been a major market shift to term insurance, and this is one of the worries. Of the significant number of people who now take out term insurance-that is, on a rising scale of premiums; as you get older you pay more--some 98 per cent of them drop out before they die. One could seriously question, therefore, in terms of the equity in the program, whether that is really in the national interest. People are, in effect, funding themselves, usually for a period of time in their mid-life when they expect major responsibilities: their mortgage payments, their children's education and so forth. Of course it is appropriate they should have additional insurance at that time to supplement whatever superannuation they may have, but it does seem to be very sad that later on, when they are approaching retirement, when the premium levels become, to say the least, very onerous for many of these people, 98 per cent of them drop out. One of the difficulties we have seen in recent years-and this is undoubtedly a fundamental criticism of the industry itselfis that the life insurance industry has failed for too long to provide a range of products to the marketplace in keeping with the changed economic and social circumstances of Australia. Perhaps the most important component of this was its failure for too long to address the reality of inflation and what inflation was doing to the traditional life insurance contract. It was decimating those contracts and people were being told along the length and breadth of Australia, 'Don't bother going to life insurance and, if you are in life insurance, get out of it because you can make a better deal somewhere else.' It is in that context that we are now seeing the spread of superannuation. I hope we are going to see an expansion of interest in the life offices, in particular, in providing a range of products more in keeping with the needs of the community as a whole. This legislation principally will be strengthening the controls on the life insurance industry and, hopefully, improving the level of protection for consumers, which, as I have noted from my early observations, is of fundamental importance. It does update a 50year-old legislative base which was clearly no longer effective and had to be changed. It establishes the Life Insurance Actuarial Standards Board that will develop standards for the prudential control of life policies and ensure that responsibilities of directors, actuaries and auditors will also be increased. In that context, I note in particular proposed amendment No.9. It is very important. It again addresses this issue of consumer protection. Subclause 3 makes the point: In order to avoid doubt, it is declared event of conflict between the interests of owners and prospective owners of policies referable to a statutory fund and the interests of shareholders a life company, a director's duty is to take able care, and use due diligence, to see that the company gives priority to the interests of owners and prospective owners of those policies over interests of shareholders. Of all these amendments, I believe that is the most profound of all. It does make the point absolutely clearly that consumer protection and, I might add, for the benefit of the minister who is at the table, the Minister Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh), consumer confidence in this product can be achieved only if people genuinely believe that, in these very large corporations controlling multifacility, billion dollar investments, it will be the responsibility of the directors of those corpoprovide rations to ensure that the rights of individuals either as mutual policyholders or as sharegalvanised holders in those corporations through their ownership of a policy are respected and protected. If the legislation achieves that, have not the slightest doubt it will be a significant improvement in re-establishing life insurance as a viable vehicle for long-term saving in this country at a time when it is sorely needed. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Public Works Committee Reference",19
12,Ms MCHUGH,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: RAAF Base Richmond replacement medical centre. The present medical centre currently occupies a conglomerate of interlinked buildings in the centre of the base. The main building is of brick construction dating from the mid-1930s and houses an operating theatre, administrative areas and several wards. The ancillary buildings, of timber framed, asbestos clad construction with galvanised iron roofs, date from the early 1940s and are used for wards that, in the and ancillary medical functions. These outlying wartime buildings were of initially intended as temporary structures but reasonhave remained in permanent use. Due to their age and construction, the buildings have long the proved inefficient for staffing and operations, are difficult and expensive to maintain and represent a significant health and fire safety hazard. Provision of a replacement facility will satisfy the recommendation in the defence report of the working party to review for the ADF policy for the provision of hospital care dated 30 November 1990. Key reasons justifying the replacement facilities are, firstly, to replace a dilapidated which is incapable of satisfactorily providing for its required functions, and to facilities to meet current standards that will replace maintenance intensive timber, iron and asbestos clad buildings constructed in the 1930s and 1940s. This will also serve to eliminate extant occupational I health and safety problems and provide a standard of patient care equivalent to that of the wider community. The second reason is to maintain Defence Force specific health care facilities for the RAAF as distinct from using civilian health care facilities, in recognition of the significantly different priorities and policies between civilian and defence health care. Such priorities and policies include the provision of operational health support, an increased emphasis on health promotion and a focus on the rapid treatment of personnel to ensure they return to duty with minimal delay. The third reason is to achieve a functional, safe, efficient and pleasant working environment and to eliminate inadequate medical practices, such as movement between buildings, which have a detrimental effect on effective patient care and expensive medical equipment. The fourth reason is to provide facilities for specialist training in aeromedical evacuation, aviation medicine, operational health support and first aid, and to enhance operational responsiveness to meet government objectives. The fifth reason is to comply with all statutory regulations and Department of Defence requirements regarding occupational health and safety issues. Environmental effects of the planned repiacement works have been determined to be minimal as works are restricted to the confines of the existing base. An environmental certificate of compliance has been issued. The cost estimate of the proposed works at December 1994 prices is $12.292 million. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA (SUBSTANTIATION) BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 February, on motion by Mr Gear: That the bill be now read a second time. (Quorum formed)",20
13,Mr ROCHER,TAX LAW IMPROVEMENT,"Curtin) (10.21 a.m.)When debate on the Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill 1994 was interrupted because of the adjournment debate last night, I had made the point that, whilst we support the substantiation legislation, the progress made is not significant enough. I gave a couple of examples where we welcome the fact that it will be no longer necessary to sign every entry in a log book or to keep records of laundry expenses. But the process must go further. The Taxation Institute of Australia has stated in connection with this exercise: It is acknowledged that a move to a simpler legislative framework with a less legalistic structure is clearly the preferred approach to the future direction of tax laws. However, the change in language used in the legislation is not of itself sufficient to materially reduce the compliance burden on taxpayers in complying with the substantiation provisions. That is the nub of our point of view. That quote brings the shortcomings of this so called tax law improvement process to the fore. As I have had reason to remind the House on numerous occasions, this legislation does not tackle the major problem; that being the cost of compliance and the concomitant need to simplify the tax laws in total. Plain English and a better drafting are not in themselves a substitute for simpler tax law with lower compliance costs. Simplification is, to a large degree, a matter of policy. So far, Labor refuses to address the problems inherent in the current tax regime and thereby gives the impression that it cannot comprehend what is appropriate tax policy in this modem age. Notwithstanding the move to simpler language and the easing of the substantiation burden, page 55 of the billsection 16-3(1) of schedule 2b-highlights not so much a fundamental flaw in the rewrite process as in the underlying policy. At this section of the bill an illustrative example is given for the guidance of taxpayers. It states: If you fly to Los Angeles for the sole purpose of attending a 7 day conference, but you don't record the conference in your travel record, you cannot deduct the cost of the air fare. This is so even if you have written evidence that you paid the fare (eg a receipt), as required by Division 5.",21
14,Mr COBB,TAX LAW IMPROVEMENT,-Crazy.,21
15,Mr ROCHER,TAX LAW IMPROVEMENT,"Indeed. This example goes to the heart of taxpayers' concerns with the substantiation provisions. It clearly illustrates that a taxpayer can honestly and properly incur and record expenditure on a business expense, but because the particular prescribed format is not observed the deduction is dethe nied. That is the ultimate in bureaucratic nonsense, if I might say so. It is compliance provisions need rewriting if the exercise is to extract more than a superficial benefit to taxpayers. To date, the government has spoken a great deal about simplifying the tax system but done virtually nothing to further that objecDecember tive. Quite frankly, Labor's record in this is abysmal. As early as the 1985 tax summit, in a draft white paper, the then Treasurerthe guess who-stated: A good tax system should be as simple as possible ... to reduce the burden of record keeping to increase the certainty of what is, or is not, forgotten. taxable and to increase the clarity of the tax system. What ever happened to that objective? It got lost somewhere on the Prime Minister's desk, only to re-emerge in February 1990 in the form of a statement announcing the establishTreasurer ment of a review team, comprising Australian Taxation Office and Treasury officers, to examine options for the simplification of the tax system. In the statement, er-guess who-made it clear that the tax system needed to be simplified. He stated: A modernised and simplified tax system is part of the government's on-going commitmentto reforms which increase our national competitiveness and efficiency.",21
16,Mr COBB,TAX LAW IMPROVEMENT,What happened to that promise?,22
17,Mr ROCHER,TAX LAW IMPROVEMENT,"Indeed. He went on further to say: Against this background, the government has decided to build on its achievements of the 1980s by undertaking a major new study of options to reduce uncertainty and complexity within the income tax system, and thereby make it simpler for taxpayers and the tax administration. Streamlining processes for individual taxpayers will be a major objective of the review. Now, that was in 1990, but that was the last we heard of the tax simplification project until December 1993, over three years later. The review team reportedly produced an options paper but it has never been made public. I have applied for it under a freedom of information application and, of course, got nothing back. It is now before the Ombudsman, because I think I was improperly refused information, and there the matter stands. I would be very interested to read what they clear that the were saying in 1993. Instead of simplifying the tax system in a well planned manner, the government since 1990 has continued to increase the complexity of tax laws and add to the already tremenhas dously high costs of compliance. On 17 1993, the then Treasurer announced area 'the commencement of a project to improve Australia's income tax law', which was titled Tax Law Improvement Project-and here is the third cracker-hence the report undertaken in 1990 by the review team was not ... only ignored but also forgotten, gone and Cynicism is the best description of the reaction of the opposition-and professional organisations-to the government's talk about simplifying the tax system. The Assistant (Mr Gear) on 28 July 1993 made a speech to the Corporate Tax Association in which his and the government's attitude to tax simplification was made clear. The Assistant the then TreasurTreasurer said: I should say that I do not see a need for any significant change in the directions that have been set for tax administration ... but change now should be more in the nature of fine-tuning ... In speaking on compliance costs, the Assistant Treasurer said: I have set as one of my priorities reaching a greater understanding of the major elements that feed into compliance costs and exploring ways of minimising those costs. I must stress, however, that work in this area will need to proceed within the broad framework that the government has set. Labor's position is clear: it will not make the wide ranging changes to the tax system needed to make it fair, economically efficient and as simple as possible. All these problems with the tax system that I have raised are referred to in the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts of November 1993, titled An assessment of tax. I am delighted to see the chairman of that committee, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), here in the chamber. It is indicative of the complexity of the tax law that the Australian Taxation Office bombarded tax advisers last year with a new ruling every day, and this year has issued for comment seven draft rulings, averaging almost 40 pages each. By way of illustration, I will mention a couple of tax rulings issued last year. (Time expired)",22
18,Mr LES SCOTT,TAX LAW IMPROVEMENT,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the bills before the House. The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) rightly points out the history of the Public Accounts Committee's interest in tax administration-and he specifically mentioned our report No. 326, An assessment of tax. The committees of this parliament are becoming more and more important each day. The first item on the program this morning was a report by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I was interested to listen to the debate by the various members who spoke in relation to the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994. It is important that committees have this role in reviewing a lot of the legislation before parliament and having an input into it. We can note with pride that that is something we have done in this parliament; we have taken more note of the work of committees. On this occasion, the work of the Public Accounts Committee has led to the Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill 1994. There are other bills before the parliament at the moment that the Public Accounts Committee, a committee that I chair, has a very serious interest in. I refer to the audit bill which is in the other place at the moment. It is important that we note that influence because in the public arena it is not often understood that, as members of parliament, we spend a great amount of time on committee work. It is good to see a lot of that work coming to fruition. The openness and frankness with which we can discuss things in those committees is important. The member for Curtin mentioned report No. 326 from the Public Accounts Committee. Comments in that report were made very much on a bipartisan basis. That report took some two years. It started in November 1991-but the March 1993 election delayed it. The first work of the Public Accounts Committee in this parliament was to take up the completion of that report. It was certainly an extensive report with 148 recommendations. A lot of those have been taken up by the government. This legislation is a result of that work. I will quote from the executive summary of the report. It sums up some of the committee's concerns about the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The action the government is taking here flows on from that. The report stated: The Inquiry into the ATO was concerned with the administration of the taxation system of Australia. Questions of the tax mix and policy were not considered. That is understandable. However, from the earliest moment the Committee recognised that the efficiency of taxation administration was related directly to the efficiency of Australia's principal taxation Act, the Income TaX Assessment Act 1936 ... As possibly the most important piece of economic legislation in Australia, the Committee found the Act was in desperate need of a comprehensive overhaul. Not only has the Act developed into a complex and incomprehensible mass of convoluted, legalistic and pedantic provisions but, most importantly, the uncertainty of its meaning acts as a positive detriment to the welfare of Australia. That sums up our view about it. The government is acknowledging that concern by bringing this legislation before us. The explanatory memorandum to the bill before· us gives reasons for the project. On page 2 it is stated: For many years, the income tax law has been criticised for being too difficult to read and understand. The structure of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936(the ITAA), which contains most of the basic rights and obligations of Australia's income tax system, has become overgrown and obscured by the addition of new material over the years. A very formal and detailed style of language used in the law also makes its true meaning hard to find. The government is responding by making those comments. It has acknowledged that there are those problems, as we acknowledged in that report as well. (Quorum formed) I appreciate my colleagues coming into listen to my comments about the 'J7ax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill 1994, because they obviously are very concerned about it. Mr Deputy Speaker, when you spoke on this debate you expressed your interest in this legislation as well. I think it is important we think about what this bill is about instead of the antics of those opposite. This is their second quorum for the day. I am sure they will have another fun day today, once again wasting the time of this House. I will not waste much more time on them, because I do not think they are worth it, quite frankly. This bill is the first produced by the tax improvement project, which I referred to earlier. The bill proposes to replace the substantiation provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. I would like to congratulate the project team for producing a bill which represents a significant improvement on the current law relating to the substantiation of deductions. The bill contains many creative and innovative features, all of which are designed to make the law easier to use and understand. Some of the particularly noteworthy features of the bill are: that it changes the structure and order of the current law to make it easier for users to navigate their way through the various provisions; that it uses clear, simple and direct language to make the law more readable; that it u-es explanatory material in the text of the bill to give examples of how the bill is intended to operate; and that it attempts to simplify the administrative procedures required to comply with the law. All these changes are for the better and, as noted in the explanatory memorandum, have the potential to reduce considerably the costs of compliance for taxpayers and the costs of administration for the Australian Taxation Office. I note in passing that many of the drafting techniques used in the bill were actually recommended in the 1993 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled Clearer Commonwealth law. That committee, which I referred to earlier, presented a report to the parliament earlier today. I mentioned then the importance of the work of committees and I highlight that aspect once again. The Public Accounts Committee made an assessment of the tax legislation and, more recently, presented a report on the audit legislation. That latter report is being conthat sidered by the parliament at the moment. I also remind the House that the tax law improvement project was established as a result of a recommendation from the Public Accounts Committee. That recommendation was one of 148. It was actually recommendation 22, which stated: The Government establish a broadly based task law force to redraft the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The next recommendation went on to suggest that it should be sufficiently resourced, and obviously it is. In 1994 the JCPA tabled report 326, An assessment of tax. One of the key recommendations in that report was that the government establish that broadly based task force to redraft the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. I welcome the initiatives taken by the government in that regard. The government moved very quickly to adopt this recommendation and in December 1993 announced the tax law improvement project. The aim of the project is to restructure, renumber and rewrite the income tax law so that it can be more easily understood by those who need to read it. It is expected that this task will take three years. In announcing the project, the then Treasurer stressed that the purpose of the project was to improve the existing law rather than review the policy behind the law. That was in the basic framework information that was provided in August 1994. The government has responded very positively to many of the other recommendations of the committee. The vast majority of the 148 recommendations made by the committee have been accepted by the government and are currently being implemented. The tax legislation introduced earlier this week also picked up some of those recommendations. At the time the tax law improvement project was established, I stated publicly that it was a welcome development and one which offered very real prospects for a long overdue rewrite of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I also referred to some concerns being expressed in the tax profession about the nature of the project team. When it was initially created the team comprised only government officials. Many in the tax profession were concerned that the team would not have adequate access to the experience and expertise of private sector practitioners. I was pleased to see that, soon after these concerns were expressed, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) took steps to appoint a consultative committee of taxpayers and tax professionals to advise the project team in its work. Of course, that has been a welcome initiative by the government, and I understand it is working very effectively. Judging by the quality of the Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill before us now, this combination of public and private sector expertise is working very well. I welcome that initiative. Because of the significance of the issues raised in the Public Accounts Committee report 326, the committee has taken a continued interest in the government's response to the report. With 148 recommendations, I am sure you would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, the ongoing interest taken by the committee. Many committees in this place maintain a watching brief and an interest in the outcomes of their reports. We have received written responses to our report from the Assistant Treasurer and from the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley). On behalf of the committee I have made public comments on these responses. We appreciate the positive response of the government. We have met with the Commissioner of Taxation, Michael Carmody, to discuss the steps being taken by the Australian Taxation Office to implement those recommendations affecting the office. I very much appreciate the cooperation which the taxation commissioner and his staff have shown towards the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. We have also met with the representatives of the tax law improvement project to discuss the work being undertaken by the project team. Specifically, the committee met with Mr Brian Nolan, the project director, who is well known in the tax field as a previous second commissioner; project team members Gavin Back, Tom Reid and Simon Gaylard; and Stan Droder, the chairman of the project team's consultative committee. One of the main issues of ongoing interest to the committee is whether the terms of reference for the tax law improvement project are sufficiently broad to enable it to deal fully with all the problems inherent in the current tax law. In the committee's view, it is essential that the momentum of change that was generated by report 326 is maintained. The work of the project is enormously significant, with potentially huge benefits for the Australian community. It is important that the maximum possible value from this opportunity be realised. Over the last few months, the committee has been considering the proposal submitted to it by the Taxation Institute of Australia, which seeks to maintain the momentum and address any stumbling blocks which may have emerged. I would like to spend a little time this morning talking about tJ'lis proposal. In mid-1994, the Taxation Institute of Australia wrote to the committee and expressed concern that the tax law improvement project did not have a wide enough ambit to fully address the intention behind the committee's recommendation. The institute is particularly concerned that, because the project is not authorised to consider policy issues, it will be unable to fully deal with the problems inherent in the current tax law. The institute proposed that the committee adopt terms of reference to allow it to oversee and review the work of the tax law improvement project. In addition, the institute has proposed the creation of a panel of 10 tax experts to advise the committee on the issues and problems which need to be addressed as part of a simplification exercise. I note that the government has formed a consultative committee which is going to ensure that there is a large contribution made by the private sector, particularly by tax practitioners in the private sector. The institute's proposal contemplates a twostage review by the committee. The first stage is to oversee the work of the project to ensure that its stated aims are achieved; the second is to consider the substantive provisions of law to determine whether policy changes need to be made to give effect to the objective of reducing the complexity of the law. It is timely that this bill is before the House today, and was before the House yesterday, because the committee was considering these matters yesterday at its normal Wednesday weekly meeting. (Quorum formed) My time on this very important issue been wasted by the opposition. Instead of taking up the proposal by the Taxation Instiimprovement tute, the committee has decided to take watching brief or a review of the implementa1993 tion of the tax law improvement project. We have already had discussions with officers from the Taxation Office, and we hope to maintain that watching briefto ensure that the goals of the work of the tax project are actually achieved. The Public Accounts Committee has an important role to play in achieving the aims of its recommendations. (Extension of time granted) The committee decided yesterday maintain this watching brief or review of work of the tax law improvement project. It is very important that we do maintain that. does not in any way reflect on the ability the officers of the tax office who were runstatement ning the committee-particularly Mr Brian Nolan, whom we hold in very high regard. From the parliament's point of view, given that a lot of these recommendations have come out of report No. 326 of the Public Accounts Committee, it is important that maintain that interest in· those recommendaurgent tions and also in the work of the tax law improvement project. That work is very important. I take the opportunity to acknowledge the cooperative spirit the committee has mainAs tained with the whole Taxation Office, parincome ticularly Michael Carmody, and also with Assistant Treasurer, who is in the chamber, and who has had the carriage of the important legislation before us. That is the sort of cooperation that the government is prepared to adopt to ensure that Australia has the possible taxation system. Only when we work in that cooperative spirit with the parliamensideration; tary committees, the tax office and the evant minister are we going to achieve better legislation and a better taxation act, which will be a good thing for all Australians-even those opposite, who do not seem to have much regard for the hard work that the Australian Taxation Office is doing in implementing the tax law improvement project.",23
19,Mr WILLIAMS,TAX LAW IMPROVEMENT,"Tangney) (10.53 a.m.)As the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said, the has Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill is the result of the efforts of the tax law project. That project was anon a nounced by the government in December with the object of rewriting the income tax law in simple language. The magnitude of the job is such that the government expects it to take three years to complete the task. I anticipate that it will take a great deal longer law improvement than three years. The announcement of the tax law improvement project was prompted, as the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) has just to indicated, by a recommendation of the Joint the Committee of Public Accounts in 1993, the suggestion being that the government establish It a broadly based task force to redraft the of Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The of objectives of the project makes it clear that the objectives do not include reforming the tax system or reviewing tax policy. There is an urgent and pressing need for the Income Tax Assessment Act to be reviewed with a view to simplifying and we improving its statement. Perhaps the most of all needs is for it to be shortened. Since the Labor government came to power in 1983, there has been literally an enormous volume of tax legislation added to the statute book. The volume is oppressive to taxpayers. a legal practitioner who gave advice on tax, I found it particularly oppressive the and I know that my colleagues in the legal and accounting professions did as well. The worse time. I can recall was around 1984-85 when, virtually at the same time, three major initiatives were introduced into the act. From best memory, they were the substantiation law; which is the subject of the bill under conthe dividend franking system; and the relthe capital gains tax system. From memory, the volume involved in each of those amendments was such that one amendment alone would have been oppressive to anybody seeking to keep up to date in understanding the tax law. The concurrence of the three amendments made it absolutely impossible for tax advisers to be abreast of the law and to be able to properly advise their clients. How accountants constantly involved in tax advice ever got through that period, I will never understand. It has become worse in another area as well. In addressing the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs this morning, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) referred to the increasingly oppressive nature of tax rulings issued by the commissioner. I am indebted to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for drawing to my attention the fact that, last year, one ruling issued by the commissioner relating to teachers-and, presumably, relating only to section 51 deductions-was 42 pages long. One ruling dealing with police was 55 pages long and, to cap it all, one relating to barbers or barber shop proprietors but to barber shop assistants was 32 pages long. It may be of assistance to barber shop assistants to know what deductions they can properly claim without fear of the penalties that can be incurred under the self-assessment system, but I doubt that most barber shop assistants would spend much time reading 32 pages of tax ruling in order to advise themselves. As I said, there is an urgent need for simplification. Even the numbering of the Income Tax Assessment Act is oppressive. Last time. I looked at the act I encountered a section 221 YDBA, which, from memory, is in either the provisional tax or the PA YE tax provisions.",26
20,Mr GEAR,TAX LAW IMPROVEMENT,Were they capitals or lower case?,27
21,Mr WILLIAMS,TAX LAW IMPROVEMENT,"-They were capitals. The Assistant Treasurer should think about that. That is seven characters, including three numbers. If you count up the number of possible combinations, you will get in the tens for each of the letters and 26 for each of the numbers. On that basis, if you fill up the act with three letters and four numbers for each provision, you will have an Income Tax Assessment Act exceeding one million sections. It is heading in that direction. In the context of simplification, I think it is appropriate to mention that there is concurrently a corporate law simplification project under way. Coincidently, the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill was debated in this House only yesterday. In that debate I moved an amendment to the second reading motion, inviting the government to recommend that the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities review the work of the corporations law simplification task force with a view to ensuring that the objects of the task force are met in the reforms that have been undertaken. That amendment was rejected by the government. In contradistinction, today we heard that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is undertaking a project of reviewing the work of the tax law improvement task force. I commend ,the joint committee on that initiative. It is most important that, in a simplification project, the' objectives sought to be not achieved are constantly in sight. It would be very easy for the task force, buried in the voluminous content of the act, to lose sight of its true objective. In the debate on the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill, I pointed out to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) that any change in an area of law that has a major impact on the community in its day-today dealings carries a heavy cost. That cost in relation to the Corporations Law is huge, given that so many people conduct their daily business in accordance with its provisions. Exactly the same can be said about the Income Tax Assessment Act, on which so many people have to structure their transactions and even the nature of their business. They have to refer to the impact such revenue measures will have upon them. The tax law improvement project will inevitably result in change to the law. You cannot simplify voluminous legislation without in some way changing it. Even if the broad principles are maintained, it is still necessary for those who operate their lives in accordance with it, particularly those advising on the impact of the tax law, to learn of the change. They have to replace the pages in their tax services; they have to know and understand the changes. They have to amend their forms and advise all their clients. The clients then have to. change their forms, practices and so on. The impact is endless. The project task force ought to bear that in mind. I think the task force could well assist the achievement of the Corporations Law objectives if it were to keep the corporations law project task force advised of the benefinevertheless cial impact that the review by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts will have in keeping its sights firmly on the objectives the improvement project. I mentioned that I was indebted to the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) for having drawn my attention to the decision of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts with regard to the initiative of the Taxation Institute of Australia. I have had a past interest in that institute. I was a state man and member of its general council some years ago. It is commendable that the tax institute has taken such a close interest improvement project. Its interest has, as understand it, resulted in the establishment the consultative body. The task force, no doubt with the best intentions, will undertake its work with diligence. However, if it does not take into that. account the impact the changes will have on the advice given to people in their daily lives, then it will have failed. It will not properly achieve the objective of simplifying, bearing in mind that the simplification is ultimately for the benefit of the consumer and not the Australian Taxation Office and its administratiation tion. I was going to comment on the bill itself. But, as it happens, the comments I was proposing to make on the bill have already been made by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). I respectfully concur with the comments he made regarding the fundamental flaw in the bill where the improvement project has not resulted in an improvement but the highlighting of a major defect which the bill seeks to preserve and maintain. The notion that a tax deduction could be lost for failure to follow a form is anathema to me and is a complete contradiction of the objectives of the improvement project itself. The Assistant Treasurer would be well advised to re-examine the provision of the bill which says that, if you go on a seven-day in conference to Los Angeles and keep what, for accounting and other tax purposes, would be proper records of your expenditure, you will not get a deduction because you have not followed the substantiation forms.",27
22,Mr GEAR,TAX LAW IMPROVEMENT,"I thank all of those who took part in the debate on the Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill. I have stated here before that I see compliance costs as the tax issue of the 1990s, and the tax law improvement project is by far our most significant effort at attacking compliance costs. The honourable member for Tangney (Mr chairWilliams) quite rightly pointed, with an example, to the outdated numbering system that has grown topsy-turvy since the tax laws in the were first introduced many years ago. I I inform the member for Tangney that there of will be public discussion and a discussion paper put out seeking views on an adequate numbering system for the new tax laws once of they have been rewritten. So, once again, we will be asking the public to have a say about Needless to say, clumsy language is a feature of the tax laws and one of the main reasons we decided to embark on the tax law improvement project. I am happy to say that the bill we have introduced today on substandoes have personalised language and streamlined administrative procedures even though they may not meet everybody's ideals. From my point of view, the strength of this project is that we have cooperation from a very talented team from the Australian Taxation Office in Canberra and Brisbane. We have allowed for some private sector leadership and a 14-person consultative committee. This substantiation rewrite has been widely circulated--over 3,500 copies have been distributed throughout Australia. I was fortunate enough to go to a meeting called in Melbourne when the tax law improvement team went down to discuss this bill. I found it very well attended. Even though I could not stay for a long time, I saw that there was of enthusiasm for it. I am sure that the bill before the House, and those bills that will follow from this project, will be much the better for that public process because community input is essential if we are to have tax laws that are meaningful to people who have to pay the taxes. Ownership of the taxation system, if you like, has to be with the community. I welcome the support the coalition has given to the bill and to the worthy improvements it will·make to the substantiation rules. The government looks forward to a speedy passage for the bill so that it has time to put in place the necessary administrative steps to ensure that taxpayers receive the benefits of these improvements in the current financial year. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) expressed concern at what he describes as the slow pace of the project. I do not think that view is widely shared when you consider the bill was introduced into the parliament within five months of the commencement of the project's three-year timetable. That is fairly quick going when you realise the bill has been developed as a model for all its future changes. It raised more issues than just substantiation. It is also impressive when you consider that it included a threemonth public consultation period. Additionally, the team is close to finalising its exposure draft bills, of its rewrite of the existing losses and mining provisions. It is also finalising a discussion paper outlining a possible new structure for the income tax law. In addition to that, it is well advanced in a number of areas such as the very extensive provisions dealing with what is income and what is deductible. So this is not the only product, if you like, of the tax law improvement project; there are a number of other things going on. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, indicated that it was his desire to have a reference to look at the tax law improvement program. I will discuss that with the chairman. I welcome the support that the opposition has given this bill. I wish the a lot tax law improvement team well on their undertakings in the future. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Gear) read a third time.

23,Mrs CROSIO,MIGRATION AGENTS,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (11.14 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is part of a package of amendments to the immigration and ethnic affairs portfolio legislation. This bill amends the Migration Act 1958 and the Immigration (Education) Act 1971. The other bills are the Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment Bill 1994, the Migration Agents Registration (Application) Levy Amendment Bill 1994 and the Migration Agents Registration (Renewal) Levy Amendment Bill 1994. The purpose of these bills is to: implement government decisions accepting recommendations of the Business Skills Advisory Panel in relation to the cancellation of business skills visas. These amendments are consequential upon the creation of new subclasses of business skills visas and are required to maintain the integrity of the cancellation regime established by the Migration Act 1958; give effect to some recommendations of the Committee for the Review of the System for Review of Migration Decisions, CROSROMD, to enhance the non-adversarial nature of the Immigration Review Tribunal, IRT. These are primarily to provide the applicant with additional entitlethe ments in relation to the presentation of, and access to, material before the tribunal. create the positions of a deputy principal member and senior members of the Refugee Review Tribunal, RRT. These amendments are designed to enhance the effectiveness of the RRT. provide for the Remuneration Tribunal to determine the remuneration of members of the IRT and the RRT. This will bring both tribunals into line with other tribunals such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Veterans Review Board; implement the government's decision to provide for the increases in portfolio fees, charges and levies in line with the impact of price movements on Commonwealth government running costs outlays without the need to periodically amend primary legislation. The proposed indexation amendments are contained in separate bills as follows: this bill-amendments to the Immigration (Education) Act 1971; Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment Bill 1994; Migration Agents Registration (Application) Levy Amendment Bill 1994; and, Migration Agents Registration (Renewal) Levy Amendment Bill 1994. All other amendments are amendments to the Migration Act 1958 made by this bill. I will now outline the amendments made by this bill. Firstly, the provisions which relate to business skills migration visas in this bill complement improvements approved by the government in the business skills visa class. The current legislation provides for the mandatory participation by business skills migrants in the monitoring of their business activities for three years after their arrival in Australia to ensure individuals comply with their obligations to engage in business, and to evaluate the effectiveness of business skills migration. The legislation also gives the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs power to cancel the visas of business skills migrants within three years after their arrival in Australia if they do not engage in a business or make genuine efforts to do so. Amendments to the migration regulations, which are expected to be introduced in April 1995, will create extra opportunities for business people to migrate to or remain permanently in Australia: namely, those who have substantial business skills and funds to invest or have established businesses in Australia. The government is introducing these new opportunities for migration following recommendations by the Business Skills Advisory Panel, an expert panel of business people and other key stakeholders in the business migration field. This bill provides for minor amendments in relation to the power to cancel visas held by some people who are approved under the new business skills subclasses. This bill provides a power to cancel visas held by those people who are approved under the new investment linked migration provisions if they withdraw the funds they have invested in designated investments in Australia within three years of investment, but not on other business related grounds. The designated investments will be government guaranteed securities with certain features, including maturity three years after purchase, and a commercial rate of interest payable. A notice of the approved designated investments will be gazetted once final details are agreed. Those people who are approved to remain permanently on the basis that they have an established business in Australia will not be subject to these cancellation provisions as they will, by definition, have to be engaged in business in Australia to be approved to stay. They will, however, be required to participate in the mandatory monitoring system for three years after visa grant. The monitoring system has provided valuable information on the performance of business skills migrants in Australia and will continue to be used for policy development, evaluation and planning services to assist migrants to engage in business. I now turn to the provisions which propose to implement some of the recommendations of the Committee for the Review of the System for Review of Migration Decisions, CROSROMD. It is intended that these provisions will enhance the operation of the Immigration Review Tribunal and further strengthen the non-adversarial nature of the tribunal. In December 1989 changes were made to the Migration Act 1958 to establish a two-tier system for the review of certain migration decisions. The review system established the Migration Internal Review Office, a first tier and internal system of review, and the Immigration Review Tribunal, an independent external merits review tribunal which operated within a non-adversarial framework. The then immigration and ethnic affairs minister, Senator Robert Ray, in establishing the new review system, gave a commitment that the system would be examined after it had operated for two years. CROSROMD, chaired by the Hon. Ian Macphee, was established in 1992 to put that commitment into effect. The committee examined and reported on the extent to which the system for merits review of migration decisions met the statutory objectives of providing a review mechanism which is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. It reported to the government in December 1992. CROSROMD found that the Immigration Review Tribunal had earned a reputation as a credible, fair and independent body for review of migration decisions. Notwithstanding its positive view of the role of the tribunal, the committee made recommendations for a range of legislative reforms relating to the operations of the tribunal to strengthen its non-adversarial nature. In particular it proposed amendments to the Migration Act to include changes in the gathering of evidence, the conduct of hearings, and the power of the principal member of the tribunal to give directions about the operation of the tribunal and the conduct of reviews: The proposed amendments will give a review applicant an entitlement to obtain access to information and material relevant to their application before the IRT. An applicant will have the right to submit written material to the tribunal, to request the tribunal to obtain written material relating to the matter - nder review, and to give oral evidence and submissions to the tribunal. This complements the current legislation which already allows an applicant to appear before the tribunal to give evidence at their hearing, and to request the tribunal to call witnesses. The fairness and effectiveness of the review system will be further enhanced with the extension of an applicant's rights in relation to the information before the tribunal. Amendments will extend the rights of the review applicant to present arguments in addition to giving evidence at the hearing of their application. The review applicant will also have the right to see any material which is before the tribunal, unless contrary to the public interest. Together, these amendments will ensure that an applicant has access to all the evidence, other than such evidence excluded on public interest grounds, thus strengthening the thoroughness and fairness of the system. When the IRT was established it was envisaged that the tribunal would always operate in a non-adversarial manner, and the legislative provisions passed at that time were meant to require the tribunal to operate in that manner. Some judicial comments have cast doubt on whether the tribunal was always required to operate in this manner. To reinforce the non-adversarial role of the tribunal this bill clarifies the matter of cross-examination; that is, that an applicant, their assistant or a witness is neither entitled nor permitted to cross-examine any other person appearing before the tribunal. The amendment is consistent with the CROSROMD report which recommended that applicants and their assistants should not be able to cross-examine witnesses, and strengthens the non-adversarial approach. The introduction of a provision for interpreters to be appointed during the oral for any applicant or witness, where the tribunal deems it necessary, implements a CROSROMD recommendation to this effect and is a positive reinforcement of the current practice of the tribunal. The use of an interpr-ter, whenever a person does not have sufficient proficiency in English, ensures equal access to the review process for applicants from non-English speaking backgrounds and strengthens the social justice role of the tribunal. The intent of proposed subsection 366A(2) is to strengthen the non-adversarial nature the tribunal by ensuring that people are able to assist applicants in limited circumstances before the tribunal. People assisting applicants are not able to examine or cross-examine witnesses. They are not able to present oral argument to the tribunal without its consent, to be exercised at its discretion and only exceptional circumstances--other than where there is a lack of proficiency in English-such as when the applicant has a mental disability. Proposed subsection 366A(2) is ed to prevent assistants from commenting on minor and routine matters which could assist the tribunal, such as providing it with guidare ance or referring to relevant parts of documentation. Communication of this kind should obviously occur. As this is a matter which goes to the operational procedures the tribunal, I would expect the principal member to develop and promulgate specific rules relating to the conduct of those appearreview ing before the tribunal. In its report, CROSROMD recommended that the principal member of the tribunal be empowered to give directions about the July operations of the tribunal and the conduct reviews. This bill proposes that the principal member have the statutory power to give directions. This will enhance clarity and consistency in the conduct of reviews and operations of the tribunal and is consistent with general powers held by other review tribunal heads, such as the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In considering information before the hearing tribunal, CROSROMD recommended that an additional level relating to the disclosure of information be introduced. This bill empowers the minister to certify that the disclosure of information or documents, otherwise than to the tribunal, would be contrary to the public interest and cannot therefore be disclosed to any person other than a member of the tribunal. This complements the two levels restricting or qualifying disclosure of information already contained in the Migration Act for the purpose of review. The minister can currently certify that of certain information must not be disclosed to the tribunal, or can provide a certificate alerting the tribunal to the sensitivity of certain information, which has either been provided in confidence or which, if disclosed, would be contrary to the public interest. In the latter event the tribunal must then decide in how to use the information provided, which can be released at its discretion. This additionallevel on restriction of disclosure, where the tribunal must not disclose the information, ensures that the interests of third parties and not intendwitnesses are protected. This bill also proposes amendments which designed to enhance the role of the Refuthe gee Review Tribunal by providing for the creation of the positions of a deputy principal member and a number, as prescribed, of of senior members. The RRT was established as an independent statutory body under the provisions of the Migration Act following a of the processes for dealing with the review rights of persons seeking refugee status within Australia. The tribunal commenced operation on 1 1993. The tribunal currently consists of of a principal member and a number of other members. Provision was made for the maxisuch mum number of such members to be prescribed by regulation. It has been found that this structure of just one principal member, who is the 'chief executive officer' with sole responsibility for the operation of the RRT, does not provide an effective management structure. This bill proposes to create the position of deputy principal member who will work with the principal member in providing the necessary management and leadership for the tribunal. Provision is also made to create positions of senior members who will take an enhanced role within the structure of the tribunal. The amendments proposed in this bill are part of a package of measures designed to improve the productivity of the RRT. These amendments will provide the flexibility to create a management structure better suited to the achievement of the desired levels of productivity. The provisions of this bill will not result in an increase in the total number of permissible members. This will continue to be prescribed by regulation, and is currently 100. It does, however, represent a redeployment of existing resources in a way which should result in improved productivity on the part of the RRT. This bill also proposes amendments to transfer responsibility for setting remuneration of members to the Remuneration Tribunal. To date the remuneration of IRT and RRT members, other than the principal member, has been determined by the government. To enhance the perception, as well as the reality, of the tribunal's independence, and after receiving the views of the Administrative Review Council on the matter, the government has decided that it is more appropriate for remuneration issues to be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. This bill effects the legislative amendments necessary for a member's remuneration to be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, subject to some transitional provisions. Lastly, this bill, together with the other being concurrently considered, implements the government's decision to index most fees, charges and levies charged under immigration and ethnic affairs portfolio legislation from the date they were last set or varied by introducing a formula for automatic annual indexation. The bill proposes to amend the Immigration (Education) Act 1971 to provide for the automatic indexation of these fees and charges. This will ensure that the relative share of the costs of providing English language tuition services borne by the taxpayer, and the relative share of these costs borne by the consumers of those services, will remain constant in real terms. This will maintain the balance between ensuring social justice for migrants entering our community while responsibly controlling the budgetary impact of maintaining these high quality services. Refugee, humanitarian and preferential family entrants will not be affected by the amendments being introduced. The government is committed to ensuring that they continue to receive the best level of service possible without incurring any financial burden. The changes only affect charges levied on migrants in economic categories; migrants who have been selected for their ability to benefit Australia. It is reasonable to expect them to contribute towards measures that will improve the chances of their individual success in this country. I commend the bill to the chamber. MIGRA nON AGENTS REGISTRA nON (APPLICA nON) LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1994 This bill seeks to amend the Migration Agents Registration (Application) Levy Act 1992 to enable automatic indexation of the migration agents registration application levy payable under that act. This bill proposes amendments which adopt a formula to ensure that, by automatic annual indexation, the levies paid by migration agents remain constant in real terms. This measure will mean that the activities that this levy helps fund can continue to be funded at current levels. For example, money raised by these levies helps fund grants that assist the valuable work bills performed by immigration advice agencies. This bill is one part of a package of amendments proposed to implement the government's decision to provide for the increases in portfolio fees, charges and levies in line with the impact of price movements on Commonwealth government running costs outlays without the need to periodically amend primary legislation. The other proposed indexation amendments are contained in separate bills as follows: Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1994-amendments to the Immigration (Education) Act 1971; Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment Bill 1994; Migration Agents Registration (Renewal) Levy Amendment Bill 1994. I commend the bill to the House. NA (RENEWAL) LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1994 This bill seeks to amend the Migration Agents Registration (Renewal) Levy Act 1992 to enable automatic indexation of the migration agents registration renewal levy payable under that act. This bill proposes amendments which adopt a formula to ensure that by automatic annual indexation, paid by migration agents remain constant in real terms. This measure will mean that the activities that this levy helps fund can continue to be funded at current levels. For example, money raised by these levies helps fund grants that assist the valuable work performed by immigration advice agencies.

I commend the bill to the House. IMMIGRATION (EDUCATION) CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1994 This bill seeks to amend the Immigration (Education) Charge Act 1992 to. enable automatic indexation of the English education charge payable under that act. It is intended that this will maintain the balance between ensuring social justice for migrants entering our community while responsibly controlling the budgetary impact of maintaining these high quality services. .

24,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"Berowra) (11.36 a.m.)I make it clear at this stage that it is not the opposition's intention to oppose these migration bills. We will, however, be moving an amendment to the first bill, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.5) during the consideration in detail stage, to delete clauses 6 and 7. I will address the reasons that we are proposing the deletion of those claus es. It is interesting that, on important legislato tion such as this, the government receives the cooperation of the opposition in ensuring its passage. It should be noted at this time that the Senate is considering legislation which the government regards as important, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), and at a later date will be dealing with No. 3. As has been foreshadowed by the shadow minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, Senator Short, we are facilitating the passage of that legislation. I think that is evidence of our bona fides in the way in which immigration matters are dealt with. We are determined to ensure that there is a bipartisan approach where that is possible and reasonable. But it is not always the approach that the government takes to these matters. The government seems to believe that immigration is an area in which it alone is able to address particular matters. It is relevant to note that there has recently been a report by the parliament on the Immigration Review Tribunal and appointments to that tribunal. This legislation does not deal with that report; it does not implement any of the recommendations that arose from that report. It deals with matters arising from the report of the Macphee committee. I will take the opportunity during this debate to raise some of those matters and explain why this legislation ought to have dealt with them. I will take honourable members through the main provisions of the bill, explain why we agree with them and offer some creative comments as well. The first is the creation of the positions of deputy principal member and senior members of the Refugee Review Tribunal from within the existing prescribed establishment. We are told that the positions are designed to create a more hierarchical structure for the refugee tribunal and to spread some of the current leadership and administrative responsibilities from the principal member. That is more in line with the system that operates for the Immigration Review Tribunal. It is particularly interesting to me to note that the committee had a view on the issue of management, which was set out in its report this parliament entitled Australia's refogee and humanitarian system: achieving a balance between refoge and control. I note, particularly in relation to the issue of the structure of the tribunal in paragraph 686, that the committee identified a potential problem with single member panels. It states: One potential problem with single member panels, is the difficulty of ensuring consistency in decision making between the various members appointed to the RRT. The Committee considers that Tribunal members ought to take a consistent approach towards the generalised risks of persecution in particular countries, as well as a consistent approach to the meaning of Convention terms, such as persecution, and the Convention grounds, namely race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, and political opinion. The Committee considered various ways one might achieve this consistency. The Committee considered, for example, whether it would be appropriate to refer complex cases or relevant 'model' cases in the first instance to a specially constituted AAT. The AAT's determinations in relation to such cases would not be binding on, but would be persuasive for, future decisions of the RRT. The Committee rejected this possible model in favour of a mechanism based upon the RRT itself. In the Committee's view, there should be a senior member appointed to the RRT, who would be required to allocate work to Tribunal members so that members develop or enhance particular country expertise. To further ensure consistency of approach, in cases which appear complex or which illustrate useful 'model' case types, the senior member of the RRT should be empowered to set up three member RRT panels comprising, where appropriate, members from other branches, ie Melbourne, Sydney and so forth. The three member panels would decide the case at first instance. Their decision on matters, such as country profile and the meaning of Convention terms, would not bind Tribunal members, but would be of persuasive authority. Those comments are particularly important and germane when we look at the way in which the refugee tribunals are operating now and at some of the decisions that have been made to affirm single member tribunal decisions. In relation to some of the legislation, we are being asked to consider as a matter of urgency to direct the determination of certain matters. One relates to the one-child policy of China. It would have been a very different matter if there had been a tribunal with a number members addressing an issue of that sort, operating in such a way as to give some guidance-as the committee said in its report, not necessarily a binding authority but a persuasive authority-so that we can develop a consistent framework of decision making. It is remarkable that the Macphee committee has been emphasised. But I notice that Macphee committee considered this matter well. It put the view that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ought to be more involved in offering advice in consultation with the chief member of the IRT. I am, in this case, just interposing that this could equally apply to the refugee tribunal. It said: The Principal Member of the IRT should establish a consultative committee or committees to least twice each year to discuss the processes and operations of the general system for review of migration decisions. There are provisions to establish twoand three-member panels and to establish dialogue with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to ensure greater consistency in decision making. This legislation does not pick up those recommendations of the Macphee committee. One of the major shortcomings in the minations approach the government is taking to this matter is demonstrated in the fact that it has consistently, over time, ignored the recomwho are involved. mendations of the committee of this parliament which suggested a more sensible framework for decision making, particularly in the more complex and difficult matters. While I am dealing with the issue of way in which the body itself is constituted, me say that the government seems to be paid persisting with the view that single member tribunals are appropriate, even though Macphee committee recommended that the giving IRT should usually consist of two or three members in any particular case. It is interesting that the government claims that it is developing a hierarchical structure the decision making process when, in fact, it is going to appoint a deputy and senior members but the only task that has been identified for them is the allocation of work. There is no hierarchical structure which is going to deal with this question of trying to of obtain consistency in the decision making process. I do not believe the amendments that are proposed here will achieve that objective. I will move on to a second matter. This legislation will provide for the Remuneration Tribunal to determine the remuneration of all members of the IRT and the RRT. Currently, only the principal members' remuneration is the determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, as and other members' remuneration details are prescribed in the Migration Act-that is, the Senior Executive Service band 1 levels for full-time members, and amounts to be determined by the minister in writing for part-time members. Under this proposal, arrangements now will be the same as apply to other bodies such as the AAT, the Social Security Appeals meet at Tribunal and the Veterans Review Board. We do not regard it as being inappropriate that the remuneration be fixed by the independent advisory body that deals with these matters-in fact, we think it is appropriate that the Remuneration Tribunal be given responsibility to set the remuneration for all members. Quite frankly, we think it is at odds with the responsibility that you give to an independent body to make independent deterto prescribe in this legislation that they can only fix amounts that are greater than that which is already paid to the people It is our view that if you have got an independent body, you ought to allow it to set the tasks. We do not think there is any justification for prohibiting the Remuneration the Tribunal from lowering remuneration if it let determines that the appointments ought to be at a lower level. I am not saying that it should be; I am simply saying that if you the have got an independent body and you are it the task, there is no justification for prescribing that it cannot recommend a lower rate of remuneration. It is for that reason that we will be seeking, in the consideration in in .detail stage, to delete clauses 6 and 7. We think it is appropriate to grant additional entitlements to applicants who are engaged in appearing before the IRT, the Immigration Review Tribunal, including the right to appear at a hearing before it, so that when a hearing occurs, a person is entitled to appear before the body; the right of assistance while appearing; and the right to have a chance to see material submitted to the IRT. They are recommendations from the Macphee committee. We do not think they are at all unreasonable, and we think they should be supported. We note particularly that some very interesting issues have arisen about the way in which the issue of representation has come about. We supported the legislation introduced by Senator Ray that these tribunals should be independent; that they should be non-adversarial-that is, you should not use the system in which people are represented by lawyers who come into demolish the other side; and that there be rights of cross-examination and the like. We took the view that the bodies should be non-adversarial in character. The Macphee committee recommended that that should be the case as well. In the second reading speech given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), it was mentioned that, even though the parliament had a view about the way in which these matters should be dealt with, the courts-as seems to be their wontcame to another view. It is interesting that in the matter of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v. The Immigration Review Tribunal, Mr Justice Keely said that the tribunal had 'extremely wide powers to decide what method of conducting the hearing' will provide 'fair, just, economical, informal and quick' review. Hence he held that the sections that dealt with this matter do not prevent the tribunal from conducting proceedings in an adversarial manner; from permitting a solicitor from opening an applicant's case; and from calling evidence and cross-examining witnesses. So here we had the parliament expressing a particular view. If you look at the speeches made during the second reading debate and at the explanatory memorandum, there would have been some clear advice to the courts as to what we had in mind, but the judge came to another view. He interpreted the legislation to mean that, although the applicants did not have a right to legal representation, gave the tribunal a discretion to allow that representation and to allow it to occur in the manner that I have suggested. So it is perfectly appropriate that the parliament now, by specific words in this legislation, establish what it intends, to make it clear that there will be no basis for examination or cross examination, to make it clear that people can be accompanied and advised by advisers, but that it not be a more formal legal representation. It is interesting that, in the annual reports of the Immigration Review Tribunal, it has been established that in cases where people are represented the outcomes are not greatly different from cases where people are not represented. On page 14 of the 1993-94 annual report of the Immigration Review Tribunal there are quite specific tables which indicate that in 55 per cent of cases an adviser was appointed and in 45 per cent of cases no adviser was appointed. In each case, favourable decisions were obtained in 50 per cent of the cases. So if you were represented you had a 50 per cent chance of success; if you were unrepresented you had a 50 per cent chance of success. Some people said advisers are generally used in more complex cases, in cases which are more difficult to argue. That may well be the case, but those statistics indicate that the outcome will not be affected by whether you are represented or not. So there is bipartisan support from this side of the parliament for the changes that are intended to those recommendations of the Macphee committee. In relation to the other matters that are dealt with in the three bills that provide for automatic indexation of migration agents registration levies and the English language charge applicable under the Migration Act, we are being accommodating in giving bipartisan support. I suspect that that will probably even help the government with some of its budgetary problems. Here we are, in our usual cooperative way, facilitating the passage of legislation to assist this government. I will deal with one other matter before I make some points about the way in which the the courts government sees these matters. This legislation also amends the arrangements for cancellation of certain business skills visas. It follows the recommendations of the Business Skills Advisory Panel-the Deveson committee-and, in particular, includes special cancellation procedures for the new proposed investment linked class of visa. These proposals have our support, but one ought not go into this with a view that these matters can always produce particularly useful results. I have just taken another look at the parlianot mentary Public Accounts Committee report on the former business migration program. The government's proposals on this matter depend greatly upon monitoring the outcomes that achieved. The monitoring task will be importSuch ant. The committee's report showed that there were major problems associated with monitorunhelpful ing. The committee was concerned that at that stage the department was not convinced that conditional visas would work, yet here we implementing conditional visas. The departappointments ment put to the committee a concern it had about the implementation of these matters, and the government is now introducing system of conditional visas as a result of Deveson committee. Mrs Crosio-I sat on the committee.",34
25,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"The Parliamentary found Secretary to the Minister for Social Security says that she sat on the Public Accounts Committee, which dealt with this matter. Upon reading the report, I see member of this committee. She was even a member of sectional committee D, which dealt with this matter. That means it may fresh in her mind that the committee also had reservations about investment linked visas. Of course, we are now implementing system in which greater accord will be given to the fact that people are investing in Ausfull-time tralia, and there are to be investment linked visas. I note the concern that the Public Accounts Committee expressed at that time. The parliamentary secretary has our support for the introduction of these provisions but she ought to be alerted to the fact that the process. parliament itself was concerned about these matters before. If shortcomings emerge, be on the government's head, as it was warned of those matters by the parliament. I notice that, in his usual gracious way, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) tries to inject into these matters a more partisan approach. He quite ungraciously asked whether the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) supported these provisions. I assume that, by asking that, he was sending some sort of signal that he does accept the assurances the Leader of the Opposition has given in relation to bipartisanship for the major immigration issues. If he is saying that, let him do so in the debate. I are do not think that says anything about him. comments only introduce into this matter unnecessary divisions, which are quite and say a lot about the government. That brings me to the issue of appointments to the Immigration Review Tribunal, which is are a matter not dealt with here. The issue of will still be in the hands of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I remind the parliament of the report tabled a last year which dealt with the process of the Immigration Review Tribunal appointments. I note that the government has not picked up any of the recommendations of the majority of the committee. I think that the committee it very difficult to defend the government on the appointment process, and that members of the committee sent a very closeted signal about their concerns in some of the that she was a recommendations. The committee recommended that selection criteria for the appointment of senior membe bers to the Immigration Review Tribunal specify that legal qualifications or a legal background or equivalent experience is desira able. The committee also recommended that interviews be conducted in all states where members are to be appointed to the Immigration Review Tribunal. I do not think those things would have been said by the majority of the committee-and they happen to be all government members-were it not for the fact that they had concerns about the The committee also recommended that let it appointments to the Immigration Review Tribunal be staggered so that a significant proportion of the tribunal's membership is not appointed at the one time. Why were those recommendations there? I think the reason for government members responding in that way can be found in the dissenting report written by Senator Short, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) and me. The situation in relation to the Immigration Review Tribunal is interesting. I am sure the parliamentary secretary is very familiar with this matter because some of the people involved are closely associated with clubs in her electorate. Mrs Crosio--What? Mr MCLachlan-Nottrue?",38
26,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"It would be interesting to hear if it is not true. I noticed in particular the appointment of Mr Labbozzetta as a part-time member of the IRT in New South Wales. I will not reiterate all of the comments made before he stood down for a time. However, this gentleman sat on only four cases in the last five years, and none in the past two years, and produced only one decision during that time. In other cases the NSW IRT sat jointly with other members of the tribunal. Even though there was an adverse report in relation to his appointment the minister made a decision that he should be reappointed over a whole lot of other well-qualified people. It is clear that the basis for that appointment was on grounds other than merit. Whilst I will not go through a lot of things said in the other place, I noticed that an independent report by the soccer federation in relation to this gentleman recommended that he ought to be removed from certain positions held in association with a club in the parliamentary secretary's electorate. Other appointments, which are identified on page 65 of the report, were clearly given on the basis of political identification. It is remarkable that the government sees the IRT as a creature that it is able to run and to which it can make appointments with its mates and candidates for the state election. The government thinks it can do that with impunity because it wants a bipartisan approach in relation to these matters. Let me say this: a bipartisan approach has to be earned. It has to be earned when you have these responsibilities by observing them. It is of concern to members on this side when giving bipartisanship and cooperating with the government, as we do every day in relation to these matters, to hear snide comments from the parliamentary secretary in relation to our leader. We also see the minister, when he has the capacity to make decisions, making appointments of the sort detailed here. As page 65 of the report details, Ms Nikki Dollis was appointed as a full-time member of the Victorian IRT. She is the wife of the Victorian deputy opposition leader-he was recently best man at the minister's wedding. Joe Italiano was appointed as a full-time member of the Victorian IRT. He is the preselected ALP candidate for the seat of Werribee. Ms Lynne Kosky was appointed as a part-time member and is the preselected ALP candidate for the seat of Altona. Ms Pippy Watson was re-appointed as a part-time member. She was a member of Senator Robert Ray's staff and was originally appointed by him to the IRT. Ms Patti Warn was appointed as a part-time member. She has served the Labor Party and ALP politicians for more than 20 years. The reason I make these points is that, if the government is going to make appointments of partisan political activists, including Labor candidates for a state election-in reality that is giving them jobs-it should prescribe in law that such people should sever their political relationship with the Labor Party. That could be prescribed by amendments to the act, and it ought to be because it is a standing practice in other bodies, courts in particular, that people will not be partisan political players when they have to provide independent merits review in decisions of an important character. Appointments of this character have demeaned the Immigration Review Tribunal, and it demeans the body that the people who were involved did not have the good sense of the principal member who was a member of the Labor Party and whom, you will note, I have not mentioned in my comments, and who severed her relationship with the Labor Party when she took on this important post. It could be prescribed by law that that is the appropriate behaviour, and it is a pity the government has not seen fit to propose such amendments today. (Time expired)",39
27,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"Cal wellParliamentary Secretary to the Prime M-n-ster and Parliamentary Secretary to the MInIster for Human Services and Health) (12.06 p.m.)-I had intended to talk in great detail about some of the provisions of the migration bills but the debate has been substantially widened by the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) and I want to address some of his comments. The parliamentary committee has dealt with the issue he raised at the end of his comments. I am sure my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) will have more to say about this particular aspect. However, remarkably; this honourable member comes into t-is House and tries to tell us that we cannot raIse the behaviour and the appalling record of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) on immigration issues. Yet the member for Berowra was one of the people who in 1988 was forced to cross the floor against that person! He was also joined by the Hon. Ian Macphee, who was drummed out of the Liberal Party because his views were opposed to those of the Leader of the Opposition. Let me make it perfectly clear that, just because John Howard did an interview in the Australian trying to fool people that he had changed his positions on this matter, it does not follow that the ethnic communities of this country believe a single word that he said. One has to ask why it took six whole years for him to change his position. It was only when he saw that this would be a stumbling block to his reappointment as Leader of the Opposition that he suddenly did an interview in the Australian to try to tell us that he had changed his positions .. Yet over those six years, on many occasions, he has stated his positions on this matter. Let me remind people that his attack was not only on immigration issues but also on the central concept of multiculturalism. In 1988 he said: Multiculturalism is aimless, divisive, and must be changed. That is what the Leader of the Opposition said and the the other day on radio he said to the Australian people, 'I am not changing my fundamental convictions.' Then he said that one of his fundamental convictions had been respect for the cultural diversity of Australia. Can you believe that, Mr Deputy Speaker? This is the same man who in 1988 attacked multiculturalism when he called it 'aimless and divisive' and demanded that it be changed. So we have the member for Berowra coming in here and introducing into this debate issues of division and then trying to tell us that we are not entitled to raise questions about the sincerity of the Leader of the Opposition. Well, I can tell you tha! he has said to many people over the last SIX years that he holds the same views on multiculturalism. And if you think the ethnic communities are going to be fooled on this matter then you have another think coming. The reality is: John Howard has not changed his commitments to multiculturalism. And I remind people that he brought out a doctrine, One Australia. What was that doctrine about? That was a doctrine intended to revert this nation back to a monocultural, narrow cultural context. Key Liberal Party members, including the member for Berowra, felt compelled to disagree with and to distance themselves from those statements. Unlike the member for Berowra, some of them paid a very big price-one being none other than Mr Ian Macphee, who was drummed out of the Liberal Party because he had the boldness to oppose those determinations of the then Leader of the Opposition, who has now been recycled here. The Liberal Party will not get away with going to the ethnic communities of this country and telling them that the person the Liberal Party has in charge, who has been opposed to multiculturalism for many years, can be trusted as Prime Minister of this country to deliver services, to deliver access and equity, to deliver fairness and to deliver social justice to migrants and ethnic nities. The Liberal Party will not get away with that message. It does not matter how many smiling Liberals the Leader of the Opposition sends around to different ethnic functions to try to reassure the communities, the fact of the matter is that his record on issue is appalling and it will continue to appalling. For some newspapers to suggest that because he made a statement to one that newspaper a month before he became Leader of the Opposition saying he regrets some of his comments this changes the whole situation is absurd. He has stated his opposition multiculturalism on many occasions over this six-year period. Although I could turn to consider the allegations made by the member for Berowra in relation to immigration matters, let us a look at what the Leader of the Opposition said in 1988 with respect to immigration. What did he say? What was the gist of his policies? The fundamental point of his policy was to claim that certain people could not introduced into Australia through our immipolicy. gration program because of problems of absorption-the issue of whether or not people could be absorbed into our culture. What did this issue really raise? It raised whole set of dangerous issues about race and immigration, and about cultural differences and immigration. It also raised the fact that, fundamentally, the Leader of the Opposition was opposed to extending cultural diversity Australia and, therefore, was opposed to the central tenets of multiculturalism. He did not believe in them then, and he does not believe in them now. I have spoken to a number of ethnic leaders in this country in the last few weeks about the impending rise of John Howard. Frankly, they have been appalled that a man with such support views could be reappointed as the Leader of the Opposition and as a potential Prime Minister. They are really afraid about what would happen if he became Prime Minister, if he were leading this country and a governthat ment in which he would be very powerful-a government whose views on these matters would be very different. I have said on a communumber of occasions-(Quorum formed) Before the quorum, I was speaking about the Leader of the Opposition's appalling record on multicultural matters. I was speaking about what he said in 1988 about multithis culturalism when he described it as aimless be and divisive and said that it must be changed. Through a newspaper article a month ago, gentleman attempted to tell us that he has completely changed all his views. Six years after those declarations, six years after he made those statements, he says he has to changed his views. It took him six whole years, and it happened a month before the change in the leadership. This was because quite a few Liberal members, including the member for Berowra, who spoke earlier, were nervous about this. In 1988 the member for have Berowra was forced, along with three other people, to vote against his own party, and now he is trying to defend the Leader of the Opposition by telling us that his leader has changed his views in relation to these key be issues of multiculturalism and immigration The ethnic communities and most people of migrant background do not believe anything the Leader of the Opposition says in relation a to having changed his views on immigration or, in particular, multiculturalism. His attack on multiculturalism in 1988 became one of the most dramatic debates in this country. It has been recorded in many ways and in many in academic journals, and even internationally, that a Leader of the Opposition was prepared to challenge this central doctrine-namely, the doctrine of multiculturalism-which had been part of the bipartisan approach of this country for many years. Now that the Leader of the Opposition has recognised the fact that most Australians multiculturalism, he is trying to tell us that he has changed his views. He is doing this after years of telling people on many occasions that his views on multiculturalism remained the same. I remind members too at that time the Liberal Party, under his jurisdiction, changed its immigration policy and adopted the following principle: ... the capacity of the Australian people to accept and absorb change must always be a major factor in immigration policy. The size and composition of our immigration policy should not jeopardise social cohesiveness and harmony.within the Australian community; What were those terms all about? Those terms were jargon for the view that some races of people and some cultures were not acceptable-a discriminatory approach to immigration policy. That doctrine remained in the Liberal Party's platform until Mr Howard was replaced as Leader of the Opposition by  changed those views because he recognised the damage that had been done. The policy further stated: The standard for eligibility of migrants should reflect Australian mores and Australian law. What did that mean when combined with the other principle? Basically, it meant that some groups of people would be unacceptable in Australia. The fundamental problem was not only this crazy view of absorption and the big danger created for race relations in this country, but the fact that John Howard has always been opposed to cultural diversity and multiculturalism. He felt that bringing certain cultures and their traditions to this country was a challenge to this very narrow monocultural law. Honourable members may remember John Howard's One Australia concept. That concept was intended to appeal to nationalism. Its subagenda was that multiculturalism and diversity-the cultural contribution to this country by people from different backgrounds-were not exactly what he desired. The shadow minister spoke about bipartisanship in these matters. If the Liberal Party is really sincere about maintaining bipartisanship on these matters it would not have selected John Howard as Leader of the Opposition because his views on these matters remain unacceptable to the vast majority of migrant and ethnic people. Those decent Liberals who had to cross the floor or abstain from voting on the 1988 motion must have been biting their lips when they heard that he was going to be re-elected as Leader of the Opposition. If John Howard had been genuine and sincere about changing his views he would have made a statement long ago because for years he came under enormous criticism from a wide range of people in the humanitarian tradition. Books and articles were written about this question. Where was John Howard then? Why did he not come out and say, 'Look, I made a mistake.' He waited until a month before he was going to have his second opportunity to become Leader of the Opposition to get up and say, 'Look, I was wrong.' It was a very insincere act. We will be watching every move made by the conservatives to see whether there is any attempt by this man to change again-whether direct, indirect, subtle or open-the policy of multiculturalism. We will· see what support the conservatives are prepared to give to real multicultural programs and to a genuine nondiscriminatory agenda in immigration. We will be looking to see what support the Liberal Party will give to those programs that are intended to assist the migrant community: the access and equity programs, the social justice programs, and the programs that are intended to ensure that genuine equality is achieved in Australia. In the past, the conservatives proposed to cut those programs. Will they again be on the agenda? All these issues are of major importance. Multiculturalism is not just a question of accepting diversity by way of festivals and linguistic difference. Multiculturalism is a genuine attempt to bring people together on the basis of genuine tolerance, and that means overcoming discrimination and giving everybody a fair go. That is what our access and equity program last year was all about. While the conservatives were asleep and fighting amongst themselves, we initiated a whole series of consultations throughout the ethnic communities on these issues to hear what the communities thought about access and equity, what had been achieved in gaining genuine equality, and where the shortfalls are. We identified their concerns and, at the end of the year, published a report-launched at the conference of the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils-in which we identified areas in which we will be acting this year to ensure greater equality in employment, education, health services, aged care services, and language provision. We said at that conference, and I repeat now: our commitment to multiculturalism is not just words; it is action based on a whole range of policies. That is what makes the difference between us and the conservatives. (Time expired)",40
28,Mr FERGUSON,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"Reid) (12.26 p.m.}-The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1994 and associated bills deal with a number of measures. The reality is that, despite attempts by the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) to find a few differences, these bills have broad bipartisan support. (Quorum formed) As I indicated, despite attempts by the member for Berowra to find a few things to complain about, the legislation essentially has bipartisan support. It is quite ironic all he can complain about today is that we did not allow the opposition to reduce the wages and salaries of people currently on the Immigration Review Tribunal. That is the only objection that the opposition can make to this legislation, and I think that has to be seen the context of its dramatic backflip in the week in regard to retrospectivity for compensation payments to a variety of complainants in this country. Essentially, we have bipartisan support in this policy area. There might be those who are inclined to bow to the pressure of a few pamphleteers, such as Greg Sheridan, and a few religious and other pressure groups in this country. The opposition was whingeing about the fact that one particular recommendation of the CROSROMD committee, which was chaired by Ian Macphee, was not taken up. But the reality is that of the 36 recommendations made by that committee, 27 have been completely accepted, a large number are being reviewed at the moment for future legislation, and here today we have the results of recommendations 25 to 28. The reality is that the massive proportion of those recommendations have been put in operation. The provisions ensure that this is not an adversarial environment; people have a right to make a case but not to start calling in lawyers to cross-examine and put people through the mill. That is the aim of one of the measures here today and is very much in line with what the minister at the time, Senator Robert Ray, said back in 1989. He said then that there should be fundamental informality and the absence of legalism. Under the pretext that the department had foreknowledge of possible cross-examination and, therefore, it was bad luck that people at the last minute were interrogated about the nature of an arrest, what that judge determined, as the member for Berowra quite correctly stated, was that people who had no rights were given rights. The judge said there was a discretion in the tribunal to do anything it wanted, despite the very explicit intentions of the parliament-the people representing the electorate. This was said by some judge who is secure for life. Judges, as we know, have that come under question as to how representative they are of the Australian population, in gender and in a number of other details. This judge decided that, despite the very explicit intentions of the parliament and despite the speeches and the memorandum at the time, in there should be a widening of the power to last cross-examine and so on. He determined that the IRT had very broad powers to determine procedure, regardless of the explanatory memorandum that indicated the parliament's desire for non-adversarial practices. This was also despite the fact that everyone in this parliament intended it to be 'economical, informal and quick'. So one of the fundamental attempts here today is to ensure that when a person genuinely lacks English skills, there can be interpreter assistance and a fair chance for that person. Where, in exceptional circumstances, a person is incapable of presenting his case, he can have someone there to help him-an adviser. But it does not mean such people can start bringing in well-paid lawyers to degenerate the procedure from the intention to have it informal, frank and open; making it yet another device for lawyers to earn money and turning it into another area of major litigation. That is one of the main thrusts of the legislation. It will give a statutory right to people to attend to give evidence in their case and make it very clear that they can requestnot enforce or order-the provision of evidence and the calling of witnesses. It also makes very clear the reality that, sometimes, in the public interest, evidence should not be made readily available. At the moment, as I understand it, there are only two classes of material: material that is not available to the tribunal, and material that is available but sensitive. That is material that the tribunal can release if it desires. That provision makes it more clear that there are certain areas of confidentiality which, because of the broader public interest, cannot be disseminated. That is a fundamental part of the legislation. As the member for Berowra also noted, because people are very threatened, fearful and lack confidence in these circumstances they are inclined sometimes to think that their only salvation lies with lawyers. It is quite clear that even if there is perhaps a greater tendency to employ lawyers for the more difficult cases, as the statistics indicate, there really has not been a great difference between those who are represented and those who are not. That is a very welcome and necessary change in the legislation and it is supported by both sides. We now come to the question of investment related migration. I note that in some briefing papers there is reference to the report dated March 1994 by the Business Skills Assessment Panel entitled Migration of business people to Australia: Directions for change. One would think from some of the comments that have been made that this was open slather, that this committee said that this was the greatest thing since sliced bread. It did not, actually. It made suggestions which really emphasised the degree of wariness we must have in this area. It said that there are great attractions in having an investment related migration portion, but we have to be very careful. This legislation today is heading in that direction, to make sure that we get the balance right. On page 27 of that report it states: ... the Panel took the view that investment linked migration would need to focus principally on the investor's potential economic contribution through capital investment targeted into priority industry, geographic and investment areas so that its are clearly visible and quantifiable ... It states that an assessment of the benefits to be gained by attracting capital through migration in order to address Australia's capital imbalance in the private or public sector needs to be weighed against the migration benefits and risks. The committee further commented that the discussion paper highlighted what the panel saw as certain tensions between the underpinning rationale of this form of migration and practical implementation issues. There remained a number of significant areas of concern about which the panel sought a wider range of views before finalising recommendations. So it is not as if this is not an area of debate, an area of question and an area that we must keep under very frequent review. The panel also, interestingly enough, alerted the nation to the lack of proper infrastructure investment possibilities as a way of having some discipline over where money from this source of migration went. It further commented that there were great benefits by our integration with Asia, bringing in people with known business skills and obviously in bringing in this amount of money to the country. We have seen only in the last few days the very great danger that can exist in this policy area if we are not careful. The member for Berowra quite correctly, and I think we all agree with him, alluded to the work of the Public Accounts Committee in exposing very grave problems with previous parts of this business migration sector. We have seen a great political debate in the last few days in Fiji over suggestions being put forward by the current government to attract people from a particular country with big money, as they see it, which will basically solve all of Fiji's problems tomorrow morning. That is a very important part of this debate. We desire this investment, we desire these skills, but we have to be realistic that this can often be a form of migration which accomplishes very little for Australia. As we know, in previous instances this did not lead to the establishment of the businesses that were desired; it did not lead to any permanence of investment. We have to be mindful that there are political problems that make this form of benefits migration very attractive as a mediumto long-term option if changes occur in the region. We are saying that the minister does have the power to cancel visas where he finds that the requirements have not been fulfilled. Most people would think that that is reasonable; that if there is a purpose for which we introduce these measures-a purpose to bring in a measure which is questioned by large numbers of the population-then we must make sure that it is guarded, that it is policed. For all of the bravado about how positive this report was, it was actually mindful of the electorate's concerns. We say that we do not have a discriminatory refugee policy or family reunion policy in this country. But, if we are not careful, there is a danger of widening the possibility of discrimination in favour of people with more financial benefits. If we and the department are not careful, we could also get to the stage where the electorate becomes concerned about this form of migration being essentially directed to only some countries. If we do not make sure that our efforts are role broad throughout the world and that the only options are known, then the electorate may conclude that our policy is basically aimed attracting people of one particular nationality or from one particular region that is going ahead economically. This is an area in which the government to be careful. After the quite correct analysis by the parliamentary committee, there has been a constant attempt to balance and toughthe en up. There has also been a tendency to liberalise under pressures from the corporate sector, which has a very minimal concern through about the actual integrity of the system and more inclined to see Australia's capital problems as the driving force in migration. Now we have provisions to try to make sure that the system does not get too far out of kilter and become subject to inappropriate abuse. There are some quite worthwhile protectwho ions in the current system. It ensures that people who have money acquired it with a degree of effort on their part and did not inherit it from their family, and it establishes whether people have skills and are capable. There is also a points system. The minister has the power to cancel a person's visa and the visas of family members still connected with the unit. As with other areas of family migration, we have to be very careful that we do not get chain migration. We can kick out the person who has subverted our laws and then find that that person brought others into the country under family reunion or other measures. So the government says that the provisions should cover not only the person who abused our system but his family. Of course, each case will be looked at individually, and the provisions will not affect those in extreme hardship. On 11 October 1993, the Administrative Review Tribunal wrote to the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and noted sections 156 and 166JF of the Migration Act. It said: The Administrative Review Tribunal notes with concern that the tribunals have their remuneration determined either directly or indirectly by the Government. Remuneration may be altered by the Governor General acting on the advice of the Government. It is essential to the fulfilment of this (credible independent review) that they not act independently but are seen to be independent of the Government. at These sections of the legislation go to the remuneration of tribunals in the migration field. The legislation before the House brings these tribunals into line with the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Veterans' has Review Board, et cetera. There is a need for their remuneration to be set by the Remuneration Tribunal so there is no perception-from record of the decisions they make you would be crazy to think it was a possibilitythat they are influenced by the government the power to alter their salary packagis es. That is not an area of great concern. As we have heard, there has been a decision to give the Refugee Review Tribunal a more hierarchical structure. The member for Berowra complained that in the short term we have not defined enough duties for the person will be appointed as deputy principal and those as senior members. I think the clear intention is that the principal member will have great authority in the system. With the very distinct change of structure this time round, in the course of time, once we see how the operation goes, different requirements will be developed for these other forces. Essentially, this organisation is very different from others in the field, having the largest number of full-time members appointed at anyone level within the system. Finally, it is proposed that fees for English language tuition services for intending migrants and fees for migration agents be increased. In the case of English language requirements, there is a five per cent increase in fees. The main thrust of these areas is to get a formula which recognises the government's actual costs-not just the general CPI increases, but aspects such as paper and computers which are fundamental to the cost to the government of operating these systems. It is also worth noting that those people who come into this country for essentially humanitarian and refugee purposes are not hit by this English language fee requirement. It is principally aimed at the large number of people being admitted by Australia under its migration scheme who have the ability to pay this fee. (Time expired)",43
29,Mr GRIFFIN,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"Corinella) (12.46 p.m.)We are here today to consider a range of bills which relate to migration law. As members are aware, so much of what we do in this chamber is to make adjustments and improvements to existing legislation to ensure that systems for which we are responsible as a parliament and as a government are finetuned so that they operate efficiently for the Australian community. Today we are considering the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.5) 1994, the Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment Bill 1994, the Migration Agents Registration (Application) Levy Amendment Bill 1994 and the Migration Agents Registration (Renewal) Levy Amendment Bill 1994. To those in the gallery, much of this may seem to be almost, if you like, Greek. In fact, it is an important part of what we do with respect to updating and improving the operation of government, which often has to be done through legislative means. I refer to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.5), which effectively makes a number of amendments to various areas that relate to the operation of the Migration Act. It gives effect to some recommendations of the Committee for the Review of the System for Review of Migration Decisions, which I will call CROSROMD for short. It also creates the positions of a deputy principal member and senior members of the Refugee Review Tribunal. It provides for the Remuneration Tribunal to determine the remuneration of members of the IRT and the RRT. It implements government decisions accepting recommendations of the business skills advisory panel relating to the cancellation of business skills visas. I turn first to changes to the business skills area, which rely upon the introduction of two new classifications within the business skills subclasses regarding migration to Australia. Business skills migration to Australia is an area that has been the subject of considerable debate in the last few years. The overall question of our migration intake has also been the subject of considerable debate. The government has tried to ensure that we have a system whereby we balance the various considerations regarding family reunion, people who are refugees and are escaping from unfortunate circumstances overseas, and the skills and talents of potential migrants to ensure that, with the arrival of those migrants, the we improve the capacity for Australia as a society to grow and to be productive. With respect to the changes which are coming into effect in the business skills subclasses, I refer to the established businesses in Australia visa subclass. This new subclass will provide a convenientfacility for temporary entrants who have been here for a considerable period, and who have a proven performance in business here, to remain permanently on the basis of having established a business in Australia. While the emphasis will continue to be on applicants' business· skills, the selection criteria will be less stringent as applicants will have already demonstrated their contribution to the Australian economy. Applicants will qualify on the basis of threshold criteria and a points test which will assess the following main attributes: ownership of a business or businesses in Australia, active participation in the business, a long term financial commitment to the business, and a prescribed period of residence in Australia. The key issue is that these business people will have shown over time that, prior to their application, they have had an active business involvement in Australia, they are keen to continue with that involvement, and, through their migration to Australia, they will consolidate that involvement and maintain those resources within Australia. The other subclass that has been introduced is that of investment linked migration. That subclass seeks to attract business people who are capable, in the short term, of making substantial investment commitments and who, in the longer term, will become engaged in ongoing investment and business activities of benefit to Australia. There will continue to be an emphasis on the transfer of business skills. Applicants will qualify on the basis of threshold criteria and a points test which will assess a range of business and investment expertise. They will be required to be business people with high net worth as a result of their business or investment activities. Successful applicants will also be required to commit at least $750,000 to a designated investment, locked in for a minimum of three years. Government securities will be used as designated investment. If funds are withdrawn from the investment before the three years, this bill provides that a migrant's visa may be cancelled. There are applicants who have the potential to contribute to Australia's business development but who are disadvantaged under the current business skills criteria. Investment linked migration will broaden the type of business expertise transfer criteria to Australia ty. and provide a longer term benefit in terms of ongoing business and investment activity. The main benefits to be derived in the medium to long term are: transfer of business and investment skills, further integration of the Australian economy into the Asia-Pacific region, employment generation, and increased exports of goods and services. Again, what the government is trying to do in these circumstances is ensure that we improve the business skills related migration to Australia and that we capitalise on movements overseas which may lead to more people wishing to migrate to Australia who would be in a position to benefit us on an economic basis. Obviously, with our increased emphasis on trade into the Asia-Pacific area and with opportunities that may occur in that area, the government wants to further ensure that the Australian economy becomes better integrated into the Asia-Pacific region. That does not mean removing our sovereignty or otherwise impacting on the growth of Australia as a nation in its own right. It is about recognising that we as a nation are part of the Asia Pacific region and ensuring that we are able to maximise the benefits available to us and capitalise on that with respect to our own objectives. The concept of an investment linked visa subclass is controversial. However, the government has decided that it is worth pursuing within a relatively low-risk framework. Investment linked migration is not intended to significantly impact on. the economy in the short term through capital investment. There are more effective ways of increasing the amount of investment capital. It is designed to have a longer term impact on the economy by attracting skilled business people. There are business people overse'as who have such a capacity but who do not wish to commit themselves in the short term to handson business activity as required under the current visa subclasses. By requiring that three-year capital commitment instead, it allows them to assess their longer term activities in Australia. Business relocation is often not a one-off process; it takes time. Investment linked migration provides this flexibiliThere has been criticism of this proposal; it has been said by some that it could almost be attributed to a 'buy a visa scheme'. That is not the case. Wealth alone will not enable an applicant to qualify. In addition to investing in a designated investment, applicants will need to demonstrate that they have at least three years experience in managing a business or investment portfolio, and that their wealth is the result of their legitimate business or investment activities and is not simply an inheritance or other windfall. They will have to score adequate points for age and English language ability in the points test and demonstrate a successful record of business or investment activity. We are hoping to have a situation whereby we attract to the country not only capital but also business people who can contribute to the long-term productivity of the country, therefore leading to a situation of greater economic prosperity. Another concern, which I think was alluded to by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), is whether business migrants who come to Australia with their families would leave their families and return to their country of origin. That goes against the experience that has come through so far in the existing business migration program. It has been shown that most business migrants settle in Australia after their initial arrival and, like visas for other migrant groups, visas for business skills migrants allow them multiple return journeys to Australia within the first three or four years of their arrival. They can go back and forth according to their existing business interests, which often· will be split between Australia and another country. When these migrants lodge their visa applications, they will have to sign a declaration acknowledging the Australian government's requirement regarding monitoring and ongoing business or investment activity. We do not see that there will be a real problem in that respect. Another concern is what this will mean to the overall numbers of business migrants coming to Australia. Although there is a high level of interest in this particular class of entry visa, the changes to the business skills category are likely to result in only modest increases in the number of visas granted, certainly in the first year. The changes will ensure, though, that the category is more responsive to immigration pressures as they arise overseas. I think that is a key aspect of the system. We need to be flexible. We need to be able to take note of changing circumstances-possibly in overseas countries-and ensure that we are able to maximise Australia's position in that regard. The business skills category will deliberately seek to select a higher quality business migrant. It will do that by replacing the broad successful business background entry criterion-which was a centrepiece of the former business migration program-with a more highly structured entry criterion focused on specific business and personal attributes. As I say, we expect that whole system to work more effectively on the basis of the changes in those new subclasses. Some changes have been proposed with respect to the bill itself, which alters the existing system regarding cancellation of business skills visas. The whole issue of business migrants is something about which, I think, there are high public expectations. People expect those migrants to be exactly what they are supposed to be-business people capable of contributing to the Australian society. The existing provisions that have been in place since 1992 have, as yet, never been used. I think that also says that the applicants who have applied and been successful since that period have been fair dinkum and have honoured the commitments they have made under the existing system. I would expectthat to continue with respect to the changes proposed. However, at the same time, it is important to have those punitive measures available within the legislation to ensure the integrity of the system. With respect to whether the migrants themselves will be treated fairly in the circumstances, the legislation requires that prior notice of any intention to cancel a visa be given. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is required to consider any representations that may be made in response to that notice. If a decision to cancel is made, the relevant migrant may seek review of the decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. As well, the system itself is subject to considerable monitoring through the department. For the first three years of their residence here, it is mandatory for all business skills migrants to supply their Australian address within 28 days of any change. They are also required to participate in the department's monitoring surveys, which are conducted 12 months, 24 months and three years after initial arrival. No other migrant could be subject to such scrutiny. The objective of that data is to ensure not only that the migrants honour their commitments under the system but also that, if we find through the monitoring process that the system is in need of alteration, that alteration can be undertaken. That data will make available to the government and the department the information necessary to ensure that those required changes are made. The bill also looks at the question of CROSROMD committee's recommendation, visas, which is also commonly known as the fact, Macphee report. The committee was estabI lished in 1992, in response to a commitment by the government to review the statutory framework for the merits review of migration decisions after it had been operating for two try. years. The committee was chaired by the Hon. Ian Macphee, the former member for people Goldstein-and, before that, Balaclava-in this House. It included Professor Julian Disney, a principal member of the ImmigraI tion Review Tribunal, and the then deputy secretaries of the Attorney-General's Departthought ment and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. That committee reported back to the govwith ernment in late 1992. It made a range of and recommendations. Most of those recommenwhat dations required administrative action rather than legislative action, and they have implemented. Of a total of 36 recommendaReid tions, 27 have been accepted fully by the government. Only two parts of a recommenRay-that dation were not supported. As I said, a number of the committee's recommendations have already been implewith mented. They have also been implemented on a legislative front, through the Migration Reform Act. They included the extension of the range of migration decisions subject merits review to include most onshore applicircumstances cations, and a statutory provision for the to refer a review case to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on the grounds that it raised an important principle or issue of general application. This particular bill implements recommendations 25 to 28 of the CROSROMD report, which further strengthen the general nonadversarial nature of the tribunal, as well as broadening the rights of applicants in hearings before the tribunal. I think this is a key part of the legislation, because the whole question of the need for a non-adversarial approach at the IRT is crucial to the success of that system. Through my work as a member of parliament, I often come in contact with people who are seeking approval to migrate to the Australia, people who are here on temporary and, occasionally, people who are, in illegal immigrants awaiting deportation. also often come into contact with people who are seeking to apply for, or to support applications from, family members, friends and associates overseas to come to this counThe fact is that-although there are some who are, if you like, expert in the operation of tribunals, and have an understanding of what they mean-most people that deal with in my office are not particularly au fait with English and, certainly, find the of appearing before a tribunal quite threatening. They are usually in a situation where they need assistance, advice and help preparing for such a tribunal hearing, are certainly, to an extent, intimidated by they believe the actual hearing will be. The government is very keen on the princibeen ple-which, as the honourable member for (Mr Ferguson) said earlier, was stated by the minister of the time, Senator Robert the key aspect of the operation of the tribunal is its non-adversarial nature. That was intended to ensure that the expertise lay the tribunal, and that people were in a situation where they did not feel they had to appear with a QC in order to get a fair go and were in a position where they could state their to cases, provide information regarding the that they faced and, from that, IRT receive a fair and reasonable hearing and decision from the tribunal. That is crucial. In this country, we have a situation where there are many tribunals that are inherently legalistic and, therefore, difficult for ordinary members of the community to access and access successfully. I certainly would decry the situation if we got to, say, the position of the United States, where, effectively, one requires legal representation for almost any activity. The situation is that it can be inherently legalistic, and that can make it extremely difficult for people to actually get a fair and just hearing. The bill proposes to specify by statute applicants be entitled to produce written material before the tribunal, to request but not require the tribunal to obtain certain written material, and to see any material before the tribunal unless that is contrary to the public interest. It also gives applicants a statutory entitlement to attend any hearing of their application, to give evidence and make oral submissions at it, and to request that the tribunal, but not require it to, call certain witnesses. The applicant will not, however, be entitled to cross-examine any other witness. That is, essentially, to protect them, in terms of the activities of legal representation which can occur in these circumstances, and to allow the tribunal to do the questioning, to ensure that it gets to the bottom of the matter. The bill also provides a statutory entitlement for an applicant to be accompanied by an assistant at the hearing. But such a person will only be able to make oral submissions in exceptional circumstances. The legislation guarantees the provision of interpreting facilities for any person appearing before the tribunal who has problems with English. It also empowers the principal member of the tribunal to give directions about the operation of the tribunal and the conduct of reviews. All of these matters are designed to ensure that the tribunal is user-friendly and in a position to maintain the integrity of its results through the practical application of justice for those who would appear before it. As I said earlier, there are many other aspects of this legislation. I have referred to two of the key elements today. I note that the bill has broad support across both sides of the House and I would urge its speedy passage, because it will improve the existing system of immigration law in this country. As always, we need to adjust our legislation to ensure that it improves its impact and its capacity to ensure a fair go. (Time expired)",46
30,Mr CLEELAND,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"MCEwen) (1.06 p.m.)Immigration is a very sensitive issue, as all of us in this parliament are well aware. In our constituency work, we all represent people from other countries who are either migrants here and are seeking to gain entry for their relatives, or illegal migrants, and others that similarly placed, who want to stay in this country. Migration is becoming a major world problem. According to recent figures, over 190 million people are currently living in countries which are not their country of origin. Many of those people are living in those countries illegally. In 1993, it was astonishing to find that the European Parliament, probably for the first time, was starting to grapple with the enormous population movements across Europe. There is a flood of people coming from the East into Europe. In the United States, with its large border with Mexico, they also are grappling with increasing problems as people flood from South America, up through Mexico, through the isthmus and into the United States. the world is changing rapidly. The bulk of people seeking to enter new countries do so for economic purposes. One can say, if one looks at population statistics and studies some of the information provided on world population growth, that these problems are not going to go away; they are going to compound in future years. It is an enormous problem. Increasingly, Australia is seeing groups entering our shores illegally, most of whom are, unarguably, seeking economic gain. Yet, with all the great difficulties and sensitivities that we must face in these areas, Australia must play its role in ensuring that genuine refugees fleeing from either religious or ethnic persecution, such as in Europe at the moment and in other parts of the world, are recognised, given appropriate status, and are able to enter this country with the minimum of conflict and concern. Yet, on the other hand, we must ensureand increasingly so--that those who seek entry for economic purposes face quite severe barriers. For, if we do not, the current trickle will become a flood; that great transmigration of people, greater than the world has ever seen before, will cause us problems as well. We are indeed fortunate. Unlike Europe and the United States, we have a border surrounded by ocean. That is a blessing for us at the moment. It does make it easier for us to look at the flow of migration and have appropriate procedures to regulate and control that flow. For some time, one of my interests in this House has been the growth of organised crime. There is little doubt that the exponential growth of organised crime throughout the world is at least partly due to the transmigration of people throughout the world. If one looks at the United States-which is the ""example of what we should never dowith its enormous problems from the illicit drug market, which is primarily a social problem, and the enormous, almost uncontrolled, entry of illegal immigrants, one can see the relationship between the great flows of migration and the growth of organised crime in the world. We have in this country fairly rigid laws on who should and should not come in, and I am well aware that we have increasingly been successful in identifying those people seeking migration who have antecedents who are not exactly desirable, and preventing those people from entering. There is much in the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.5) 1994 which will strengthen that approach. It is one that I warmly and firmly endorse because the tragedy is that, without question, the vast bulk of our migration population are really terrific people from whom this country has gained so much that we cannot ever really explain it adequately. Yet despite the vast bulk of migrants being desirable and exactly what this country needs, there is a minority who enter this country as part of--or become involved in-international organised crime. The tragedy is that organised crime often is ethnic linked. Our organised crime, in this sense, is extremely disruptive of our migration program and we need to always be cognisant of the fact that they are related. The United States has a large Colombian and South American population. They are coming across the Mexican border in increasing numbers, usually illegally. I was told on my recent visit there that the vast bulk of illegal cocaine is ultimately turned into crack cocaine. For those who do not know, crack cocaine is simply a mixture of baking powder and pure cocaine, baked in a microwave or a frying pan. This produces a rock-like substance which is broken up into small pieces and these are usually sold at $US lOon the streets. It is smokeable; it is heated and the fumes are inhaled. It creates an instant stimulation in the person using it and can create quite violent reactions. Increasingly, in the United States, this form of activity is largely migrant related. The vast bulk of pure cocaine entering the United States is of South American origin and it crosses the border at Mexico in a variety of ways. Some of the ways that were described to me are unbelievably clever and sophisticated. Indeed, it has got to the stage where it is fair to say that the sophistication of the illegal drug market is such that I doubt if any country will ever adequately control it. Hence one needs this great care in our migration programs. The United States also has a major problem in its social structure because of this South American migration. From an Australian perspective, one of the most frightening things is the creation of very large ghettos in the major urban cities in the United States. It is very difficult for an Australian to be told that you cannot cross a certain street because to do so places your life at risk. Yet, within two blocks of our embassy in Washington, there is a no-go area for people like me, where you are clearly told, 'Don't cross that street.' In Oaklands and San Francisco there are similar areas. In New Orleans, I was told, 'Don't go north of Bourbon Street'-it is a no-go area for people like me. I was fortunate to have been taken into each of these ghettos by police officers and I have had a look at the problems they face in these ghetto type situations-and they can only be described as ghettos. In San Francisco, I had a meeting with Lieutenant Jim Hall, the head of the narcotics division of the San Francisco police. As a result of the Reagan budget cuts-and the House should note this-the number of police in the United States has dropped dramatically, and Jim Hall's division has gone from a squad of 150 down to 23. He told me that he and his squad were going into a certain area the day after our meeting to, as he put it, 'take it back'. It was an area where law had ceased to exist and where the social norms of the United States no longer had any relevant role. But I was told that the removal of the current crime leaders from that area would create a vacuum and the police then expected quite a massive inflow of violence as other groups wanted to take control. In New York, on the lower west side, just two blocks off Broadway, one enters areas which are no-go areas for people like me, where the social system is such that law and order and government have no influence. This is related somewhat to the social structure and lack of distribution of income in other areas but it is also closely related to the huge flow of illegal migration across the borders from the south. Measures to strengthen the control of the tribunal are important, so I am particularly pleased to note that CROSROMD recommended that an additional level relating to the disclosure of information be reduced to the tribunal. The bill empowers the minister to certify that the disclosure of information or documents would be contrary to the public interest and cannot be disclosed to any person other than a member of the tribunal. This is a very important power in the fight against organised crime. It seems to me that that will enable intellilaw. gence information, gathered as part of the normal activities of the Australian Federal Police or the National Crime Authority, to be utilised in determining that a person is not a suitable person to remain in Australia. Often that information is such that it should not be disclosed publicly because it may not be, as we would say, 'beyond all reasonable doubt' but strong enough to caution the Australian authorities that the risk is too high for that person to remain in this country. That proposal complements the other two levels of restriction or the qualification of disclosure of information contained in the existing act. Currently, the minister can certify that certain information must not be disclosed to the tribunal or can provide a certificate alerting the tribunal to the sensitivity of certain information, which has either been provided in confidence or which, if disclosed, would be contrary to the public interest-all of which is vital in terms of the difficulties we face in this country. If we do not have these powers and if we do not have that kind of operation through the tribunal, we open ourselves to further infiltration by people this country, frankly, does not want. It is difficult for a person like me who is so supportive of our migration program to have to go down the track of saying that whilst it is mostly good there is some bad. It is difficult because I know that the sensitivities of people are such that if I talk about the Mafioso, for example, the Italian community immediately starts saying that they are a peace loving people and are not involved in crime. Of course, that is perfectly correct and applies also to our Asian and eastern groups. I understa-d that this bill now has bipartisan support, which pleases me greatly. Mr Ruddock-Good.",50
31,Mr CLEELAND,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"I also understand that, whilst there might be some attempt at amendments, it would not really be a serious attempt to change the thrust of the legislation. As the nod from the honourable gentleman confirms, basically this House is in agreement with the measures which are now being introduced as The bill has my full support. I believe we need to be very flexible in the future as to further changes to our migration law as it affects this enormous pressure we and other countries are going to face regarding economic refugees, and I urge the House to fully support it. Debate (on motion by Mr Elliott) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1995 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Explanatory memorandum presented by Mrs Crosio; leave granted for second reading to be moved forthwith. Second Reading",52
32,Mrs CROSIO,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (1.21 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995 is to enable the recently enacted safe third country provisions of the Migration Act 1958 to cover Vietnamese refugees who had already been successfully resettled in the People's Republic of China but who lodged claims for a protection visa in Australia after 30 December 1994. More generally, the bill is also to enable the safe third country provisions of the act to have effect from a specified date preceding the date of commencement of any future agreements and relevant regulations. In the last session of parliament, the government introduced safe third country amendments to the Migration Act to ensure that certain non-citizens, in relation to whom there is a safe third country or who are covered by the comprehensive plan of action for IndoChinese refugees (CPA), should not be allowed to apply for a protection visa. The purpose of the legislation was to prevent 'forum shopping' by people who had already found a country which offered them protection, or whose claims for refugee status had been rejected under an appropriate determination system. The first application of the legislation was in respect of people who arrived in Australia from Galang in Indonesia where they had been assessed as not being refugees under a refugee determination process approved by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The legislation has been effective in ensuring that the relatively small numbers of asylum seekers from Galang arriving here after the legislation was passed were returned, and others in similar circumstances were discouraged from attempting to circumvent the comprehensive plan of action brokered by UNHCR. What the current legislation did not foresee was a situation where large numbers of people arrive very quickly from a place where they have received effective and ongoing protection, but with which Australia does not have an existing safe third country agreement. Under the legislation as it stands, Australia has no choice but to process to finality all claims from those people lodged before a safe third country agreement has been reached. In other words, it is possible for people to arrive in Australia from what is in fact a safe third country and access our refugee determination system because an agreement between that country and Australia had not been negotiated. This is not in the interests of the safe third country, . the country to which the asylum 'seekers travel or UNHCR. It encourages rapid and destabilising irregular movements of people, and undermines the concerted actions of governments and the UNHCR to provide durable solutions in countries of first asylum. From October 1994, 695 people-largely ethnic Chinese Vietnamese from southern China-have arrived by boat in Australia. Neither Australia nor China considers it desirable to encourage this flow of people. More importantly, information from UNHCR, the government of China and our own representatives in southern China has shown conclusively that these people have received the protection of China since they began arriving there from Vietnam in the late 1970s. The details outlined in the statement on the prescribing of the PRC as a safe third country, which was tabled in parliament last week, reveal the group in question to have been treated humanely and that every effort has been made to help them integrate socially and economically into Chinese society. To encourage the belief that simply by sailing to Australia they, and many like them who remain in China, can undermine the resettlement efforts made on their behalf by China and the UNHCR, is wrong. The Government does not believe that this is in the best interests of ethnic Chinese Vietnamese community in China and it is not in the best interests of international community. Australia makes a considerable effort internationally through our overseas aid program, our significant contribution to UN peacekeeping initiatives and our assistance the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to support efforts to help refugees return to their own country or to resettle their country of first asylum. Where resettlebeen ment in Australia is the most appropriate approach, cases are considered in an orderly way under our humanitarian program, which this year will bring 13,000 people in need resettlement to Australia to begin a new life. The irregular and illegal movement to Australia of people who have no grounds for claiming to be refugees from China undermines these and similar efforts made by the international community. On 30 December 1994, it was announced that the government would introduce into this session of parliament legislation designed to ensure that, from that date, certain unauthorised arrivals from the PRC would not be allowed to gain access to Australia's refugee determination system. The announcement underlines the fact that a country may have been a safe third country well before it has been prescribed as one by Australia. To arrived alleviate the paradoxical situation of a country appearing to be an unsafe country one day and a safe country the next, and to avoid possibility of a similar situation to that which we have recently found ourselves in respect the House. of China, Australia would have to negotiate safe third country agreements with every country in the world. The sensible alternative, clearly signalled 30 December 1994 in the case of the boat arrivals from China, is to amend the legislahowever, tion to enable Australian law to reflect the pre-existing reality. This bill will allow the sensible operation of the safe third country legislation by ensurwill ing that all people who have safe third country will be treated in the same way, rather than the anomalous situation that exists under present law where people from the the safe third country who apply before a safe third country agreement is concluded are the allowed to engage our protection obligations whereas those who arrive in precisely the same circumstances but after an agreement has been reached cannot. The legislation will not, and cannot, result to in people being returned to a country that is not a safe third country. No-one will be returned anywhere unless they are covered by in a safe third country agreement or there has proper examination of their claim for protection. The legislation also does not apply to anyone who has been granted a substantive visa or to whom it has been determined of Australia owes protection obligations before the safe third country regulation takes effect. It should also be noted that the minister retains a non-compellable discretion to allow a person's application to remain valid despite this legislation if the minister judges that to be in the public interest. This bill seeks to make Australia's contribution to international efforts to reduce the large-scale illegal movement of people effective and consistent. Its main effect will be to eliminate inconsistencies in the way people are dealt with under the safe third country provisions of the Migration Act who are in all respects the same, other than in the date they in Australia. It contains a very effective safety net to ensure that people affected by it are either returned to a prescribed safe the third country or allowed into our refugee determination system. I commend this bill to",53
33,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Berowra) (l.30 p.m.)The opposition will not be opposing the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. on 2) 1995. The bill will pass with our concurrence. I want to make a number of points, in relation to the debate. The detailed statement by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) on the bill and the way in which it operate is now part of the record, and protection in a one accepts that. The situation that Australia has been faced with since October 1994 is that 695 people, mainly Sino-Vietnamese from southern China, have arrived here by boat. They have arrived illegally in Australia. As has been mentioned, Sino-Vietnamese people started to arrive in the People's Republic of China in 1978. It was a movement which was stimulated by the border conflict between Vietnam and the People's Republic of China. I remember it well. It was almost a situation of war as there were significant troop movements. I imagine that people of Chinese origin in North Vietnam, as it was at that time, would have felt very insecure, and thus they moved into the People's Republic of China They were issued with appropriate documentation. Under the supervision of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, they were resettled in both rural and urban China. China resettled in the order of 284,000 Sino-Vietnamese people between 1978 and 1989. Apparently, China has spent about $US760 million on projects to assist with refugee resettlement. The UNHCR has contributed an additional $US82 million. It was a very significant resettlement of people who may well have been at risk if they had remained in Vietnam. Refugees are not able to pick and choose where they might go for sanctuary in a case where they are likely to be persecuted. Countries where people first arrive have an obligation to resettle those people who are living in fear. There may well be some situations in which, internationally, people agree to resettlement arrangements, but it is the country of first arrival that has the obligation to resettle those who have a well-founded fear ofpersecution. In the case of the Sino-Vietnamese, since the early 1980s they have been involved in illegal movements from the People's Republic of China to places such as Macau, Japan, Hong Kong-on several occasionsand now they are coming to Australia. The opposition has looked very closely at this legislation. The Senate has had an opportunity to examine a number of witnesses in relation to the bill. I refer members to the Hansard record of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee of 3 February and 6 February. One of the people who appeared before the committee, in addition to departmental representatives and those who are interested in refugee questions in  representative in Australia of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. What was particularly interesting was that in his evidence he revealed that this was not a new problem. Mr Fontaine set out what had been done in China and his own experience in relation to China, and he set out what had been done to assist people in resettlement. He also dealt very comprehensively with the arguments that were being advanced by some that people were not running away from what had happened to them previously in Vietnam but were moving from China because of what was now happening to them in China. He wanted to set the record straight on that matter. He went right through the various areas in which people were living and the circumstances in which, because of certain redevelopments, people were being moved to new areas, particularly where people had moved within China and, as I understand it, squatted in particular areas, and why there needed to be some resettlement of those folk within China. He set out the arrangements that were being made and the various options that were being given to people. Those matters are dealt with in Hansard, pages 128 and 129. He also set out something of the history, and I think that is perhaps more indicative of the government's record on this matter. I do not think he was intending to raise criticisms of the government by giving something of this history, but what he made clear is that the situation that we face now is not a new situation. It was a situation, as I had said before, that had faced Macau in the 1980s, Japan, Hong Kong and now Australia. So we have a situation in which the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) would have been awareproperly advised, I am sure, by his department-of what was happening in China. He would have known of the potential for people in these circumstances to move. The legislation that had provided for safe third party status had earlier been dealt with by this parliament. It is only a matter of making proclamations that a country is a safe third country. Mrs Crosio-Without the country's agreement.",54
34,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"The parliamentary secretary says without the country's agreement. We have to satisfy ourselves that it is an appropriate country, but it is only a matter - f making the proclamation under the legislation. What distinguishes this legislation is that we are backdating-I will not say retrospectively legislate because there was some announcement of this measure on 30 December i- a press release of the minister-the legislation to the date on which the minister said that we would legislate this matter. People were on notice, which distinguishes it from a normal retrospective situation. This legislation is to validate this safe third party status, even though we had not produced the appropriate regulations in accordance with the existing legislation to proclaim a safe third party status between the period of the minister's statement and the proclamation. This matter could have been dealt with well in advance of that. I am told that the minister was alerted almost a year ago to the likelihood of an influx of illegal entrants from southern China, and that he should take strong and immediate action to ensure that both the Chi-ese au-horities - nd people contemplating leavmg Chma were m no doubt that Australia would not tolerate such an inflow. So we had all that time in 1994 in which to act and the minister failed to do so. I think it is a measure of the cooperation that the government receives from the opposit-on and our bip-rtis-n approach to immigration matters-which IS not always exemplified by the way in which government members respond-that this cooperation is being facilitated to help the government out of what is in fact a very embarrassing situation. It is certainly appropriate to legislate to ensure that people who are protected and in a safe third country cannot forum shop, cannot move on to another country like Australia and seek further protection, particularly when so many resources, both of China and of the UNHCR have been devoted to ensuring that people arprotected and that they are properly resettled. It is - lear that we are under no obligation to provide further protection. It is on that basis that the principal approach ought to be pursued. It is certainly our view, on this side of the House, that whatever obligations Australia accepts to assist those who have a 'Yell-founded and bona fide fear of persecution are accommodated within Australia. But our capacity to provide that protection is always compromised if those who have no entitlement seek to bring themselves under that umbrella. It is to maintain the integrity of the system itself, and the support of the Australian community for it, that legislation o- this sort is appropriate, and that the cooperatIOn that we have offered is granted. I want to make it clear, by repeating the statement fro!ll the parliamentary secretary, that under thiS legislation the minister does retain a non-compellable discretion to allow a person's application to remain valid, despite· the legislation, if the minister judges that to be in the public interest. That has not been defined, and there may be some purpose in that, because I imagine there might be a wide range of situations that could be covered by that reference to the 'public interest': But, by way of reassurance, I expect that, If people were found to be persecuted within a safe third country, contrary to the general ambit of its assurances the minister would look at such cases on case by case basis. I assume that that might be one of the situations that could exist. I do not know whether it is desirable to spell out those sorts of situations, or to ask the minister or his representative to spell them o-t. For my own part, I certainly take the view that no person in Australia who was in genuine fear of persecution would be returned in. those circumstances, and that one might still have to look at particular cases, beyond the general views that we are proclaiming within this legislation, if such situations arose. I assume that is why we have this reference. On this side of the House, the maintenance ?f our refugee obligations is of particular Importance. We do not believe they should be degraded. We accept that the situation in which some people seek to take advantage of our compassion means that we have to address a whole lot of particularly difficult situations. For that reason, we are cooperating. But we are particularly disappointed that the government, and the minister in particular, have allowed a situation to arise wherein we have had a large number of arrivals. That has occurred in circumstances in which prompt and earlier action might well have obviated the situation. I simply make the point that the minister's failure is not without cost to Australia. I am told that this bill will result in some savings in offshore refugee determination processing costs, given that the number of unauthorised arrivals already in Australia will not be able to access or continue to access our refugee assessment system. It will also save the ongoing costs of detention, which are $55 day, making a total of $37,000 per day those currently in Australia. 'I would simply make the point that those costs arise because people are in fact here. There are additional costs, which we underpaign stand might be in the range of $1 - million $2 million, associated with the obligations that have been assumed under the memoranthis dum of understanding signed with the People's Republic of China. Those are costs associated, particularly, with the return each entrant and possibly some relocation contrary costs for people who have come from remote areas. It can be seen that, whilst there are alleged savings and there are costs-and asked to accept that they are rather neutral in impact on the budget-none of the costs would have been incurred on either side that equation if the minister had acted when he should have acted in relation to this matter. In other words, if a year ago the decisions had been taken to ensure that it was undergood; stood that China was seen as a safe third country and that, if people came they would not be able to access our refugee determination system-which is what we are doing now-we would not have been faced with this situation. It should have been made clear. So let us have none of the nonsense this is rather neutral in budgetary or financial terms. The cost that has been incurred has street been incurred because of the government's abysmal handling of the situation. That is the reality of it. I conclude my remarks by reiterating that the opposition is cooperating in relation to the passage of this legislation. We think it is legislation that is necessary in the national interest and therefore we are facilitating its passage today. Presumably the department will be able to act on this matter promptly and expeditiously. I hope that, as a corollary, the government and its members, particularly those who hold office in the government, will cut out the gratuitous nonsense of the sort we heard today in relation to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services a and Health, the member for Calwell (Dr for Theophanous), when he was ungracious enough not to accept his statements of bipartisanship on immigration. It may be a sign of the underground camthat members like the member for to Calwell will tend to engage in by running around functions and activities, perpetuating myth and asserting that in some way we do not have a bipartisan approach to the fundamental principles. He may think that is of smart but, for my part, I regard it as quite to the national interest, quite unhelpful to political debate, demeaning of the parliamentary institution and demeaning of the government and all of its members if they proclaim that they want a bipartisan approach we are being on these matters. I hope that those who are in positions of of responsibility would dissociate themselves from the remarks of the honourable member for Calwell or others who want to try to perpetuate that argument. It does them no it does the government no good; it does the people of Australia no good. I will simply here by boat, leave it at that.",56
35,Mr FERGUSON,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I say at the outset that I, for one, am very mindful of the importance of bipartisanship in this particular policy area. It is an area into which that great emotions can be channelled and one in which, to be honest, the average person in the gets very little say in the broader public debate--essentially because the debate is dictated by a coterie of people in the ABC, the SBS, the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald, and a number of community groups and religious organisations that really do not want to face up to a few of the truths that are happening internationally in regard to people movement. It is, of course, very important that in this area both the government and the opposition attempt to reach a consensus and to understand that the preservation of the integrity of the system is paramount. Whilst I do not for one moment say that the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 involves financial gain and criminal involvement in relation to the movement of these people, we do have to appreciate that these cases are a small portion of what is occurring internationally. This is not just a matter affecting Australia. It is worth noting that in the December 1994 journal of the International Organisation of Migration an article headed 'Trafficking in migrants' noted internationally the illegal movement of Chinese migrants in Belgium, France, Spain, the United States, Japan and the Caribbean. The Bulletin reports that French authorities have arrested a leader of a network which smuggled Chinese nationals into France and put them to work in textile factories. Spanish authorities in mid-August broke up a trafficking network suspected of smuggling migrants into Spain and Portugal. In the United States, in early November, federal agents broke up a trafficking ring which had reportedly smuggled hundreds of Chinese migrants into the United States. According to the traffickers, several undetected smuggling ships have landed hundreds of migrants into the United States since 1993. The Japanese government, which has seen itself as very much emphasising isolationism in regard to migration, is having a similar problem. An article in Asia Week on 20 January this year said: Though good intentions often motivate rich nations to accept refugees from poorer ones, such generosity would be misplaced in the case of today's boat people. The biggest beneficiaries are not the migrants, who have dubious prospects in the host society, but the criminal syndicates who charge them small fortunes to arrange their passage. On the other hand, those who stand to lose the most when a recipient country is laden with unauthorized migrants are other fugitives with genuine claims to refugee status, who may be squeezed out. Governments wishing to discourage the perilous intercontinental voyages as well as the syndicates that organize them should adopt a policy more in keeping with prevailing realities. They should repatriate all boat people who cannot produce bona fide evidence of persecution at home. Recent arrivals in Australia have testified that they were encouraged to try their luck by the fact that none of their predecessors had been returned. In the particular circumstance of those people who fled Vietnam in 1978-when, in a well known dispute, they felt they would be persecuted as a Chinese speaking minority in North Vietnam-I do not say for one moment that they actually paid money to people as part of this situation when they fled to China. But we cannot just sit back and wish for good intentions and hope that everything will sort itself out. The government has in the last year started a process to get these safe third country agreements. I will take up one point with the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). It is very easy to come here today and say that the government knew this was going to happen, that there was a potential for it, and that the government should have acted. Quite frankly, where in the world can you not have the potential for these kinds of movements? Let us be realistic. We can have the sudden movement of people from Taiwan, with the original native inhabitants saying they are persecuted by the Han Chinese leadership. We can have the Karen saying that the latest events in Burma justify the whole group coming here. I even learnt this week from another member of parliament who has recently been in Indonesia that, whilst we know about Aceh, Timor and Irian Jaya, there is another conflict in Sulawesi that is getting very little national focus. There are so very many possibilities. To say that the government should start putting diplomats and immigration officials on 2,000 planes and sending them around the world to negotiate agreements with every country is absolutely preposterous. There must be a very large area of agreement in this policy area because it can be so difficult; it can cause such friction. I do not think those opposite should come here today with simplistic statements such as, 'The government knew what was going to happen and so it should have been out there fixing all this up.' If we return to the specific, what the government is fundamentally doing here is saying that an agreement was signed with the People's Republic of China on 25 January which relates to this Vietnamese minority in southern China. It is an agreement which followed attendance by our government's immigration authorities in the region to investigate the circumstances first-hand. It follows work done by our public servants to assure us that Chinese bona fides were there in regards to this matter; that they were genuinely not discriminating against this minority. In this debate it is worth saying also that some of the experts in the media who are so ready to say that Australia should accept every person that hits the shore are the same people who criticise members of this parliament for raising human rights issues in a number of countries in this region-Indonesia, China, the lot of them. They are the same people who say, 'Let's have a very close relationship with these regimes. Let's never open our mouths. Let's not say we have different standards.' And when a problem like this happens, and even in cases where there are no bona fides whatsoever, they write in the Australian newspaper or the Sydney Morning Herald saying, 'This government and this opposition are too hardline. They're not humane. They're not willing to face up to people's needs.' This decision follows the movement here of approximately 700 people since October. I agree with those people who say that by itself it is not a tremendous number. But we have to be aware that it is part of a bigger picture. There is a reality up there that you must give signals. What we have seen there in that Asia Week article is that particular point-that because so few people go back we are sending a false signal. We see quotes from the Vietnamese minority in southern China who say, 'I will try my luck. I should be able to get a job on a farm in Australia.' They have that view because they have not seen people sent back. That is the important aspect of this. These people have been accorded protection by China. I am a person who has no doubts about the very big human rights problems in China, but evidence from our officers, from the UNHCR-from authorities that can be trusted, most of the time-is that when they went there they did not find discrimination; they did not find persecution. They found that China had made a genuine effort to absorb these people into its society. They found that there was no employment discrimination, that the people were living in fishing towns and in rural communities that were very much like the rest of the surrounding countryside. There was no discrimination such that they had the worse land. Some of them had land that was not the best for farming purposes, but equally some of them were found in fertile regions. It was found that the Chinese government was facing a degree of criticism because of an analysis by its own residents that these people through UNHCR help and through Chinese government measures were actually advantaged compared with the native population. There have been allegations that the Chinese government has been discriminating but, as I have said, there have been efforts by authorities to check that allegation at first hand. When those authorities went there they noted that this movement of 280,000-odd people since 1978 had been put into 194 settlements in the area. They had not been shoved into a ghetto or ostracised and put on the sideline. They had been distributed throughout the region. In the period since then, China has spent $US760 million on measures and the UNHCR has devoted $82 million to the same measures. It is worth noting a UNHCR report of 1992 which states, 'The economic and social integration of the great majority of the refugees does not pose any major problems as they are rural people of Chinese origin and they come from the northern part of Vietnam.' It has been noted by the Chinese authorities responsible that about five per cent of these people have systematically decided that they do not like the area in which they live and that they want resettlement in the West. Over the course of time, they have attempted to move to Hong Kong and Macau-and in some cases to Japan and Australia. The objective of that visit was to conduct an independent assessment of the situation of Sino-Vietnamese farmer refugees in China through the examination of a representative sample of resettlement sites. That visit had, according to our immigration authorities, the cooperation of the relevant Chinese ministry, the ministry for civil affairs. The immigration authorities did not find that they were being excluded, that they could not meet people, that they were pushed to select areas or that they were allowed to talk only to compliant leaders of the community. They essentially found that we had great cooperation, that we visited a variety of areas and looked at different circumstances-different factories, fishing areas and rural villages. They came to a view that the houses they were living in were 'solidly built from plastered brick and have running water and electricity'. They are not different from the majority of old-style accommodation available in China. They said, 'This accommodation was of a considerably higher standard than that occupied by most rural and provincial workers in neighbouring South-East Asian countries.' We have a situation where these people do not fall within UN conventions as a class facing discrimination or persecution. A view has been expressed by the UNHCR. Quite frankly, the commissioner's record of criticism of this country's policies is that we are liberal and too hardlined. (Quorum formed) As I said, we had an examination of the circumstances in the region. It is not as though that examination concerned only the nature of conditions under which they were living. Australia reached an agreement with China in relation to the compliance of its government with relevant international law concerning the protection of Vietnamese refugees, the relevant human rights standards for the Vietnamese and a system of verification. It is worth noting that, as others have said, this legislation has been used in other circumstances. For all the complaints in the world, it is interesting to note that the chief migration officer visited those people on the Falcon on 16 December 1994 in Indonesia and noted no evidence of ill-treatment in their case. This is not an isolated circumstance; it is part of an international pattern. What we are doing today in Australia is paralleled in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Finland and France. At the moment the United States is considering similar measures. Europe is getting towards a situation where there is an understanding as to which country has primary responsibility for particular cases. This legislation seeks to ensure that we do not, tomorrow morning, convert a country from the category of safe to unsafe. The essential thrust of the legislation is to invalidate applications for protection visas made by Vietnamese refugees presently resettled in the PRC between 30 December 1994, effecting the statutory rule and, more generally, to make sure that we can invalidate visa applications made during a similar transitional period. I commend the legislation. It is not to be seen in isolated circumstances-there is a pattern of human movement around the world. It has been speculated that as many as one million Chinese have moved into Europe in the last three or four years. We know that that has been accompanied by criminal involvement. We know that people are making money out of moving people. We also realise that, for all the complaints by the member for Berowra-that all of this is very predictable and the government should know everything in advance; he has all the answers and he knows where all the problems are going to occur--essentially this measure is a realistic response to a problem that has emerged since October.",57
36,Mr CAMPBELL,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"These migration bills are so necessary and so eminently common sense that it is very hard to see how there can be any significant opposition. Indeed, it is pleasing to see that the opposition is supporting the legislationnot, I would suggest, out of any sense of helping us but because to do so is eminently 'common sense (Quorum formed) I sincerely want to thank the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) for calling a quorum because it is very hard to fill 20 minutes on this particular subject. She has been a considerable help. The member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and I diverge on many policy issues, but he is one of the most thoroughly decent people I know and also one of the most knowledgeable in this field of immigration. To have called a quorum during the speech of the member for Reid was childish in the extreme. I am not suggesting the member for Moncrieff is entering her second childhood-I realise she is just acting under orders-but she could have exhibited a little more discretion. I was listening to the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) in my room. The extent of the sanctimonious nonsense we get from him never ceases to amaze me. While it might be appropriate for his electorate, he really is misplaced and should have been a bishop in a constituency like the east Sydney diocese. I want to make a point about government and, I hope, about opposition. The paramount responsibility of any government is, and must be, to the citizens of its country. Today too many governments think they have larger responsibilities elsewhere. They see themselves as citizens of an entity bigger than the nation. In my view, there is no big entity and certainly there is no responsibility for govern to ment that goes beyond the interests of its citizens. The member for Berowra talked about the bipartisan policy that government has in immigration. He is right: it is a bipartisan policy, by and large; but it is not the policy that the people of Australia want. Both parties know this. It is not the platform of any party, and it does not have to be because there is bipartisanship. Bob Hawke, whom some of you may remember, said he thought that one of his great achievements was to conspire with the Liberal Party and the ACTU to keep immigration and multiculturalism off the agenda. I do not think that was a great achievement; I believe that has all the hallmarks of treachery. The member for Reid has detailed the humbug we have been faced with in claims for refugee status. The reality is that there are countless billions of people in the world who see themselves as economic refugees. They seek our shores for beneficiation of their economic circumstances. It is very nice for them, but we simply cannot accommodate that. While I support this bill and believe that the measures should have been brought in long ago, I have the feeling that we are shuffling deckchairs on the Titanic, for simultaneously the world is embracing policies that can make this problem only worse and, in my view, insurmountable. I refer to the present penchant throughout the world for free trade. Members should be very cognisant of the fact that the consequence of free trade throughout the world will be-without a doubt and inevitably-the lowering of standards of living. If free trade were to enter and affect agriculture in Third World countries, and if they were brought up to the 'efficient levels' of Australian or American agriculture, there would be a massive movement of people out of agriculture because they would no longer be needed. They would drift to the already crowded seas of Asia, and that would set off an inevitable and remorseless pressure for the movement of people throughout the world. It would be a pressure that would be very hard resist and would be a direct consequence of the adoption of world free trade. It is a bizarre idea. I can understand, in the limited world of Ricardo, why it may have made some sense. But I suggest that David Ricardo was talking about a world far smaller and far less integrated than exists. I send that as a very urgent warning. The evidence is already there. Since the United States embraced free trade, it has had, on average, a real decline in standards, and 20 per cent of the population has developed into a permanent underc1ass. I suppose the United States thinks it can disregard that 20 per cent because most of them are black. That is not a view I hold. This bill simply tries to stem what would be a breach in the dyke-something that could become overwhelming. Mrs SuIIivan- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House. The bells being rungMrs SuIIivan- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I draw your attention to standing order 58.",60
37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Mr Snow)Order! The honourable member for Moncrieff has drawn my attention to standing order 58, which states: Every Member of the House, when he or she comes into the Chamber, shall take his or her seat, and shall not at any time stand in any of the passages or gangways. I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff. (Quorum formed)",62
38,Mr CAMPBELL,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"--With these constant interruptions, I forget where I am up to. I cannot recall whether I have mentioned the member for Berowra, but I thought he was particularly churlish and showed a real lack of bipartisanship when he implied that the government should have foreseen all these problems it is having with immigration. These sorts of things are going to happen on an increasing scale all around the world, and it is impossible to know when or where they will occur. We need to address the whole system so we will not be directly affected by whatever happens around the world. I believe the people of Australia want a policy of low immigration and very strong measures taken against boat people, who are clearly queue jumping. There is hardly a genuine refugee amongst them; in fact, I would say there is not a genuine refugee amongst them. I have done a fair bit of refugee work in this House. However, I have stopped doing it because I find that genuine refugees are not applying to come here. The people coming here are overwhelmingly economic refugees. As I said before, we cannot provide a haven for economic refugees. The honourable member for Berowra is one of the bleeding hearts. He poses in this House as one who, by his actions, supports the people who seek to make repatriation difficult. The government of Australia has no alternative. It is easy to say that we are only talking about a small number of people. I believe that the total number of people who have come to Australia since the early 1970s is around 1,000. This is significant because we are faced with pressures and actions which are really going to ignite the powder keg. We have Judge Sackville in Australia. He is one of the new class with his politically correct ideas. I doubt whether Judge Sackville ever thinks about or gives a damn about the national interests of this country. Ifhe did, he would not come to such bizarre judgments. I believe that any government should have a policy of immediately legislating to overrule any of Judge Sackville's judgments because, on balance, it would be in the national interest to do so. What Judge Sackville has done not only in immigration, but in the timber debate, is a great disservice to this country. I believe the man is someone who ought to be recognised in Australia as being destructive and opposed to our national interest. I am generally opposed to retrospective legislation. I believe the government has acted with extreme compassion. Whilst I very strongly support the legislation, there are still too many loopholes that can possibly be exploited. I hope I am proved wrong, but I rather fear that the battalions of lawyers that blight this industry will be looking for every possible loophole. It is in the national interest that we pass this legislation. I urge both parties in this place to think more strongly about immigration for it may be that we do not want a bipartisan policy; maybe one or other of the parties should be honest enough and have the guts to come forward with a policy as part of its election manifesto that will be endorsed by the people of Australia.",62
39,Mrs CROSIO,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (2.22 p.m.)-I will be brief, but a number of points have to be said about the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995 before the House. In thanking the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), I reiterate what the honourable member for Reid said. The honourable member for Berowra expressed concern that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) did not take action quickly enough. I can assure him that it was taken more than quickly enough. The honourable member for Berowra should understand that we need to have both the agreement and the regulations in place before the scheme comes into being. When we were aware of action that was taken, the deputy secretary of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs went to China around 27 November last year. He later returned to China. We continued negotiations with the Chinese government. The agreement with the Chinese government was not signed until 25 January. We immediately had the regulations before executive government, and the Governor General signed them on 27 January. If that is not fast action, I wonder what is. We were aware of rumours that things may have taken place and that people may have been starting to leave China. We were also aware that the Chinese government was taking some very positive steps to make it illegal those people to flee. Rather than be condemned for lack of action, the minister ought to be congratulated for the action that has been taken. The government ought to be congratulated for the speed with which it took action. A lot of people in the community had media-fuelled opinions-and both previous speakers, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie and the honourable member for Reid, have touched on that-that we should have taken more refugees and we should not be so harsh. Even though the honourable member for Kalgoorlie may say that we have different opinions on migration, I can assure all members of this House that, as far as we are concerned, Australia is second to none in the area of settlement and resettlement of refugees from around the world. Between July of 1989 and July of 1994, Australia resettled 17,600 Vietnamese and Laotian refugees under our comprehensive plan of action. I believe that is a record second to none. The UK and Germany are often put up as examples of refugee resettlement, but we find that for 1993 the UK averaged about five per cent and Germany about seven per cent. When we compare that with the numbers Australia has resettled, ours is no mean feat for a country of our size. The minister issued a press release on 30 December concerning this matter-how Australia was going to move concerning boat arrivals-and I would like to put into the Hansard an excerpt from page 2: None of the changes will compromise the Australian Government's commitment to provide protection for genuine refugees. Indeed, they strengthen it because they protect Australia's capacity to offer humanitarian protection to the many people around the world who need accessto Australia for resettlement under our normal programs. The minister went on to talk about how many refugees we have accepted from the different camps in the Indo-Chinese region. That is what we are about. We are about making sure that we contribute under the UNHCR agreement for the resettlement of refugees, that it is done in a legal manner and that we do not have queue jumping and shopping around for countries. That is parfor ticularly so in this case, where it has been proven that these people settled in China as early as 1978-79 and that they were integrated within the community, particularly as far as the work aspect of their lives there is concerned, with most deciding that they would seek another country after they had settled in the country of their first choice. In fact, between 1978 and 1989, some 285,000 people arrived in southern China from Vietnam seeking protection. People talk about what the community at large thinks, and I know that, in all good faith, people feel that Australia should do more for refugees. But I recollect a minister from China, when the Chinese were talking about the Olympics, asking, 'What country in the world will accept one per cent of our population if we open up our doors?' That made me think about what Australia would do if China opened up its doors and did not agree with us about resettlement of people from there. I thought about what we would do if, overnight, we had to resettle 1.2 million people. So while the community at large is saying that we should do more, people should be saying thank you to the Australian government-there is bipartisan agreement on this-for what we have been able to do by way of contribution to resettlement of refugees from many parts of the world. I thank the speakers in this debate. I would certainly say to people who were concerned about this legislation that we have had recent experiences of Sino-Vietnamese boat people being illegal immigrants and being returned from Hong Kong. Their return has been organised very smoothly. The UNHCR is of the view that the returnees were able to return to normal entitlements. There has been no evidence of any discrimination suffered by them, nor has there been any evidence of persecution following the return of those people. I can assure the community at large, which might have concerns about this legislation, that things are being done correctly. The situation is being monitored and supervised and these people will be returned to their countries. I thank the supporters of the bill and I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mrs Crosio) read a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.5) 1994 Cognate bills: NA REGISTRATION (APPLICATION) LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1994 NA REGISTRATION (RENEWAL) LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1994 IMMIGRATION (EDUCATION) CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed.",62
40,Mrs CROSIO,MIGRATION AGENTS,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (2.30 p.m.)-Before I commence speaking about some of the things I would like to round off on this bill, I would like to thank the members who spoke in this debate: the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Griffin). I would like to relate a couple of the points that I believe were not covered by speakers on our side of the House who were speaking in support of the bill, on behalf of the government. I was going to talk at great length on investment migrationMr Ruddock-Didn't Mr Cleeland speak?",64
41,Mrs CROSIO,MIGRATION AGENTS,"I am sorry, he did. I thank the honourable member for Berowra for drawing my attention to the fact that the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) also spoke on behalf of the government. I would certainly not like to omit him; I thank him for his contribution. I was going to talk at great length about business migration but I will not repeat myself because the member for Corinella certainly covered that. I will just say to the member for Berowra that, yes, I did sit on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts when we fully examined the business migration scheme at that time. If we look at what this bill is all about we will see it has taken into account some of the concerns raised by the Public Accounts Committee in its report and in its investigations. At the same time, the bill has acknowledged that we can only go from strength to strength if we encourage correct business migration as well as investment-linked migration. What we did not have previously is the mandatory reporting that is now required under this legislation. That is one of the anomalies the Public Accounts Committee found during its investigation. Once a person arrived, there was not a great deal of follow-up of where they were or what they were doing. This legislation now provides for mandatory reporting of our business skills migrants; they must notify their address in Australia within 28 days of any change. They are also required to participate in the department's monitoring surveys which are going to be conducted on a 12-month, 24-month and 36-month basis after their initial arrival. When we look at those stringent conditions attached to a business migrant we find that no other migrant group will be subject to such scrutiny. We are aware of some of the concerns that have been expressed in the past and some of the anomalies that flow from them. This bill certainly will strengthen the provisions. Through these surveys and investigations our government will be able to assess the success of the business skills migration classes. We need to do that on a continual basis. I do not think we should allow people just to come in willy-nilly to this country. They have to make a contribution and have to show that they can make that contribution. There were many recommendations in the 1992 CROSROMD report. When the member for Berowra spoke on this bill he said the opposition would support it-then we got the usual 'but'. He went on about what was eliminated from the report, and I will come to that in a moment. One of the things we did not get was a congratulation from the opposition for the fact that of the 36 recommendations that CROSROMD, under Ian Macphee, had recommended to the government, at this stage some 27 have been fully accepted by the government. There are a small number of recommendations to further examine, particularly those relating to third-party issues. I suppose I am saying that we have not been slow as a government in moving to accept and put into legislation recommendations from the Macphee report for change in those areas where there was an obvious anomaly. (Quorum formed) I can never understand why members of the opposition wish to call a quorum when I am on my feet unless they are not wanting to hear what I have to say. All I am doing is rounding up on a bill that was debated here earlier today. The debate has been going on from about 10.45 a.m., and we deferred it to take on board another bill. I am now wrapping up on some of the points raised during that procedure, points which I believe have to be answeredand I will continue to do so. I had stated on the Macphee report, CROSROMD, that where the generosity of the opposition did not extend was to congratulate the government for having acted on so many of the recommendations and for having put in place legislation on the immigration reviews. That was not acknowledged. Mrs Sullivan interjecting",64
42,Mrs CROSIO,MIGRATION AGENTS,"I would like a polite word but I do not think my English language would go that far. I wanted to touch on what the member for Berowra started to talk about, the Immigration Review Tribunal appointment process. I had a copy of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration brought in. For those who were attuned to the debates this morning, the Immigration Review Tribunal appointments process of December 1994 was tabled in this House on about 8 December. The government itself does not even have to reply to this until March, yet the member for Berowra went on in great detail about why the government has not taken into account the recommendations of that particular committee. I suppose he has the right, like everybody else, to comment on a committee that he has served on, and particularly a committee on which he put in a dissenting report. But I too now would like to comment on some of those things. First and foremost, I think the criticism of the recent appointments, whether they are justified or not, went a littleMr Ruddock interjecting",65
43,Mrs CROSIO,MIGRATION AGENTS,"There was a dissenting report or a minority report. To understand the procedures, the Immigration Review Tribunal presently has something like 36 members. They are concerned with making sure that the job is done in a very highly skilled way. We talked about the applications, as touched on by the member for Berowra. Something like 750 applications were received before that tribunal was put together. The member for Berowra stated that those selected were either Labor voters or friends of the minister and asked why they were appointed. When he was speaking I made some notes of my own. It does not matter whether they are members of the ALP or not. The one person that he referred to as being the president of a club within my electorate is not a member of the ALP. He did not touch on some of those who had reapplied because they were past members of the ALP. I would like to examine the others who were put on the tribunal, to see where their political alliances lie. I suppose we do not need to do that. I say to the member for Berowra and all other members of this parliament: if you are a member of the ALP, does it mean that you do not bleed blood? Does it mean that you are not human? Does it mean that you do not have an understanding of what the review tribunal is all about or that you could not make a contribution to that tribunal? We do not want to have a tribunal that is made up of doctors, lawyers or members like the member for Berowra. What we want is a cross-section of people able to handle appeals that are being placed by individuals who feel that they have in some way not had all of their application considered. There is a right of appeal, and that is why that mechanism was put in place. It was put there so that those rights were there for all people making applications to have access to. I thought it was ironic too because I read also in the CROSROMD report congratulations to the Immigration Review Tribunal, not only for its process, the way it dealt with the applications, but also for the way it conducted its business. All we have had is criticism from the opposition in that respect. At times, it is quite unfair. If we are looking at acknowledging what has occurred, we also need to make sure that we do not imply, by our petty little re-arks and innuendo and supposition, somethmg that does not really exist. At times many members use this place as a cowards' castle. I have never done so, because I do not believe any person's character should be assassinated without adequate proof. Someone standing up here and making allegations based on supposition and innuendo without verification can with the spoken word, absolutely decimate thperson concerned and the family of that person. When people making such allegations here are asked to go outside and repeat them, they do not want to. They always say, 'Oh, but maybe ... ' I do not think that is good enough. It is not good enough for any members of parliament-elected representatives representing not only their constituents but the people of Australia-to use the democratic process and stand up in this House, where they are covered by parliamentary privilege, and imply that someone is not this or not that without having evidence, or, as in the case of the member for Berowra, imply something without waiting for the due process of proceedings to be completed. He is aware, as I am, that those people have gone through an inquiry in which a lot of the evidence was based on hearsay because they were not able to subpoena witnesses under oath. That issue has now been taken over by a Senate inquiry. I understand that Senate inquiry will not come to its determination until late July. I would expect people, certainly parliamentarians, at least to have the decency to wait until the Senate inquiry is completed rather than commenting on those matters now in a debate on an immigration bill before the House. If further things are proven, well and good. Let us then debate those matters and take the appropriate action. On behalf of the government, I commend all members who have participated in this debate. The bills will certainly put in place the recommendations to make sure that the Migration Act, in its entirety, is administered in a fairer way. Through the levy administration bills-which are tax bills, and that is why they have been introduced in the House before they go to the Senate-we will make sure that taxpayers' dollars are spent wisely and well. The levy on migration agents has been accepted by those agents. The levy on adult migrant education programs has also been accepted. I commend to the House the four bills that have been debated cognately, and I thank speakers for their contributions. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Clauses 1 to 5-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clauses 6 and 7-by leave-taken together.",65
44,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AGENTS,"Berowra) (2.43 p.m.)Clauses 6 and 7 deal with the question I adverted to before: the issue of the remuneration of members of the Immigration Review Tribunal. The clauses ensure that the remuneration of members is not reduced by any determination of the Remuneration Tribunal. The bill, in other clauses, ensures that from now on remuneration will be set at a level determined by the Remuneration Tribunal rather than, as has been the case to date, by legislation and ministerial determination. In substituting the Remuneration Tribunal, which is an independent body, for the government or the minister determining these matters, it seems to me that it is not a question of asking the tribunal to do the job and then saying, 'But you can only do the job if you give them more.' If the tribunal determines that the government erred in relation to relativities or made an incorrect decision as to what was an appropriate award, then it seems to me that the rate determined by the tribunal is the rate at which the determination ought to be effected. The intention of the opposition is clear: it is to remove clauses 6 and 7, which effectively grandfather the rates of pay which have been determined by statute and by ministerial determination; and to enable the Remuneration Tribunal to carry out its task unfettered by this legislation. In other words, the intention is to allow the tribunal to do what it has been asked to do-to set a fair rate of remuneration based upon all of the appropriate comparisons and other issues that ought to be properly considered but not to allow the matter then to be affected by a decision in this act so that it cannot reduce an award below current rates. For that reason, the opposition opposes these two clauses. They are quite discrete clauses and can easily be omitted. That will not affect the other intent of the legislation.",66
45,Mrs CROSIO,MIGRATION AGENTS,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (2.46 p.m.)-The government completely opposes the elimination of these clauses, as proposed by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). I will explain a little further what the elimination of these two clauses would mean. We have people who are now on the appeals tribunal. They have been under contracts---certain conditions of employment-which state that they would earn X, Y and Z as part of their employment. The member for Berowra is asking this House to consider eliminating completely, by using the Remuneration Tribunal to eliminate those clauses in such a way, the previous contract that had been extended to those people who are doing that job. He is asking that we take away all that security they are receiving in payment now, and then have the tribunal start from there. That is certainly contrary to what the government intended with these clauses. We intended to make sure that, in future, any remuneration at all will be considered, not by the minister or the government, but by the Remuneration Tribunal, following from the original contract extended to those people who are presently employed. It would be the same for any other job that had been offered to an individual. They would be given a certain contract and conditions with regard to what is expected from them in that job. They would then be told how much they would earn and whether they would be paid on an hourly, daily, weekly or sitting fee basis. Then they would agree to take that position and be employed under those rights or conditions that were set out. The opposition is saying, 'We want to eliminate that process. We want to do it virtually retrospectively'-an action which the opposition continually claims in this House that it does not believe in. It says, 'We want to eliminate completely the guarantee of security, the guarantee of the contract that was entered into and agreed to by the government and those people who were employed by the appeals tribunal.' The opposition wants to say to them now, 'You will not know what you are going to get.' (Quorum formed) I say for those who have just come into the House, and particularly for those in the gallery, that the debate on the migration bills has been going on since about a quarter to 11. The opposition is proposing to eliminate two clauses from those bills. As I have stated before, the government opposes the elimination of those clauses as that would give no security whatsoever to those people who are already employed on that tribunal. Under the contract of their employment and what has been signed and agreed to, their remuneration would remain as they are now receiving it. That is why we oppose the amendment in total. (Time expired) Question put: That the clauses be agreed to. The House divided. [2.52 p.m.] e Mr SPEAKER - Hon. Stephen Martin) Ayes ............... Noes ............... Majority . . . . . . . . . .

47,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister of his repeated claims that outlays in Australia are 'as low as you could possibly have them'; his claim that the government was not cutting outlays any further because it would be 'irresponsible, unfair and just not smart'; and in particular the Treasurer's statement, 'If you're going to do anything substantial, then it's difficult to do too much on outlays without starting to rip away at programs which have already been finetuned.' I ask the Prime Minister: why have you deliberately deceived the Australian people by publicly attacking spending cuts and denigrating those who have supported. them whilst, at the same time, preparing plans which would, over the next four years, cut government spending by $3 billion in year one, $5 billion in year two, $6 billion in year three, and $7 billion in year four, totalling $21 billion in five departments alone?",68

51,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,69
52,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I have said in the House on a number of occasions is that outlays to GDP in this country rose to their highest level ever when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer-that is, 29.9 per cent of gross domestic product. They were brought down by 1989-90 to 23.7 per cent: that is, they had been reduced by six per cent of GDP. In today's terms, that is a reduction in government spending of $30 billion a year. When the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and I talk about resorting to outlays cuts of these sorts of dimensions, we make the point that, in accordance with last year's budget documents, on a no policy change basis, the projected outlays levels for 1997-98 are 24 per cent of GDP: that is, back almost to the lowest point of 23.7 per cent in the late that? 1980s. When it does this natural shift back to 24 per cent, the underlying structure of the outlays is such that Australia will have achieved a very modest level of government outlays to GDP as a consequence of-as the finance minister put it-the 'swingeing' cuts to outlays in the 1980s. What I and other ministers have said, and what the Treasurer made plain a week ago, is that there is going to be a significant tightener ing of policy which can come in a number of areas which we have since discussed in this parliament, including outlays. However, a review of outlays does not imply that we are about having outlays cuts anything approaching the gargantuan reductions of the 1980s. That is the key point. No resort to any document from the finance department-and apparently the document that you have is not even one that I have seen",69

76,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Goldstein. The minister has the call.,70
77,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the month of January, 16,600 jobs were created, taking to 494,000 the total number of jobs delivered by this government since its re-election 23 months ago. The participation rate for last month increased. But that, essentially, also confirms the strength of the labour market as well because it shows that more people are reentering the work force. It is a healthy sign in terms of people's perceptions of job opportunity but it also, significantly, will help dampen wage pressures. The monthly figures themselves, of course, can always be volatile but the trend figures are unmistakable.",70
78,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For January, employment trend figures went up 16,700Mr Richard Evans-What was the number unemployed.",70
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Cowan.,70
80,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And, in unemployed numbers, they fell 3,600. Over the year, 285,000 jobs have been created. Let us compare the 285,000 jobs we delivered in one year with the number of jobs that were created in the five years when the current Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer. How many jobs were created in five years? There were 262,000. We have bettered it in one year. Significantly, it is interesting to note that this economy is experiencing not only strong jobs growth but also strong productivity growth. So we have more people working, but they are working more productively. Again I make the comparison. We have four per cent productivity improvement in the labour force and the best that could be achieved when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer was 1Y2 per cent. It went from 1Y2 per cent to four per cent. I make the point that this is a very significant recovery. It is a recovery that is being sustained because of the high levels of economic growth and has been added to by the targeted measures that Working Nation has brought to bear. We on this side of the House accept that, at nine per cent unemployment, we still have a long way to go. But the policies we have put in place have worked and they will continue to work. I believe the House will see continuing improvement in the labour market. Last month's figures only serve to confirm that view. Government Policy",70

110,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The tax cuts were in two tranches-the first was brought forward and the second put back-which were agreed by both houses of parliament. Mr Costello-Till when?,72
111,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As promised, the government will be making its position clear about the second round of tax cuts in this year's budget. To get this right, the first lot has paid and the second lot-well, you will have to wait for the budget and you will see it. The government paid all of the tax cuts between 1983 and 1993 that it said it would of pay. It paid billions upon billions of tax cuts. One tax cut after another was used to reduce be wage demands and bring down Australia's inflation. They were commitments made and honoured. This is in sharp contrast to when the opposition was in government. An article in today'sAge is headlined 'The tax taskmaster of the past feigns shock', referring to the Leader of the Opposition. It states: ... MrHoward: · Broke the Government's ""fistful of dollars"" campaign promise of a few months earlier and gave only half indexation of income tax. At a time of high inflation, this raised extra revenue equivalent to $3 billion in today's economy. · Introduced the crude oil levy to raise domestic oil prices to world parity levels. This bumped up petrol prices by 15 to 20 per cent, raising the equivalent of $3.5 billion in a full year. Mr Costello interjecting",72
112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the Deputy Treasurer Leader of the Opposition.,72
113,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The article continues: · Imposed a 1.5 per cent temporary surcharge on income tax, raising $2.5 billion. Of course, there is no mention of the temporary surcharge in the previous election. It further states: · Thumped up taxes on beer, spirits and cigarettes by the equivalent of $2 billion in today's terms. · Introduced the airport departure tax, initially at $10. · Taxed retirees on lump sum payments for unused annual and long service leave. · Scrapped tax deductions for home loan interest payments. The article goes on to say that· the consequence of all this was an increase in tax. He raised tax from 23.8 per cent of GDP to 26.1 per cent. That is, he raised tax by two per cent of GDP which, in today's dollars, is $10 billion. This followed an election where the then Treasurer, the now Leader of the Opposition, was going to give tax cuts. You could ring up and find out how much the tax cuts were. There were the 'fistful of dollars' been photographs in the newspapers of the advertisements from the opposition's advertising agency. It had an advertising campaign. That is the reference I made to the Leader of the Opposition being like Ronald Biggs. He does not have a past. How dare Mr Cole batch from the Age mention these things? Don't we know that the Liberal Party has given him a clean bill of health? It has rubbed away his identity. When you see him in the carnival shirt and with the maracas, it is not really him at all. It looks like Biggs, it talks like Biggs, it thinks like Biggs, but it is not Biggs; it is Bobby, the brush salesman from Bennelong. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise to a point of order. Ronald Biggs was a convicted criminal of the most infamous type. I find the Prime Minister's reference to Ronald Biggs offensive, in poor taste, and certainly irrelevant, and the Prime Minister should withdraw.",72
114,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. I take the opportunity to remind the honourable member for Warringah that this week he is making something of an art form of taking points of order. May I also say to him that, during the debate in this place yesterday, the Deputy Speaker asked somebody to be removed for a period of one hour for taking spurious points of order. I hope he takes the hint.",73
115,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That deals with the veracity of the appropriate election commitments. After the government has been in office for 12 years and paid one tax cut after another, to have these sorts of questions with these imputations in them is, of course, without any veracity whatsoever.

123,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are talking about Working Nation, which is a program to support the long-term unemployed; to train them; to get them back into the labour market; to give them a future; to make Australia more equitable and more cohesive; to bring skills formation and skills complementation to the labour market in the right part of the recovery cycle-the thing you described as a spending spree which you would, as a government, wipe out-support for the long-term unemployed; support for them through Working Nation, when at the last election you said you would take $350 million from the then $750 million labour market programs. That is hardly the sort of background, I would think, from somebody who wants to ask a question about it. You have said that you will cut the programs to pieces. You have described the government's quite revolutionary approach to labour market programs as a spending spree. You do not believe in the social equity of giving the long-term unemployed a place in the labour market. You do not even believe in the economic efficiency of having better skills formation and complementation at the right part of the cycle by bringing the long-term unemployed and young people into the thing. Rather, you want to score what you think is a cheap parliamentary shot from a program that you said was a spending spree--on programs that you actually said you would cut. I think no more needs to be said about the question. . Investment Growth",73
124,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer provide information of any analysis which has been done on the impact of the government's development allowance in encouraging investment in major projects in Australia? Can the Treasurer also advise the House of the importance of investment growth to the Australian economy?,74
125,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the member for Perth I say that of course the government has been very concerned to get investment growing again and in the past few years made various changes to tax provisions to ensure that we have a strong growth in investcast ment. That has included: reducing the pany tax from 39c to 33c; the accelerated depreciation allowance; the general investment allowance of 10 per cent; and, of course, the development allowance, which was referred to by the questioner. The development allowance is for major projects and it is, I think, proving to be important element of the government's of policies to produce a strong investment response. So far, some 230 projects have been registered, with a capital value of in excess $61.5 billion. In order to gauge the impact of the allowance initiative the Development Allowance Authority has developed a questionnaire which was sent to projects registered for the allowance. The response from that questionnaire shows that the allowance is having a very encouraging effect. It indicates that the allowance has had a significant effect on stimulating new investment or bringing forward the timing of planned investments. Indeed, 70 per cent of respondents have said that the availability of the allowance had an impact on either the actual occurrence of the project or its timing. The results suggest that the availability of the allowance may have helped bring forward both start dates and completion dates by an average of one year. They show that for manufacturing industry the effect has been to enable new projects to come forward, whereas for mining it has been more to change the timing of projects. That, of course, is very important in getting an .increase in investment. At a time when the economy is growing strongly we need investment to increase so we do not reach capacity constraints. If the economy runs into capacity constraints, what will happen is that, clearly, prices will take off, so there will be a spill over into imports. For us to maintain a position where we do not reach those capacity constraints, strong business investment is needed. Of course, this year we forecast 14.5 per cent, which the opposition decried as ludihas crous-it said investment was dead in the water-but in fact now we see that the foreis 24 per cent. So we do have that strong cominvestment that we have been seeking to generate. It is very much what the economy needs to keep inflation low, to keep creating jobs, and to get that enormous job growth that the minister for employment was referring to earlier-which has given us almost 500,000 jobs since the last election, an extraordinary rate of increasing employment. To enable us an to keep that kind of performance going, we array need to have strong investment. The development allowance has been an of important part of the way in which the government is providing not just for increased investment now but also for that strong investment to continue into years hence and give us sustainable long-term growth of the economy and employment.

126,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Executive Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa, Mr F.W. de Klerk. On behalf of the House, I extend him a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! . QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE Pensions and Allowances",74
127,Mr HOWARD,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Could the Prime Minister explain the statement yesterday by the Minister for Social Security that 'the government remains committed to the twice yearly indexation of pensions and allowances that takes place each March and September'. Given that his own department, the Treasury and the Department of Finance have developed a plan to save $805 million over the next four years by changing indexation arrangements for pensions and allowances, is it the case that the Minister for Social Security misled the House yesterday or is it the case that you, the Prime Minister, misled the Minister for Social Security by not informing him what you had decided for his portfolio?",75
128,Mr MELHAM,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,This is the order from the advertising agency.,75
129,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,I warn the member for Banks.,75
130,Mr KEATING,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"The Leader of the Opposition does come to the leadership of his party with a long history-and a not always glorious one. He wants to be taken seriously as somebody of account, somebody who is about something better than his predecessor. What he is really about is a grubby little exercise trying to make the nation's budget building even harder than it normally is by running out into the public domain, asking",75
131,Mr FILING,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order relating to standing order 145 relevance. I make the observation that understand your previous rulings that the answerer may contrast and compare opposition and government policies but, in this list instance, the Prime Minister is indulging in personal attack; and he ought to be brought back",75
132,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,Absolute rubbish. You did hear my earlier warning. I warn the member for Moore. The Prime Minister was talking about the budget.,75
133,Mr KEATING,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,The Leader of the Opposition will want to run around and present himself as a person without a historyOpposition members-Answer the question!,75
134,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,Order! Order!,75
135,Mr KEATING,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"as a new-age person who is going to bring something better to the body politic. But, really, what is he about? He is about picking up a list of savings options which occur in every budget round, that have no status with the government, no status with the cabinet and trying-as he was instructed by his advertising agency in its poll-driven response to politics-to make every recipient of a benefit think that the benefit will be lost or that those who do not lose it this time will lose it next time. Again it is very instructive to go back to Mr Colebatch's article today. He says: Again, Mr Howard had words for his critics on the right. Too often, he told Parliament, ""enthusiasm for taxation reductions, and for the general restraint on expenditures which makes these reductions possible is not matched by a willingness to accept the consequences of expenditure reductions in particular areas"". ""It is the Government's responsibility to achieve a proper balance between these competing pressures. No one should be under any illusion that the task is easy"". That was about Mr Howard when he was of Treasurer. What he is doing now is simply trying to debase the whole process",75
136,Mr HOWARD,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,I was a good Treasurer.,75
137,Mr KEATING,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"No, you were not; you were never a good Treasurer. You were a flop on as a Treasurer-a complete flop. But even I you had flashes of consistency about you. Here you are, saying the very thing that I am . saying to you; and here you are, relying on a that has no status, asking ministers and me a questions about the social security system. There will be a plethora of spending options being proposed by ministers and departments in this budget round. Only a few of them will succeed. There will be a plethora of savings options proposed by departments in this round. Only a few of those will be adopted. The government is not going to be in a position of ruling in, ruling out; and playing John Howard's miserable little political game. National Competition Policy: Privatisation",75
138,Mr GRIFFIN,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,My question is addressed to the Assistant Treasurer. Has he seen reports that the competition policy reforms which will be implemented shortly by the federal and state governments are encouraging state governments to privatise their businesses? Can he assure the House that these reforms provide no such encouragement to those state governments?,76
139,Mr GEAR,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I am aware of claims made by state politicians that they are being forced to privatise their utilities by competition policy. This is particularly true in Victoria, where the state government has decided to privatise the SEC. I can say that these claims are wrong. The Hilmer report and the legislation that will flow from it are silent on ownership. That is because ownership has nothing to do with promoting competition and realising its benefits. As an example we could point to the Commonwealth's policy on telecommunicatioris. Since we introduced competition to Telecom, the cost of a long distance phone call between Sydney and Melbourne has gone down by 21 per cent in the first year that Optus has been operating. For instance, there are packages that allow Australians to phone the world at a cost of $5 for five minutes, and all of this with 100 per cent public ownership of Telecom. Unlike the opposition, our approach is based on practical judgments about the public interest rather than ideology, and we will continue to make privatisation decisions on a case by case basis. We have heard claims that the privatisation of Victoria's electricity assets is being justified on the basis of competition policy. It seems nowadays that most decisions or a lot of decisions are made in the name of competition. If we contrast Victoria with New South Wales we see that they have introduced competition into electricity without a government sell off. Not only is there no encouragement to privatise from competition policy but also there is no encouragement by way of fmancial compensation from the Commonwealth. What a national competition policy will do is to make sure that, if state governments make a decision to sell their government enterprises for whatever reason, they are not sold as monopolies. We do not want public monopolies sold to be private monopolies as they were in Britain when Margaret Thatcher was the Prime Minister. Consumers are still paying for that policy. Finally, to suggest that competition policy forces privatisation on a government is· not only wrong, it is deceitful. Competition policy is being pursued for one reason and one reason only, and that is the massive benefits that will accrue to Australian businesses and moves to a national consumers. Concessional Medication",76
140,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Treasurer, I refer you to information received by the opposition showing that a proposal exists for a new contribution level for concessional medication. These are the scripts that pensioners get in pharmacies. I remind you that this item has the support of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Treasury and Finance. Is it a fact that to save $215 million in 1998-99 as you propose, given that there were 77 million concessional scripts written last year, the only way you can do that is to slug pensioners an extra $2.80 a script?",76
141,Mr WILLIS,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"-I think the status of this so called list that the opposition has been well and truly described by the Prime Minister as having no status, and that is exactly the position. It is absurd for us to get this array of questions about the government's plan to do this or that on the basis of some list which has no status. Let us get that absolutely clear: there is no plan to do all these things that the opposition are raising. These things are on a list which has no status. What we do know is that those opposite want to cut government expenditure very heaVily. They tell us all the time that that is what we should be doing. They say that, whatever the circumstances, we should be slashing government expenditure. When the economy was not growing, they said the answer was: cut government expenditure. When the economy is growing strongly and there is need to curb it, they say the answer is: just cut government expenditure. Whatever the circumstances, that is what they say should be done. They agree that it should be in the order of billions and billions of dollars. When the Business Council of Australia recently proposed that there should be a cut of $5 billion in outlays, the shadow minister for finance said that that illustrated the sort of savings that are available without any slash and burn. In other words, this seemed like a pretty good array of cuts. Let us have a look at that proposal. That involved 0.5 per cent efficiency dividend on all outlays, including the age pension, family allowances, unemployment benefits, all those things-cut everything by a half a per cent. 'That is okay. That is not slash and burn,' says the opposition finance spokesman, 'That is just a good, solid way to get some cuts.' Since the issue of health has been raised, the BCA proposed a saving of $1 billion from the introduction of a co-payment, a further $434 million to be saved from abolishing the general subsidy on pharmaceuticals with a safety net for those with a chronic illness. But the only way you get to those sorts of savings would be to abolish altogether the safety net for general patients. Again, that is not slash and burn, that just seems like sensible economics to the shadow minister for finance. It is incredibly hypocritical for those ite to be trying to make political capital out of some supposed array of expenditure cuts that the government has in mind from a list which has no status when they themselves are pursuing a course of saying that we should be cutting government expenditure heavily; endorsing proposals like those from the Business Council, which have obviously very severe implications on people in disadvantaged circumstances in this country.  order. I corrected by way of a personal explanation the suggestion that the coalition did not endorse the BCA proposal to the Prime Minister. The Treasurer is seeking to mislead the House in regard to my position.",76
142,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Order! There is no point of order. I hav- already said to members in this place that points of order should be taken in the appropriate way. The member for Forrest should listen very, very carefully. There are forms of this House that he can use if he believes that in some way what someone says in this place is not an accurate reflection of his views.",77
143,Mr WILLIS,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"-I quoted the member as saying, 'They illustrated the sorts of savings that are available without any slash and burn.' If that is not an implied endorsement, I do not know what is. Quite clearly, he thought they were in the right order and the right direction and they were the sorts of cuts that he could live with quite happily. We saw at the last election what the opposition really thought about appropriate cuts in government expenditure--the whole Fightback array, which we do not need to go through again now. That whole array of $10 billion in cuts was put to the Australian people by the opposition. The opposition seriously proposed ruling out unemployment benefits after nine months and all sorts of cuts for sole parents, disability pensioners, et cetera. It also proposed swingeing cuts in Medicare. All of those things were put to the Australian people at the last election. It is what the opposition really believes in. We can see it again in the endorsement of the Business Council; and it is incredibly hypocritical, and an enormous stench of hypocrisy comes from oppos- the opposition, when the opposition members seek to pursue us on expenditure cuts which they themselves think do not go far enough. They would like to do an enormous amount more than they see in any such list that they have dredged up from somewhere within the bowels of our bureaucracy . Workers Compensation",77
144,Mr TANNER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,My question is addressed to the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer the minister to changes or proposed changes to restrict access to benefits in the workers compensation schemes in various states. Could the minister advise the House of what financial impact this might have on the Commonwealth?,77
145,Mr JOHNS,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest and support in this debate. The Commonwealth is concerned about the restriction on the benefits of workers compensation now taking place in a number of states. We are concerned because, inevitably, it is injured workers who will bear the brunt of those cuts. But we are also concerned that a fair degree of cost shifting to the Commonwealth and, thereby, the taxpayer is taking place because of this diminution of benefits to workers in the states. The extent of that cost shifting is around $200 million per year. That is $200 million which the Commonwealth and the taxpayer pick up through social security and Medicare payments that ought to be paid for through workers compensation insurance schemes. Despite the fact that we find cost cutting still going on amongst the states, the states are not running schemes that are viable. In Victoria, even though the Kennett ernment has slashed workers' access to efits and increased the cost to employers, find that medical payments per claim continue to increase. In New South Wales the number of claims has increased by 10 per cent per year in recent years, with the result that premiums being collected now do not cover costs. In Tasmania and the Northern Territory the premiums being paid are no longer suffihas cient to meet their liabilities. In Queensland the cost of common law claim settlements has risen from $10 million in 1982-83 to $100 1994. million in 1993-94, or 39 per cent of the workers compensation bill. For the Commonwealth's part, next week I will be releasing a discussion paper on accessibility to common law. What is occurring amongst the states is a Dutch auction as they try to bring the costs of workers compensation down and base compensation almost purely on diminishing benefits to workers. The offer that the Commonwealth has made on a number of occasions is that the front Commonwealth, in conjunction with the states, set minimum national standards the states do not concentrate on cutting benefits to workers but get back to the proper business of workers compensation, which is about improved safety, rehabilitation, a quick return to work and improved productivity in the workplace. I again make the plea to the states that it is in their interests that they do not compete amongst themselves to cheapen the costs of labour by slashing benefits to workers but instead concentrate on the positive elements of workers compensation, to the benefit of workers. Children's Services Program",78
146,Mr TIM FISCHER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister explain the government's plans to cut the children's services program over the next four years, which includes child-care assistance and the child-care cash rebate? Does the Prime Minister prefer the proposal of his own department to cut spending in this area by $269 million, or the option of the Department of Finance to cut spending by $760 million?",78
147,Mr KEATING,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I can only say the same thing to the Leader of the National Party that govI said to the Leader of the Opposition. In bendoing so, I make this point about the we government's child care record: since 1983, child-care places have increased from 46,000 to 242,000. Another 25,000 places are planned for this year. The government is well on the way to meeting its commitment to work related demands for child care by the year 2000. Eligibility for child-care assistance become more generous, and the number of families receiving child-care assistance has increased from 49,000 in 1989 to 215,000 in Last year an accreditation scheme was introduced to improve the quality of child care, which is an issue of great importance. I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition-of course, he will now say anything at any time to suit himself-when asked if he was in favour of income testing the child-care rebate, said: We would never have introduced it in the form that the government did. The difference is we were upand honest. We said right at the beginning, you cannot have an open-ended approach to so that something like this. In fact, John Howard promised to introduce a child-care tax allowance for all families. That is a fact. Doesn't that make you pretty shabby? You were not up-front and honest; you were down the back and dishonest.",78

150,Mr KEATING,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,I have finished.,79
151,Mr QUICK,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"'-My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Apart from the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, this year also marks another important commemorative event-the 80th anniversary of the landings at Gallipoli. Given the obvious importance of the enduring legacy of the original ANZACs and the· bipartisan support shown in this week's passing of the ANZAC Day legislation, can the minister inform the House what plans the government has initiated to ensure that this important anniversary is appropriately commemorated?",79
152,Mr SCIACCA,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I particularly thank him because I think he may well be the only person in this House who is the child of a Gallipoli veteran. Maybe I am wrong, but I think that he is. Indeed, we are doing something for the 80th anniversary of Gallipoli, which will take place on 25 April this year. We intend to take nine young direct descendants of Gallipoli veterans to Turkey. I understand that the honourable member for Franklin will also be coming. Mr Bruce Scott-Oh, a junket.",79
153,Mr SCIACCA,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"He will be paying his own way, I might tell you. Don't you want to hear about this? Aren't you interested? If you keep quiet, I will tell you what it is all about. It is quite good, actually. There are about 400 veterans left but, because they are very oldthey are in their late 90s-we decided to send young people who are direct descendants of the veterans so that they could come back to Australia, act as young ambassadors and pass on the ANZAC tradition. There has been a fair bit of support for that. We arranged to have three people from each state and territory. Tomorrow I will be able to announce the names of those who will be lucky enough to go. The criteria will be that they will have to come back and speak to service clubs and Rotary clubs, et cetera. Mosf sections of the media accepted this, and I think everybody is quite happy with this youth angle of the whole project. The only person who was publicly against it was one guy called Michael Kroger. Do honourable Gallipoli members know him? On 3AW he was looking after the Mitchell program. It did not matter what I said to him, I just could not get it through to him that this was a good idea for youth. He just wanted to criticise it. At the end of the day, I thought, 'It doesn't really matter. What's the difference? You can't win them all.' At least he is not in here with that miserable attitude. My little multicultural friend Petro is here. Welcome to you, Petro!",79
154,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,Order! The minister will refer to members by their correct title.,79
155,Mr SCIACCA,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I am sorry-my friend. I mean that. He is a good bloke. He is better than the other bloke, I can tell you that. We are going to do something in regard to this matter. I think this is the right way of going about it. I am looking forward to making sure that those people will come back and bring that spirit with them. I am looking forward to having the honourable member for Franklin and the shadow minister join us on this very important occasion.",79
156,Mr HOWARD,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"On indulgence, I would like to quickly say on behalf of the opposition that we welcome the proposal of the minister. Anything that appropriately continues to honour the ANZAC landing and the ANZAC tradition will always have the utter support of the Liberal and National parties. Education",79
157,Dr KEMP,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Is it a fact that the Department of Finance and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet are proposing cuts in the programs covered by the Department of Employment, Education and Training which, in its fourth year, would total $2.2 billion? Do these cuts include: the removal of real growth for non-government schools of $99 million; cuts to future higher education places, saving $113 million; aligning Austudy to the Department of Social Security income test, saving $219 million; the abolition of employment subsidies for unemployed people under the national training wage; and a cutback in the number of unemployed people to be assisted under labour market programs, with that move alone saving the government $600 million? Has the minister been told of these cuts?",79
158,Mr CREAN,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"The only time the member for Goldstein actually gets up and asks me questions is when he is quoting from leaked documents. On the last occasion he quoted, it was from a doctored document. He went through it with little bits of white-out and produced a document which was not accurate. He has never been able to justify it. I will be interested to see this document, which I understand he is not prepared to table. I will have a very close look at it. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have already indicated that, at budget time, all sorts of proposals are prepared. They are prepared by ministers and by the Department of Finance. The Department of Finance in fact always prepares an extraordinary list. That is probably why it is not a very liked department. But the fact of the matter is that it is not the Department of Finance that makes the decisions for the government. And that point has already been made. It is the government, through the ERe process and the cabinet, that will make decisions about what goes into the budget. The list that was read out does not sound like something that we would be embracing in the process; it sounds more like something that you would propose. Look back at what you put forward in Jobsback. Were you proposing to support employment and training in this initiative? First of all, there was the commitment to Austrain. What was Austrain? There was no requirement to actually undertake training. It was a discounted rate. The discount got greater the longer the person had been out of work. What was that going to do to help people's self-esteem-going back into the workplace below minimum rates of pay? You made no commitment to training. You made no commitment to the long-term unemployed. You ridiculed what we had to say in Working Nation, the proposals we put forward with the compact and case management, and you were going to knock people off the dole after they had been on it for nine months. Quite apart from the labour market programs which the Prime Minister has referred to",80
159,Mr CREAN,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,That is true. Quite apart from the $300 million cuts,80
160,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Order! The minister will wait for a minute. The member for Sturt constantly interjects from his part of the chamber. I suggest that, if he wants to stay with us this afternoon for the remainder of question time, he not interject any more.",80
161,Mr CREAN,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"The Prime Minister has already referred to the $300 million cuts that were contained in Jobsback. That was before any of the Working Nation initiatives. Working Nation has committed $10.3 billion of expenditure over the next four years. In the forward estimates, we see a real commitment to ensuring that people not only get back into work but get training. There is also a real commitment to ensuring that we develop the skills of this nation. The fact of it remains that you, in terms of your policy prescription, were going to rely on economic growth alone. The experience of every recovery is that economic growth will not pick up the long-term unemployed. Our initiatives have. Of the 494,000 jobs created, 88,000 have gone to the long-term unemployed. It took five years-1983-89-to pick up that number. On the basis of your past performance, not only would you cut $300 million, but you would cut the swag of Working Nation apart. You have no commitment to helping the long-term unemployed, to genuine training or to employment growth. I dismiss the question that the member for Goldstein put forward. Let him put forward the document. I will be interested to have a look at it. But, based on his track record, you would have to look pretty carefully at anything he was proposing because he always gets it wrong. Ozone Layer",80
162,Mr GIBSON,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. Can the minister tell us what the government doing to implement the Montreal Protocol on move: Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer regarding the phasing out and destruction of halon and CFC gases in Australia?,81
163,Mr WALKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Australia is leading the world in taking action under the Montreal protocol to collect and safely destroy ozone damaging gases. Our success in dealing with halon-which is the most damaging of those gases-has won world acclaim, so much so that Australia is providing information and advice to other countries on how to manage their halon, which is contained in all those yellow fire extinguishers now being phased out. The National Halon Bank is now turning its attention to CFCs, which, as we all know, are also ozone depleting. Although there are no accurate figures on the amount of CFCs used in Australia we know that they are widely used, mostly in the air conditioning and refrigeration industries. As good corporate citizens, people in those industries have now set up a special fund to reclaim, recover, recycle and reprocess refrigeration which can be reused. These people· also encourage the safe storage and destruction of refrigerant gases, which cannot be recycled or reused. The halon bank is giving expert advice on the handling of ozone depleting CFC gases. An initial contract has been signed with the reclaim fund to collect, safely store and then destroy 50 tonnes of CFCs. Further contracts will be negotiated after this initial collection is completed. The world pioneering plascon technology, which Australia has developed to destroy halon, can also be used to destroy the CFCs question time. safely. I think Australians should be proud that we are the first country to put into practice a national strategy to withdraw and safely destroy CFCs. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders",81
164,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER," Mr Speaker, I seek leave to That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith that the Prime Minister explain why he has been parading around the country and in the parliament claiming there would be no need for big cuts in expenditure and for demanding that the coalition releases a list of spending cuts when all the time, his government was drawing up a Labor hit list which amounts to $21 billion over four years.",81

185,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"We'll pick it up in two weeks time. Give him a valium, Mr Speaker, he needs it.",82
186,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Resume your seat! Order! We have established that the government has not given leave.,82
187,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith that the Prime Minister explain why he has been parading around the country and in the parliament claiming there would be no need for big cuts in expenditure and for demanding that the coalition releases a list spending cuts when all the time, his government was drawing up a Labor hit list which amounts $21 billion over four years. It is important that the standing orders suspended because the debate that is going at the present time is not about the need fiscal responsibility, it is not about the need for spending cuts, it is about one thing one thing alone: it is about the credibility the current Prime Minister of Australia. What monster. we have witnessed over the last 12 monthsand we are seeing another example as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gathers his papers-is his part-time occupancy of the opposite office of Prime Minister. Once again, scuttles from the parliament. Let us say, 'Goodbye, Paul.' Opposition members-Bye, Paul.",82
188,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"We are very pleased as he the goes out of the parliament. Can I just say you, Mr Speaker: it demonstrates very clearly one thing-the charge being made by the opposition is a charge that has not only honesty landed home but that also resonates around the Australian community with the Australian people. What we have had over the last 12 months is a very concerted campaign by the government. Whenever the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), or anybody in the business community, calls for expenditure restraint, do you know what the response of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) has been? Every time their response has been, 'Anybody who advocates more spending cuts is a heartless, insensitive, brutal, out-of-touch Australian.' As far as the government is concerned if you cut government spending any further, to quote the words of the Treasurer, 'you are ripping the structure out of basic programs.' Let me say, so there will be no fear of contradiction and it will even be beyond the misrepresentative powers of the Prime Minister, that we have consistently argued for spending cuts. The difference between us and them is that we have come clean. Members of the government have lied and deceived. That is the difference. In the process, they have of earned themselves the description not of the true believers but of the true deceivers. to Throughout the last 12 months, they have tried to spin the line-and the member for be Lilley (Mr Swan), the member for Charlton on (Mr Robert Brown) and the Treasurer have all for done it, one after the another-that you do not need any further expenditure restraint and and that anybody who cuts spending further is of either a lunatic or a heartless, insensitive That is basically what they have said, so the debate in front of us is a very simple debate. It is a very simple debate that members will understand. It is all about truth he and credibility-no wonder the Prime Minister is absent from the debate-because we have said all along, as we know it to be the case, that there needs to be a reduction in budget deficit and we support a reduction to in the budget deficit. We have argued all along that there ought to be cuts in government spending. We have had the consistency, and sense of responsibility to say that. By contrast, this mob opposite have pretended that further spending cuts are unnecessary. They have misled the Australian people into believing that it cannot be done. They hav:e labelled anybody from the Business Council through to the opposition as being irresponsible if they ask for those spending cuts. Yet now, forced with the very chaotic situation which the government is now facing, the- inevitably have been driven to do the very thing that we said all along had to be done, and that is to have a look at expenditure cuts. The Australian people are entitled to ask the government, and they are entitled to ask of the Prime Minister: why is it that over a period of 12 or 18 months the government has so deliberately misled the Australian people? A classic example of that deception is to be found in the child-care cash rebate. This was a child-care measure that was introduced by the government in the Prime Minister's policy speech at the time of the election. It was an open-ended subsidy towards some of the surplus costs of child care-an attractive measure in its own right. Any measure of that kind is attractive in its own right. It was open-ended. It was not subject to a means test. The difference between the government and the opposition, once again, is that the opposition from the word go told the truth about that measure and the government from the word go refused to tell the truth about that measure. What the government said from the very beginning about that measure was that it is absolutely unrealistic to have a child-care subsidy that is available to people on family incomes of $400,000 or $500,000 a year. Inevitably, the government has been forced to face the reality that that kind measure can no longer be afforded by the Australian people. The difference, once again, is that the government refused to tell the truth-whereas the opposition, from the very beginning, quite openly and quite candidly told it as it really was. There is a very simple reason why question after question has been asked of the government about this Labor Party hit list of $21 billion of spending cuts-that is, to drive home to the Australian people the measure of the deceit of this Prime Minister and of this government. That is the reason why. You cannot hope to persuade the Australian people that you are really trustworthy, honest and fair dinkum if on the one hand you say, 'No more spending cuts are necessary; anybody who advocates them is insensitive and really a deficit dalek and a person who is heartless to the true needs of the Australian people,' and in the next breath commission the officers of your department to draw up a list of $21 billion of spending cuts over a of period of four years. That is the kernel of this debate. It goes right to the heart of the credibility and the trustworthiness of the current Prime Minister of Australia. That is what it is about. And there is nothing more important in government than the capacity of the Australian people to believe what they are told by their leaders. If ever a man has dishonoured his office in last terms of deceiving the Australian people-if ever a man has demonstrated a capacity to say or do anything in order to win a grubby vote, to say or do anything to stay in office, to say or do anything to misrepresent the policies of· his opponents-it is the current Prime Minister of Australia. Paul Keating comes into this parliament and talks about scare campaigns! The gall and the nerve of the man-the man who can get up in parliament without so much as a blush day after day and allege proposals of the opposition that do not even exist and go through the whole of the last election campaign deceiving and misrepresenting the policies of the coalition. He claims that there are proposals being prepared by the opposition which do not even exist. If ever there was monumental gall, of open-ended deceit and cheek",82
189,Unknown,PRIME MINISTER,Government members interjecting,83
190,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! Those on my right.,83
191,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"All the time he is attacking us about proposals that do not exist, all the time he is saying that no more reductions in government spending are necessary, he is quietly saying to Finance and Treasury, '$15 billion is not enough, get it up to $16 billion, get it up to $17 billion, get it up to $18 billion, get it up to $21 billion.' That is what this debate is about. It is not about the need for spending cuts; it is about the need for the Prime Minister of Australia to tell the truth.",83
192,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PRIME MINISTER,"I second the motion. The reason I am seconding this motion to suspend standing orders is that we need to discuss these proposals the government will be considering and we need to expose the hypocrisy of some of these proposals in light of comments that have come out over the last two years from the government. To back up my case of why standing orders should be suspended I am going to give five examples from this list and give them some light of day. I am going to talk about concessional pharmacy, about discretionary drugs, about pharmaceutical allowances, about waiting lists and about home and community care. Mr Snowdon-What list?",84
193,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The member for Northern Territory is not in his correct position.,84
194,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PRIME MINISTER,"I am sorry, you're too junior to see it; only the big guys have seen it. Concessional pharmacy is a proposal to save $215 million in 1988-89. Concessioilal pharmacy is what pensioners get: they have to pay only $2.60 a script. There were 77 million concessional pharmacy scripts last year, and the only way you can save $215 million is to slug pensioners an extra $2.80 every time they get a script. That is going to be a very popular idea out in the marginal electorates. In· the last election, letters around such as the one I have here from the member for Petrie (Mr Johns), which said: Families and the elderly and the chronically under Dr Hewson will end up paying more and getting less. That is just what they are getting here. They are are paying more and they are getting second area is discretionary pharmacy. This is very interesting because no-one has ever heard of discretionary drugs before; this something totally new. Members opposite should listen to this. I phoned a couple pharmacists this morning and asked, 'What are discretionary drugs?' and they said, 'We have never heard of it.' So I phoned someone on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and he said, 'We got a letter from the minister in December, but we didn't what it meant so we wrote back to her ahd asked her to explain. We haven't heard from her yet.' I have to say, going on past exp-rience, it will be waiting a while. : I spoke to a number of pharmacists and-he only discretionary drug they can comel up with is the oral contraceptive pill. If you want to put a tax on women of child-bearing age, that is a great way to do it. I remember what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in1the last election about that. In a speech on 22 February 1993, he said: Dr Hewson would make it more expensive to be a woman. You can't get much more unfair than that. On our list we know who supports and who does not support these proposals. Let me tell you that when it comes to discretionary drugs there is a tick from PM&C. The third issue that needs to be talked about here is the pharmaceutical allowance. That is the allowance that allows pensioners to be compensated for the amount they are slugged. There is going to be $68 million saved for that if this proposal is taken up. It has got support from all the three major departments. Waiting lists is the fourth area. Do you remember during the last election that waiting lists were a bit of a problem? 'So we'll throw $100 million at it. We won't know how we'll do it, but we'll throw the money there.' What happened after the election? We find that there is a proposal not just to slash but to take came away all of the money for the waiting list proposal. It is very interesting because I have another letter here-the Labor Party sent out ill a lot of letters in the last election-from Senator Michael Beahan: We think Medicare can be improved ... and we going to expand resources to public hospitals to less. The help reduce waiting lists. If this proposal, which is supported by all the three major departments, is taken up, that is is another broken promise. The final issue is home and community care. The proposal, as of is supported by all the three major departments, is to take $36 million out of that care. I rang my ministerial colleague in Victoria and asked what that reduction would mean. You would be interested to know what I was told: it would bean eight per cent cut. That know would mean we could not provide HACC to the growth areas-that is, the electorates of th- member for MCMillan (Mr Cunningham) ami the member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland). I am sure they will be happy to know why that cannot be achieved. I These issues have to be debated openly and honestly. I sat here two months ago and listened to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) bucket the Victorian government for looking at cuts. She said: ... I feel a deep sense of responsibility to draw this to the attention of the public ... Well, so do I, and that is why standing orders should be suspended.",84
195,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"This debate demonstrates how far the opposition is from government. Despite the fact that the opposition has put the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) ih the witness protection program to give him a new name, new face, new policy and new identity, he cannot escape his history in this regard because he, of all the opposition members, ought to understand the budgetary process. I will explain it to the opposition because, over years of budget deliberations, I have seen very few new savings options circulating amongst the bureaucracy. The budget process is simple. Ministers put up their bids, their offerings of savings. The central agenciesthat is, Prime Minister and Cabinet, Treasury and Finance-put up their sets of suggestions about how far you ought to go or whatever it is you ought to do or might like to contemplate as ministers. When that is all finished, when the departments have all had their go at it, a presentation is made to government. The vast bulk of spending and saving proposals get knocked off in the various processes they go throughfrom direct meetings with individual portfolio ministers, the ERC and, ultimately, to budget cabinet. That is all there is to it. There is virtually no suggestion circulating around the bureaucracy which, in one form or another, has not come up at some time or another in the last decade as a proposition for savings options, and of course the bulk of them do not get picked up. Whatever it is the opposition thinks it has the opposition thinks it has added it up to $5 billion to $10 billion per annum-at least it has some idea what cuts of $5 billion to $10 billion per annum in outlays as a result of that process might cost. That might give it some pause for thought for its habit of the last three or four months of rocking around the country and saying, 'Don't look at anything on the revenue side as you pare back your budget; look only on the outlay side to the tune of $5 billion to $10 billion.' If the opposition is in the process of being educated as to the common sense of that, that is a plus for us all and will be very useful. If it has been educated, it will have relearned a certain lesson that its leader, when Treasurer, learned a very long time ago. In the context of this debate, I find this quote of the opposition leader, now in the witness protection program, very useful: Some might argue that the Government could have achieved greater restraint in expenditure. Further savings could have been achieved by an actual cut in the money level of benefits such as pensions and family allowances. But we were not prepared to place a disproportionately large burden upon the recipients of such benefits ... Therefore, to achieve our deficit target, it was necessary to raise substantial additional revenue ... In the final analysis, the Government decided, as an element of this revenue-raising effort, to increase the standard rate of personal income tax as a temporary measure. Those remarks were made by the then treasurer, now Leader of the Opposition, in the budget debate that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had occasion to refer to today and that Tim Colebatch refers to in the article in today's Age. In the process of that budget, having made solemn undertakings to the electorate three or four months before, that coalition government introduced a whacking great-in today's dollar terms-$10 billion worth of tax. That is what this exponent of honesty and decency with the electorate was capable of producing at that point in time. He stands on a record like that but has the hide to come into this chamber and offer criticism of the Prime Minister on his alleged integrity in relation to the electorate. It is no wonder that he has been put in the witness protection program when we see a record like that before which we are also supposed to bow. But he did get one thing right, and he got an understanding very solidly in his mind when he was Treasurer-an understanding which he has subsequently lost: that is, if you are going to go through the process of sensible adjustment of the budget it is virtually impossible to do that solely on the expenditure side. If the opposition has at least learnt that, then that is a very positive thing to come out of this exercise. On that occasion he also said this in the course of the debate: It would have been foolish for the government to have closed off any options available to it in advance of the budget. That is his statement about what ought to be the responses of ministers. Mr Horne-That is Honest John-he said that.",85
196,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"Honest John said that. In a set of debates and questions in this place he is now inviting the government to go around doing precisely the opposite from that which was his advice to treasurers at the time when he had responsibility. He had two pieces of advice for treasurers which, since he entered the witness protection program, he has chosen to forget. One piece of advice was that if you are going to be a prudent and humane manager of the economy you address both sides of fiscal policy when a budget comes down. The second piece of advice was that if you are a competent government and people put up speCUlation before you about what is to be considered, you tell them to take off; that the government will give all these things due consideration and, at the end of the day, arrive at sensible conclusions.",86
197,Mr CADMAN,PRIME MINISTER,Choking on your words?,86
198,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"I do choke on these words, I have to say, given the origins of them. It is no surprise, I suppose, that I should do that. We have a situation now where the government is not going through some panic exercise addressing the economic needs of this country. We have a very good economy at the moment. We have a situation which any government would be pleased to address: that is, a requirement on government to adjust fiscal policy to deal with the f<¢t that it has slightly greater than expected growth. All it requires is a certain amount of sdnsible manipulation of that fiscal policy in order to get that back on track; to ensure that there is a decent performance by national saving in the course of the next couple of years to take pressure off the difference between national expenditure and our growth rate which is of itself placing some pressurenot the only source of pressure---on interest rates. What do the Australian people want? They want jobs. They want the certainty that they have an opportunity in those jobs to get productivity based wage rises. They want affordable interest rates. They have interest rates now on housing at a level that, in the whole time of John Howard's treasurership, they never fell below. These are things worth sustaining. If, from time to time, it is necessary to adjust fiscal policy to ensure that they are all sustained, this is what a competent government does. This government has done it with far more integrity than was ever managed to be achieved by the opposition when it had the opportunity. A great deal has been said about l-a-w, law. What happened to l-a-w, law, on the tax changes put in place by this government? What happened was that for low to middle income earners they were delivered in to to. Mr Elliott-Seven months early.",86
199,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"Seven months early. The subsequent changes, most of which fell into higher income brackets, were not delivered immediately; they were put back for further consideration in this budget. For some 2Y2 years now the average Australian punter has been experiencing the benefit of those tax changes. How long did they get the benefit of the tax changes put into l-a-w, law, by John Winston Howard when he was Treasurer of the country? Six months! They got them for six months and then they lost them. Imposed on top of that they received something like $10 billion, in today's terms, of taxation arrangements. When it comes to knowing how to put in a budget, this government knows how to do it. We went through the agony of massive expenditure cuts during the 1980s. As a result of that, we do not face the same sorts of tasks Sinclair, 1. MCC. in this budget that we faced in those budgets, as we dealt in the 1980s with the consequences of the profligacy of John Winston Howard as Treasurer of this nation. Fortunately, we do not confront that. So we, thank you very much, will go about it at our own pace, determining what the budget ought to be. We will not take hypocritical cant from the opposition as to what particular strategies we ought to adopt. Above all, we will not be responding to documents that have absolutely no status whatsoever in our own discussions.",86

That statement of the Prime Minister is manifestly incorrect. There are numerous articles that I wrote, both in the Sunday Telegraph and in speeches that I have made from the very beginning, describing it in my words then as obscene that a family with a household income of $400,000 a year could have access to this rebate yet a single income household on $40,000 a year by comparison had less than half the amount that was available to that high income family. So, once again, the Prime Minister has been a true deceiver. NA Australian Insignia",88
210,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"At an earlier stage today I had occasion with a number of my colleagues to attend a meeting in the Main Committee room with Mr F. W. de Klerk. I noticed that in that room there are no insignia designating that it is Australian. There is neither a coat of arms nor are there any flags. Could I submit to you that, in circumstances where it is used for functions of that character, it would be appropriate that some Australian insignia were there. I believe that both the Australian coat of arms and an Australian flag in each corner at the front of the Main Committee room would be appropriate as permanent features of that room. Could I put to you that you look at that?",88

216,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Well, ifl can just preface it. Ronald Biggs is a bank robber who bashed over the head somebody who died. He is a man who took the savings of individuals and thieved, and I would ask youMr Horne--This is pointing out the similarities.",88

241,Mr SCIACCA,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-On 14 August 1994, at the Australian War Memorial, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) launched Australia Remembers 1945-1995. That launch signalled the commencement of 12 months of activities designed to commemorate and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War on 15 August 1945. As a nation, we have constantly honoured those Australian men and women who have fought and died to preserve and enhance the fundamental freedoms, lifestyle and values we cherish. With the backing of the parliament, and with the full support of the Australian people, the government has, over recent years, sponsored or significantly assisted with significant commemorative events aimed at reinforcing in the minds of all Australians but especially those younger Australians who have been fortunate enough to have no direct experience of war-the debt which is owed to ex-service men and women. By way of example, there was the 1990 pilgrimage to GaUipoli by a large group of First World War veterans to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the landing at ANZAC Cove; the dedication in 1992 of the Australian Vietnam Forces Memorial on ANZAC Parade; a pilgrimage to the Western Front in 1993 to coincide with the 75th anniversary of the end of the First World War; and, of course, the emotion charged interment of the unknown December Australian soldier on Remembrance Day 1993. Now, in 1995, our commitment is to ensuring that the sacrifices made by Australians during the six years of the Second World War are properly recalled and recorded. As the Prime Minister said at the launch: The focus will be on Australia and Australians. will remember all those who lost their lives and those who lost the ones they loved. We will remember those who served at home in factories and on farms. We will also remember those who came from war torn Europe to make their lives here, and who by doing so made all our lives so much richer. The government's objective is to see that the Australia Remembers program reaches all parts of the country. If there was ever a single moment in Australia's history when virtually every man, woman and child-no matter whether they lived in the city, the suburbs or the bush-were united in a common voice and thought, it was at the end of the Second World War-or, perhaps better expressed, at the beginning of peace. It is important that all Australians have an opportunity to take part in this program, to unlock dormant family and community histories so that a young generation of today can understand and appreciate the contribution of a young generation of 50 years ago. In an effort to achieve this, the government has put in place a structure which provides management of the program at national, state and regional levels. Much of my time energy, and that of members of my staff, going into Australia Remembers. I am supthose ported in this by a task force established within the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and by a ministerial advisory committee comprising representatives of relevant departleave ments and agencies and ex-service organisareflected, tions. State and territory committees have been established in each capital city to nate a program of activities throughout the year for those capitals. Unlike my staff, and those departmental officers engaged in this program, those chairwar ing and working on the state committees doing so on a voluntary basis, and are putting in an enormous amount of work. There are clearly too many individuals to thank but, with the indulgence of the House, I would like to place on record the parliament's pictured. appreciation for the work of the state chairmen: the Lord Mayor of Hobart, Alderman Doone Kennedy; Richard Fidock, in South Australia; Keith Mattingley, in Western Australia; Bob Alford, in the Northern TerriWe tory; Ian Meikle, in the ACT; Frank Conroy, in New South Wales; and Tony Beddison, chairman of the Victorian committee. Mr Bradford-What about Queensland?",90
242,Mr SCIACCA,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am the chairman in Queensland, so there is no point in thanking myself. As members are well aware, Australia Remembers committees have been established within each of the 147 federal electorates. Members have been asked to oversee the development of activities within their electorates, and each of them has my personal thanks for the enthusiastic and sincere way in which they and their staff have approached this task. I know, too, that a great many people within members' electorates have volunteered their services to support the Australia Remembers program. Again, I could not hope to name them all, but I would ask that members pass on my thanks and appreciation, that of the government and, I am confident, that of the ex-service community in whose honour we are making these efforts. Expanding on my introductory comments, for the aims of those working on Australia Remembers are to thank the veterans who fought and in World War II; commemorate those who is died; recognise the widows and children of who died; remember all who kept the home front running; recreate the joy felt at the end of the war in the best way possible; educate the nation about World War II and a lasting legacy. Many of those aims are I believe, in the logo which we have designed for this year. Its centrepiece is a coordiphotograph of Private 'Ray' Walsh being reunited with his wife, Varlie, and two of his children after more than 5Y:z years' overseas service-nearly four of them as a prisoner of in Europe. We can clearly recognise the are joy evident in the reunion. We can only speculate about the harshness and difficulties of those years for both Ray and Varlie. Most of us can only guess at the gap in the lives of those two children and the other three not Mr Deputy Speaker, imagine the impact on each of us if we were to be told that, from tomorrow, we would not see our children, our partners or our friends until the year 2001. That experience must change people's lives. Yet, for all that, there is a fundamental optimism captured in that logo photo, a sense of better things to come. In support of the aims I have enunciated, the government has approved a program the following main elements. The first is conduct of a number of national ceremonies. Already, a major commemorative service has been held in Western Australia to recall sinking of the HMAS Sydney-the single greatest tragedy Australia has experienced in its territories, with all 645 sailors and aboard perishing. Others in prospect include services in February for Australian prisoners of war and for merchant mariners into mark VE Day in May; and to commemorate and celebrate VP Day in August. The year's major commemorations, for VE and VP days, promise to be spectaculars. They will be held in Canberra and Brisbane respecal tively. I have mentioned before in this House the historical basis for the use of 'VP Day', 'VJ Day'. Examples abound of the universality of the expression dating from August 1945. VP Day was the common terminology used at the time by the Australian government, media, and in the armed forces, as well as by King George VI. VP Day was gazetted offiI cially by the Australian government in 1945 as a prescribed holiday to celebrate victory the Pacific War. But at the end of the day, expression used is peripheral to the event being celebrated, and I do not engage further in a debate which distracts from that anniversary. Under the national program of events, support has been or will be given to a diverse range of other activities. Beating Retreat Port Arthur on 28 January received funding under the Australia Remembers program. ex-servicewomen's reunion in Darwin in June and the 'Back to the Track' convoy of historof ic military vehicles to Darwin in August will be supported. Financial assistance will also given to an event to recognise the wartime role of Pacific Islander people. This will be held in Townsville in August. Complementing these events in Australia will be three overseas pilgrimages by veterans to significant theatres of war. In Maya small group of nine veterans, ambassadors representing Australian veterans of each of the services, the merchant marine and prisoners of war will travel by commercial airliner to with London for VE Day commemorations and the celebrations. That pilgrimage will include stopovers in North Africa, Greece and Crete. In June up to 140 veterans will return to the Papua New Guinea on board the Mikhail Sholokov. Travelling by ship from Sydney will enable port visits to Brisbane, Lae, Milne airmen Bay, Oro Bay and Port Moresby. Arrangements can be made for visits to most of the major battle sites in which Australians were March; so desperately engaged in 1942-43. In July a third pilgrimage involving about 20 to 25 veterans will be mounted to Borneo. A key element of this pilgrimage will be to take part in the handover of the RSL MemoriPark at Sandakan to the Sabah Government, but the itinerary will also encompass visits to Jakarta, Balikpapan, Tarakan, Kota not Kinabalu, Labuan, Brunei and Singapore. Members will see advertisements in the national press in the near future describing the process for veterans to apply for these pilthe grimages. This may generate many queries from veteran constituents to members' offices. will circulate information about the process, selection and itineraries of the pilgrimages in directly to members to assist with responding the to these queries, but should members need further information they should feel free to intend to contact my office staff. A range of government departments is also contributing towards the success of the national calendar. Since the inception of the Australia Remembers program, the Department of at Defence has been an enthusiastic supporter. As its other commitments allow, Defence will An provide assistance with transport, music, ceremonial guards, and assets over the course the year. I wish to place on the record my thanks to the Minister for Defence (Senator be Robert Ray), the Secretary to the Department of Defence, the Chief of the Defence Force and the heads of the three armed services for their understanding and strong support. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy has developed a display, to be launched by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) in late March, on the Women's Land Army. This will be exhibited at the War Memorial and will then be available to move around the country. Together with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, my department is looking to find surviving uniformed and nonuniformed indigenous veterans, and is looking at an appropriate commemorative ceremony to recognise the special-and often unacknowledged-role played by these people in the defence of Australia. The Speaker has written to me recently to advise that he and the President of the Senate will jointly fund an exhibition which reflects the life and times of the parliament during those long and difficult years. In recent discussions, it has been decided that a separate Australia Remembers display will be arranged in the marble foyer. For that cooperation, may I thank the Speaker. Might I also thank the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), because it was his idea in the first place. The Department of Employment, Education and Training has come up with an extremely innovative and exciting initiative which complements the Australia Remembers program, builds on our cultural heritage program, and gives some unemployed Australians valuable work experience. Using the new work opportunities program, the government will provide a number of unemployed persons with the opportunity of assisting with the refurbishment of many of the nation's ageing war memorials, as well as creating or rejuvenating remembrance driveways and memorials. The Department of Communications and the Arts is compiling a CD-ROM on Australia Remembers, and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) has allocated moneys through the projects of national significance program to assist with national play writing competition. The aim is to find a play suitable for use in high schools which reflects our proud Second World War heritage while relating to the values of today's young generation. It is important that many educational legacies come out of this year. It is important that we do not forget our history. It is important that we do not forget what makes us Australian. Many other departments are assisting us and I will give them appropriate recognition as the year goes on. The second element is the provision of seeding funding for activities agreed by each of the state capital committees. Each of these committees has now finalised a major program of events for the coming year. In each capital, heavy emphasis will be placed on appropriate recognition of VE Day and VP Day. The activities planned are diverse, but reasonably common elements include commemorative wreath laying, ecumenical church services, street parades, victory ball re-enactments and concerts which reflect the music of the era. More information will be distributed in coming weeks by my office. The third element involves the provision of seeding money for use by regional Australia Remembers committees. To date, I have received bids for assistance from almost all of the 147 federal members of parliament, and I know that the remainder are on their way. As with the state committee bids, there is some commonality in the initiatives being developed, but there is also considerable individuality. Members have received advice recently on the process which is to be applied in approving bids for funding assistance, and the mechanism for making payments. The national Australia Remembers task force is currently evaluating all bids, and members should expect to receive advice on the outcome very soon. I am advised that on the basis of preliminary consideration few, if any, proposals would fall outside the criteria set for funding assistance. The fourth major element of the program relates to government support for unit reunions and unit histories. Without being unduly pessimistic, the government recognises a that 1995 could be the last major opportunity for significant gatherings of those having taken part in the 1939-45 war. It also recognises the need to encourage those who took part to share their recollections. Understandably, this is proving to be a very popular initiative. Under agreed guidelines, unit reunions are generally supported to a maximum of $3,000, and assistance with publication of histories to a maximum of $5,000. To date, over 50 requests for contributions towards the costs of reunions have been agreed and something like another 60 are awaiting determination. Around 25 bids in respect of unit histories are presently being assessed. In March I expect to be releasing details about a fifth element of the program: the issue of certificates of appreciation on or around VP Day to World War II veterans and to those who served or contributed at home. My intention, subject to consultation with colleagues in this chamber, is to ask members to maintain a register of applications within their electorate offices and to issue the From the outset, a fundamental objective has been to raise public awareness of the events of 1939-1945 and of the significance of the 50th anniversary of the end of that war. All of the activities outlined above will play a part in raising consciousness. All of them, I hope, will be educative. But in a slightly aggressive way, as part of a sixth element of the program, we have set out to win the cooperation of the Australian media in embracing the concepts underlying Australia Remembers and in promoting human interest and educational material bearing on the anniversary. Not surprisingly, we are receiving this support in spades. Newspapers throughout the country are running stories under the Australia Remembers logo. There are features in the major dailies and colour pieces in the Advocate in Ayr, the Mandurah Telegraph and the Naracoorte Herald. Every day the coverage is increasing. The television networks are swinging strongly behind Australia Remembers. Already, hours of news footage have been devoted to functions which have taken place in far-flung parts of the land. Channel 7 and Channel 9, with cooperation from the Australian War Memorial, are producing community service announcements for screening throughout the year. Film Australia is producing for the Department of Veterans' Affairs a series of short announcements which it is hoped will get to television outlets throughout regional Australia. I am already aware that major documentaries are being developed for screening on or around VE Day and VP Day, and this is sure to be but a small component of what is in store. The department is also having produced a series of short radio programs which will run throughout much of this year on a significant number of commercial radio stations across the country. Stations such as Sydney's 2UE have indicated that Australia Remembers will be a major theme for them in 1995. The seventh and final major element of the program-not unrelated to raising public awareness-is the development of an education kit for every primary and secondary certificates. school in Australia. This I regard as one of the most important projects being undertaken this year. One of the major reasons that so much money and effort is being expended on this commemorative year is that today's schoolchildren know so little of the threat that Australia was under 50 years ago. This is not a criticism of them; it is not a criticism of the education system. How vast, how rapid, how bewildering have been the changes of the last 50 years? We learned by rote, from the blackboard, through hours poring over books. Our children now access information through computers; they learn and play through CD-ROM technology which itself is likely to be obsolete in just a few years. We might have spent Saturday aftemoonsabsorbing movies such as The Dam Busters and Sink the Bismarck and other black and white depictions of that war. Our children have a considerably different range of tastes in the videos which they select and view in their own homes. Few of them have direct experience of mothers or fathers who have been involved in war. And, correctly, few of them would have grown up contemplating a threat to their future safety. The last 'televised' war, the Gulf War, was a world away, in an almost 'unknown' country, and the images were almost those of computer warfare with which our young are familiar and, it seems to me, sadly, comfortable. Yet now we are asking them to make sense of images of young Australians in khaki shorts dying in the deserts of North Africa, or the jungle of New Guinea and the islands; in fur-lined leathers over Europe or steamy cockpits north of Darwin; or in wet weather gear in the Atlantic or tropical kit on a off the Philippines. What can they possibly make of rationing; of blackouts; of mothers quietly weeping; of the prospect of foreign invasion? That is the job which has been assigned the Ryebuck Media Company, which has been contracted to produce kits for schools. In brief, the school kits will contain a video a variety of printed curriculum material picking up five major themes: 'All in', which provides an overview of Australia's involvement in the Second World War; 'Remembering the dead', which will include casualty lists and case studies; 'Voices from a war', which stresses the variety of experiences of the ordinary Australians caught up in the war; 'After the war is over', which focuses on impact of world peace and the variety of challenges faced by Australians put their lives back together; and 'Remembering the living', which will provide students with strategies for investigating the personal experiences of war in their local communities. The kits will be launched nationally will be in schools before VE Day. I know that members have shown considerable interest the kits, and I urge each member in this House, in discussing Australia Remembers, to emphasise the importance of this element the program. To build upon the education kit I am proposing to conduct a series of Australia Remembers youth forums throughout the country. The first round of capital city youth forums will be run in March, while the second round of regional youth forums will be held in April. This process will national Australia Remembers youth forum and move: being held in Brisbane in August in the leadup to VP Day. The forums are intended to help a young generation of today understand a young generation of 50 years ago. This process will help the youth of today appreciate the importance of the freedom which was won for them 50 years ago. It will help them realise that the or torch of freedom won for them in August 1945 is now being passed to them-it is being entrusted to them to protect. But to protect ship something you have first to understand its essence-understand its origins-and that is at the heart of Australia Remembers. The symbolism of the passing of the freedom torch from one generation to another is in fact the key to the national Australia to Remembers ceremony to be conducted in Brisbane on 15 August. It is being designed as a lasting moment which will be recalled by and successive generations of Australians long after this commemorative year is over. In conclusion, I would like to state my thanks to the Australian War Memorial, which is probably one of this country's finest institutions. Its resources have been stretched to the limit as a result of this program. They have been fantastic. I ask honourable members to the remember and understand that, particularly when they are out there asking for some help struggling to in capital financing. I thank my own department which has been stretched to the limit and, I can assure you, never realised that life under me was going to be like this. I also thank in particular the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the and honourable member for O'Connor, who gave enthusiastic and bipartisan support for this in program, and restate my thanks to all members from all sides of the House and my colleagues in the Senate for the way in which of they have embraced Australia Remembers with such gusto and commitment. By year's end, this parliament will be able to look back with pride on the way it has been able to mark this very important moment in Australia's short history. I presentthe following paper: Australia Remembers 1945-1995-Ministerial lead to a statement, 9 February 1995. That the House take note of the paper.",91
243,Mr TUCKEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"O'Connor) (5.06 p.m.}-On behalf of the coalition, I would firstly like to endorse the remarks of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), particularly in relation to all those people he identified for special thanks, and to add to his remarks the thanks of the members of the coalition. I also welcome the minister's comments on VJ-VP Day. He said that the controversy between the use of those two indicators should 'not distract us from commemorating and celebrating that anniversary' and, might I add, that most important anniversary. Nevertheless, I would like to say with the best of goodwill that the minister's decision to raise the issue of VJ-VP Day in question time recently was probably the one low point of his otherwise excellent management of the Australia Remembers program. I understand that there might be some principles that might demand such a response but I am glad that he has now put the issue to bed. The facts are that in certain sections of the community very strong views are held on this issue. But, irrespective of the strength of those views, I hold strongly to the opinion that the minister has now expressed that they should not distract us from commemorating and celebrating the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. As a further example of my commitment in this area, I draw briefly to the attention of House the fact that other forms of public comment have arisen-for instance, imputing, amongst other things, improper motives for this celebration. This has caused certain people to express their concern to me. My response to them has been to advise that I have no evidence of such motives. But, notwithstanding that, neither I nor they should be distracted from the high principles associated with this year of commemoration. I can assure the minister that that will continue to be our position. The minister will perform to the highest level of his responsibility in this year, I am sure. He can do so without any fear that the coalition will seek to exploit minor areas of dispute either between our parties or within the community. Put simply, the commemoration of the deaths of approximately 40,000 people, the wounding of some 67,000 people, the internment of over 30,500 people and the nearly one million-in fact, 992,600-service personnel who left our shores or fought against attacks on Australian soil, including the many civilians killed or injured from such attacks who fought in that fashion to protect our values, is just too important for anyone to desire to descend to minor issues. The coalition endorses the government's program of pilgrimages and the involvement of the veteran community in those pilgrimages. Again, whilst some may be disappointed if they are not selected, the coalition recognises that cost constraints do apply and that funds must be stretched to the many commemorative activities proposed. I wish to also comment on the involvement of the Australian parliament and welcome the minister's advice of the support that the Presiding Officers propose. I thank him for recognising my involvement in that. The Australian parliament has a diverse, rich and a sometimes surprising history of involvement during World War II. I trust the Presiding Officers intend to address all aspects of that history. The direct involvement and heroism of members and parliamentary staff, past and present, should receive substantial exposure. the Whilst I do not want to be exclusive and I recognise the many people whom I could refer to, I think it is of great interest to us all, and probably not to the knowledge of all, that a previous Clerk of the House of Representatives between 1937 and 1955, Frank Clifton Green, won a Military Cross. That cross and his other medals hang in the clerks' office to this day. That is just an example of something of which we might not all be aware. But the list is long of people from both sides of the House who lost their lives, or who came to this parliament after their military service, or who were prisoners of warTom Uren is an example. I believe the parliament should pay great attention to that aspect of Australia Remembers. Furthermore, without labouring the point, the Inaugural National Wool Day demonstrated clearly how well the Great Hall of Parliament House can be utilised to mount a display and bring credit to this House. Considering the importance and sensitivity of Australia Remembers, I think this display should be the benchmark for the Presiding Officers. I hope you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will take that message to them in due course. I also welcome the DEET program to assist in the restoration of our ageing war memorials throughout the nation. That is being achieved through assistance to the unemployed. I remind the minister, nevertheless, that to succeed in this admirable objective some administrative flexibility must be introduced. I trust he is continuing in his endeavours with DEET. The minister has referred at length to the involvement of Australia's youth. This, too, is most appropriate. It is a fact that many of those who served and/or lost their lives in the Second World War were of contemporary school age. It is probably an unfortunate fact of those days that military recruiting agents did not demand to see birth certificates. They signed you up, and some of those young people went to war as young as 15. It is a matter of some concern, but it is a reality young people must recognise. The Second World War was, and I hope will remain, the only time when the Australian continent came under attack from the modern war machine and when Australian citizens died on our land from such attacks. Sadly, even this situation is little known or understood by contemporary generations. The year 1995, as the 50th anniversary of the end of the conflict, is the appropriate time to remind all Australians, young and old, of the threat and horror of war and of the contribution and sacrifice that was made by so many Australians in those grim days to successfully protect our land and the values for which Australia has been internationally recognised. The coalition does support the minister's initiative. I can assure him that throughout areas of representative responsibilities our members are working to guarantee the successful outcome of the Australia Remembers 1945-95 celebrations.

The Parliamentary Contributory Superannualump tion Legislation Amendment Bill amends the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948 and the Superannuation Laws Amendment Act 1994. The main purpose of the amendments is to improve the operation of the provisions which allow certain former members and senators who re-enter parliament to repay lump sums paid under the parliamentime, tary contributory superannuation scheme and receive recognition of prior parliamentary plied. service for future benefit purposes. The existing provisions of the scheme former members of the scheme who have not qualified for pension benefits, and who received lump sum benefits instead, to enter into a contract with the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Trust to repay those lump In return for this repayment, the scheme recognises the actual period of prior parliaI mentary service towards future benefits, including pensions. Currently, affected members may enter contracts with the trust within three months re-entering parliament, with the trust having discretion to extend this period to six months. This bill will extend the period during which the trust has discretion to enter a contract from six to 12 months. In a number of past cases, and in one current one, this contract has not been signed within the six-month period. The extended discretionary period should allow the trust and any affected future members sufficient time to enter contracts. The bill contains transitional provisions to allow current members who have not been able to enter repayment contracts with the trust to do so within three months of this bill receiving royal assent. The extended discretionary period is to be subject to a cut-off date in the event that the former member's term expires before the end of any other period contained in the provisions. This is to ensure that the affected members' decisions are made while they are still members of the scheme. The bill also proposes to replace the existing provision for repayment of the actual sum received with a repayment amount which is updated in line with movements in basic parliamentary salary from the time the original sum was paid until the time the affected member enters a contract with the trust. This would remove a possible windfall to the affected member, which arises from the current provisions, where he or she may have received interest on, or otherwise made use of, the lump sum amount.

We have no difficulty with the amendments put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurof er (Mr Elliott). He has explained the details of the proposal at some length. The important thing is that the proposed amendments do not in any way alter the basic design of the existing parliamentary superannuation scheme. Any financial impact is therefore negligible. If anything, it is probably a saving in that people who have previously served, have then left parliament, and subsequently returned, will now be required to make up the difference in their lump sums, plus the effect of CPI adjustments and so forth which had previously not been the case.

HMAS Voyager",98
249,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"Groom) (5.27 p.m.)Tomorrow, 10 February, is the 31st anniversary of a national tragedy. I refer, the collision of the destroyer HMAS Voyager and the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne off Jervis Bay with the loss of 83 lives. For six years in this place and elsewhere I have been just fighting for the compensation those survivors-through this place, through It goes on: the parliament generally, and also through the successful case before the Full Bench of the ... High Court of Australia. Things became bogged down until, in May 1993, the now Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) gave us a glimmer of light and indicated that the compensation claims for those survivors would be resolved and would be resolved quickly. Unfortunately, as a result of further questions to the Attorney-General in June last year, it was clear that there were further sticking points to that compensation, caused in large part by some provisions of the government's Com care legislation. This evening I would like to reveal to the House the details of this in a letter that has been written to the Chairman of the Victorian Bar Counsel by James Taylor, a barrister who has been acting on behalf 70 or 80 of the survivors over a long period of time. It reads in part: This letter is by way of a complaint against Mr. John MCCarthy QC. and Mr B. Knox and Mr J. Lenczner, all members of the Victorian Bar for an alleged breach of clause 5.12 Chapter 5 of the Victorian Bar Rules ... I act on behalf of Mr Hugh Gilvarry who commenced proceedings in the Victorian Supreme Court by Writ No. 4937 of 1994. Mr Gilvarry suffered psychological and physical injuries as a consequence of being a crew member on HMAS Voyager when it collided with HMAS Melbourne on the 10th February, 1964 on the high seas. Mr Gilvarry's case is the vanguard for at least survivors of the collision who have lodged claims by Writ. Because these remaining survivors failed to issue Writs prior to the 1st December, 1988 they now confronted with a Defence pleaded by the Commonwealth involving s.44 of the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Commonwealth) commonly known as the ComCare Act, s.44 purports to take away Commonwealth employees right to bring an action for damages at Common Law for Writs issued after the 1st December, 1988. of course, to He goes on to say: The High Court decided that a cause of action is properly within the meaning of s.51(xxxi) and which was acquired by the Commonwealth NOT on terms and therefore s.44 in those circumstances cause of all is unconstitutional. the Australian Constitution invalidates s.44 of the ComCare Act so far as it relates to actions where time has expired under the Limitation of Actions Act, i.e. can an action brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date upon the action arose have, value, or, benefit or 'property'. He finishes by saying: Gilvarry's case was heard by His Honour Mr. Justice Nathan between 24th October, 1994 to the 28th October, 1994 decision being reserved by His Honour on that date. No mention was made by Counsel for the Commonwealth to His Honour that a relevant decision was reserved. The decision of Mewettwas handed down by the Federal Court on 1st November, 1994. The parties went before His Honour Mr Justice Nathan on the 15th November, 1994. No mention was made by Counsel for the Commonwealth to His Honour on that date. Despite the Commonwealth having had that decision for two weeks. Counsel for the Commonwealth did not inform His Honour of that decision between the 1st November, 1994 and the 15th November, 1994 when Gilvarry was reserved. Counsel for the Commonwealth's actions seem to be in contravention of clause 5.12 of the Victorian Bar Rules. There has subsequently been an interim reply from the Bar Council to that letter and, as I understand it, the Bar Council is looking at the issue. The reason I raise this matter this evening is that I have placed on the Notice Paper question No. 1976 which, in part, sets out the details and a number of questions for the Attorney-General. I simply say to the 70 Attorney-General yet again: when are these cases going to be resolved? We know that $30 million to $50 million is involved in these compensation cases. It is in the national are interest and in the interest of the individuals concerned to quickly have those issues resolved financially. Port Adelaide Football Club",99
250,Mr SAWFORD,ADJOURNMENT,I would like to put on the record in this place my delight in seeing the Port Adelaide Football Club obtain the second licence in South AustraliaMr Simmons-The mighty Magpies!,100
251,Mr SAWFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, the mighty Magpies will enter the AFL competition, hopefully in 1996. The decision by the South Australian National Football League to give Port Adelaide the nod was not a forgone conclusion, as many people in South Australia believed. Port Adelaide, by the proverbial country mile, presented the most comprehensive and complete submission to the Football League. Contrary to what some of the losers would have us believe, the decision was based entirely on merit. On that basis, Port Adelaide was leaps and bounds ahead of all the other pretenders. Port Adelaide Football Club, like the Port Adelaide area, is full of history and tradition. It is the common thread that links the locals together which has brought about the most successful Australian Rules football club in history. Mr Knott-And the executive.",101
252,Mr SAWFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"That is. correct. The Port Adelaide football club is the oldest established club in South Australia, playing its first game on 24 May 1870. Since that time, the club has won a record 33 premierships, being runnerup 34 times and third, 24 times. It was out of the finals only 12 times. It is unparalleled in the history of Australian Rules. Five premierships have come in the last seven years. Port Adelaide has the largest supporter base and membership of any SANFL club. It is a leader in football administration, which is reflected in the continual strong financial position of the club. To me, the choice was obvious. Only Port Adelaide can provide the alternative supporter base to the Adelaide Crows. I can tell that most locals, including me, were a little relieved and excited when the decision was made. Now there is a fair degree of eagerness to meet the challenge now emerging. It means a lot to Port Adelaide as it meant a lot to the sister city of Fremantle in Western Australia. Port Adelaide is a city tle; it is a port town with a potential for development while retaining its historical charm. Fremantle had the America's Cup in the 1980s as the spur needed to get things moving. I hope that this will do the same thing for Port Adelaide. With the MFP close by, Port Adelaide is overripe for development. Indications of interest are now coming in at a reasonable rate. Port Adelaide has an identity very much its own, an identity very separate from the other parts of Adelaide. Its people are fiercely loyal to each other, to the area and to their successful football team. It is somewhat akin to the legendary Collingwood Football club in its loyalties, with a supporter base spread right across Australia. Mr Simmons-Same colours.",101
253,Mr SAWFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"We will have different colours in the new league, but I think we will still call them the Magpies. It is said often that you can take a person out of Port Adelaide but you can never take Port Adelaide out of a person. Such is the loyalty to Port Adelaide that it is imbibed from generation to generation. Local people know the AFL decision will be good for business and employment in the area, bringing with it greater confidence in the future. This decision will definitely put Port Adelaide on the map with more visitors to South Australia likely to visit historic Port Adelaide. Port Adelaide is and always has been very much a working class community and this is strongly reflected in the membership of the football club. The club has a heart and a soul. The strength of the club is in its grassroots membership, not simply in corporate sponsorship, though that is of course important. I would like to publicly add my congratulations and thanks on behalf of all Port Adelaide supporters to all of those people closely associated with Port Adelaide for its AFL bid. It would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of many people within the club. People such as club president, Greg Boulton; club chairman, Barry Wilson, former wharfie; football director, Jim Nitschke; and coach, Jack Cahill all deserve a mention, as well as the committee, players-past and like Freman- present-and supporters. Port Adelaide's CEO, Brian Cunningham, deserves a special mention. Brian, like most local lads, aspired to play for Port Adelaide from a very early age. He achieved that goal, went on to have a very distinguished playing career with Port Adelaide with many appearrenowned ances for his state over that time and reward of the club captaincy for and leadership. Brian returned to the club as chief executive officer in 1992 and has proven himself as leader in football administration at a national level. I think I can sum it up with the motto of the club-'Proud of the past, confident the future'. One thing is for sure, when we actually enter the national competition, would not miss it for quids. We have a trial years ago. match coming up in a couple of weeks against the Fremantle Dockers and I really do look forward to the day next year when Port old Adelaide plays the Crows and Port Adelaide will definitely win. Australian Labor Party",101
254,Mr CLEARY,ADJOURNMENT,"The and Labor Party's resident Gordon Gekko, the bloke who makes Adam Smith look like Keynesian, otherwise known as the member for Werriwa(Mr Latham), was at it again this week exorcising the ghosts of the true believP.J. ers from the ALP and giving us a grade three version of Labor history. With a thimble of knowledge and only bravado camouflaging his foolishness, he chose to stick those bovver boots into the former anti-conscriptionist, Frank Anstey he did not. who, for all his failings, was a much respected Victorian Labor politician. I can see it now. There would be the member for that Werriwa in the jacuzzi reading his economic textbook. He would come to the 1930s Deand pression and see Frank Anstey, socialist heretic, wanting to take the mickey out of the tual. banks. The member for Werriwa would have jumped to his feet, stuck his nose in the and said, 'How old fashioned.' The honourable member blithely and pombuilt pously mocks the past, oblivious to the fact that modest, thoughtful people accept that everyone is historically and circumstantially fashioned. This is exactly what E.P. for Thompson meant when he said he wrote book entitled The Making of the British Working Class to rescue working people the enormous condescension of posterity. One could only assume E.P. Thompson, that British Labour historian, had the the likes of the member for Werriwa in mind his loyalty when he penned those words. If the member wants to condemn Frank Anstey for not being a flashy dressed 1990s a bloke and for having some ideas particular to his times, then he should follow his line of argument through to its logical conclusion. If of he did, he would be standing up in this place do condemning the Prime Minister for opposing I a motion to decriminalise homosexuality 22 The old Prime Minister, who was not too then, was not particularly radical when he lined up with Bob Katter Sr and some-dare I say it-right wing fogies to oppose the motion. Does the member for Werriwa have the intellectual courage to jump to his feet tell us that the Prime Minister was either homophobic or ignorant of the predicament of a homosexuals when he, the Prime Minister, opposed that motion? Or was it that there was a bit of the old B.A. Santamaria morality in Keating? I bet the honourable member did not have the courage to raise the issue over a snag at the Lodge last night. I bet he did not sidle up to the PM and say, 'Listen, you old fogy, I'm not very happy about your attitude to homosexuality and what you said about women in your first speech.' No, I bet The member for Werriwa crudely asserts anyone who explores the ways in which unbridled globalisation can diminish cultural national sovereignty is old fashioned or narrow-minded. This is patently anti-intellecHis is a doctrinaire view, blind to the air cultural and economic foundations that an independent republican Australia should be on. Contrary to the member's rhetoric and attempted point scoring, the coalition is just as committed to globalisation as the Labor Party. Anglophiles such as the member Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) will continue to the wave the Union Jack, but ownership of Australia concerns them no more than it from concerns the member for Werriwa. It is interesting to hear the member dismiss Frank Anstey as an old-fashioned socialist. Would he have praised him if he had been a branch stacking, right wing bovver boy like Steve Conroy, the New South Wales Right's nomination for the Victorian Senate, or if he had been an opportunist careerist like Kelvin Thomson, the state ALP defector and now candidate for Wills? Had he been around in the 1930s, the member for Werriwa would have been there waving a grade 3 economics textbook as that great British banker Otto Niemeyer passed by to remind the Australian government that all loans had to be repaid. You see, in the lexicon of the member for Werriwa, the market rules, okay. That is why he drools over the Hilmer report. Belatedly, it has now dawned on some Labor backbenchers that the Hilmer report might be used by the Kennett government to support its privatisation fetish. Hence the dorothy dixer to the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) today. The problem was that all the minister said was that the government was opposed to monopoly ownership, not privatisation. So don't be surprised if the member for Werriwa is told to pull up on Hilmer until the party gets its story right. I will bet the honourable member did not tell ALP members in his FEA just how little regard he had for Labor history and the true believers when he begged for pre-selection. Then again, there is every possibility he was foisted on the community via branch stacking. Conroy was happy to tell readers of the Melbourne Age that he had nothing but contempt for the Labor Left. What distinguishes Latham, Conroy and Kelvin Thomson from the true believers of the 30s? Frank Anstey, Frank Brennan and John Curtin all had moral courage. They believed in an egalitarian future for Australia and subscribed to the view that government had a role to play in bringing about social justice and equitable economic outcomes. In the 1990s, the likes of Frank Anstey would have had the courage to point out that an information superhighway was only as good as the quality of the ideas on it. In the middle of one banking crisis during the Depression, Frank Anstey referred to his cabinet colleagues as 'only the stuffed effigy of a government'. Sounds like a bloke with a bit of spirit. Anstey, unlike the member for Werriwa, was neither a servant to vested economic interests nor a class traitor. (Time expired) Hepatitis C",102
255,Mr SIMMONS,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to draw the attention of the House to a concern that is presently held in the community by Hepatitis C sufferers. There is, I believe, a sense of frustration. In a letter I am about to read into Hansard, given to me by a constituent who gave his permission for such a letter to be incorporated in Hansard, there is a plaintive cry for help coming through from many such sufferers. His letter begins: I am a Hep C positive and live in Orange, country NSW. The story of how I came to learn that I had Hep C is an indication of the ignorance and critical shortage of services there is in country NSW for people with Hep C. The following story is not an isolated example of misfortune. Discussions at our monthly Hep C support group meetings, a group which my wife and I started, has proven to me the ignorance of doctors and the apparent disinterest in treating Hep C patients, even in a regional centre like Orange with a population of more than 32,000 people, is more widespread than I had even feared it was. The problem is worse in the smaller satellite country towns which surround Orange. Despite seeing a general practitioner (GP) for a year complaining about being tired and run down he could not tell me what was wrong with me. However after my wife say a television program (Ray Martin's midday show) which outlined the symptoms and causes of Hep C, I decided to change GPs. After examining me, my doctor said it looked like I had Hep C. So he sent me away for a blood test. The results came back a week later and they were positive. Totally ignorant of what it meant to have Hep C I was then sent offto a local gastroenterologist.! did not know what to expect or what a gastroenterologist did. I only saw him once was then referred to the 'interferon unit' at Westmead Hospital, in Sydney. This took six months and I had to wait a further six months for a liver biopsy to see how far gone, or the level of damage the Hep C virus had caused in me. Needless to say this was an extremely traumatic time for me. However I was at no stage during this harrowing time ever given any support or counselling of any kind from anyone. I was constantly wondering what my prognosis was; death, cancer, or what? Finally I was put onto a trial of interferon for' a period of 12 months, but I suffered quite severe side-effects throughout this trial period (I was a packet of injections whereby I'd inject the interferon in my stomach over two months). And again, I did not receive any counselling, or emotional support. The worse part of the side-effects was the chemically induced depression. I kept complaining about it to my GP and to the registrars atWestmead. But my plight was ignored; I attempted suicide, but fortunately was not successful because I kept thinking of my five children, my wife and my faith in God. Somehow, I don't know, I survived this traumatic, life-threatening time on interferon. After all of I was told that the interferon had been unsuccessful. I went into shock on hearing this depressing news and had a car accident on the way home as I was still coming to terms with the fact that I was still Hep C positive. Once again there were no social workers, or anyone, to help me. I have been to the interferon clinic at Westmead every second month and have been promised more treatment each visit. I have been fed this line for the last 18 months. They say the reason is they do not have enough funding from the Federal Government but are hopeful of some money soon. Then I was told I was ineligible for the program because I have already failed a trial period on interferon. I have been offered a four year trial on interferon. But going on the side-effects from the last trial I don't think I would be able to survive such a long-term trial. I am supposed to start this in February, 1995. Living with the virus is bad enough. But living in a society that is ignorant of the virus and are uninformed about it and how it is transmitted is a living hell. I had an encounter with a man in town that would not let me get any closer than a car distance from him because he thought he would be infected. When I was first diagnosed with Hep C it was the most frightening time of my life. I did not know how I got it, if it could be caught by my wife, if it was sexually transmitted, or whether it had been passed on to our children. However, I am pleased to say, my wife and children are all negative. He then points out some of the further suffering caused. In his final paragraph, he says: When you consider there are 10,000 new cases of Hep C diagnosed each year compared with 800 HIV, stalling things will only compound the problem. If something is not done now, in 10 years we will have to spend all available medical funding on building liver transplant units all over the country to cope with the problem with Hep C. But, given I bet, even then we won't spend the money! In order to facilitate community awareness about the difficulties of Hep C sufferers, this support group in Orange will be conducting an information day next Monday, 13 February. I will be pleased to be associated with that day. (Time expired) Fisher, Mr Andrew: Houses",103
256,Mr TRUSS,ADJOURNMENT,"Wide Bay) (5.47 p.m.)Australia has a very poor record of rememthis bering the contributions of its former political leaders and statesmen. We preserve very few of the relics that are associated with our former leaders. The first member for Wide Bay was Andrew Fisher, who also served three terms as Prime Minister. He was the first Australian Prime Minister to have a majority government and the first to be head of a Labor government-not the first Labor Prime Minister, but the first to be head of a Labor government. He is obviously closely associated with my 'electorate. Little has been done in this country to preserve the memory of this man and his contribution to Australia. There are two houses in the electorate, one in Gympie and one in Howard, which are associated with Andrew Fisher-and both need attention. Andrew Fisher House in Gympie is currently owned by the historical society and was moved into its museum complex in 1973. The house has been fully restored and furnished in the style of the 1900s. It is closely associated with Andrew Fisher, the miner and engine driver from Gympie who rose from humble beginnings to become the Labor Prime Minister of Australia. The house contains some of Andrew Fisher's personal belongings and has been listed by the National Trust of Queensland. The house urgently needs a new roof, and the society has asked the government on many occasions for financial assistance to help preserve this house. It has got very little support from members opposite, even though Andrew Fisher was a Labor Prime Minister. Only the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) has given this cause much support. He has been to Gympie personally, has seen the house and has made applications to government ministers on a number of occasions for funding for this important project. Ironically, the minister at the table, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), is amongst those who have signed letters refusing financial assistance to restore Andrew Fisher House. A second house has perhaps even greater association with this former Prime Minister. It was built and owned by Andrew Fisher in the town of Howard when he was a coal miner on the Burrum coalfields. I have a copy of the certificate of title which recognises Andrew Fisher as its owner. The house is in its original condition, although it has been unsympathetically added to over the years. It has had a number of owners subsequent to Andrew Fisher, with the current owners having it since 1972. They need money for an entry contribution to an aged people's complex, so the house is for sale. This is a rare opportunity for a building that has a particular association with Australia's history-being owned by one of our great former prime ministers-to be acquired for national ownership. I appeal particularly to members opposite but also to the government as a whole to take up the opportunity of acquiring the house as a national museum and as something to remember one of our former prime ministers by. The house is clearly in need of some work to restore it to its original state, but it would be a very fitting monument to Andrew Fisher. After Andrew Fisher retired as Prime Minister of Australia, he became high commissioner for Australia in London and he eventually died in England, where he is buried. I understand that his grave is largely unattended. There is very little by which to remember this great Australian Prime Minister. This is a unique opportunity-one which will possibly not come again. We need to move very quickly to acquire this building. I encourage government members, who have an association with the ALP, who would like to remember one of their former heroes, to take this opportunity to ensure that this building is not lost, that it is preserved and kept for future generations to remember one of the early Australian prime ministers-the first Prime Minister of a Labor government and someone who did so much to contribute towards the early history of our country. Fisher, Mr Andrew: Houses State Bank of New South Wales",104
257,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I am amazed by the utter gall of the previous speaker, the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), by the shamefaced way in which he stood and spoke in this House. He was one of the people who was responsible for the garrotte being put on the program which would have funded exactly what he is now pleading for. It is utterly shameful for this man to now come before us and plead for such a program when he, with some help, knocked out a minister who had nothing to hide. It was an act of political 'fatherlessness of a child'-I am trying to be parliamentary in the use of my language. This man comes in here and has the hide, the temerity, to start talking about how we should honour our fallen when he was directly responsible, along with another member, for this program going down. It is to his utter shame and to the utter shame of everyone in his electorate that he should be held contemptuously responsible for that. However, I will not waste my time on such riffraff. The real reason I wish to speak is that I have a letter from Premier John Fahey. I am supposed to be pleased, as a State Bank customer in New South Wales, at receiving this letter which, to protect my privacy, was addressed and distributed by the State Bank on behalf of the New South Wales government. The New South Wales government is using a government instrumentality to peddle this propaganda. I am glad that the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) is not here so he cannot correct any minor errors in terms of historical facts and .dates; I will leave those out. The government savings bank operated and opened by Jack Lang for the benefit of people of New South Wales-which sadly went broke under some difficulties and became the Rural Bank of New South Waleshad a particular reference. I note the smiles on the faces of those opposite. One of the references of the Rural Bank of New South Wales is pertinent to the state of Australia at the moment. That reference was to make sure that the rural industries and agricultural people in this country had equal access to and equity in financial services. Somewhere, you have lost that. Somewhere in New South Wales it has been determined that that should be sold out. That is why those opposite have gone so quiet-because they know that their mate in New South Wales has sold out those principles. Frank Anstey was mentioned in a previous speech. You have criticised the respect of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for Jack Lang, another one of our great men. You stand here and try to pull our great people up for your own cause. That is very hard to take. This letter from John Fahey states that the government guarantee over my deposits will be there for three years. What is he in fact saying? He is saying that the company to which they have sold this bank has been given government guarantees for three years. I suggest that is a commercial thing. It has nothing to do with my interests, but has everything to do with ensuring that the company it has sold has been sold with a gold stamp of approval. The second part of the letter relates to strength and competitiveness. It is almost a joke to suggest that the sale of this bank anything for strength and competitiveness. I was one of those Australians who liked to put my savings in a government bank. I have to go back to the Commonwealth Bank, which is only 49 per cent owned by the people of Australia. But I will do that, not because I want to but because I have to. I do not have the choice. There is no competition. I do not have the choice to put my savings in a bank which is owned by the people of New South Wales. To suggest that this is going to strengthen the competitiveness is hoo-ha. The last part of the letter relates to the prudent manner in which Reserve Bank supervision can be expected. Reserve Bank supervIsIOn has nothing to do with John Fahey. What is he on about? I suggest that John Fahey stop selling out the people of New South Wales. (Time expired) National Roads and Motorists Association",105
258,Mr CADMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I am amazed by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott). He is a member of the party that started to sell the Commonwealth Bank-the great bastion of the Australian Labor Party, for the protection of the poor battler and the poor saver. He has been part of that sale process, and the government is going to sell the lot of it. The member had a bit of a chip at the state government. One cannot believe members like that. We should dismiss what they say and just take it as pure political rhetoric for the New South Wales election that is coming up. Some weeks ago I made a speech in regard to the NRMA. I praised the directors for their decision to go ahead with the demutualisation. I also praised them for their stand against some of the crazier ideas that were being foisted on the NRMA and the motorists of New South Wales by an unusual conglomerthat ation of people who wanted to do quite unusual things with shareholders' funds. Since I made that speech, I have had a chance to examine some of the activities in the management of the NRMA, and I do not know whether I should have been as strong in my praise of the majority of board members. does Some things have concerned me. The process that has been gone through is beneficial to motorists. I think that the loss of capital, which has reduced the average share value from $1,000 to $500, indicates that perhaps the expectations of the current board were too high in light of the circumstances. I look forward to the settlement of this process and I trust that the motorists of New South Wales will be able to make a .reasonable decision when the new prospectus is issued. I have to agree with the comments made by my colleague the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) during that debate in relation to the role ofMs Lynn Ralph, who is the Deputy Chairperson of the Australian Securities Commission. Ms Ralph seemed to hold a very unusual dual capacity in this whole process. I believe that all public servants and servants of great institutions should be at arms length from commercial decisions. It was a commercial decision to sell, even though it is a mutual group. Ms Ralph's advice would have been seen to be more credible if she had stood back from her attachment to the NRMA or appointed somebody else to fill the role she undertook. I know that the motorists of New South Wales will be watching very carefully over the next few weeks as they decide whether or not that great organisation should be demutualised. I think I will be voting no. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 5.59 p.m. NA The following notice was given: Mr Cameron to move That this House: (1) acknowledges the need for Australian workers to save for their retirement to ensure the burden on the Government and Australian taxpayers is minimised; (2) as such, recognises the massive imposts under the guise of account and management fees that are imposed on individuals' retirement funds and the disincentive this causes to saving and the subsequent burden which is placed on taxpayers; (3) cans on the Government to provide policies which encourage savings for retirement; and (4) opposes any taxes or changes which discourage saving.

This is what I refer to a speech that the Minister for Faulkner) gave in Wollongong in September with the United Nations Convention on the Australia declared an exclusive economic zone one of the largest EEZs in the world, and Convention on the Law of the Sea. That convention important to the economy of our country and came about only because this government made sure to negotiate in various international bodies, we protected not only our own area but our made mention of negotiations with regional regional protection initiatives. It is very Often I hear the opposition, in various the main chamber, berating the government for and declarations, as if this in some way impinges I am sure, the government's view that such to our sovereignty but also to our responsibilities speech the minister reminded his listeners of taken, yet there has been, in the most recent number of people to suggest that this government's to be desired. The constitutional arrangements in this colonial posturings that occurred some 100 years concerned with maintaining their parochial rights meant that the Commonwealth has been hamstrung because many of the powers that it would require on many of these issues-and the woodchipping agreement as a national government without created a great many difficulties.

In the same speech the minister groups in ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific area for important that we commit ourselves to this. speeches in the Main Committee room and also in its commitment to United Nations conventions on our sovereign rights. It is my view and, conventions are enormously important not only to the wider, international scene. In his a number of initiatives that this government has debate on the woodchip issue, an attempt by a record on conservation issues leaves a lot country-which I contend are an overlay of the ago, when various vested interests were more than with the future good of the nation-have in meeting its national responsibilities remain the responsibility of the states.

(2)(b) The remaining 18 cases were all rejected. and there were no cases of claims being withdrawn, Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There is no specific class of persons who are entitled to the intermediate rate. An Australian veteran, a member of the Australian Defence Force, an Australian member of a PeacekeepirigForce, or an Australian mariner, may be eligible for the intermediate rate if: the degree of incapacity from the person's war-caused or defence-caused disability or disabilities is determined to be at least 70%; or the person has suffered or is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, and is receiving or is entitled to receive a disability pension at the general rate; and Payment the incapacity from the person's accepted disability or disabilities alone renders the person incapable of undertaking remunerative work otherwise than on a part-time basis or intermittently (unable to undertake or continue to undertake 50% or more of normal time or 20 hours or more per week); and the person is, by reason of his or her incapacity from accepted disability or disabilities alone, prevented from continuing to undertake remunerative work and suffers a loss of income or earnings which the person would not suffer if free from that incapacity. Between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 1993 a total of 428 persons were granted the intermediate rate of disability pension. Annual grants in these three years were as under: NUMBER OF GRANTS (BY CONFLICT) 1990 1991 1992 1993 Total 75 58 38 47 218 13 7 7 5 32 2 1 Nil 2 5 20 20 25 48 113 9 12 14 25 60 119 98 84 127 428 a war widow's pension after the death of their spouse.
