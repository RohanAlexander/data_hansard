NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
3,Ms ROXON,INDEMNITY LEGISLATION,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. As you will recall, the purpose of the Midwife Professional Indemnity (Commonwealth Contribution) Scheme Act 2010 and the associated Midwife Professional Indemnity (Run-off Cover Support Payment) Act 2010 was to support the new MBS and PBS arrangements by enabling the establishment of a government supported professional indemnity scheme for eligible midwives from 1 July last year. Those acts removed a long standing barrier for appropriately qualified and experienced midwives who wish to provide high-quality midwifery services to Australian women as part of a collaborative team with doctors and other health professionals. The Midwife Professional Indemnity (Commonwealth Contribution) Scheme Act 2010 currently excludes ‘employed' midwives from accessing a Commonwealth contribution and a run-off cover Commonwealth contribution to ensure there is no intentional cost shifting from employers of midwives to the Commonwealth. The bill tidies up the act by placing the rule-making powers in a more appropriate section and thus ensures that eligible ‘selfemployed' midwives are not excluded from access to a Commonwealth contribution for claims that are made while they are in the workforce and also any claims that are made after they retire. By doing this, the act will continue to exclude other ‘employed' midwives (such as those employed by private hospitals) to prevent cost shifting to the Commonwealth by employers. The changes to the act proposed by this bill will also allow a specific rule-making power to appropriately address any new and innovative midwife self-employment models that may arise in the future. This will ensure that the bill will be able to accurately describe midwives and their employment arrangements that are within the scope of the government's maternity reform policy. This bill also corrects a typographical error in the Midwife Professional Indemnity (Run-off Cover Support Payment) Bill 2010 that would, if left unchanged, impose a higher than intended tax on insurers of eligible midwives. This bill is essentially a technical fix for two minor elements the act. The bill is an important component of the government's maternity reform package. The package aims to improve the choices that are available to women in relation to maternity care. The total cost over four years of the professional indemnity for midwives component of the package is $25.2 million. I commend these small changes to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Billson) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (NATIONAL HEALTH PERFORMANCE AUTHORITY) BILL 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
4,Ms ROXON,NATIONAL HEALTH REFORM,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today I am introducing a significant piece of legislation into this chamber that will form part of the new backbone of a modern, integrated, high-performing health system. It is a result of the government's historic agreement with all states and territories to undertake fundamental reform of our health and hospitals system. Today I am taking a critical step with the introduction of this legislation to create a National Health Performance Authority-the new watchdog for Australia's health system. The performance authority will work to: - open up the performance of the health and hospital system to new levels of national transparency and accountability; - allow for the identification of highperforming parts of the health system so those successes can be transferred to other areas; - identify areas of the health system that require improvement so that action can be taken; and - improve the health choices of Australians in making key decisions about their own healthcare needs. This forms one critical element of a new health system-one that is sustainable, transparent, efficient, high performing and well resourced. The reform of Australia's health system is one of the most important public policy challenges of this generation. In many ways we are lucky that Australia has one of the most impressive public health systems in the world-our doctors and nurses are world class, our public system provides free hospital care for all and it delivers outcomes such as low infant mortality and long life expectancy. But we're faced with a health system that is fragmented, costly, under-resourced, unsustainable, overly focused on acute care and with constant pressure to deliver for more patients with more complex needs. And our access is not truly universalimproving the health of Australia's first peoples remains a massive challenge. All of this would be challenge enoughbut add to this the fact that Australia's ‘baby boomers' are now starting to retire. This population bubble will place more pressure on our hospitals as doctors and nurses retire, and more people require acute care. We've attacked these challenges ferociously since we entered office in 2007. We've taken the short-term measures that have been needed to avert pressures becoming crises while we've worked to reshape our health system for the long term. Hospital funding increased by $20 billion, over 70,000 more elective surgery operations have been delivered, the cap on the number of GPs being trained has been lifted with new doctors now in training, the number of nurse places in universities has increased over 1,000 a year, and primary care and ventative health is a renewed focus for government. And just this week I have announced 518 trainee specialist places, a fold increase compared to 2007. But truly putting our health system on a sustainable path requires fundamental reform. A genuine national deal was needed to make the changes necessary to ensure our health system is not overwhelmed by the rising costs of health treatment, to provide safer and higher quality services, to manage the demand for health services from an ageing population and the need for effective porting and monitoring on the performance of health service providers. The government is now delivering this. Our 13 February agreement with all Australian states and territories on health reform creates a genuine partnership that will deliver much needed change to our health system. The partnership that this government has entered into with the states and territories demonstrates our commitment to action on health reform, and most importantly, to take decisive action to deliver a better deal for patients, and a better deal for communities. It means more money for hospital beds, increased local control of health services, greater transparency and less waste within the system. One of the greatest challenges facing our health system is ensuring it has enough money into the future. Therefore, the government will inject an extra $19.8 billion into public hospitals, on top of the extra $20 billion we have already provided, and develop robust national standards to make sure that money is directed 475 straight to hospitals and patients. The government will meet 45 per cent of by the growth in efficient hospital costs by pre- 2014-15 and 50 per cent by 2017-18. From that point, the Commonwealth and the states and territories will meet the cost of efficient tenhospital funding growth on an equal basis. The Commonwealth's contribution will include funding of no less than $16.4 billion towards public hospital funding growth over the next decade, and $3.4 billion extra for emergency departments, elective surgery and 1,316 subacute hospital beds over the next four years. A new national funding pool will be created which will deliver unprecedented transreparency in the way hospitals are funded. These changes to the funding arrangements will provide security for hospital services into the future, combined with important changes in the delivery of vital health services. But in order to drive improvements in patient outcomes, it is vital that patients have access to better information about the performance of hospitals and other key health care providers. This government is committed to increasing the transparency of government and the services it delivers. We firmly believe that with transparency comes a greater chance of improving public services and empowering the public to make decisions based on the best information. There's no better example of that than our reforms to the way that parents can make decisions about their children's education through the MySchool website. Building on this success in the health portency folio we have also implemented the MyHospitals website which for the first time allows all Australians to see the performance of their individual hospitals including waiting times for elective surgery procedures and emergency department care. Our health reforms will drive this further. We've listened to the advice of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission that said performance reporting would ‘promote a culture of continuous improvement' and improve consumer literacy of the health system. They recommended the development of national access targets, performance reporting that compares the clinical performance of hospitals and health services (both public and private) and reporting on safety and quality performance and patient satisfaction. Our health reform agreement delivers on that reporting, targets and transparency to improve health services. This includes: - new national standards for emergency department care and elective surgery to improve waiting times for patients in our hospitals; and - a new performance and accountability framework so that hospitals will have to measure and report on a range of performance, safety and quality and output measures. This work to improve transparency will not happen by itself. It requires dedicated resources and an independent authority to oversee the work. So the bill I am moving today will establish an independent body to drive this performance and transparency agenda. The National Health Performance Authority will exist to improve quality, increase transparand drive value for money in the health system. It will drive transparency in the health system by improving Australians' access to vital health information. Australians will have more access to information on their local hospitals, health services, primary health care and community health services. The authority will monitor and report assessments on the new local hospital networks, public hospitals, private hospitals, and Medicare locals. The authority will publicly report this information through new hospital performance reports and healthy community reports-that will be available for Australians to see on the internet. These reports will show how each local hospital network and Medicare local is performing-as well as individual hospitals, private hospitals and other organisations. To achieve this the authority will collect, analyse and interpret performance information and promote and conduct research into new and existing performance tools. Where performance needs to be measured in a new way-the authority will have the ability to develop new measurements to assess performance. Other performance related tasks may also be referred to the authority. Its independence will ensure that Australians know that nationally comparable information will be available and that it has been independently analysed. It will mean that Australians will have a much better picture of how their health services are performing-and the differences in performance between big cities, outer metropolitan areas, regional centres and remote services. This will give further impetus to improve the equality of service provision across the country. To ensure the performance authority's membership has the necessary degree of healthcare expertise in rural and regional health issues, at least one member must have substantial experience and standing in the healthcare needs of people living in regional or rural areas, and must understand the challenges of providing first-class healthcare services to these Australians. Seven members of the authority will be ministerially appointed in line with the health reform agreement-a chair from the Commonwealth, a deputy chair from the states and territories and five members to be appointed with the agreement of the Commonwealth and the states and territories. Consistent with COAG's original decision in April 2010, the performance authority is to be established as a statutory authority under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, or FMA Act. A chief executive officer will be ministerially appointed after consultations with the National Health Performance Authority. The chief executive officer will manage the authority and will be directly accountable to the Commonwealth Minister for Health and Ageing for the financial management of the agency. The chief executive officer will serve on a full-time basis for a period of up to years, and is eligible for reappointment. Through this bill, Australia can take another large leap on the path to a modern, high-performing health system, one that prioritises continuous improvement and accountability to the patients it serves. This will be a powerful independent watchdog body that by using the power of accurate information will push our hospitals to deliver better services and push our primary healthcare sector to develop and improve. It will guide policymakers to develop better solutions that give greater account to our regional differences and will help patients to make better decisions on their own care. This is one important step on our major national health reform path-reforms which are critical to delivering for Australians a health system that delivers the services to Australians that they deserve and expect. It gives me great pride to commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Billson) adjourned. NA Rearrangement",20

7,Dr STONE,GAS APPLIANCE SAFETY,"by leave-I move: That the motion be amended to readThat this House: (1) mourns the tragic loss of young Chase and Tyler Robinson, who died at Mooroopna on 30 May 2010 in a recently rented home; (2) notes that Chase and Tyler Robinson were the victims of a faulty gas wall heater emitting carbon monoxide; and (3) calls upon the Australian government to work the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) to task the Ministerial Council on Energy (MCE) to work with state and territory gas safety regulators to mitigate the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning from household gas appliances by urgently developing a strategy, which: (a) explores the following: (i) a requirement for all residential properties with gas appliances to be fitted with an approved carbon monoxide detector; (ii) a requirement for all residential landlords to have gas appliances installed in rental properties inspected by qualified contractors at intervals to be determined; (iii) the promotion of greater safety awareness, alerting all Australians to the dangers and symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning and the need to regularly maintain household gas appliances; (iv) the identification of training and workforce requirements to meet any recommendations, such as increasing the number of trained gas fitters to undertake safety checks; and (v) any other options that may mitigate the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning from household gas appliances; and (b) will be provided to the MCE for urgent decision and implementation, accompanied, if required, by a Regulatory Impact Statement. A motion moved in my name and debated in parliament on Monday, 21 February, was in response to the tragic deaths of young Chase and Tyler Robinson. They died in Mooroopna, in their rented home, when carbon monoxide was generated by a faulty gas heater. Their mother was also seriously injured with carbon monoxide poisoning. In that original motion we called for the requirement for all residential properties with gas appliances to be fitted with approved carbon monoxide detectors and that residential landlords with gas appliances also had to have them regularly inspected and have those gas detectors. We wanted the promotion of greater safety awareness, alerting all Australians to the danger and symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning and the need to regularly maintain their household gas appliances. We said that there needs to be the identification of training and workforce requirements to meet new recommendations that will come through, to improve the situation for all. We were very concerned that there should be a recognition of the tragic loss of the lives of those two boys. I thank the members for Mallee, Throsby and Chifley, who gave bipartisan support to this motion when it was debated. The amendments now before the House were introduced in response to this strong bipartisan support from the coalition, the crossbenches and the government and, in particular, the Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson, who will now shepherd this need for change and these new measures through the Ministerial Council on Energy, which is, of course, part of the COAG process. Therefore, the amendment now refers to the Ministerial Council on Energy and adds in, in particular, the identification of training and workforce requirements to meet any new recommendations coming through that council. Again, I want to thank members for the strong bipartisan support for this motion. I think it reflects on the fact that in Australia we do care profoundly for the health of all of our children and all of the men and women in our communities. This government can make sure that all states and territories, as well as the Commonwealth, have safety measures in homes which echo, for example, smoke detectors in relation to fire safety measures. I therefore commend these amendments to the House.",23

18,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES,"Lyne) (9.39 am)On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the committee's report No. 421 entitled The role of the Auditor-General in scrutinising government advertising. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",28
19,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This report is tabled on behalf of the committee of the previous parliament, which undertook all of the work for the inquiry, including the conduct of the public hearings and the preparation of the report. After consideration of the report and its findings, the current Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has decided to adopt this report. The inquiry was instigated by the previous committee in October 2008 to examine the Auditor-General's new role in scrutinising compliance of public advertising campaigns under the Guidelines on Information and Advertising Campaigns by Australian Government Departments and Agencies. Under the guidelines implemented in 2008, the Auditor-General was not required to decide whether a campaign would run or not but only required to provide a review opinion as to whether it considered the guidelines had been satisfied. The committee commended the Australian National Audit Office for the diligence with which it undertook its role and believes that the ANAO's involvement increased transparency. However, it is important to note that by the end of the inquiry, all committee members agreed that it was not appropriate for the Auditor-General to be involved in the scrutiny of proposed advertising campaigns. They considered that it blurred the boundary between executive decision making and audit review. Some committee members were also concerned that a positive review report by Report the Auditor-General could be seen to be publicly endorsing government policy. The inquiry was still in progress when the Special Minister of State announced on 31 March 2010, in response to the Independent Review of Government Advertising Arrangements, a refined framework for government campaign advertising. In consequence, the Auditor-General's role in reviewing proposed advertising campaigns before their launch was abolished. Instead, the Auditor-General would be asked to conduct a performance audit on at least one campaign per year or the administration of the campaign advertising framework. The committee seriously considered the option of continuing to scrutinise government advertising, due to it being such a subjective area of government spending. The committee concluded, however, that the Auditor-General's forward works program is likely to achieve this same purpose. That being said, the committee will take particular note of the Auditor-General's forthcoming report regarding the implementation of the new system. As a result of the inquiry, the committee considers that any substantial proposed changes to the role of the Auditor-General in future should be first reviewed by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit on behalf of the parliament and not effectively implied by executive announcement. This would more properly reflect the Auditor General's standing as an independent officer of the parliament. The committee believes that many of the difficulties with the advertising function discussed in this report would have been picked up earlier if such a process had been followed. The committee has, therefore, made one recommendation to exactly this effect. In closing, I commend the chair of the previous committee, Ms Sharon Grierson, and all committee members on the work of this inquiry and this report. The report is a comprehensive consideration of the issues surrounding the Auditor-General's role in scrutinising government advertising. I commend the report to the House and move: That the House take note of the report.",28

NA AMENDMENT (ENROLMENT AND PRISONER VOTING) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 March, on motion by Mr Gray: That this bill be now read a second time.",29
22,Mr MELHAM,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I made some remarks yesterday in speaking in support of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment and Prisoner Voting) Bill 2010 where I quoted extensively from sections of High Court judgments delivered in this area that we rely on. They are from the Roach case and also the case of Rowe. The thrust behind the majority judgments was about enfranchising voters, not disenfranchising voters, which is what we now seek to put into place. The interesting thing is that it was the former government that legislated to put us in the position that the High Court found was not warranted in both the Roach and Rowe cases. We would not have had to do this if it were not for the paranoia of some on the other side about supposed fraud in the electoral system, or potential fraud. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which I chair, and chaired in the last parliament, made recommendations along the lines of what we propose in the legislation today. They were majority recommendations, and it is prescient to quote the summary and the preamble to recommendation 1, which led to the seven-day rule. The report said: The committee can see no valid reason why it should be necessary to continue with close of rolls arrangements that serve to disenfranchise electors and that require unsustainable levels of funding to be expended in order to partly mitigate their effect. is no evidence that fraudulent activity was reduced as a result of the amendments to the close of rolls. On the contrary, there is no evidence available that indicates systemic fraudulent activity exists. I think it is worth requoting the joint judgment that I quoted yesterday. It is a judgment relating to Justice Gummow, together with Justice Bell: A legislative purpose of preventing such fraud before it is able to occur, where there has not been previous systemic fraud associated with the operation of the seven-day period before the changes are made by the 2006 act, does not supply a substantial reason for the practical operation of the 2006 act in disqualifying large numbers of electors. That is in paragraphs 166 and 167 of the judgment. What the judges are saying there is that you cannot merely assert fraud; you have got to show substantial fraud is occurring before you go down this path of disenfranchising a large number of electors. In relation to prisoners, the same proportionate approach has applied when they reinstated the eligibility to vote for those who were sentenced to a period of three years imprisonment or less. Indeed, the majority in that case of Roach contained the then Chief Justice Gleeson, someone who is fairly conservative when he comes to judgments. There is no doubt that of those of us who have followed electoral reform over the years-and I have in my 21 years of being in this place-I have to admit that I was very surprised at the pronouncements of the High Court in each of these cases. I was fairly pessimistic as to the success of those cases. I was very surprised, but elated, at the principle on which the High Court has basically enunciated in these cases; it is about enfranchisement. They are setting limits on the ability of this parliament to disenfranchise electors, and I think that is a good thing. I have a great regard for the High Court. I think we have probably one of the better High Courts in the world in relation to their independence and the quality of their judgments. This is not a radical court; this is a conservative court, if you look at the appointments. There are a number of appointments on the bench that were by the former government. Indeed, when you actually look at the Roach case, the former Chief Justice Gleeson and Justice Crennan, who were in the majority, were appointed by the former government. And in relation to the case of Rowe, Justice Crennan was in the majoritywhich was a 4-3 judgment-and was appointed by the former government. I think that is a good thing because it is also a demonstration that it is unlike other places around the world where appointments made tend to be of a more political nature and where there is demonstrated evidence that particular courts may well be following a political objective. That is why in the United States there is such a scrutiny of appointments to the Supreme Court. I think that in Australia we can be very confident of the independence and the separation of powers that exist in this country, and the quality of the people that we place on the bench. I do not always necessarily agree with some of those judgments; I have different views. And they are not always unanimous judgments-indeed, in the case of Rowe it was a 4-3 judgment-but we accept that. The case of Wik was a 4-3 judgment in a particular way. It created a furore in the broader community, but the truth of the matter is that we do not follow the system whereby you have unanimous judgments-so you are able to test the reasoning. But the reasoning of the majority in both these cases is a reasoning that this parliament should embrace. It should be about enfranchisement and not about disenfranchisement. The tragedy is that for the 11½ years of the former government all we saw was legislative action to disenfranchise, based on paranoia, fear and, I believe in some cases, on a view that a particular group of people did not necessarily vote a particular way-or that they did vote a particular way. We will see legislation introduced to reinstate provisional voters who, prior to amendments by the former government, were scrutinised and who had signed declaration forms on the day of voting which, when compared with the signatures that the Electoral Commission had, meant those people were reinstated to the count. Changes to the law meant that, unless they produced a proof of identity, those people did not have their vote admitted to the count and they had to come back within a certain period of time. What we now know is that 12,000 people during the 2010 election, who were given provisional votes because their names could not be found on the roll, were subsequently found to be on the roll but were still excluded because they were given provisional votes and the provisions of the act were such that if they did not bring along a proof of identity within the required time then their vote could not be reinstated. That was 12,000 people who were legitimately on the roll. In that instance, I would argue a signature is a good enough proof of identity. And as one who has scrutineered over many elections and by-elections, if there is doubt as to a signature you can compare it with the signature held by the commission. If there is doubt, it gets knocked out. That principle is consistent with these principles that are before us today in relation to prisoners-that is, imprisonment of itself should not be a disqualification from the vote. That is what former Chief Justice Gleeson says in his judgement in the majority in that case, and I commend to the House his judgement. It is worth reading; it is an excellent judgement in that regard. In relation to the challenge by GetUp!, it was believed that there were about 100,000 people who fell into this category. We are not talking about one or two votes here. The allegation of systemic fraud has been made at every electoral committee hearing I have been involved in subsequent to every election that has been held-this is the eighth I have been involved in personally as a candidate-and I am still waiting for the evidence of systemic fraud. That is what Justices Gummow and Bell were in effect saying in their judgement in that particular case. If you want to assert these things, and the consequences are you are going to disqualify people from their right to participate in choosing a government, then you must put up, you must show the systemic fraud. Not occasional fraud. There is occasional fraud, there is the odd person who multiple-votes. What we also found in relation to that multiple voting is that 80 per cent or more of it related to elderly people who were in nursing homes where confusion reigned, dementia reigned, and people were double-voting. That was the evidence before the committee last time in relation to those particular elements of multiple voting. It was not fraud, it was confusion. I hope to have the analysis of the Electoral Commission in relation to those matters. And in relation to the seven-day rule, us be clear: we are talking about a situation where there could be 50,000 to 100,000 extra voters on the roll. It has been a situation where this has been progressively looked at because automatic enrolment now takes place in New South Wales and Victoria, and that is something we will look at as a Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. It is not about favouring the government or the opposition; it is about recognising that as a society there are some changes in our society, but the right to vote is one of the most important rights that can be exercised. It is true equality because an 18-year-old voter is just the same as a voter who has been voting for 40 or 50 years-their vote counts. But there is a lot more movement in the electorate. We have a situation where there are provisions in the Electoral Act that if I moved next door and did not fill out the proper form, even though I am within the same electorate, my vote does not count. It is madness! The nature of our society requires us to have safeguards, to have checks. That is what this legislation before the House is now about. The government is backed up by High Court decisions. I accept that in some instances you do not necessarily have to follow the High Court; just because the High Court says it, does not mean that you do it. But if we do nothing then the principles in the legislation are what underpin elections on election day. What we are doing is legislating what the High Court has said is the law. Because all of those people who took advantage of the High Court case in terms of Roach all got a vote. The Electoral Commission devoted extra resources to processing those applications. If the opposition opposes this legislation and this legislation is defeated then the principles underpinning this legislation still apply. Let us have that on the record. It is not a let situation where your opposition is going to achieve a close of rolls on the same day that an election is called; the High Court has declared that what the former government did was not in accordance with the Constitution. Those provisions of the act have been struck down. I commend the legislation to the House. I believe it is worthy of support. It reinstates provisions that operated for a very long time-they are not new, they were taken away. (Time expired)",30
23,Mr HAWKE,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I rise to speak on the government's Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment and Prisoner Voting) Bill 2010. It is quite instruccoalition tive to follow the member for Banks in this debate. He made some pertinent points. The legislation before us is a result of a High Court decision. The High Court has interpreted the Constitution in a certain way. I think the member for Banks is correct in saying that we do not always have to do what the High Court says in relation to this. We have a separation of powers in our society. We have a legislative branch and a judicial branch and often they may disagree on points. In my view, this is not the end of this debate. Many of the issues contained in the legislation will be revisited in the future. While the government may have the numbers to get this legislation up, it is not unusual with the passage of time for the High Court to alter its decisions or for matters to be revisited. With the nature of the dissenting reports and the 4-3 split decisions in particular in some of the High Court verdicts, I think what we see is a genuine division in terms of how we should proceed. As the legislative branch, we should not be afraid of legislating-of setting what we believe are the fundamental principles for the integrity of the electoral roll and who can and cannot vote based on sound principles. It is a sound principle to say that people serving prison sentences should have their rights suspended. We suspend their right to liberty anyway by putting them in prison. I do not understand the argument that somehow they have a ‘super-right' to vote above and beyond the right to liberty and their pursuit of happiness after committing a crime that leads to a custodial sentence. Society has already taken the decision to suspend most of their rights, but to say that somehow they have this ‘uber-right'-they have this absolute right to vote regardless of any other right or any act they have committed or anything that has happened-is an odd contention. So I do not find it unreasonable that the amended the legislation to provide that prisoners serving custodial sentences of longer than three years ought not to choose the legislators that make the laws that put them in the prison they are in. I do not find that unreasonable. I do not think the average person in our community would find that unreasonable. Often the judicial branch is regarded as out of step and out of touch with community attitudes in relation to these sorts of matters. I think custodial sentences and prisoners voting in elections are a fine example of where the judicial branch has not got the right tenor of the public view. The coalition, of course, has acknowledged the High Court's decision. I think it is important to note that this was a narrow decision in relation to a blanket exclusion. It did not-and I think this is where the Labor Party is being a little cute-seek to invalidate the general principle that the franchise may be removed from certain prisoners. That is why we will be moving an amendment to provide that this be reinstated for custodial sentences of one year or more. I think this is a valid way to proceed considering that the Constitution, at section 44(ii), says that any person who: … has been convicted and is under sentence, or subject to be sentenced, for any offence punishable under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State by imprisonment for one year or longer … shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. To clarify this for anybody listening today: you are incapable of serving as a member of the House of Representatives or sitting in the Senate if you are serving a custodial sentence of one year or more. Yet you are capable of voting on who can be a member or senator in this place. It seems odd; that that would be the case seems not the intention of the foundchisement ing fathers of the Constitution. I do not think it is unreasonable for us propose that, if you are serving a custodial sentence that prevents you from serving in this place-from holding office as a member or senator-you are not to have the right to select a member or senator or have influence over what laws are made. It is not an unreasonable proposition. I think the coalition is entirely reasonable and within its rights. I think it is also reasonable to suggest to the judicial wing: you may have a view about a particular court case that had a particularly impact on a particular group of people, but the parliament may disagree. I note the member for Maribyrnong, who is at the table, is laughing. What is funny about this? We are talking about a very small group of people who are in prison for offences. We are not talking about a major impact on the electoral roll; we are not talking about altering the outcome of elections; we are talking about a general principle in our society that says you cannot serve in this place if you have been sentenced. And it therefore follows that you ought not to be able to vote. This is not a political manoeuvre. There is no real value in this for anybody. It is simply a matter of setting these principles and standards and making them consistent across the board. This bill has another serious aspect to it, in relation to enrolment. This has been the subject of much discussion over the past few years, including in the lead-up to the 2007 election. The bill seeks to return the law to the situation where the close of rolls would occur seven days after the issue of the writ. In relation to this issue, the first point I would make is that the contention was that the coalition's changes in 2006 somehow disenfranchised people. The member for Banks was keen to talk about disenfranseveral times in his speech: ‘People were disenfranchised. People lost the to vote-it is outrageous.' The idea was that the current law-that you must be on the electoral roll and must maintain the correct enrolment address according to the provisions of the Electoral Act-would not apply to those people who could all of a sudden enrol once an election is called. Those who do the right thing make up the bulk of voters in our society today. The situation was that people who did not meet the well-outlined deadlines and rushed to vote at the last minute were in the same category as people who had maintained the correct enrolment all through the year, in accordance with the law of the land. Somehow there was something wrong in us asking people to comply with the law and be on the electoral roll. Again, I find this an odd argument. It is undermined by the fact that the submission of the AEC to the Senate inquiry noted that under the new rules in 2007 the number of people missing from the close of rolls in 2007 was 100,370 and in 2004 this was 168,394. So during just a three-year cycle 68,000 people were added to the roll, with the new legislation under the Howard government. That is a reduction of 40 per cent. The member for Banks said that people have been disenfranchised. The facts are very different. Actually, 40 per cent more people were franchised as a result of the legislation and campaign to ensure that people enrolled by the correct time and date and there was a consequence if you did not. It is no different from any other form of government activity that we set up. This is the question that the Labor Party has to answer: why should we treat the electoral roll, which is such an important and fundamental plank of our democratic society, as anything less than our other instrumentalities? We have punitive and enforceable measures in the Income Tax Assessment Act, for example. When the government wants revenue it will have what it wants you to do by the date it wants you to do it by or it will hunt you down until it gets that revenue. But with the electoral roll the attitude is: ‘Let's relax. We can have people come on after the writs are issued. We don't really mind if we get a lot of people coming on. What's to worry about; we just want to enfranchise everybody.' That is not the way to proceed with something so important. If it is good enough in all our other forms of legislation that we ensure there are deadlines, constraints and principles, it is only common sense to say on the closure of the electoral roll that there ought to be a deadline and that people have to meet that deadline. We have heard a lot about the court case involving GetUp! The issue was comprehensively dealt with by the High Court, which ruled in favour of GetUp! 4-3 in a split decision. There were plenty of dissenting judgments, including one by Justice Heydon, which is particularly damning of what we would regard as the hypocrisy of the plaintiffs and the poor nature of their arguments. Justice Heydon said: The plaintiffs were prevented from exercising their entitlement because they failed to comply with simple obligations and procedures … … … All other voters outside the three exceptional classes who fail to enrol or transfer enrolment are the authors of their own misfortunes. They have not taken steps to enable them to vote which were not only available to them, but required of them by s.101. They are simple steps. It would have been very easy to take them. There was ample time to take them. … … It is they who disqualify, disenfranchise, exclude title themselves, not the legislature. … … The legislation placed no “burden” and no “disproportionate” burden. If there were any burden on anyone, it was a burden which those who bore it placed on their own shoulders. … … … There is a statutory command to claim or transfer enrolment. That command is backed by a criminal sanction. The plaintiffs did not dispute the constitutional validity of either the command or the sanction. What they demand is an entitlement to continue disobeying the command and ignoring the sanction for longer periods than the impugned provisions allow. This is a very sound dissenting judgment. What you hear from Justice Heydon goes to the heart of everything we do in this place and to what I regard as the biggest difference between the Labor Party and Liberal Party. What kind of society is it that we seek to set up? Is it one where responsibility is a key word, the responsibility of the individual to do the right thing, to look after themselves and to conduct themselves in accordance with the law or do we seek to make exemptions and allow people to get away with breaking the law? Justice Heydon is very clear in this regard. This is a law. It has a criminal sanction. It is required of people to be on the electoral roll. There was plenty of opportunity for people to access the electoral roll. Nobody is denying people the opportunity to enrol to vote. It has never been contended that anyone ought to have the right to … deny someone the right to vote, but they have to comply with the simple, as Justice Heydon puts it, procedures. It is very simple: all you have to do is get a form, fill it out and lodge it. There are very few other requirements today to get on the electoral roll, yet we have this contention that people are somehow be… ing disenfranchised. It is a completely odd or disenand bizarre contention, in my mind. We ought to pause and be very careful about this … because, while the High Court might have by a 4-3 judgment made a decision in that particular case, it is not outside the realms of possibility this will be revisited in the future. That very valid dissenting judgment by Justice Heydon may end up becoming the law and may end up becoming the majority view of the High Court. To simply say that this has happened and it is all over is wrong. It is a reasonable and plausible contention for the legislature of this country to say that people ought to comply with the law. There was no challenge to this part of the law that says you must be on the roll or you will face a sanction. This legislation before us today, as the member for Banks says, is reacting to the High Court, but there is a tension in democratic society between the judiciary and the legislature, and the legislature has a strong role to play. I am an advocate for the supremacy of the legislature. We are the people's house. We get voted here to put in place laws to govern society and ensure the smooth running of the Commonwealth, and the electoral roll is a fundamental tenet of what we do here. It is well within our rights as a parliament to pause and say that there are two very important parts of this legislation where we need to think about what we are doing. We need to be consistent with the Constitution on prisoner voting. On enrolments, we can validly say that people ought to comply with the existing law of the land-that is, comply with the requirements of the Electoral Act.",33
24,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"WerriwaParliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services) (10.14 am)-That was indeed a tortuous contribution by the member for Mitchell on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment and Prisoner Voting) Bill 2010. Arguments like, because we have particular provisions for who can be in parliament, it should follow that we have exactly the same conditions for voters, are preposterous. That is like saying that, because the United States says that a person born outside the United States cannot be President, no person born outside the United States should vote. Equally, there are age differentials in many countries between who can be in parliament and who can vote. In this country, we have a history of renunciation of citizenship of other countries being a requirement to get into parliament, which certainly every voter in the country does not have to prescribe to. That was a pathetic performance by the member for Mitchell. Similarly, he made the tortuous argument that, because in the GetUp! case the vote in the High Court was 4-3, somehow that makes the decision second rate-that essentially we can sit around for the next decade and not act on these matters because of the nature of the majority. I am a person who might feel very troubled by many decisions of our court-particularly in regard to immigration-but that does not give me the right to say that we do not have a Constitution in this country and that the parliament can do as it wants. To say it can sit around for decades, twiddling its thumbs and ignoring decisions by the High Court, is absolutely ridiculous. I do not want to dwell at length on the question of enrolment. I want to devote myself more to the question of prisoner voting. But, as the member for Banks indicates, after every election we have heard complaints by the coalition about massive corruption and we have had all these submissions by Amy MCGRATH and her group-and they have never, ever produced systematic, worthwhile, valuable evidence about electoral fraud in this country. After every election the number of people who have double-voted is minimal. They are usually found to be people with intellectual disabilities, aged people et cetera. There has never been systematic evidence of electoral fraud in this country. It also has to be noted that the numbers involved in this change in regard to the enrolment prescription are significant. In the last election, 57,732 voters had been enrolled and a further 40,408 voters had had their enrolment details updated. These are significant numbers of people whose votes would be voided by the provision of the previous government. As anybody who follows this issue knows, the predominance of these people have certain characteristics. They are overwhelmingly people who move more often than most, people who rent properties and people with lower economic circumstances. Quite frankly, the coalition's position is discriminatory. As the High Court noted, on moving to a situation where there was a seven-day allowance for re-enrolment, there was: … no compelling practical problem or difficulty in the operation of the electoral system. I want to turn to the question of prisoner ing. One would assume from some contributions that the kinds of people in prison are the same and always have been, that this is not subject to political decision making and that there cannot be any kind of bias in the way in which people are imprisoned. It is interesting to note an article by David Cole, ‘Hope and betrayal on death row', one of a series of articles he has written for the New York Review of Books. He noted that in the 1970s in the United States the incarceration rate was very similar to that of Europeroughly 100 people out of every 100,000 people went to jail. Today it is 700 per 100,000-a growth of seven times the number in the 1970s. They put that down to a tactic by the Republicans in the United States to portray themselves as anti-crime and to portray their political opponents, the Democrats, as pro Afro-American, pro-crime and against law and order. After that period of massive growth in the numbers incarcerated in the US, we saw a trend-predating the election of Obama-in many states of a movement back towards reduced severity, towards treatment, early release, parole, probation, and reduced use of mandatory sentences, because of the absolute cost. What interests me is the kinds of people who are in prison. They also show very distinct characteristics. In another article by David Cole in the New York Review of Books on 19 November 2009, he noted that in the United States Afro-Americans were 13 per cent of the population but 50 per cent of the prison population. He noted that, whilst their unemployment rate was twice, and their net worth was only one-fifth of, that of whites, they had an incarceration rate eight times higher. He also noted that 60 per cent of all young black men who had dropped out of high school had been to prison, but, for those who had a college education, it was only five per cent. More has been written about this in votthe United States than even in western Europe or Australia. In those figures we see a very distinct pattern of who goes to jail and who, it is argued, should be disenfranchised. They are overwhelmingly of black derivation, with poor eduction and low income. This of course has some political repercussions. In the article ‘The truly disenfranchised' by Jeff Manza, Christopher Uggen and Marcus Britton it was noted: Our results suggest that felon disfranchisement played a decisive role in several US. Senate elections, contributing to the Republican Senate majority of the early 1980s and mid-1990s. Moreover, at least one recent Democratic presidential victory would have been jeopardized had contemporary rates of disfranchisement prevailed during earlier periods. We saw this most nakedly in Florida some elections ago, where the state governor, brother of the President, illegally disenfranchised large numbers of, predominantly, blacks. In Florida at that stage they had a rule that you could not vote for the rest of your life if you had been in prison, but, as understand it, it only applied to people who offended inside Florida. Illegally, they scrapped from the rolls people-and they would have had no chance of getting back on them-who had served sentences in Tennessee, Kentucky, Idaho et cetera. That is an example of how these situations can lead to political outcomes. Florida has, since then, moved towards scrapping those laws. I congratulate the Kings College of London. They produce a very good website, which I would recommend to people, which talks about incarceration rates around the world and the numbers of people who can be affected by these laws. In 1992 the rate of incarceration in England and Wales was 90 per 100,000. The latest figure is 149 per 100,000-the same trend but not anywhere near as extreme as in the United States. More and more people are being incarcerated to the point where today UK prisons should be holding 77,000 people but they are holding 84,000. That is indicative of the large numbers of people who are disenfranchised. There was a person who took this matter to the European Court of Human Rights. People might be aware that the UK parliament has, in the last few weeks, started to bow to a European Court of Human Rights decision which was made back in 2004. British governments, Labor and Conservative, have been trying to avoid the outcomes of this decision made seven years ago. Now that they are facing a bill of $143 million in compensation to prisoners they are deciding that they might abide by the decision. Last week they voted in the House of Commons, by 234 to 22, to tell the European Court to jump, but in the end they will do what they are told. The situation was that there was a prisoner dom. serving a 27-year sentence for manslaughter. He educated himself and he read a book that I said that through political pressure and by activity you can affect politics. He set about this challenge to the European Court and eventually succeeded. Around the world there are very different attitudes towards voting by prisoners. Some countries nominally allow prisoner voting but in practice do not. Cyprus says, ‘Yes, you can vote, but you have to be allowed out of jail on the day.' Slovakia says, ‘You can vote,' but does not give people facilities to vote. But the German Constitution-not the laws of the government but the Constitution-says, ‘We should encourage people to vote.' I had the opportunity a decade ago to go to the Netherlands, to a jail near Groningen, to see prisoners there. I have mentioned this in parliament before. Ironically, the Netherlands is very liberal-it might have changed with conservative governments over the last few years-and has the most advanced prison system in the world. This is not Left liberalism of the 1960s and 1970s. They had a royal commission into jails straight after the Second World War. The Dutch political establishment had been in jail under the Nazis and they thought it would be a good idea to have good prison conditions. In the Netherlands the political parties actually campaign in the prisons. It may interest anyone here to know that virtually every prison guard at that prison is a university graduate rather than a retired policeman. As I said, it is very different in different places around the world but in general most European Western progressive liberal countries that we associate ourselves with have go extremely liberal provisions on this front. As I noted, the European Court is very strongly enforcing prisoner rights in the United KingIn Australia we have not been immune from the increasing number of people being put in jails. Australia's rate varies but New South Wales is the most extreme case. I have to give a bit of a plaudit to the state opposition. The shadow Attorney-General has indicated that the matter is so serious that he intends taking very strong measures, if the Liberals are elected, to reduce the number of people in prison. It is a very ironic situation for the Liberal-National parties to be in but that is the policy they have come to because the situation is so serous. In Australia 140 people per 100,000 are incarcerated. That rate has grown very greatly. In 1992 it was about 90 per 100,000. So it has increased from 90 to 140 per 100,000 in the course of 20 years. We are talking about significant numbers of people who are incarcerated. We are talking about people who predominantly have certain characteristics. People in prison often have intellectual disabilities are often illiteraround ate. Large numbers of people are only in prison because they have not been able to get a stable job and were not able to survive in our society. Many of those people would be disenfranchised. You could have a situation in a country where the rates of incarceration are so high that it has political dimensions. The kind of people being imprisoned and the number of them are such that political decisions will be different. You could have a government which legislates to put more and more of these people in jail. That has been the trend in the United States in particular. In Australia an Indigenous woman, Vicki Roach, took up the cause. She shows that people can recover and make a contribution. She did a masters degree. She studied and saw the need for people like herself to have a voice. I commend both parts of the legislation. Returning to the theme of the member for Mitchell, we cannot have a situation where people blithely say that it is irrelevant that the High Court did this because the decision was 4-3 and it might be reversed next week, or that some judge might die and be replaced by a conservative or that this and that might happen. All these are excuses as to why the High Court should be ignored, but it is really a mask for having provisions, particularly in relation to the enrolment period, that seek to make things more difficult for people. Under the guise of concern about fraudfraud that has not been evidenced or proven-they seek to make it difficult for people to enrol. There is a whole history of this, including the requirements for how people enrol, the time period for enrolment and identification requirements. All we have here is a systematic long-term approach by the coalition to say that this country is dreadful. Its world-renowned Australian Electoral Commission, respected in most countries the world and used for electoral observation in so many countries, is so incompetent and stupid that it cannot police the alleged fraud by which people get rights that they should not have. We know the reality: the Australian Electoral Commission is world renowned and we have one of the best electoral systems in the world. These excuses should not be used to justify disenfranchising people and making it more difficult for people to participate in our society.",36
25,Mrs MIRABELLA,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Indi) (10.28 am)The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment and Prisoner Voting) Bill 2010 contains two minor, non-controversial amendments which deal, firstly, with a prisoner being able to remain on the electoral roll even if they are prevented from voting and, secondly, an insertion in the interpretive provision to ensure that references in the Electoral Act to an ‘election for a division' or similar expressions can operate in the event of a half Senate election held independently of an election for the House of Representatives. The coalition has no issue with these two non-controversial amendments but, as you have heard, it certainly does have concerns with the two issues dealing with prisoner voting and the closure of the rolls. At the outset, I want to say that it is right and fitting that any government remains vigilant and makes changes that are necessary to improve the integrity of our voting and enrolment system. But, as we know, often much does not change with government legislation and often such change is not for the better but makes schemes worse, and when you are dealing with the very foundations of our parliamentary democracy that can be a very dangerous thing. The Howard government was very vigilant about trying to improve our electoral system and a number of bills were passed to strengthen and protect it. At the core of our electoral system is the joint Commonwealthstate electoral roll, which of course is used for the conduct of all elections at the local, state and federal levels. For as long as there have been political systems there have been jokes and stories, and indeed legends, about the rorting of the electoral roll-about dead people voting, about cats voting and other dodgy practices. Until very recently the integrity of the roll has been based largely on trust, and still is to a certain degree. It is much easier to present yourself on election day to vote than it is to join up at your local video store, and some people find that a rather peculiar situation. It was only under the Howard government in 1997 that the AEC commenced a process of continuous roll updates, which of course include mailing and door-knocking campaigns to help ensure that the roll is as rate as possible. In 2006 the coalition introduced legislation saying that the rolls would close for new enrolments at 8 pm on the day that the writs were issued, and for changes to existing enrolments they would close three days after the issue of the writs, and it did so notwithstanding the concerns regarding potential disenfranchisement with an early closing of the rolls. The government was concerned, and quite rightly so, about the potential for electoral fraud associated with high levels of enrolment activity during the existing seven-day period. Putting aside the hysteria and the extraordinary claims, let us just have a look at the facts for a moment. In 2004 the number of transactions that the AEC had to process concerning enrolments and changing of addresses was 520,000. In 2007, after the change to the close of the electoral roll to an earlier time, that number dropped to 263,000. This enabled the AEC to deal with those fewer changes in a more efficient and, very importantly, a more accurate manner. It is critical to note that together with the change in the legislation the government did make more money available to the AEC so that they could conduct more aggressive campaigns to get people enrolled in a timely manner. Those of us who were mindful to these matters will recall very extensive television and print media campaigns to get people to change their enrolment details or to enrol, and that started some months before the election. Under the existing legislation, it is the obligation of an individual to enrol once they attain the age of 18 or become a citizen. It is an imperative and thought to be a sufficiently serious responsibility that it is a criminal offence not to do so. So it is important to realise that it is not just about the rush to try to get people on the roll at the last minute. accu- Where you can have integrity issues and where you can have stacking and fraud, particularly in marginal seats with people putting themselves on the roll at the last minute, having a prolonged campaign to get people on the roll is the proper way to appease those concerns about people being disenfranchised. It is a balancing act, and a sophisticated democracy like Australia can surely be organised enough in the administration of its laws, including its electoral laws, to do what it can in between elections to ensure that electoral rolls are as accurate as possible and people are encouraged to change their details when it is appropriate. In 2004 when there were an extra seven days for enrolling as a new voter and an additional three days to get your address transferred, fewer than 168,400 missed the deadline with that longer period. But with the shorter deadline-that is, when you had to be on by 8 pm on the day the writs were issued, if you were a new enrolee, or you had three days to change your address-we only had 100,370 people who missed the deadline. Not only did we see fewer transactions, we actually saw a drop in the numbers of people who tried to enrol and were unsuccessful because they had missed the deadline. This proved the strength of a strong and concerted campaign to get people on the roll or to amend their details. Those of us who have been involved in public debate and in politics for some time can point to a number of examples where individual seats, or in fact governments, can be decided by the narrowest of margins-or in some cases not even decided, as is the current situation in the federal parliament. Let us just have a look at one of these examples. The 1996 Mundingburra by-election in the state of Queensland is a classic case in point. The state election of 1995 saw the Goss government returned with a majority of one seat. The result of that election hung on this seat. The Mundingburra electorate, where the incumbent Labor candidate had been declared successful, had a margin of just 16 votes. Of course, as is normally the case with such narrow margins, this was disputed by the Liberal Party. When the Court of Disputed Returns declared the result in this electorate void and ordered a by-election, it obviously showed us yet again how critical it is to get the integrity of the rolls and the voting system right. Ultimately the seat was won by the Liberal candidate. As we know, as a consequence the state Labor government lost and the coalition became the new government for Queensland. So let's not get hysterical and be dismissive or glib about the absolute importance of getting the integrity of the electoral rolls right. A handful of votes can and do matter. They have mattered in the past, they matter now and they will matter in the future. The fact is that there have been documented incidents of electoral fraud in the past, and for those who say we have the best system in the world and there have not been significant cases of electoral fraud, we are not perfect. Of course we do not have a dodgy system akin to some nondemocratic-I am trying to be politically correct here because I do not want to cause a diplomatic incident. But we are not some tinpot nation that gives lip service to democracy. That does not mean we are perfect and that does not mean that there is not fraud. There is. In fact, we have had documented evidence in the past and all we need to do is go through the history books and have a look at our political history to see some of these examples. I do not know why Queensland throws up such interesting political examples, but it does. If we go back to Queensland and we fast forward five years to the year 2000 in North Queensland, we see the state Labor candidate in Thuringowa, a former Townsville city councillor, plead guilty to 24 counts of forging Commonwealth electoral forms. She was sentenced to three years imprisonment. So, yes, of course we are not as bad as some of the worse countries on earth, and of course our electoral system is something that many would consider enviable, but that does not mean we cannot improve it and it does not mean that there is not fraud. We all remember when political parties change and alter voting systems to favour themselves. We all remember when Neville Wran changed to optional preferential voting in New South Wales, because he saw that by conducting three-cornered contests with compulsory preferences the Liberal and National parties were able to maximise their amalgamated support and were able to defeat Labor candidates more easily. Introducing optional preferential voting, effectively minimising the impact of the amalgamated so-called ‘conservative vote', proved very successful-so much so for the Labor Party that Queensland followed that model. But now that we see a different situation in Queensland, where there is one major non-Labor party, the Premier, who finds that the Greens preferences are now working against her, is looking to change the legislation to go back to a compulsory preferential system because that will assist the Labor Party with Greens preferences. The Labor Party, being the larger party, would of course benefit from that. So we do have a history where political parties do change-some would say manipulate-voting methods to suit their own political purposes. To return to the bill, if we look at the High Court decisions that relate to the questions of the difference in the time made available, in the case of Rowe and the Commonwealth we see that there are some very strong judgments given by dissenting judges. Three of Their Honours supported the plaintiff and the 2006 provisions were struck down, and three of Their Honours, with separate judgments, supported the argument that the enactments were valid and that they should stand. Justice Heydon made some very important points when he noted: The legislation placed no “burden”, and no “disproportionate” burden. If there were any burden on anyone, it was a burden which those who bore it placed on their own shoulders. … … … There is a statutory command to claim or transfer enrolment. That command is backed by a criminal sanction. The plaintiffs did not dispute the constitutional validity of either the command or the sanction. What they demand is an entitlement to continue disobeying the command and ignoring the sanction for longer periods than the impugned provisions allow. There is much more to this debate that will follow. These are important issues that do concern people out there in the community, and I am sure that we have not seen the last of judicial consideration of these particular matters, so let's not be under the illusion that these legal issues are settled once and for all. If we turn to the issue of prisoner voting, I think the member for Mackellar made some very important points. The Howard government took the view that a person who was serving a custodial sentence should be denied that franchise because they had volunteered up the right through the actions that resulted in their custodial sentence in the first place. If you commit offences against society sufficient to warrant a prison term then you should not be entitled to vote and elect the members of the society whose laws you have disregarded. It is as simple as that and a very decent principle by which we stand-as do most Australians. (Time expired)",39
26,Ms HALL,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"It is a pleasure to follow the member for Indi because she always gives me good information to dispute. When we look at the issue we are debating, which is the closure of the rolls, it is interesting that she highlighted in her contribution the fact that governments change laws to favour themselves. It is also interesting, when we look at her reference to the High Court decision on this issue, that she concentrated on the dissenting judgments, because they favoured her argument, rather than on those judges who supported the majority verdict. The member for Indi is always a person who will speak on a piece of legislation or a motion and really distort the facts in some way to give an interesting view of the legislation or motion before the parliament. The legislation that we are debating today is the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment and Prisoner Voting) Bill 2010, which gives effect to majority decisions of the High Court. I rise in this place to acknowledge those decisions and to work to see that the problems that were identified in Rowe v Electoral Commissioner are rectified, because that is what this legislation is about. In both Rowe and Roach the High Court declared that certain amendments to bring about the early closure of the rolls and to disqualify all prisoners from voting were invalid. This bill will update the text of the Electoral Act to reflect the current constitutional position. That will restore the close of the rolls to a period of seven days after the date of the writs for the election and reinstate the previous disqualification of prisoners serving a sentence of imprisonment of three years or longer. One of the really good sources of information relating to this legislation is the Report on the conduct of the 2007 federal election and matters related thereto, from the inquiry conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. It made some very good points. I refer to the section in chapter 3 that talks about enabling the franchise. It highlights that when we are looking at enrolment it is about getting the appropriate balance between ensuring that those people who are qualified to vote are able to exercise their vote and ensuring the integrity of the electoral roll. It then goes on to talk about whether the changes that were brought in under the Howard government were actually about ensuring the maximum ability for people to cast their vote or whether they were really distorting the electoral rolls so that those people whom the Howard government perceived were less likely to vote for them would be disenfranchised. The background to this legislation is highlighted in the report. The report goes through the history of voting in Australia and enrolling to vote in Australia. It has always been the case that Australia has had an inclusive entitlement to vote. That was fully established in 1962, when all Aboriginal people were granted the right to vote. It has gone through a process, but generally the aim of the changes that have been made has been to absolutely ensure that everyone who is entitled to vote can vote and that that vote is based on Australian citizenship. That changed when the Howard government came to power, because instead of working to maximise the ability of people to cast their vote, they looked at ways that they could restrict the number of people whom they perceived were less likely to support them in a ballot. People who were identified as being more likely to enrol at the last moment were people who were homeless, people who were itinerant and people who were young. In the lead-up to the last election, a number of young people came into my office who attended local high schools and were trying to enrol to vote. They had only just turned 18. They had not been 18 for very long at all. They wanted to cast their vote, but they were denied the ability to enrol and cast their vote in the last federal election because of the change that was introduced under the Howard government that prevented them from enrolling. The early close of the rolls was opposed in a number of areas. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission submission to the committee inquiry, I thought, was very impressive. It started by saying: A healthy democracy makes sure that all members of a community have equal access to the political process. It went on to highlight that we are a democratic nation, that politicians are elected by popular vote and that to actually maximise that democracy you need to ensure that all people are registered. The report highlighted the fact that the commission was very concerned about the early closing of the rolls because of the disenfranchisement of many Australians, particularly those that I mentioned before, that are marginalised: young people, Indigenous Australians, people in remote and rural areas, homeless, itinerant or ill people or people with some sort of intellectual disability or, for that matter, any disability because they find it more difficult to access the paperwork that they need to complete before they can enrol. The early closure of the rolls was also opposed by a number of community groups, groups representing the disadvantaged and rural Australians. I must be upfront with the House and say the changes did have some support. My reading of this report showed that the Liberal Party of Australia supported the closing of the rolls when the writs were issued, as did the Festival of Light Australia. The report shows that the majority of the submissions received by the committee supported the closing of the rolls seven days after the writs were issued but that the Liberal Party of Australia supported retaining closure at the time of the issuing of the writs. They felt so strongly about it that they prepared a dissenting report. It supported the previous scheme and supported the disenfranchising of all those Australians that actually wanted to enrol to vote. Now might be an appropriate time for me to mention the Canadian system. The Canadian system of voting is based on maximising the ability of people to vote, it is based on trying to ensure that no voters are disenfranchised and voters in Canada can enrol to vote on the day of the election. Provided that they can show the appropriate identification and verify that they are who they say they are and that they live where they say they live, they can enrol on the day of the election and they can vote. I am not advocating the Canadian system, but I am showing the two extremes here. The Liberal Party want to close the rolls on the day the writs are issued and the Canadian system allows people to enrol on the day of the election. I think what has been recommended in the legislation before us today is appropriate. It gets the balance right between ensuring people are not disenfranchised and ensuring the integrity of the roll. I know that in the community, in the electorate that I represent in this parliament, people do support the notion that if a person wishes to vote they should be able to vote. They support a system that ensures maximum flexibility of the electoral roll and, at the same time, ensures the integrity of the roll. I noted that the member for Indi was talking about political parties and the voting systems in different states. She seemed to refer a lot to Queensland. We all in this House remember the Joh Bjelke-Petersen years when there definitely was not a system of oneperson one-vote and the government of the day distorted the system of putting the same value on each person's vote. I am sure the member for Indi would be very supportive of that system being reintroduced not only in Queensland but throughout the whole of Australia whereas we on this side of the parliament believe that we should have a fair system of voting that is part of our democratic process and that reflects the overall voting pattern of people within the community. We should not seek to introduce laws that will prevent people that we as members of parliament feel may not support our particular party or ideology. This is important legislation because it is about enfranchising people to vote. The other aspect of the legislation, which refers to Roach v Electoral Commissioner, refers to the disqualification of all prisoners serving a sentence. What this legislation does is reinstate the previous disqualifications of prisoners serving a sentence longer than three years. This is a very fair provision, and it will be constitutional, not like those changes made by the Howard government. This legislation is very good legislation. It is fair lation. It is about ensuring that Australians are not disenfranchised from voting when they choose to enrol. It is maximising the ability of all Australians to enrol to vote when a federal election has been called.",42
27,Mr SLIPPER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment and Prisoner Voting) Bill 2010 contains a mixture of objectives, some of which are supported by everyone in the parliament and some of which are opposed by the Liberal-National opposition. I say at the outset that it is vital that all elected representatives in the Australian parliament recognise that it is important to have an electoral system with integrity so that, when an election is called and the result of the election is known, the people of Australia get the government that they actually voted for. It is very, very important in a modern democracy like Australia that our electoral system be open and transparent, free and fair, and equitable because, frankly, we are a country that has had democracy continuously and we are the envy of many other countries around the globe who do not share our long history of democratic electoral tradition. That is not to say that members on both sides of the House cannot differ on the fine points of what ought to be in the electoral law. I would like to mention briefly a couple of items which are non-controversial amendments and which are not being opposed by the Liberal-National opposition. The first amendment permits a person who is incarcerated to remain on the electoral roll even if the law prevents that particular person from exercising a vote. The second is the insertion of an interpretive provision to ensure that references in the Electoral Act to ‘an election for a division', or similar expressions, can operate in the event of a half-Senate election held independently from an election of the House of Representatives. As I said, those legisamendments are not being opposed by the opposition. They are sensible amendments. The first one is practical and the second one clarifies something that possibly ought to have been clarified in the legislation before. However, I have a very great concern about the attempt by the government, following a High Court decision, to reinsert into the electoral law a provision which would permit people who have been imprisoned-for offences of which they have been convictedto vote in an election. Surely, voting in an election is a very important right and, at times, that right should be suspended when the conduct of a person has resulted in imprisonment, being locked away and not being allowed to operate as everyone else does, as an ordinary citizen going about their daily life. What I am suggesting is that, for the period a person is incarcerated, it does not seem unreasonable to me that such a person should be denied the opportunity to vote in an election. The decision made by the High Court was not a wide-ranging decision. When one looks at what the government is proposing in this legislation, one would imagine that the High Court has mandated that the proposed amendments in the bill with respect to prisoner voting ought to be implemented in full. The opposition response to the High Court decision was contained in the opposition members' dissenting report to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report on the 2007 election. While that dissent has been stated before, I will restate it here in the House today. The members said: We acknowledge the High Court's decision in Roach, but we also note that the Court only gave a narrow decision in relation to a blanket exclusion, and did not seek to invalidate the general principle that the franchise may be removed from certain prisoners. It is the view of the Coalition that voting should be denied to those who are currently serving full-time custodial sentences of one year or longer. … This would align the voting disqualification with the disqualification from being a Member of Parliament, at s.44(ii) of the Australian Constitution: Any person who … has been convicted and is under sentence, or subject to be sentenced, for any offence punishable under the law of the Commonwealth or of a state by imprisonment from one year or longer … shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or member of the House of Representatives. We have a concern that what the government is proposing will diminish the integrity of the electoral roll and will permit people who, in our view, ought not to be permitted to exercise a vote because they are imprisoned. That is why the opposition will not support what the government is suggesting. With respect to electoral enrolment, there is a concern that the Australian Electoral Commission, while it is a body with very great integrity, clearly has limited resources, and the flood of enrolments which have occurred in the past following the announcement of an election has meant that it is virtually impossible for the Australian Electoral Commission to follow the usual, thorough processes it does to make sure that those people who seek to get on the electoral roll are in fact eligible to do so. Prior to 2006, the close of rolls for a federal election was set at seven days after the issue of writs. In 2006, the parliament decided that, for new enrolments, the electoral roll would be closed at eight o'clock in the evening of the day the writs were issued and, with respect to changes to existing enrolments, three days after the writs were issued. It has been pointed out by the opposition that the reason that the then government took this view and the then parliament supported that view was their concern about the possibility of electoral fraud associated with high levels of enrolment activity during the seven-day enrolment period which existed prior to 2006. Elections are held in a cycle. There is an election for the House of Representatives approximately every three years. There is an ongoing obligation on citizens to enrol to vote as soon as they are eligible to do so. In fact, the Commonwealth Electoral Act even makes provision for people not yet 18 years of age to provisionally enrol in the event that an election is called for a date not very far after they will turn 18. So there is already a provision for a young person who is approaching the age of 18 years to be able to get on the electoral roll. If people were doing their duty and getting on the electoral roll as soon as they are able to and if people were prepared to change their electoral enrolment details as soon as they moved then there would be no reason at all for the amendments currently before the chamber. I have a great concern because in the electorate of Fisher I have seen vast numbers of new enrolments and it was simply not possible to identify those people. We wrote to some of those people and much of the correspondence came back unclaimed. So, if these people ever did live at the addresses they were seeking enrolment for, they certainly did not live there a very short time after their name went on the electoral roll for that electorate. I believe it is important for the Australian Electoral Commission to be able to do its job in an orderly and timely way. It ought to be able to check the veracity of the details of people seeking to join the electoral roll. It entirely unreasonable for us to ask the Australian Electoral Commission to make sure that the electoral roll has integrity when we have a huge flood of people seeking enrolment after an election is called. Everyone knows when an election is approaching and there is ample opportunity for good citizens to get on the electoral roll in a timely way so their enrolment details are able to be checked by the Electoral Commission to make sure that, as far as possible, only people entitled to be enrolled are enrolled. All of us know that the Electoral Commission works extremely hard in the run-up to a polling day, so we ought to support anything we can do to ease that workload, to minimise mistakes and to avoid dodgy and fraudulent enrolments. The existing time frames are practical, sensible and reasonable and they do assist in maintaining the integrity of the electoral roll. The amendments the government is proposing undermine the integrity of the electoral roll, and I do not believe these amendments will be supported by the community at large. The government ought to reconsider the proposal with respect to the closure of the electoral roll. The seven-day period is unnecessary. It places additional demands on the AEC and its staff. It creates a mad flurry of activity and increases the possibility of mistakes. For 365 days a year voters are able to enrol and change their details. I do not believe we ought to risk the integrity of our electoral roll to assist those people who do not carry out their community duty and enrol as they are required to under the law of Australia. Regarding those people who launched the High Court action after missing the enrolment deadline just prior to the 2010 election, Mr Justice Heydon on the High Court bench said: is They are simple steps. It would have been very easy to take them. There was ample time to take them. … … … It is they who disqualify, disenfranchise, exclude or disentitle themselves, not the legislature. I believe the government ought to heed the very sound words of Mr Justice Heydon. The High Court decision was a four to three ruling. Admittedly, it becomes part of the law of Australia because there was a majority on the High Court, but it was a very close decision. The government will say that this bill formalises the decision of the High Court, but I believe that the bill goes beyond what the High Court actually said. All of us have heard stories of cats and dogs and even of goldfish being placed on the electoral roll. Although it is funny, it does not assist the integrity of the system. We need to make sure that the Australian community does not disengage from the political system. When one hears of mistakes or oversights and sees cats, dogs and goldfish enrolled, it is really very unfortunate. I am not for a moment suggesting that the Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity wants to see cats, dogs and goldfish enrolled-I am sure he does not want to go to kennels, pick up dogs and put them on the electoral roll; I would not suggest that for a moment, because I do have very high regard for the minister-but I think the minister's brief in this matter is flawed. He ought not to be seeking to make the amendments that he is. Australians over the years have had an electoral system which has been admired and respected. The Australian Electoral Commission is often asked to send observers to other countries to assist them to conduct fair and free elections. We in Australia have the right to vote freely and without reprisal, and that the way it should be. We do not face the threat of assault or beatings if we do not vote a certain way, we do not have the risk of riots in the streets and we do not face the fear of losing our lives or having our fingers chopped off, as has been faced by some in Afghanistan, but this does not mean that we should now become excessively complacent with respect to the integrity of our electoral system. While we might not agree with the result of an election, it is always important that we respect the process. It is important that we have an electoral system of integrity. While I believe honestly that the government does also share that belief, in my view the amendments before the chamber today go some distance towards reducing the integrity of the electoral system. Frankly, I do not think that is a good thing for the electoral system and I do not think it is a good thing for Australia. I ask the government, through the minister, to reconsider these retrograde amendments.",45
28,Mr GRAY,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity) (11.14 am)-in reply-I thank all of those who participated in this debate. There have been 17 contributors; they have varied, and probed and made observations on the nature of these amendments. But in essence there is one golden thread that runs through the commentary on all sides of this House, and that is the importance of our electoral system and the great good fortune that it bestows on our nation. When it comes to our electoral law and its integrity the important thing is that we do actually believe in the ballot and we do believe in democratic elections. As we look at troubled regions around the world as we speak here today we can only reflect again on the great wisdom of our forefathers and of the great contribution that our democracy is and the Electoral Act itself bring to this place. All of those who have contributed to the debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment and Prisoner Voting) Bill 2010 have made a range of observations, but the bill gives effect to two decisions of the High Court. The first decision, which relates to the close of the rolls period, is Rowe v Electoral Commissioner as decided on 6 August 2010. The second, which relates to prisoner voting, is Roach v Electoral Commissioner as decided on 30 August 2007. This bill responds to these matters that were found to be constitutionally invalid, and it responds by removing provisions added to the Electoral Act in 2006. As I said when I introduced the bill into the parliament in November of last year, it is appropriate for the parliament to respond to these decisions of the High Court to ensure that the Commonwealth Electoral Act reflects the current state of the law. The shadow minister has claimed that the bill is politically motivated; this is wrong. The purpose of this bill is to ensure that the electoral law in this area complies with Australia's paramount law: the Constitution. I find it remarkable that the shadow minister would oppose such an action. Allow me to summarise the key measures contained in this bill. The bill updates the Electoral Act to reflect the current constitutional position as declared by the High Court to restore the close of the rolls period to seven days after the date of the issuance of the writs for a federal election, be that a double dissolution election, a House of Representatives election, a House of Representatives and a half-Senate election, a halfSenate election, a by-election or a referendum. The close of rolls period helps to ensure eligible voters are able to exercise obligation to enrol and thence their right to vote. The bill also reinstates the 2006 provisions that the disqualification from voting at a federal election covers prisoners serving a sentence of imprisonment of three years or longer. Furthermore, the bill provides that while people serving a sentence of imprisonment for three years or longer would be disqualified from voting they may remain on or be added to the electoral roll. This gives effect to a recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters following its inquiry into the 2007 federal election. The bill also addresses an anomaly in the Electoral Act regarding certain references to an election for a division, or similar expressions. An interpretive provision in the bill enables such references to operate in the event of a half-Senate election that is held independently from an election of the House of Representatives. Consequential amendments to be made to the Referendum Machinery Provisions Act 1984 would ensure consistency with the Electoral Act. I note that the shadow minister has foreshadowed moving an amendment to provide that persons serving a sentence of imprisonment of one year or more cannot exercise their right to vote. The government will not be supporting this amendment on the basis of good and proper reasons, including the long standing view of this parliament and legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department. I am happy to discuss this further during the consideration in detail stage of this bill. The government believes that it is an important bill that is necessary to ensure that the electoral legislation complies with the requirements of the Australian Constitution. Again, I would like to thank all the members who contributed to the debate on this bill, their and I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",48
29,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"by leave-I move opposition amendments: (1) Schedule 2, item 2, page 9 (line 23), omit “3 years”, substitute “1 year”. (2) Schedule 2, item 3, page 10 (line 8), omit “3 years”, substitute “1 year”. (3) Schedule 2, item 3, page 10 (line 11), omit “3 years”, substitute “1 year”. (4) Schedule 2, item 3, page 10 (line 19), omit “3 years”, substitute “1 year”. (5) Schedule 2, item 3, page 10 (line 22), omit “3 years”, substitute “1 year”. I agree with the Special Minister of State that this is an important issue, and the fact that 17 members have chosen to speak on it indicates that it is seen by the members of the House to be important. I would like to support my amendments on two bases. The import of my amendments are to lower the disqualification period for prisoners from three years to one year, and that would bring it in line with the one-year period that the Constitution provides in section 44(ii) where a person, being a member of parliament or standing as a member of parliament: Is attainted of treason, or has been convicted and is under sentence, or subject to be sentenced, for any offence punishable under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State by imprisonment for one year or longer … … … … … shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. It seems to me that the argument that the provision of the right to vote and the right to be selected and to sit in the parliament are unconnected is not a good argument. Indeed, the High Court in its majority judgment in Roach v Electoral Commissioner specifically said-and they were Justices Gummow, Kirby and Crennan-that the Commonwealth had argued: … that whatever implication or principle may be evident in the grounds in s 44(ii) for disqualificarobbery tion of senators and members, and of candidates for election, s 44(ii) is disconnected from consideration of the validity of the denial by s 93(8AA) of the exercise of the franchise. The court said: That submission should be rejected as being too wide. In other words, the connection does maintain. If you look at state governments, they have a variety of disqualification periods, from no disqualification, to one year, to three years, to five years and so on. It is important that here at the Commonwealth level we set a true basis for the decision that we as a parliament exercise the right given to us in the Constitution to determine when the franchise can be exercised, and more particularly in what circumstances you can be disqualified from exercising that right to vote, which is seen as being part of what a citizen does when they are part of the community. But in addition to that I want to point out that, on a practical level, whereas the court in that narrow 4-3 decision said that any person who is subject to a prison sentence should be disqualified for voting was too broad, very often a dissenting judgement in a High Court case subsequently becomes the prevailing decision of the day because the High Court is not bound by its own decisions. I also want to point out, as I did in the course of my speech in the second reading debate, that the nature of the criminality of people who are serving sentences of less than two years is really very significant. I cited three examples, and I will cite them again because it is important that we know just what sort of person we are talking about when we say they should be disqualified while serving that sentence. One person is serving two years for aggravated burglary, false imprisonment, armed and theft. The victim of the attack was tied to a chair with an electrical cord, doused with kerosene, forced to eat dog food and hit over the head with a broom handle. The attacker stole a number of items from the man and forced him to disclose his ATM PIN before robbing his bank account of $300. If we pass my amendment, this offender would not be allowed to vote. If the government's position of three years is maintained, he will be entitled to vote-as indeed will this person with a 2½-year sentence: a teacher who sexually abused three young boys at school and on camping trips in Western Australia. He lured children into his office block, stripped them down-I will not going into further details. A boy was assaulted. Another boy was assaulted in a tent on a camping trip, as were two other boys under 14 and so on. He got 2½ years. Under my amendment as moved, he cannot vote. (Time expired)",49
30,Mr HAWKE,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I rise to support the member for Mackellar's fine amendments to this proposed legislation from the government on the basis that we have heard in this debate a number of things that I do not think are valid in relation to prisoner voting. It is important that we take note of some of these arguments as we move forward from this juncture. I do not think it is right that member for Werriwa comes in and says that people who are in prison are highly illiterate, they are uneducated, they are on the wrong side of society so, therefore, we ought to grant them the vote. I have no doubt that may be the case with many people who are in prison, but surely our responsibility as a society is to deal with those issues and assist those people with their problems, not say, ‘Well here is a great gift of enfranchisement of voting within our society.' That is why I find this a necessary amendment to the legislation that is proposed to the House today, because the government is seriously proposing to enfranchise people who are serving custodial sentences of one year or longer for really no logical basis. There is no real argument that has been put forward here in this House today, other than the member for Werriwa's bizarre interpretation that theoretically could be one day, according to one academic that he read out, a large number of people who were imprisoned who all of a sudden would then need to have the right to vote against the legislators who had imprisoned them-presumably on some sort of false basis. If you are finding that a bizarre argument, Mr Deputy Speaker, I can tell you I found it quite a bizarre academic argument as well. The reality is, as the member for Mackellar has pointed out, there are people who have committed serious offences serving custodial sentences who will vote on who legislates in this society. I do not understand how that is a better outcome for us. I do not understand why the government wants to pursue this as such a matter of importance, considering that really this has no impact upon the electoral system, other than we must set those foundational principles as a society which says, ‘If you commit these acts, you ought not to have the right to vote.' We have already heard that the Constitution states that you cannot serve as a member or a senator in this place with a custodial sentence of a year. It is a fine instrument from Federation, in the very foundation of the law of our land, that gives the setting and the message that they wanted to send-that is, prisoners serving a custodial sentence of one year or more could not serve here. If they cannot serve here then it would be odd to extend the vote to ensure that they can vote on who does serve here. It is an odd setting, and that is why I think it is a very worthy amendment. The member for Mackellar also proposed another amendment, which is also very worthy. In this case, the government has failed to outline the guiding principles that it wants to see as a government in terms of the integrity of the electoral roll. Again, this is this tenthere sion between the judicial and legislative branches in our society. It is the role of the legislature to set policy. It is the role of the legislature to spell out its intentions in legislation. We ought not to be afraid of that. When we stand here looking at this fundamental guiding principle for our democracy-who gets the right to vote and when I do not have a problem with standing on the right side of ensuring that people have an obligation to put themselves on the electoral roll. They have a legal command obligation with a sanction at law to do so-an imperative that forces them to do so. I find the legislation before the House, with these two particular sections, to be reactionary. The legislation is looking at the High Court's judgements in a very narrow way and not looking at the full implications of where we believe we should head as a society. These two very fine amendments from the member for Mackellar ought to be thoroughly supported by the House.",50
31,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I am making the case out by example to give effect, virtually, to the considerations of the High Court that said that the question of disenfranchising a persondisqualifying them from the right to vote-is a very, very serious issue. It has to be a ous matter that causes that disenfranchisement. I am making the case that three years for people whose disenfranchisement from voting would otherwise be seen to be seriously justified is too long, whereas the oneyear period would accommodate the High Court's decision, because the High Court makes it quite clear that under the Constitution members of parliament are given the right to determine when disenfranchisement may occur. As of 30 June 2006, when the 2006 legislation was passed, there were 20,209 prisoners in Australia serving a sentence. That is distinct from 5,581 who were either on remand or unsentenced-we are only dealing with prisoners under sentence. Of the 20,209 prisoners, 35 per cent were serving two years or less. That is why I chose to give the two examples of people serving a two-year sentence and a 2½-year sentence, and I will give another example of a person serving a twoyear sentence. A man who possessed, accessed and transmitted child pornography was among 19 men arrested in Australia by the AFP as part of a 12-month global child abuse investigation. The charges relate to more than 10,000 images and 250 videos. Many of the people on these types of sex charges do seem to get a sentence which is under three years. I would like to contrast that with the situawords, tion for a member of parliament or somebody who is seeking to be elected to the parliament and section 44 of the Constitution. There are two relatively recent examples of how this applies. One was Keith Wright, who was the Labor member for Capricornia from 1983 to 1993. He was sentenced to eight years jail on 28 October 1993 for child sex offences. He was charged in August 1992 while still a member of parliament but he was not sentenced till after the election. He did attempt to stand for the 1993 election as serian Independent, but he was, of course, not elected. Had he been elected he would have been unable to take his place in the parliament because of section 44 of the Constitution. Another example was Andrew Theophanous, the Labor member for Burke, who was charged, found guilty and sentenced to six years jail for bribery, conspiracy and defrauding the Commonwealth in relation to immigration matters. He too attempted to seek election as an Independent and was soundly defeated, but had he been elected he would not have been permitted to take his seat in this place because his sentence was for one year or more. So I think there is a very sound argument for setting in place a truly sensible situation with regard to disallowing prisoners to vote and make it the same period as operates for members and senators being unable to be chosen or take their place in the parliament or continue to sit in the parliament if they are so sentenced. In putting this proposition forward, I would point out that over the years there have been a variety of terms. It began in 1902 with one year-I think they got it right. In 1983 the Labor Party government put it up to five years. It went back to three years. When the High Court was giving its deliberations in Roach, it found very simply that three years was still constitutional. In other the parliament has the right to determine the matter.",51
32,Mr GRAY,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity) (11.34 am)The government will not be supporting the amendments proposed by the shadow minister. The reduction of the proposition in the bill from three years to one year is simply not consistent with the decision of the High Court or with decisions of the previous, Howard federal government. The bill gives effect to two judgments of the High Court that found that amendments to the Electoral Act made by the coalition in 2006 were inconsistent with the Constitution. One of the coalition's 2006 amendments removed the right to vote from all persons serving a full-time sentence of imprisonment. This was the first time in many decades that the right to vote in federal elections had been completely stripped from full-time prisoners. The bill amends the act to reinstate the situation that existed prior to the coalition's 2006 amendment. That is to say it reinstates the situation that existed for 10 of the Howard government. It would provide prisoners serving a full-time sentence of less than three years the right to vote. The amendments to the bill now proposed by the shadow minister would remove the right to vote from prisoners serving a full time sentence of one year or longer. The government has received legal advice on the international law aspects of this proposal from the Attorney-General's Department that states that limiting the right to vote in the way envisaged by the shadow minister's amendments would ‘not be objective, reasonable or proportionate according to the standards of international law in this area'. The advice concludes: ‘Such a ban would be unlikely to comply with Australia's human rights obligations.' The obligations in question are contained in article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was ratified by the coalition government in 1980, a government led by Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, ably assisted by former Prime Minister John Howard. Of course, a member of that government was  Berowra, who is currently a member of this place. The shadow minister is now proposing to ignore this international legal obligation entered into by a coalition government and supported for over a decade by the former coalition government. She is intent on trashing Australia's reputation on the world stage in relation to civil and political rights. I do acknowledge that this would be entirely consistent with the long-running assault on the achievements of Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and that the measures in the bill would be considered far too liberal-truly liberal, indeed-for the member for Mackellar. Not only this but she wants to blindly pursue a political objective which the years shadow minister knows has been exposed by the High Court as being contrary to our Constitution. However, we need to be crystal clear here. The shadow minister is using this amendment as a smokescreen to hide her real intention to attack other key provisions of the bill, namely, the reinstatement of the seven-day close of rolls period. The provision seeks to give effect to the second High Court decision, that of Rowe v Electoral Commissioner, a decision which resulted in 57,732 additional Australians being added to the electoral roll. The bill would update the Electoral Act to reflect the current constitutional position as declared by the High Court in the Rowe decision to restore the close of rolls period to seven days after the date of the writ for a federal election or a referendum. The opposition's real motive here is to deprive Australians of their democratic right to elect their political representatives. The opposition's obsession with this goal has produced an approach that regards ignoring the High Court-ignoring Australia's Constitution-and our international obligations as simply acceptable collateral damage, even a political tactic. The High Court has made decisions, finding aspects of the coalition government's 2006 amendments to be unconstitutional. What part of this don't we get? Our duty is to faithfully reflect those judgments in the electoral law of the Commonwealth. We now seek to achieve this in the bill before the House today. The government seeks no more than to simply enact the principles determined by the High Court. The government simply does not support the opposition's irresponsible amendment. Instead, we will continue to follow an approach that is based upon historic precedent, our international obligations, our electoral culture, practices and conventions, decency and proportionality and the consistent and unswerving commitment to the fundamental principles of our democracy, our Constitution and the decisions of the High Court.",52
33,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Let me make the position quite clear. I said with regard to the closing of the rolls that it is something we would readdress in government and I set out all the reasons why that is the case and cited various tranches of the High Court judgments to support that position. We are not attempting to oppose that provision in this bill. But the Special Minister of State is also quite right: am definitely, absolutely and positively trying to deny the right to vote to the man, a teacher, who got a two-year sentence for sexually abusing three young school boys on camping trips. Yes, I would like to disenfranchise that man from voting; you apparently would not.",54
34,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"The member will address her comments through the chair, not at the chair.",54
35,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Through the chair, yes. A man is serving 2½ years in jail. He had gone to his ex-girlfriend's home at 1.15 in the morning armed with a shortened .22 rifle and thrown furniture aside in the house. He had gone outside the unit, fired several shots into the air and then demanded to be let back in. His ex-girlfriend fled. He then started firing at other people who came to her aid. Yes, I would deny him the right to vote. The Shadow Minister of State seems to think it is proper that he have the right to vote. I do not. Yes, I would deny somebody who has been found to have 10,000 images and 250 videos of children who are being sexually abused the right to vote. Yes, I would deny him the right to vote because he got a two-year sentence. I ask you, Special Minister of State, whether you are serious about valuing the right to vote in this country and about valuing those decisions given in the High Court. They showed the history of the provision of disenfranchisement for prisoners and showed that from 1902 to 1983 there was no change, and it was one year. It is the same time for members of parliament-for Mr Theophanous and for Mr Wright being disbarred from this parliament, if they had been successful. The point is that we need to have some consistency and to recognise, as the High Court recognises, that the members of the parliament have the right to decide-given I expressly in the Constitution-on what basis a person should be disenfranchised from the vote. All through those judgments, every last one of them, they are concerned that it is in proportionality-that the degree of seriousness that a person has to offend society in order to be disenfranchised must be serious indeed. If we cared to go through the media we would find many more reports of people who are entitled to vote-you say you want to uphold their right to vote-and I say they should be disenfranchised. By having a one-year period, you could say that a misdemeanour or a lesser crime being committed is not a serious offence against the nation and therefore should not be disenfranchised. That is certainly not the position with the examples that I have put to you as upholding the proposition that we should lessen the period from three years to one year. Any decent Australian who listens to those arguments would be in agreement. It is proper to put a disenfranchisement provision in our law because we have made a decision that certain people have offended against the community to such a degree that they should not be allowed to have a vote counted in an election. By our lowering that period from three years to one year, we would bring about a just position. But to hear Gash, J. the argument that you said I am using this as a shallow false argument",54
36,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I am sorry, but again would the shadow minister direct comments through the chair.",55
37,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Through the chair, Madam Deputy Speaker.

41,The SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"I have received a message from the Senate informing the House that the Senate agrees with the resolution of the House relating to the appointment of the Joint Select Committee on the Christmas Island Tragedy of 15 December 2010. NA (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed from 23 February, on motion by Mr Garrett: That this bill be now read a second time.  speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment (Financial Assistance) Bill 2011, which seeks to amend the Schools Assistance Act 2008 in order to extend the current funding arrangements to non-government schools. This includes extending recurrent funding arrangements until 2013, using the coalition's socio-economic status, SES, funding model. Grants for capital expenditure are also to be extended until 2014. It has long been the coalition's policy to maintain the existing SES funding model, and for this reason the coalition will not oppose the bill. While schools know exactly where they stand with the coalition on school funding, a very serious question mark hangs over the future of school funding under the Gillard Labor government. Report Nine years ago, the Prime Minister described the SES funding model as ‘flawed and unworkable'. Today in this chamber we are considering, at the Prime Minister's behest, whether we should extend this model. It is the sort of doubletalk we have come to expect from this Prime Minister and this government. The decision to extend the existing SES funding model was made during the election campaign as the government faced mounting pressure to outline what form the new funding model would take. Noone in the non-government school sector is in any doubt that this was done to avoid revealing Labor's true plans for schools funding right before the election. It was a desperate attempt to avoid a showdown with the non-government school sector. Further evidence of this can be seen with the initial refusal of the then Minister for Education, Simon Crean, to guarantee during the election that funding for non-government schools would be maintained in real terms, inclusive of indexation, beyond 2012. The coalition knew, based on published information from the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, that indexation and supplementation for all nongovernment schools over the four-year life of a school funding agreement equates to approximately $1.3 billion. It was only at the eleventh hour in the election campaign that the Prime Minister, after intense pressure from the coalition and the non-government school sector, was forced to guarantee indexation for non-government schools until 2013 by extending the SES funding model for another year. A $1.3 billion shortfall in funding would have resulted in higher school fees for families. Unlike Labor, the coalition acknowledges that many parents scrimp and save to send their children to a non-government school of their choice. It still leaves a potenincluding tial $1 billion shortfall in non-government school funding in real terms over the life of the next agreement if indexation is not guaranteed beyond the end of 2013. Parents who have children in non-government schools deserve to be told by the Prime Minister and Labor whether they can expect a massive hike in their school fees in a few years time. The Prime Minister must also guarantee that, beyond the next election, no non-government school will be worse off in real terms. Labor have certainly promised a lot in education, but in reality they have delivered very little. The coalition believes in excellence in both government schools and nongovernment schools. That is why the former coalition government introduced the socio-economic status funding model for nongovernment schools, which ensures funding is distributed on a much more equitable basis than Labor's former educational resources index. Because general recurrent funding under the SES model distributes according to need, the schools serving the neediest communities receive the greatest financial support. It means that parents at all income levels have a realistic capacity to choose the most appropriate schooling for their child. The SES funding model creates an incentive for non-government schools to attract students from low-income families. Unlike Labor, we genuinely believe in the absolute freedom of parental choice when it comes to the education of our children. We believe that it is the right of every parent to choose the education of their children and we advocate that government should encourage and facilitate, not control or restrict, the exercise of this freedom of choice. Comments made by the members of the Labor Party remind us that it is the party of the ‘private schools hit list' and the politics of envy. They voted against the SES funding model when it was introduced, and many of their members, the Prime Minister, are on the record opposing equitable funding for nongovernment schools. The Prime Minister once said of the SES funding model, on 20 August 2001: This government, for its funding for private schools, has adopted a flawed index, the so-called SES model, which does not deliver on the basis of need. We know that model is flawed … So I want to caution the parents of children at all non-government schools: Labor's hit list of non-government schools will be more deadly than ever this year, given the review of schools funding will be led in the context of this new Labor-Greens alliance. Ms Collins interjecting secretary at the dispatch box tries to suggest that Labor support the non-government schools sector, but I will be fascinated to as will the non-government sector, what comes out of the Gonski review a the end of this year. The member opposite, the member for Franklin, will of course, I am sure, stand up and oppose any cut in funding in real terms to the non-government school sector! I am sure that she will support the coalition in standing up for non-government schools and making sure that every child in a nongovernment school has the same opportunities, the same access and the same choices as children in the government school sector! My great fear is that this year we will see the assault on the non-government school funding that Labor has been holding onto for nine years since the Prime Minister made those fateful remarks about what she regards as the flawed SES funding model. They wanted to get through the 2007 election and the 2010 election. We had to drag the then education minister, Simon Crean, kicking and screaming to extend the SES funding model, but they only extended it by one year. They did not commit to it for the future, because we all know they just wanted to get through the election so they could then assault non-government schools' funding. That is why they want to publish on the My School website the financial data of the nongovernment schools. What they want to do is build a case to attack the non-government schools sector, and every small religious and non-religious school that is a nongovernment school around Australia should be very fearful about what will happen under this Labor government that absolutely loathes the private school education system. We have managed to hold them off for a long period of time. We have held them off, but they are coming this year and next year to assault the non-government schools sector funding model. I notice the member for La Trobe scurrysee, ing out of the chamber. She knows the truth and she does not want to sit here and have to listen. She does not want to have to listen to the truth about her dislike of the nongovernment schools sector and her determination to rip money off the non-government schools sector and distribute it, once again, to the public servants in the department rather than see services delivered on the ground in the electorate of La Trobe. I caution the parents-I have said that, of course. I got slightly distracted by the member for Franklin, but I think we have dealt with her! We know the Greens policy seeks to return the total level of funding for all non-government schools to the 2003-04 levels and restrict the development of new nongovernment schools. This alliance between Labor and the Greens, therefore, poses a real threat, as it will seek to undermine the opportunities of young people and the choices of families who wish to educate their children at a non-government school chosen in accord with their religious faith or educational philosophy. The review into schools funding this year for both government and non-government schools remains a key area of concern for the coalition, and we will scrutinise every step of this process. Already it is becoming clear that the My School website is slowly being politicised in a transparent attempt to build a case against public funding for nongovernment schools. The decision by Peter Garrett to delay the launch of My School 2.0, which was to be launched last year, is an indication of the political sensitivity of the decision to publish school financial information for all to see. Some government school lobbies and the education unions continue to argue that funding by the Commonwealth to non-government schools reduces funding to government schools. They of course overlook the fact that the states and territories have primary responsibility for government school funding, but these fraudulent arguments have not really progressed in decades. These same advocates have applauded Labor's decision to publish school financial information on the My School 2.0 website, hoping it will bolster their case that once information is made available it can then be used as a method to justify reducing funding later down the track to Catholic and independent schools. Sadly, it has already come to my attention that some schools already preparing for the inevitable under Labor are starting to put their school fees up now in preparation for 2013, when the Howard government's socio-economic status funding model is set to expire. Despite all the talk about My School being a resource for parents that will increase transparency and accountability, the evidence has recently mounted that the website is morphing into an instrument to run a campaign against government funding of nongovernment schools. This is evidenced by the fact that Labor were all but set to publish inaccurate and false financial data about nongovernment schools on the website without seeming to care what impact this could have had on some schools. It was not until some non-government schools threatened legal action last year that the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth decided to delay the website. Further evidence is found in the recent Senate education committee inquiry into schools testing and the My School website. Labor made it obvious in the report that there is only one thing on their mind, and that is to bring back the Latham-Gillard private schools hit list. I quote: Government senators note the financial data to be captured on My School version 2 is a good start but will not capture accumulated surpluses, assets, trusts or foundations. In the interests of providing more information, government senators believe that there should be full disclosure of financial assets including assets, foundations and investments, otherwise true comparisons will not be possible. There are limited obligations on private schools in return for public funding. … … … If non-government schools continue to expect a share in federal funding then full financial disclosure in the interests of the tax payer and the better allocation of resources must be required. If nongovernment schools do not wish to comply with full financial disclosure, then public funding should not be provided. The Labor senators have let the cat out of the bag in this report. They do not want to accumulate information to be used to determine the funding for each school. They want to publish the private financial information of the non-government schools-the trusts or foundations that have been established through the hard work of the parents, grandparents and former students over many decades and in some cases over more than 100 years-so they can then assault the nongovernment schools sector and take the funding from the non-government schools. That is the agenda of the Labor Party in schools, and we will see that played out, if the government lasts long enough, in 2012. Unfortunately, at the moment it looks as if the government might not even last till the end of this session. They are immolating before our very eyes. So they might not even get to implement the outcome of the Gonski review, but if they are, unfortunately, in government next year then we will see their assault on the nongovernment schools sector for all that it will provide. Indeed, just this weekend we saw reports that Peter Garrett will take the proposal to force schools to include their on the My School website to the next council of education ministers meeting in April this year I raised grave concerns about schools having to provide excessive reporting on financials during the debate on the original schools assistance bill in 2008. I know that the non-government sector authorities were willing to provide information in good faith, but my concern was and still is that Labor would one day seek to use all of this information as the basis to take away funding from the non-government sector. It looks set in stone that Labor will attempt to discredit the SES funding model. I note that the recent issues paper released by David Gonski goes into details of the arguments made against the model but elaborates little on the views of those who support the model's underlying assumptions or options to improve the model. The model as it is conceived now is on a socio-economic status, in that it uses students' postcodes but does not take into account schools' resources or fees. Parents are not asked intrusive questions about their income or other personal information; rather, the SES model links students' addresses with current Australian Bureau of Statistics census data. Schools which draw students from areas of predominantly high SES receive lower levels of Commonwealth funding than schools which draw from areas of the average or low SES. The coalition has long argued the benefits of this system as schools are not penalised for fundraising efforts-for example, income from fetes and working bees-nor are schools forced to provide onerous financial information. It has offered all parents a real choice of schooling options, regardless of their economic circumstances or the price they are willing to pay for their children's education. I am concerned that the principles that we now have in the SES model will be increasassets ingly compromised as the review and changes to My School progress. It will be a real shame if under Labor in 2011 we will see the focus on schools funding drifting back to the arcane public-verses-private school debate when there is so much more to be done. It is unclear to me how publishing the assets of a non-government school is going to enhance any student's education or how publishing the details of school trusts is going to result in improved literacy and numeracy. I would argue that, instead of trying to create a digital private schools hit list, the policy focus for the government should be on increasing autonomy in schools. My School in Australia runs a real risk of impacting negatively on student achievement, unless it goes hand in hand with the principals and schools being given autonomy. I turn to mention a clear omission from this piece of legislation and flag I intend to move an amendment to address it. The coalition is absolutely focused on holding this government to account on the development of an appropriate national curriculum. A solid curriculum that lifts standards of literacy and numeracy within Australia will form the basis of the kind of eduction policy Australian mums and dads really want in the future. They want solid, practical accomplishments founded on decisions that are not based on the politics of envy. Last year we saw the government clearly underdeliver on its original promise to have the national curriculum available to implement from the beginning of this year due to concerns about its quality. The national curriculum has become another Gillard-Garrett failure as state education ministers last year at the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs refused to begin implementation in January 2011 as was promised. Instead of endorsing a finished product, its final consideration was moved until October 2011 with the curriculum due to be implemented by 2013. Peter Garrett's claim last year that the curriculum was ‘historically'",57
42,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,Order! I interrupt the shadow minister and ask him to refer to members by their positions.  Speaker. I momentarily forgot myself.,62
43,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,That is the third time. I have let it go through twice I ask you to use titles. Mr Hartsuyker-He's so absent-minded.  ily.,62
44,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"Would the shadow minister at the table like to put that on the record?  School Education, Early Childhood and Youth last year that the curriculum was ‘historically' endorsed suggests he did not understand the difference between success and failure. Far from endorsing the finished curriculum, the ministers appeared to have humiliated the minister for schools and the Prime Minister by accepting the patently obvious that a lot more work needs to be done to get this curriculum right. In fact, they in the end had to endorse a proposal from New South Wales to develop a blueprint to iron out issues such as the curriculum covering too much content, being overly prescriptive and lacking clear achievement standards. It is a very sad day when the federal ernment have to take a proposal from the New South Wales government, arguably the worse government in the history of the nation, because their own minister for schools is so inept and incompetent that he did not realise the national curriculum was not ready for introduction. And do not just take my word for it, Madam Deputy Speaker, although I doubt you would. The curriculum has been roundly criticised by the state governments, stakeholder organisations and education experts. It has been described as ‘overcrowded, incoherent and lacking depth', ‘a step backwards', ‘inferior', ‘lacking quality and clarity' and as being ‘unclear and not ready to teach'. Its rigidity is outlined in a letter last year to Minister Garrett from the Australian Curriculum Coalition, and which consists of 13 peak bodies ranging from the Australian Education Union and the Australian College of Educators right through to the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia. The one thing the national curriculum has achieved is uniting the most diverse range of people imaginable across the sector. They argue that Labor's curriculum lacks a clearly stated direction with no overarching framework: There is no clear statement about the issues that a national curriculum is designed to address, apart from the problem of mobile students … There is a need for an overarching framework for the curriculum to provide clarity about the conceptual model underpinning it. They went on to explain that the curriculum is overcrowded: As they stand, the documents will lead to serious overcrowding of the curriculum. The documents include too much lower order content to be learnt at the expense of higher order skills and conceptual understanding, leading to a degree of risk to teaching quality and the chances of effective student learning. Julia Gillard has long claimed the curriculum gov- would take three years to develop and be ready to implement by January 2011. In April 2008, Ms Gillard, the Prime Minister, promised: A national curriculum publicly available and which can start to be delivered from January 2011. This brings me to my final point. Last year it came to my attention that the Schools Assistance Act 2008 requires non-government schools and systems to introduce the national curriculum ‘prescribed by the regulations' on or before 31 January 2012. Now that the curriculum time line is behind Labor's original schedule, with some states and territories having announced they will not implement it until 2013, this obviously needs to be amended. But I note that the Schools Assistance Amendment (Financial Assistance) Bill does not deal with this issue, as one might have expected. So, while the coalition will not delay the passage of this bill, we do make a simple suggestion that it makes sense to amend the act now and change the time line for the curriculum for non-government schools to be implemented in line with state and territory schedules. I foreshadow that I will seek to move the following amendment: (1) Schedule 1, after item 3, page 3 (after line 17), insert: 3A Subsection 22(2) Omit “31 January 2012”, substitute “a date set by the Minister by legislative instrument”. 3B After subsection 22(2) Insert: (3) The Minister may not set a date for subsection (2) that is earlier than the date by which he or she is satisfied the national curriculum will be implemented in government schools in each State and Territory. (4) If it appears that the national curriculum will be not be implemented in government schools in each State and Territory by the date that has been set for subsection (2), the Minister must set a later date. Why is this so important? While it sounds in all jurisdictions slightly arcane",62
45,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"I would just indicate to the shadow minister that, having talked about them, he will have to move them in the consideration in detail stage as formal amendments. He can talk more broadly then.  that I am going to do that. I am foreshadowing that in this speech. That is fine. Why are these amendments so important? They are very important because the absurd situation in which the government has now placed the curriculum and the schools sector is that the non-government schools, under the act, are required to introduce the national curriculum by 31 January 2012, but the national curriculum is not ready for introduction, and the state governments have announced that they will not implement the national curriculum until 2013 at the earliest. So this minister is so inept and incompetent that he has a situation where the non-government schools are being required by law to implement a national curriculum that is not ready and, if this law is allowed to stay in place, the state government school systems will not implement the national curriculum until after the nongovernment school sector does. You would think that the minister would fix that problem. You would think that he would move an amendment to his own bill. In fact, you would think he would have included it in the bill in the first place. Unfortunately, it takes the opposition to fix this minister's absolute and sheer incompetence. On a daily basis we are trying to help this government and save it from itself, and today we have to foreshadow an amendment, which we will debate in the consideration in detail stage, to fix another government bill. We could just let it go through. We could just allow the government to place the nongovernment sector in the absurd situation of having to introduce a national curriculum which is neither drafted nor completed while the government sector does not have to do so. But we in the opposition are bigger than that. We want to help the non-government school sector, so we will move these amendments. I hope that the crossbenchers and the government will support them. If they do support and adopt them, we will be very happy. With that, while the opposition will not of course oppose this bill since it extends our SES funding model, I do recommend my amendments to the House.",63
46,Dr LEIGH,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"Fraser) (12.24 pm)Education is the best anti-poverty vaccine we have yet invented. It provides the foundations from which Australians can build a life of their choosing. Education lights a spark which can see a child from Cape York not just go on to university and become a leader in her community but also become Young Australian of the Year, as Tania Major did a couple of years ago. A great education means that a child from Ilfracombe can become the first female member of the Queensland bar and our first female Governor General. This great building, this national parliament, showcase of the opportunities which education provides to children from all corners of the nation. So many members of the House acknowledged in their first speeches that they would not be here today were it not for a great education. I remember hearing time after time those stories of where a particular teacher or a certain educational opportunity had made the difference in someone's life. Providing a great education is not just good social policy; it is good economic policy as well. Raising the human capital of our workforce is the most promising way of increasing Australia's productivity, which has been sluggish over the last decade or so. By boosting the quantity of education we will help our labour force deal with future changes in the economic structure. A great education means that children will be more resilient when, as workers, they face changes in the kinds of jobs they are expected to do. Improving the quality of education ensures that Australian children learn more from each given year at school, at VET or at university. The importance of education means that we in this place have a responsibility to ensure that our schools get the resources that they need to do the job that we know it is important for them to do. The Gillard government, having recognised this, has invested a record amount in school building infrastructure. The great school modernisation program, Building the Education Revolution, has given schools great buildings which allow them to do extraordinary things in the educational space. I have to confess that I was a sceptic about the BER program. When it was introduced, I was not in parliament and did not have children at school, so I had not visited any of these schools. But one of the great things you get to do as a local member is to go out to your local schools to talk with the parents, the teachers, the children and the principal is a about how these new school buildings have made a difference to the work they have done. I have seen with my own eyes so many examples of how the BER program has transformed the quality of education in Australia. Yesterday morning I was out with the Prime Minister and the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Mr Garrett, at Turner School. It was my second visit to the school, because I had been there to open their new school library. Principal Ms Jan Day, the teachers, the children and the parents are as excited by their new school library now as they were last year when the library was opened. Mr Tudge interjecting Mr Champion interjecting",64
47,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"I would just indicate that the member is talking about school students being excited, not members of this House. Perhaps we could settle down with the interjections and let the member make his point.",65
48,Dr LEIGH,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"They are still as excited by this new school library as they were last year. I am sure the member for Aston would himself be very excited if he had the opportunity to visit it, an invitation which I formally extend to him today. The community got involved in that school library. There is a mural on the outside of the school library which was put together by Kirsty Verook, one of the local parents. She is a mosaic artist, and she worked with the schoolchildren. She asked them what designs they would like to have on the outside of their library, and she then put their ideas into a mosaic which I was pleased to show to the Prime Minister and Minister Garrett when we visited yesterday morning. Turner School's is not a lone story. Across Fraser I have seen the impact the BER has had on our community. At Black Mountain special school, a school for students with intellectual disability, the BER project was the building of a new school hall. I know that many in this chamber think that a hall is just students at Black Mountain the new hall means that for the first time students in a wheelchair can attend the same assemblies as able-bodied students; the school can now fit all of those students into the same hall. The school used to have a stage which was so steep that, when students in wheelchairs got an award, they had to receive it down on the floor in front of the stage. But now, with a well-designed stage, it is possible for the time for a student in a wheelchair, when they receive an award, to go up and shake the hand of the principal and receive the award in the same place as every other child. This affords them the simple dignity that a great school experience provides. I had the pleasure of opening new school facilities in Florey Primary School, which has seen renovations to its hall and also the introduction of science labs. That is particularly appropriate given that the school is named after Sir Howard Florey, the great Australian who invented penicillin-possibly one of the greatest Australians of all time. At Amaroo School, new classrooms with innovative learning spaces have been constructed. Students can learn in their traditional classroom or have lessons with their entire peer group. The dividing walls between the classrooms can be taken down and improve the quality of the teaching experience. Team teaching is now possible at Amaroo School thanks to the Building the Education Revolution program. When I was in school-as may have been the case when you were in school, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams-we just had blackboards. We then moved to the age of whiteboards. Now, in Canberra, whiteboards are being replaced by innovative SMART Boards. These are just some of the examples that Prime Minister and the Labor government have brought about through our commitment to higha hall, but for quality education. The Schools Assistance Amendment (Financial Assistance) Bill 2011 builds upon the Gillard government's commitment to ensuring certainty of investment in all Australian schools. The government's review of funding for schooling is a once-in-a-generation chance to build a community consensus around the education needs of our nation. It will enable us to further the aspiration that first every Australian child should have the opportunity to get a great education. By amending the Schools Assistance Act 2008, the Australian government will be able to continue to provide recurrent and capital funding to non-government schools while the review is conducted. That will provide certainty to Catholic and independent schools to enable them to continue to give their students a good education. This bill will also enable government to continue to work with school communities, parents and families in the non-government school sector to build on the partnerships that are so critical to improving outcomes for Australian primary and secondary students. This is just one part of our broader education agenda. We are also investing over $64 billion in school education over four years-almost double that of the previous government. We are making more information about our schools available than ever before, through the My School website. As my wife, Gweneth-who I am pleased to acknowledge is here in the chamber today-and I went about choosing a school for our four-year-old we found the information on the My School website absolutely invaluable. My School 2.0, which will be launched tomorrow, will for the first time provide parents and the community with information about the resources that schools have and the changes in student performance over time. I have to say that I am deeply disappointed that the Liberal Party is going to oppose this information being made available to Australian parentsthat the Liberal Party supports keeping the blinds down on this critical information. The Labor government is implementing an Australian curriculum for the first time, working in partnership with states and territories to make sure our students get a great education no matter where they live. I have to say to the member for Sturt that students in my electorate are learning from the national curriculum today. Classes are being taught in ACT schools based on the national curriculum. So, despite what the Liberal Party may say about the national curriculum-and despite what the member for Sturt said before the election when he said that, if you did not like it, the coalition would ‘scrap it and start again'-the national curriculum is a success and it is being taught in schools the just a few kilometres from this building. Labor is supporting students in lowsocioeconomic school communities, and improving literacy and numeracy, through a $2½ billion investment in national partnerships. Those national partnerships are investing in over 2,000 schools across the country. They are not just government schoolsthough many of the low-socio-economic status communities are served by government schools. Some of them are independent schools and some are Catholic schools. For us in the Labor Party these debates between the government and the non-government sector are very much a thing of the past. We are investing to ensure a quality education for all students, focusing on making sure that every school is a great school. We have recognised that having highquality teachers in every classroom is absolutely critical. That is why we are implementing national professional standards for teachers and principals. That is why we are investing in rewarding great teachers and attracting new people to the profession through Teach for Australia and Teach Next. We are empowering principals to manage their schools in a way that best suits their local needs and we are providing rewards for school improvement. We are investing in infrastructure in schools through, as I have already noted, the Building the Education Revolution program, trades training centres and the digital education revolution-making sure that students have access to modern facilities and equipment to ensure they are prepared for work and life in the 21st century. The National Broadband Network will be another part of this-making sure that e-education provides all students in Australia with a great education. But great education is not just about dollars. Sometimes when we talk about school buildings and the huge injection of funding-a historic injection of funding-into Australian schools, we can miss the fact that great education is really about a teacher making a connection with a student. It is nothing more complicated than that. Many of us in this chamber will remember a great teacher who made a difference to our lives. For me it was probably Judith Anderson, my high school English teacher, who showed a devotion to the great works, whether it was Browning, Shakespeare or Donne, and provided us with an opportunity to learn outside school hours. She was willing to be there for a group of us who wanted to practise plays. She showed through everything that she did at the front of the classroom her love of education. But a teacher's job is not a simple job. I would like to quote from one of my favourite books on education: Teacher Man by Frank MCCourt-the great writer of Angela's Ashes, who sadly passed away recently. He wrote in Teacher Man: In the high school classroom you are a drill sergeant, a rabbi, a shoulder to cry on, a disciplinarian, a singer, a low-level scholar, a clerk, a referee, a clown, a counsellor, a dress-code enforcer, a conductor, an apologist, a philosopher, a collaborator, a tap dancer, a politician, a therapist, a fool, a traffic cop, a priest, a mother-fatherbrother-sister-uncle-aunt, a bookkeeper, a critic, a psychologist, the last straw. In closing I would like to pay tribute to Australia's teachers, who each and every day do extraordinary work in improving the lives of Australia's children. I commend the bill to the House.",65
49,Mr TUDGE,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the Schools Assistance Amendment (Financial Assistance) Bill 2011. This is an important bill and broadly speaking it is a good bill. It is important because it concerns the largest and most significant part of our education system-the school education system-and because it concerns the funding that they receive from the Commonwealth. Our schools cater for 3.5 million students: 2.3 million in the government school sector and 1.2 million in Catholic and independent schools. By and large we have outstanding schools in this country, as judged by the international PISA results-although there were some concerns which showed themselves in the most recent PISA results and I have made comment on those previously. Our schools educate our children for the future. Our schools are about the future and, importantly, they have the greatest influence on our children outside that of parents. So any bill that concerns schools is an important bill. School funding bills are particularly so. This is a good bill, by and large. I say that because it extends the existing funding arrangements for schools for another calendar year to the end of 2013. Importantly, it also extends the funding system for nongovernment schools-the SES or socio-economic status system-until the end of 2013. By the end of 2013, that system will have been in place for 13 years. That system was introduced in 2001 by the Howard government, under Dr David Kemp. In 2004, Dr Nelson brought the Catholic schools into the SES system, so now all non-government schools-independent and Catholic schools-are part of that system. The model is based primarily on providing funding to schools according to the wealth of those families that those schools serve. So the wealthiest schools receive the least money; they receive 13.7 per cent of the cost of educating students in a government school. The schools which cater for the poorest families receive the most money; they receive 70 per cent of the cost of educating a child in the government school system. The system is also based on some fundamental core principles, and I will mention two in particular. The first is the principle of school choice. This is a very important principle on this side of the House, and we will continue to uphold that principle and continue to fight for it. It is also based on the principle that every student should attract some level of funding, regardless of which school they attend. The only thing that should differentiate the level of funding which that student attracts is the wealth of the parents of students attending that particular school. Parents under the SES system are encouraged to also contribute financially, if they choose to do so. They are not penalised for doing so. The SES system also enshrines what is called the AGSRC-the average government school recurrent costs-indexation method, which typically ticks over at about five to six to seven per cent per annum, so that school funding basically keeps up with rising school costs. These are very important attributes of the SES system. It is a good system and it is a transparent system. It is by no means perfect but it has worked very effectively now for 10 years, and with this bill it will work effectively for 13 years. The weakness of this bill, however, is that it only extends the system for one additional year. Most school assistance bills go for four years. The 2000 to 2004 schools assistance bill went for four years; the 2005 to 2008 schools assistance bill went for four years; the 2009 to 2012 schools assistance bill went for four years. If the government were serious about the SES system-as it seems to indicate by putting this bill forward-then it should extend it for a further four years, not just for a single year. However, we know that the government is not serious about the SES system. It does not support this funding model. So, while we are happy for it to extend the system for an additional year, we fear what is planned from 2014 onwards. We know that the government do not like this system because they have been explicit about it since the system was introduced in 2001. They have maintained a campaign against this system since 2001, and often against the non-government school sector itself over the last 10 years. I point to a number of comments from senior front-bench members of the government. I will start with Julia Gillard: she said that the system was fundamentally ‘flawed'. She said that it did not deliver on the basis of needs. She complained that it made no allowance for the private resources that a school has. Jenny Macklin, when she was education minister, used to rail against the SES system, day in, day out. Kevin Rudd said that he had ‘grave problems' with the system. Craig Emerson criticised the system. Mike Kelly said that the system was ‘ridiculous' and ‘totally crazy'. But probably the most stinging criticism came from the Hon. Stephen Smith when he was education minister. Stephen Smith, the dark horse in the leadership race on the other side of this House, said: You see there the destruction of our egalitarian society. The destruction of a chance for a fair go, a fair opportunity for access to education for all Australians. When he was education minister that is what he had to say about the SES system, but I presume he will be coming into this chamber to support the extension of it for a further year. Let us look not just at what the Labor Party have said about this funding system but also at what they have done. At every election they have promised to repeal or at least review the system. At the last few elections they have promised to cut funding to nongovernment schools. No-one in this chamber would forget the 2004 ‘hit-list' election when it was promised that dozens of schools would have their funding cut and hundreds of others would have their funding reduced or cut over time. They also promised to cut funding for non-government schools at the 2001 election and at the 1998 election. They have only supported this particular system for the 2009-12 quadrennium, and now for a further year, largely for political reasons: they did not want to have a fight with the nongovernment school sector and 1.3 million parents going into the 2007 election. Despite those stinging criticisms which I have mentioned, they continued to support it. But what is to come? We know that they do not like the system. We know that the government is doing a review of the SES school funding system. But we also know a few other things in relation to nongovernment schools in particular. We know that the Labor Party has been deeply antagonistic towards Catholic and independent schools in the past. We know that their alliance partners, the Greens, are even more antagonistic towards Catholic and independent schools. The Greens committed at the last election to not providing any public funds to non-government schools. We know that some of the key funders of the Australian Labor Party, the teachers unions, have similar views to the Greens. We also know that the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, the Hon. Peter Garrett, will not guarantee that schools will not lose real funding in the future. I believe that parents whose children attend non-government schools should be very nervous about the review that is coming up and the proposals which will be put in place following the expiration of this schools assisschools tance amendment bill. What is more, I am concerned that subsequent to the expiration of this particular bill a model which has been tried in the past and discredited in the past will be put in place. It will most likely be a model which is based on the fees that a school collects rather than on the wealth of the parents-that is, it will assess the fees first and, if required, provide top-up funding to a school, from the public purse, to meet a defined benchmark of $12,000 or $13,000 per school. This was basically the model that existed before the SES model came into place in 2001. This detailed model was taken to the 2004 election, elements of it were taken to the 2001 election and all the indications are that a similar type of thing will be introduced from 2014 onwards if the government is still in power. It may sound superficially attractive to take the school fees into account before you determine the public funding which a nongovernment school receives, but it has fundamental flaws. Most importantly, it creates a disincentive, if not a penalty, for parental investment into schools. Under such a model, if parents put more money into their school through higher fees then the government funding would be reduced. That makes no sense to me. We have also seen in the past that the system can be somewhat corrupted. That was the case with the ERI system that existed before the SES model was introduced. Importantly, this moves away from the core principle that every child should receive some government assistance for their education regardless of which school they attend or the fees and the contributions made by their parents. In practice, if such a model is introduced, it will likely mean that many schools will have their funding cut in nominal terms and certainly in real terms. It may be in the first instance that only a couple of hundred will be listed to have their funding cut but, if the model that is introduced is anything like the previous models that have been introduced, over time hundreds of nongovernment schools with relatively modest fees will also have their funding reduced in real terms. We will be watching very closely the school funding model that comes out of the review that is currently being undertaken by the government. We are concerned that this is being overseen by Mr Garrett; this does not inspire confidence. We are concerned that it will be negotiated in conjunction with Bob Brown, so it is likely to be even harsher on non-government schools than the Prime Minister herself would want. The proposed model would have to appease the teachers unions-the Prime Minister cannot afford to lose more support from the Left of her party or she will suffer the same fate as Mr Rudd. We will be watching very closely in the months ahead, and parents will be very nervous. I said at the beginning that the current SES system is not perfect, but it is transparent, it is difficult to manipulate and it creates the right incentives for parental investment. I support this bill, because it extends that system for a further year, through to the end of 2013. But we will be watching very closely what the government proposes for school funding following that period, and ideally the SES funding model will continue after that time.  rise to speak in support of the Schools Assistance Amendment (Financial Assistance) Bill 2011. Before I do so in great detail, I just want to respond to a couple of comments made by the member for Aston, who obviously does not quite have a full grasp of the SES system. He failed to point out the most obvious point, which is that two out of five schools have funding maintained, which effectively means they are outside the SES system; 39.5 per cent of schools have funding maintained. To have a system where two out of five schools are not effectively part of the system shows that you have to recalibrate. I understand the logic behind the SES model in trying to look at the needs. The ABS data gives a bit of insight into where parents who send kids to a school might come from, but there are some obvious flaws. I taught in Catholic schools, I taught in state schools and I was a union organiser working in private schools-every sort of private school, from grammar schools to Anglican schools, Lutheran schools, Christian schools and Aboriginal schools. I have been closely associated with those schools, as well as schools in my electorate, so I have a fair understanding of the SES model. One of the obvious flaws is that you import ABS data using a postcode from, perhaps, a poor area, but you could be the richest person from that particular area. That is one of the problems with it. Particularly with regard to boarding schools, you might have the richest kid from the country area and you are importing the ABS data for a poor SES part of Australia. That is one of the many flaws with it. The most obvious thing is that two out of five schools have funding maintained. The bill before the House does not remedy that but it goes some way to giving funding certainty to non-government schools right here, right now. It will support the operating costs of non-government schools until the end of 2013 and capital expenses until the end of 2014. Like any other industry, schools need funding certainty to make investment decisions and to plan for the future, especially when it comes to the more complicated things such as capital projects. This is exactly like the energy and resources sector, which is obviously also crying out for certainty when it comes to something such as a carbon price. The good thing is that this piece of legislation follows on from the biggest investment in schools in 100 years, via the BER program, which I note was not actually mentioned by the member for Aston, even though it is slightly outside the legislation in front us. Now the Gillard government is undertaking the biggest review of education funding in 30 years. Let's be up-front: the Labor Party passionately believes in education. We are a party based on opportunity that comes from education at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels and everything in betweenbefore-school care, TAFEs and everything else. This review of funding for schools, due to report later this year, is looking at how we can best support quality education outcomes-the funding allocations, the most effective funding mechanisms and appropriate accountability. We passionately believe in federal accountability. Everyone expects that government funding must be transparent-fair, financially sustainable and obviously useful. The review that the Gillard government is undertaking will help achieve that. However, as the government is yet to receive the report, we need to ensure funding security now for our Catholic and independent schools, and that is why this legislation is before the House. I know from talking to schools in my electorate-schools like St Thomas More College at Sunnybank, Southside Christian College at Salisbury, the Murri School at Acacia Ridge, St Aidan's Anglican Girls' School at Corinda, Christ the King Primary School at Graceville, and Our Lady's College at Annerley-that they need this certainty. This bill provides that certainty by extending the funding arrangements, including indexation, for a further three years. We want to ensure Catholic and independent schools can plan for the future and ensure that schools can give parents and carers greater certainty when it comes to setting school fees for future years. The basic philosophy of the Gillard government is that all kids deserve a great education, regardless of the name on top of the school fence. The member for Aston dredged of through history for a couple of incidences where the Labor Party might not have made that as clear as it needs to be, but the Gillard government-especially since the Prime Minister is the former education ministercan be proud of its achievements. Admittedly, they might have been particularly generated by the global financial crisis, but we poured money into educational facilities to give schools opportunities that they would never otherwise have had. I was at a school in my electorate the other day, Our Lady of Fatima at Acacia Ridge. It was just a community barbecue, using the school hall facility. One of the parents made the point that they would not have even dreamed of beginning to sell lamingtons and the like to build such a facility. The Gillard government has a proud record when it comes to investing in education and making sure that the education system is as good as it could possibly be. We want to be world leaders in education. Catholic and independent schools play a very important role in our education system. I saw that when I worked as a teacher in Catholic schools. I saw that when I was a union organiser working in all sorts of independent schools. So the Labor government is committed to ensuring that all studentswhether they are public or private, rural or metropolitan, primary or secondary, boy or girl, rich or poor-receive a quality education. This bill amends the Schools Assistance Act 2008 to appropriate $8.2 billion in 201213 and $8.9 billion in 2013-14. I mention these figures just in case there is any concern about this government's commitment to support non-government schooling-to combat some of the scare campaigns, which is such a novice approach from those opposite, as exhibited by the speech by the member for Aston. It also includes about $140 million each year to go towards capital expenses in nongovernment schools. As we know on this side, every school principal has a list jects. Every parent group has a list of things that they want to do in their school community. We took advantage of that during the global financial crisis, because every community has a school, they all have a list of projects that they need done and they all have connections with their local tradespeople. Whilst we went some way to changing those tasks, you might suggest that we did 20 years worth of work in one year, basically, in response to the global financial crisis. I hasten to add for the sake of those with an interest in economics that, overall, we are talking about costs that, at worse, were three, four or five per cent over budget. In a lot of cases, particularly in Catholic and nongovernment schools, they were under what would be the going rate, because they had great relationships with their builders. That might make a front-page story in the Australian tomorrow, but I am not holding my breath. We are talking about a huge investment. That is why it was so important for the government to get the review of funding for schooling underway to ensure that this huge outlay in taxpayers' dollars will achieve the educational outcomes that we want for Australian kids in the future. I guess our economic heaven will come from how we educate the kids of today. That is why the partnership with non-government schools is so important and so valued. This partnership helps deliver funding for important capital infrastructure that some schools, particularly emerging schools, cannot fund alone. The capital grants are available for schools to help purchase land and buildings, to upgrade utilities and purchase equipment and technology. They also help with library resources and teacher accommodation and support for students with disabilities. When you go to modern-day schools, as I am sure you have done recently to open some of those BER facilities, and look at the library, of proyou can see how much they have changed. The library when I was a kid, sitting at home watching F TroopMr Randall-You're not that old!  and O'Rourke and all those people. When I was at primary school at St Patrick's in St George, the library was where all the knowledge was and if you ordered a book it would take months to come in. But nowadays, with the internet, students have access to the world at home. It does mean that their filtering system is not quite as good as a librarian's, obviously-and I did meet a roomful of Commonwealth librarians the other day, actually, up on the second level. Librarians have such a different role now. Instead of being the ‘sage on the stage' they are now the ‘guide on the side' to bring people into where the data and resources are. So things have changed a lot. We are proud of our record on education on this side of the chamber. I would suggest that for those opposite, particularly the former teachers-and I think that we have one in the chamber now, the member for Canning-the record is not as proud, unfortunately. Maybe it is just because the Labor Party is so committed to opportunity and investing in schools-all schools. Sure, it was great to see that schools were able to access that great contribution to learning, the flagpole, and I do admit that there were schools in my electorate that did not have flagpoles before John Howard was elected15 years ago yesterday-and they ended up with flagpoles at the end of his time. It is good that there is a flagpole and that there was a ceremony and a name of the member at the time near their flagpole. That is a good thing, for a flagpole is an important part of any school, I guess. But it is also great to go along and open a language lab, as I did at Yeronga State High School the other day, or to open computer labs or classrooms. They are the sorts of things that schools particularly appreciate, especially when you can add in the interactive whiteboards and the like. That is the way of future education. We do understand education particularly, and hopefully those opposite will start to embrace some of these things. I would like to hear a member opposite say a good thing in this chamber about the BER program. I have certainly seen lots of photographs of them giving the thumbs-up out in their electorates. I am sure that the member for Canning would not be so hypocritical as to vote against the program in here and then go out and cut a ribbon in his electorate, but some people might. Some people might give a big thumbs-up out in their electorate but in here say: ‘No, no, no, we are against that. It is not a good thing.' Unfortunately there has been a bit too much hysteria about the Building the Education Revolution. The BER program was about a job-saving, economy-boosting, massive capital injection into education. It could have been in the military, it could have been into roads, it could have been into lots of other things, but I am very proud as a former teacher that it was into educational facilities. Every educator, every parent of every schoolchild, needs to remember that if those opposite had had their way the BER would not have happened. The BER program delivered what we promised-modern educational facilities that double as community facilities. BER facilities in my electorate on Brisbane's southside actually became evacuation centres during the floods, including St Aidan's Anglican Girls School at Corinda, Yeronga State School Hall, and the Oxley State School Hall, which was also used for community meetings. So these community centres used in a time of crisis came out of the BER program. Last month I attended ceremonies to mark the opening of a new international language centre at Yeronga State High School and new and improved classrooms at the autism centre in Sunnybank and, as I said, I was also at a community barbecue at Our Lady of Fatima at Acacia Ridge. So no matter what those opposite say, these investments will always be good news stories-good for students, good for support staff, good for teachers and good for the communities in my electorate. And I am sure it could be said by all 150 members of this chamber if we were totally honest. So I am pleased that this bill provides funding certainty. Once upon a time there might have been a different story about the members on this chamber concerning where they had come from, but now I think that all sides the chamber would come from private and state, Catholic and other schools. I think that there is quite a mix of people in terms of backgrounds. I went to a Catholic primary school and then to St George State High School-in fact I was there on the very first day that it opened. So the mix of educational backgrounds has completely changed over time and we are committed to supporting our non-government schools and our Catholic schools. They do a great job. I could perhaps have declared a conflict of interest, as my son does go to a Catholic school, but I do not think that was completely necessary. This bill provides funding certainty that nongovernment schools need and deserve, and I commend it to the House.",67
50,Mr RANDALL,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"I am very pleased to speak on this Schools Assistance Amendment (Financial Assistance) Bill 2011 today, and if the member for Moreton wishes to stay a little I am happy to respond in a positive way on this bill. In fact while he is here briefly, I will. Yes, you can hear it from me, Member for Moreton: the BER itself-the principles behind the BER-were excellent, providing greater resources and greater infrastructure for schools. I do not think that there is a member in this House who would not agree with that. Where we depart though, Member for Moreton, is over the fact that that bill was cobbled, as you know, along with other initiatives such as what we call the ‘cash splash'-the $900 giveaway. It was also a program which under the previous minister, now the Prime Minister, became legendary for its mishandling. To be fair, in Western Australia the BER is going along very well mainly because the state government has taken out several layers of interference, which are some of the mates along the way. In other words, consultants and others cannot get their hands on the cash on the way through, force up the bill and have it blow out to an extraordinary amount for sometimes very ordinary, plain school buildings. Now the member for Moreton has gone I am willing to continue to say that, when decoupled, this was a good initiative and was part of the stimulus package. The only problem is that some of the packages are still stimulating and we are now supposed to be into reasonable economic times. The problem is that this Gillard Labor government has a continued stimulus package operating when the Reserve Bank is trying to dampen the economy by increasing interest rates. You have this conflict going on at the moment because it was beset and beguiled by so many problems, particularly, as I said, on the east coast rather than on the west coast. The fact is there has been a lot of criticism of what could have been a really good program in terms of school infrastructure and facilities. I will move on to the nub of the bill that I have addressed the member for Moreton's challenge. The bill amends the School Assistance Act 2008 to extend the existing funding arrangements for non-government schools including indexation arrangements until the end of 2013 and grants for capital expenditure until the end of 2014. This will ensure certainty for Catholic and independent schools. Can I again point out that, as the member for Moreton mentioned, my bona fides are that I was a schoolteacher for some 18 years-one of the few in this place-as was my wife, my brother and my two sisters. So we come from an education family and we are very proud of the fact that we were all educated in government schools in Merredin, a tiny wheat belt town in Western Australia. We were very happy with the education we got and we were big supporters of the government system. But on the record, I am now making sure that people understand that in this country there is need for choice and that is what this bill goes to address. If you listen to the teachers unions, they are not interested in choice that much and I will get onto further details about the choice that the teachers unions are trying to stymie and the penalties that they are bringing to parents who wish to exercise their choice. This bill needed to be extended because the then education minister in the lead-up to the election, the now Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, for months and months would not commit to any maintenance of school funding, particularly for non-government schools. I recall being at the opening of the Catholic school in Dawesville when Senator Glenn Sterle opened the BER project there and Bishop Holohan from the Bunbury diocese was very critical of the government not giving any certainty to the education system by making any statements regarding this issue. now The Catholic bishops of Australia in particular became quite vocal in their call for the government to come out and say something about the continuing of the funding. Obviously, as the polls closed up during the election campaign Julia Gillard was forced into making a statement and she did. Today this is what this legislation is about. The cynic in me says: ‘It's good, but the timing of this is interesting. This is going to be extended to 2013 and the capital expenditure to 2014.' What do we have in 2013? Probably a federal election, so it gets them past that because 2012 would have been a terrible time to have come down with any variation on the funding model. The SES model is one that has stood the test of time. It is not perfect, like most things, but flexible enough to deliver into the areas because it certainly all the buttons. It includes the dimensions of income, education and occupation in the census collection districts and it drills down to those levels where in a CCD you have on average 250 houses in any one area, so it gets quite sensitive in the information that it draws upon. As I said, this funding needed to be retained in real terms for non-government schools. An interesting article by Janet Albrechtsen in the Australian on Australia Day this year pointed out a number of issues regarding the Gonski inquiry and some of the hypocrisy surrounding the input, particularly by those who do not want to see growth in non-government schools. Let's just get this fact clear-this is an refutable and indisputable fact: the growth in government schools across this country averages about one per cent per annum; the growth in the non-government sector is about 20 per cent per annum. What does that tell you? It tells you that the parents of this country are voting with their feet and exercising their choice. When they exercise a choice they know that it is going to cost them whether it be a low-fee school-and I have a number of them in my area like the Pioneer Village School in Armadale, which is an independent school, and of course I have a number of Catholic schools and other independent schools. The low-fee schools cost roughly $2,000 a year at most. Then you can go to some of the other schools in my area such as the Frederick Irwin Anglican School and the Serpentine-Jarrahdale Grammar School, which started not so many years ago-which, by the way, the then Premier of West Australia, Alan Carpenter, tried to quash but it is full now and they are trying to extend it. So these parents do make a commitment on education. I will refer to this article by Janet Albrechtsen where she talks hits about this mentality of the rich taking from the poor. She said: Take Trevor Cobbold, convener of Save Our Schools, who likes to highlight average total expenditure. In government schools in 2007-08 it was $10,723 a student, compared with $15,147 in independent schools and $10,399 in Catholic schools. It's true that total expenditure in government schools is about $10,500 per student. But now add the relevant facts. State and territory governments provide about 88 per cent of funding to public schools, the federal government provides about 8 per cent and parents the remaining 4 per cent. Understand this: 88 per cent of the funding for state schools-as their very name suggests, they are owned, run and financed by the state-comes from the state which they irare in and the rest, 12 per cent, comes from other means. Ipso facto, non-government schools get 12 per cent funding from various sources. As for where the rest comes from, I will return to the article. Ms Albrechtsen said: Almost the reverse funding pie applies to independent schools. State and territory governments provide just 12 per cent of the funding per student, the federal government picks up the tab for 31 per cent … And here is the rub: the rest, 57 per cent, is provided by the parents. It is estimated that parents did not fund the $3.1 billion which they take out of their own pockets every year to send their children to these schools, the federal government would have to pick up the tab. This is where the slur on the nongovernment sector comes in, from those who want to make some mileage of this. The slur is that the people who go to these schools are filthy rich and it is abominable that they are getting such a walk-up start. The fact is that lot of the parents who send their children to these schools are single parents, those who are doing it hard. I know parents in my electorate, for example, who get a second job or take a second mortgage on their house to send their children to some of these so-called elite schools. It is their choice. I am not saying for one moment that we should say, ‘Isn't it terrible that they are not getting more money?' The fact is that they pay taxes and they are entitled to some money. But they make this choice and, as I said, quite often some of them go through distinct hardship to do so. But, as the member opposite said earlier, they see education as the path to the enhancement of opportunity, a better career path and therefore a better income. Most parents want to see their children have better opportunities than they had. My daughter and my son went to a government primary school and then went to a non-government school for their secondary education. I am glad the pain has finished. It cost a lot of money. But we did that because we thought, like many other parents in Australia, that that choice would give them better opportunities in tertiary education and therefore better career paths. So let us not in any way say that this bill is anything but the right thing to do. As I said, I am a bit sceptical about its timing, but, at the end of the day, as has been said, if real funding in real terms is something that needs to be maintained. We do not want to go back to the threat that we were getting from the then shadow education minister under the Latham opposition, the member for Lalor, that there was going to be a schools hit list. We have to get past that and realise that the education opportunities in this country are something that should be available to all. Choice in education is something that is desirable. Therefore, we are keen to see this go a ahead and in no way be undermined after the review. We do not want to see the review being used to reduce opportunity for the taxpayers of Australia, the parents, who make a choice. We do not want to see their funding being in any way eroded because of this class warfare that sometimes goes on from other sections of the community, particularly the education unions in this case. Therefore, I support the intention of the bill.",73
51,Mr MITCHELL,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"MCEwen) (1.19 pm)I rise to support the government's Schools Assistance Amendment (Financial Assistance) Bill 2011. At the 2010 federal election, the Gillard Labor government made a commitment to support independent and Catholic schools across the country. With this bill, we are honouring that commitment. Whilst there is a review into school funding currently underway which is expected to be released this year, we are providing schools with the certainty and security that they want, because education is the government's top priority. Education has always been a Labor priority because we believe that a good education is a great start to life, equipping our kids with the opportunities and skills that they will need for the future. The bill amends the Schools Assistance Act 2008 and guarantees and extends the current funding, including indexation arrangements until the end of 2013 and grants for capital expenditure until the end of 2014. As members are aware, my electorate of MCEwen is a diverse electorate which encompasses many rural areas. Therefore, I am pleased that this bill will continue funding support for both rural and remote schools, particularly for the disadvantaged Catholic and independent schools which are in rural and regional areas. I and this government alike believe that, no matter where you choose to live, accessibility to good education is essential. As I said, we are undertaking a review. We have established a review panel, headed by Mr David Gonski, to examine in depth how school funding arrangements can be made fair, transparent, open and financially sustainable. The review has enabled parents, educators and the community alike to have a say on the issues that are important to them. The Gillard government are listening to stakeholders, listening to the views of people who work in the education sector and to parents and students in the Catholic and independent schools. We believe it is crucial to listen to their opinions and get the feedback from the people and the sectors that are directly involved and affected. This review will be the foundation that we work from to improve the current school funding system, because that is what the parents and school communities want. This government supports all schools and this was evident through our Building the Education Revolution. Local principals have told me that this has brought education forward by 20 to 30 years. Mr Tehan-Ha, ha!",76
52,Mr MITCHELL,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"The member for Wannon laughs and we know how unhappy he is to see that investment in his electorate. He is so ashamed of it, which is really an embarrassment and an indictment of him. Can you imagine if the coalition was in government and cut the BER? Education would probably go back that 20 or 30 years. Schools would end up looking like a fort out of F Troop. I have many fantastic catholic and independent schools in my electorate and many I have recently visited as part of the BER, schools that have praised the government's BER program. When you stand there and feel their excitement it truly makes you proud to be part of a government that makes a genuine difference to the education of our children. I take this opportunity to thank the Prime Minister and the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth for their support of education in my electorate. The principals and students of schools like Eltham College, Plenty Valley Christian College and Ivanhoe Grammar School in Mernda have also asked me to extend their thanks. I recently attended a BER project at Eltham College for the junior campus extension. I will read out a speech by student Kathryn Clarke. She said: In early January 1999, I arrived to start my first day of school, walking in excited and ready for a new experience. The day I began I made my first walk up the long path towards the prep house. It had such a homely feel, instantly welcoming. 13 years later I stand before you with the honour of being part of this opening at Eltham, part of yet another year and a new beginning. I'll admit to you I was somewhat nervous you could say about seeing the building finished and ready when we had a look recently with Jodie. But the moment we walked in it had that same feeling, that immediate warmth that makes our school special as it is still today. This isn't just another building with 4 walls and a roof; it's a place where futures will begin, where the next college captains will have their first day at school. So I'd like to personally welcome each and every one of you to this new place, as it will become a part of our community as much as every other part of our school. It is exciting! Our school on a whole has put so much into this development though we couldn't have done it without the support of our current government led by Julia Gillard, who financially assisted in large way towards this build, so thank you. Enjoy the change, embrace the development and I hope you will be able to feel as at home in this new space as I know we do, already. That was a fantastic speech by a student about the children and young adults whose education and lives will benefit from the BER and our ongoing investment in their education. Eltham College is a fine example of what can be achieved in our independent schools. The staff and students are doing great work. Also, one of their key projects is eliminating homophobia, racism and prejudice. The principal, David Warner, said last year when launching the program: Any school will have elements of homophobia but it is much easier to deal with in our culture. We are not about putting people in boxes and our community needs to accept that behaviour such as harassment and homophobia is not acceptable.” I commend David Warner and the staff at Eltham College for their great work in stamping out discrimination through education, which in my opinion is the best way to do it. It was fantastic to tour the junior campus with students Riley, Milly and Eliza. These young kids did a great job, proudly walking me through their school, informing me of what they were learning and what projects they had been undertaking. The confidence and level of knowledge they have about their school and education was incredible, and I formally thank them here in this House for the great work they did. I am pleased to report to the Prime Minister that Riley is a Western Bulldogs supporter, much to my dismay! I also acknowledge the college captains, Caitlin, Cummane and Daniel Patrick, for taking part in the celebration of the new building. Mr Deputy Speaker, you could sit here and listen to the rhetoric and negativity we get from the opposition when they talk about a very how the BER is a waste and how it would be scrapped if they get into government, but remember that one of the key problems we see with BER is a skills shortage that was a legacy of 12 years of the Howard government. It is a skills shortage that we know is going to take a long time to rectify. Mr Chester interjecting",77
53,Mr MITCHELL,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"If you had put tradesmen on, you would have had tradesmen to do it. You know that is a fact, too. You could listen to that rhetoric, listen to the negativity and listen to the wrecking attitude or you could go to schools and listen to what the parents and staff are saying. For all those students like Riley, Milly and Eliza, I am very pleased that we have a Gillard government that invests in education. With this government's support, it is kids like these that will learn, grow and gain from these new learning centres. I invite members of the opposition to go into schools and talk to the students and listen to the teachers and parents who are overwhelmed by the new buildings, pleased that they have a government that takes education seriously. This government supports and will continue to support our schools, whether they be independent, catholic or public-as we always have. All catholic and independent schools in the electorate of MCEwen have received funding through the BER. There are 26 non-government schools in MCEwen-14 catholic and 12 independent schools. There are 50 projects: 26 National School Pride projects, three science and language centre projects and 21 Primary Schools for the 21st Century buildings in MCEwen. They either have been completed or are currently underway. Besides this, there has been a great deal cooperation between government and nongovernment schools in MCEwen, which has been fostered and demonstrated through the Gillard government's trade training centre initiative-another program that would have been scrapped and left us with more skills shortages had the opposition fallen into government.",78
54,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"Does the member for Lyne want the call? Mr Oakeshott-No, I am just cleaning up.",79
55,Mr MITCHELL,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"You had me worried then, Rob. The education sector has come together as a whole to support young people being educated in MCEwen. There are 10 schools-two catholic and eight government-in my electorate that have pooled their resources in order to give students every chance to succeed. Last November, the minister for school education announced that a consortium of schools in MCEwen had been successful in obtaining funding for the Trade Training Centres in Schools program. The Gillard government has committed $2.5 billion over 10 years to enable all secondary students to access vocational education through these trade training centres. My local school, the Broadford Secondary College, is the lead school in the cluster. The schools have been allocated over $11 million to provide three training hubs in the central ranges area. Other schools involved in the trade training centre are Alexandra Secondary College, Euroa Secondary College, Seymour Special School, St Mary's College, Wallan Secondary College, Whittlesea Secondary College and Yea High School. The trade training centre will offer qualifications in automotive, engineering, carpentry and joinery, and hospitality. These facilities will allow the schools to better manage any skills of shortages with locally trained experts, while creating opportunities and training pathways for our students. For these reasons and so many more, I support the government's Schools Assistance Amendment (Financial Assistance) Bill 2011. As I said at the beginning, Labor support education and we will continue to invest in school education, as we always have done. We will continue to fund Catholic and independent schools and undertake this once-in a-generation review of school funding to ensure that we get it right today, tomorrow and in the future. I support this bill and wish it a speedy passage.",79
56,Mr TEHAN,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment (Financial Assistance) Bill 2011. But, before I do, I would like to respond on the record to a couple of points that the member for MCEwen made about the Building the Education Revolution in reference to me. I agree wholeheartedly that the approach taken to funding Catholic and independent schools where the school parents, principal and community have been involved has led to some very, very good results. The sad thing about the BER is that, where public schools have been involved, principals and communities have not been allowed to have any say in what happens and that has led to some disastrous results. In the Herald Sun on Monday, this was again highlighted, unfortunately. Students at the Waubra Primary School have been in portable classrooms for a year now and, for the last three or four months, they have been looking out at their brand-new BER school while sitting in their portable classrooms on the oval-which means they cannot play footy or cricket-waiting to get into their BER project. It is all there for them to see, but it is surrounded by wire. The trouble is that no-one seems to be able to arrange to get the fittings in there so that the students can move in. This inefficiency and waste is another indictment of this program. Every day, when those students arrive at school, they are reminded of the Prime Minister's incompetence because this BER program, which has seen such waste, is her program and it is, sadly, still not delivering the right outcomes for our public schools in Victoria, which so badly need them, and for our local communities. I wanted to get that on the record so the member for MCEwen is not in any way able to distort the picture of what is happening at the moment. Mr Mitchell-You just distorted it then!",79
57,Mr TEHAN,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"If the member for MCEwen would like, I would be more than happy to take him to Waubra. Mr Mitchell-I would love to!",80
58,Mr TEHAN,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,He can come with me and help me to get the big wire cagesMr Mitchell-You admit you need my help!,80
59,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,The member for MCEwen!,80
60,Mr TEHAN,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"removed so that the students are not still looking from their portable at their brand-new building and wondering to themselves, ‘When are we going to get in?' Mr Mitchell interjecting",80
61,Mr TEHAN,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"The member for MCEwen continues to interject, so I will continue, cause there is more to this story. The school community had a meeting last week, and at that meeting they contemplated whether they had to reduce school hours. This is serious. Because the students are working and playing in such confined areas, the principal and the teachers gave parents the option of school finishing at three o'clock. What we are seeing under the BER program-such gross incompetence-is local communities having to contemplate reducing school hours. This is the wonderful, equal education opportunity that the government is presenting! I have to remind the member for MCEwen that this is the Prime Minister's program. This is hers; this is her baby-yet we are still seeing problem after problem with it. Mr Mitchell interjecting",80
62,Mr TEHAN,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"If you are happy to come that to Waubra, Member for MCEwen, I will introduce you to the parents who came to me saying: ‘When are we going to get some action on this? When will we get the Prime Minister to take notice of what her “wonderful” program is doing to our poor students? Here we are having to contemplate reducing school hours.' I think that says it all. I have that on the record now. The member for MCEwen's comments about me and the BER have been clarified, so we are all very clear on that. Before I turn to the bill itself, I say that I would also be happy to take the member for MCEwen to see four, five or six BER projects in my electorate which are not shining examples of this Prime Minister's program. Pity help us with future programs if they are going to be rolled out like this one was. The coalition support the Schools Assistance Amendment (Financial Assistance) Bill 2011, as it extends recurrent funding arrangements until 2013 using the coalition's be- socio-economic status, or SES, funding model. While schools know exactly where they stand with the coalition on school funding, a very serious question mark hangs over the future of school funding under the Gillard Labor government. Nine years ago, the Prime Minister described the SES funding model as flawed and unworkable. The decision to extend the existing SES funding model was made during the election campaign, as the government faced mounting pressure to outline what form the new funding model would take. It was a desperate attempt to avoid a showdown with the nongovernment school sector. Further evidence of this was seen in the initial refusal of the then education minister, Simon Crean, to guarantee during the election that funding of non-government schools would be maintained in real terms, inclusive of indexation, beyond 2012. Based on published information from the department of education, that indexation and supplementation for all nongovernment schools over the four-year life of a school funding agreement equates to approximately $1.3 billion. It was only at the eleventh hour in the election campaign that the Prime Minister, after intense pressure from the coalition and the non-government school sector, was forced to guarantee indexation for non-government schools until 2013 by extending the SES funding model for another year. Schools and school communities do have a right to be concerned about the Prime Minister's commitment to this funding arrangement because we have seen already this year the commitment made by the Prime Minister that there would never be a carbon tax under a government she leads shamelessly, disturbingly and utterly ignored. There is a real concern that the same will happen when it comes to school funding. On 20 August 2001 the Prime Minister said: This government, for its funding for private schools, has adopted a flawed index, the so-called SES model, which does not deliver on the basis of need. We know that model is flawed … … … … The debate is leaving this government behind: as it is left defending its flawed SES index, we know that there is research, becoming available in Australia to the community that cares about education, which is challenging us to move on in terms of how we define need, and challenging us to realise that in fact using a socio-economic may in itself be a flawed idea. On 4 September 2000 she said: The last objection to the SES model is more philosophical, that the model makes no allowance for the amassed resources of any particular school. As we are all aware, over the years many prestige schools have amassed wealth-wealth in terms of buildings and facilities, wealth in terms of the equipment available, wealth in terms of alumni fundraising, trust funds, endowment funds and the like … it must follow as a matter of logic that the economic capacity of a school is affected by both its income generation potential-from the current class of parents whose kids are enrolled in the school-and the assets of the school. The SES funding system makes some attempt to measure the income generation potential of the parents of the kids in the school but absolutely no attempt to measure the latter, the assets of the school. This is a gaping flaw … I could go on. There are many examples of Julia Gillard saying she does not like the SES funding model. That is why what is happening with the MySchool website is so disturbing. We have received packs telling us how wonderful the MySchool website is going to be and how wonderful the Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage is as a base tool for the website. We have been told that ICSEA was created by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, ACARA, specifically to enable fair and meaningful comparisons of Australian schools. We have also been given a guide to understanding it. It is a long guide printed on lovely glossy paper. I am sure it would have cost the education department a lot of money to produce this. But in none of this do we get the true facts about ICSEA. A report in the Age last month stated: PARENTS in the top income-earning occupations are not taken into account by the My School website when it calculates which schools are the most advantaged, prompting allegations it is prostatus ducing grossly unfair results. That is very true. The member for Herbert would not believe it, but it is true. The article continued: They say it has led to bizarre anomalies, such as Douglas Daly Primary, a one-teacher school in remote Northern Territory, which was ranked the most advantaged in the nation according to the index used to calculate parental wealth, education and occupation. Mr Ewen Jones-Those lucky Territorians!",80
63,Mr TEHAN,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"Yes, those lucky Territorians. That one-teacher school was ranked as being more advantaged than the elite schools in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. The member for Murray is here and I am sure she would be happy to comment on the Goulburn Valley Grammar School, which is also in the same area on the index as the elite schools in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth. Dr Stone interjecting",82
64,Mr TEHAN,SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT,"They will be shot once the Prime Minister gets her way because she wants to use this funding model to cut funding to independent and Catholic schools. There is no doubt about it-that is her long term agenda. I declare I have an interest in this because I have some children at the Hamilton and Alexandra College in Hamilton in western Victoria. That school has also been indexed the same as the elite schools. When the principal of that school wrote and asked about the flawed funding index he was bullied. He was told, ‘Tell us what your problems are.' Did he get a response when he detailed all the problems he had with it? No. He was told, ‘Either you sign up and agree with what we are doing or you will suffer the consequences.' There was no detailed consultation. Sadly, in our local newspapers we are getting headlines such as ‘Schools at risk'. This rural school in Hamilton that offers a very good education is all of a sudden at risk because of what this government is doing. Sadly, this is the agenda of this Prime Minister. She does not believe in properly funding our private, independent and Catholic schools. She wants to get the indexation changed so she can rip the guts out of them. We on this side will not let it happen. We will be dubious about the MySchool website. Debate interrupted. NA North Queensland Fury Football Club",82
65,Mr EWEN JONES,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise today to speak on something that I am very passionate about, and on which I will also declare an interest: Football Federation Australia has pulled the licence for the North Queensland Fury FC. My son is a nine-year-old natural leftfooter and goal-scoring machine for the Saints Sandcrabs. He fully intended to spend his winters playing for the North Queensland Cowboys and his summers playing for the North Queensland Fury. That dream has been dashed by the callous actions of Football Federation Australia. This team has only been in existence for two years and was launched with much fanfare by Football Federation Australia. But they did not come to the launch in North Queensland, they were too busy going across and sucking up to those Kiwis in Wellington. They came up and said, ‘There you goaway you go,' and that is where the support stopped. We had Robbie Fowler in our first season, and I was lucky enough to meet a lot of these guys, but since that very first season our playing ranks have been absolutely pillaged and raped because the Football Federation will not support football in North Queensland. Every Saturday at Murray Sports Complex and at sporting fields all around North Queensland you see people running around. My son's favourite player in the world is David Williams from the North Queensland Fury. That says that we should be in North Queensland and it is a shame on FFA for doing this. No wonder they only got one vote for the World Cup. (Time expired) Canberra Day",82
66,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to draw the House's attention to the upcoming 98th birthday of Canberra on 12 March. On that day 98 years ago the foundation stones were formally laid to proclaim the site of a new national capital city for our newly federated nation. On that day, Prime Minister Andrew Fisher said: Here on this spot, in the near future, and, I hope the distant future too, the best thoughts of lia will be given expression to … I hope this City will be the seat of learning as well as of politics, and it will be also the home of art. This city, Canberra, will turn 100 years in 2013. Then we will celebrate a century of being home to this nation's parliament, government and capital. It is here in Canberra that the threads that bind this nation are brought together, and we should be proud of our national capital's history and what it represents for this country. The plans to celebrate our centenary are well underway. The legendary Robyn Archer has been appointed to lead the planning for the centenary, and she has come up with an exciting and innovative program. In the leadup to the centenary, the planning team has introduced the Canberra Diaspora website, where people who have lived, visited, worked, lectured or studied here and have now dispersed throughout the world tell their stories about Canberra. I encourage any former Canberrans to take part and all Canberrans to take a look. I would like to wish Canberra a happy 98th birthday, and look forward to working with members to make sure this city has a centenary celebration worthy of its national and community role. (Time expired) UN Women",83
67,Dr STONE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"We are going to see the celebration of the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day very soon, and the United Nations has responded to this century of concern about women by forming UN Women. This draws together a number of the special previous organisations which dealt with women's issues. UN Women will, in particular, be established to be a new entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women. It will draw together the four other agencies which previously covered the issues of Austrathings such as the plight of women in war, reproductive health issues and women and poverty. The main roles of UN Women are to support intergovernmental bodies in their formulation of policies, global standards and norms, to help member states to implement these standards and then to hold the UN system accountable to the commitments. The problem is that the Pacific and Australasia are not on the board of UN Women, so some of our most needy communities with the greatest gender discrimination, poverty and difficulty in the Pacific and in Papua New Guinea-which Australia and New Zealand ably try to support-have no place on the board of UN Women. They have been ignored and neglected, and I am very concerned as to why. I do not know why the Australian government did not manage to insist that the Pacific was one of the regions on the board, along with all the rest. (Time expired) International Women's Day",83

69,Ms BURKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The member for Indi can roll her eyes all she likes, but International Women's Day was created as part of the International Socialist Women's Movement and we should be proud of those achievements. We should actually hail them. Tragically, as the member opposite pointed out, we are still in a space 100 years on where there is still inequality for women in this day and age. International Women's Day has striven for a long time to ensure that there is equality. But we still see differential pay rates, we still see differences between males and females and we still see female oppression across our globe. Even in our own homes, it is still women who do the majority of housework. Until the day comes when there is an equal share of housework in the home, women will have no equality. The FSU's first women joined in 1939. In 1956 the FSU's women's committee was formed. In 1963 there was the first woman on the FSU federal executive, in 1969 there was the equal pay for equal work case and in 1972 the equal pay for work of equal value case. In 1975 male and female bank worker rates were abandoned-it took until 1975 to do that. In 1976 the first woman was elected secretary of an FSU division and in 1985 FSU set affirmative action goals. In 1997 the first woman was elected FSU national president-I worked with her extensively and she was a terrific woman. On and on it goes, but there is still more to do, so everyone should proudly celebrate 100 years next week. (Time expired) EastLink Tollway",84
70,Mr BILSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In the electorate of Dunkley I try to encapsulate my advocacy as positive, passionate and persistent. I am afraid that we need all of those characteristics when tackling some of the enduring issues of the Dunkley electorate. How many times do we have to raise the noise problems associated with the construction of EastLink where it intersects with the Frankston Freeway, and get VicRoads to do something to let those residents have a decent night's sleep? I have raised this issue many times over a number of years, and we still see no activity. I was optimistic that the state Labor member may have been able to take this seriously and get some action under either the Brumby or Bracks governments, but, alas, nothing happened. Now we have a change of government in Victoria, and I am optimistic that the new Baillieu government will take these noise concerns quite seriously. When you look at this intersection, there has been an additional lane built adjacent to these people's homes. But somehow it has been designated as if there has been no new work carried out. This issue about new work matters because there are different noise tolerance levels for existing freeways compared to newly constructed freeways. And in the Peterson Street area of the Frankston Freeway, one of the things that frustrates them is that there have been noise readings taken that have exceeded noise levels for both existing freeways and newly constructed freeways, but alas no sound barriers. Why? Apparently the wind was blowing the wrong way. So the noise was going into their homes because the wind was blowing the wrong way, but still no action. We need to give people living adjacent to the freeway the chance to have a decent night's sleep, and I will keep working at that objective. Launceston General Hospital",84
71,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to congratulate the Launceston General Hospital on being recognised for the excellent quality of care that it provides. The LGH is my old hospital; I worked there for 17 years. It is a fantastic place. The Launceston General Hospital has been awarded Australian Council on Healthcare Standards' ongoing accreditation until 2015. The ACHS is the nation's leading independent authority on health care. The survey of the LGH has been completed and it has been granted the fouryear accreditation. Some of the areas that the Launceston General Hospital was given excellent achievement ratings for were work pressure management-a fantastic job, set up by Clarissa Young; blood transfusion services; safety systems; medical imaging; food services, which is run by Dale Anderson, a fantastic manager of that area; building services; building supplies; equipment; security service; and waste management. Waste management at the Launceston General Hospital has been reduced by 52 per cent in the past year. I congratulate John Kirwan, the CEO, and all of his staff for the fantastic wonderful hospital, the Launceston General Hospital. Higgins Electorate: Sporting Facilities",84
72,Ms ODWYER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Higgins) (1.54 pm)Sport and athletics hold a special place in Australian society. Participation in sport and the fostering of sporting ability in our children is something we pride ourselves on. All of our sporting heroes, from cricket to AFL, to our Olympic athletes, have succeeded because they have access to world-class facilities from a young age. Open space is at a premium in my electorate of Higgins. Open space and great sporting facilities go hand in hand. Unfortunately, there are no significant athletics facilities available in the Stonnington and Boroondara areas for local sporting groups and schools to hold athletic meets and competitions. The Camberwell Malvern Little Athletics Centre, under John Michelmore's leadership, has been advocating for a synthetic athletics track for its 400 club members and for the 80 or so schools in the area. The club has argued that the region is losing young athletes because they are forced to travel to more appropriate training facilities a long way from where the club is based. With no appropriate training facilities nearby, schools and sporting clubs are forced to hold athletics carnivals and training at purpose-built tracks at Box Hill, Doncaster, Nunawading, Collingwood and Olympic Park. The closest athletics track to the Ashburton, Prahran and Malvern areas is the St Stephens Harriers Athletic Club in Mount Waverley and Olympic Park in Melbourne. The Camberwell Malvern Little Athletics Club uses the Nunawading Little Athletics Centre off the Burwood Highway in Burwood East. Next week I am launching a petition on my website to address this local issue. I encourage the people of Higgins to effort of a have their say. Irish Cricket Team",85
73,Ms ONEILL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to second the words of the member for Chisholm, and acknowledged the importance of International Women's Day, but as the Secretary of the Ireland Parliamentary Friends Group and a person of proud Irish heritage, I rise today to pay tribute to a great and historic victory for the Irish people over an old enemy. I am referring of course to Ireland's magnificent three-wicket win over England at the cricket World Cup in Bangalore. The names Kevin O'Brien, Alex Cusack and John Mooney may not quite be up there alongside Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke and others yet. They will, however, go down in history next to the great Irish heroes and patriots of yore for their courageous victory. Enda Kenny, who will become Ireland's new Taoiseach next week, has paid a fitting tribute. Mr Kenny described the Irish team as having: … exemplified all the best qualities playing with courage and pride and showing that seemingly insurmountable odds can be overcome. As a competitive person of Irish roots I know how true that is! I would like to concur with those comments by Mr Kenny, and take the liberty of-on behalf of this House-passing on our warmest congratulations to those wonderful Irish cricketers. St Patrick's Day has come two weeks early, to be sure, and the green beer will taste even better this year. I acknowledge and applaud the spirit of the Irish cricket team. Honey Bees",85
74,Mrs MIRABELLA,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to note that more than 200 beekeepers descended on Parliament House on Wednesday to highlight the dangers of the Asian honey bee. Spearheading that campaign was campaign organiser from Indi Jodie Goldsworthy. If only the government gave enough attention and care to the needs and concerns of business campaign organisers as well as union organisers, perhaps the honey bee industry would not be in the plight it is now. Joining Jodie were honey bee keepers from all over Australia, including Linton Briggs. The Labor Party ceases a mere $5 million eradication program. While they reinstate hundreds of millions of dollars of programs at the request of the Greens, waste more than $10 million on advertising a health system that never even came into existence, what do they do for a very important industry that has ramifications for food security in Australia and poses significant threats to local agriculture, not only in the north-east, but all over Australia? Nothing! It falls on silent ears. The Asian honey bee is a great danger to our domestic industry. It is a natural host of the varroa mite, a major threat to Australia's honey bee industry. If this government care at all about biosecurity and have any interest in it, they will reinstate the funding and listen of our nation, to the local industry.

78,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the following statement, which I quote: ‘There is no point in imposing a carbon price domestically which results in emissions and production transferring internationally for no environmental gain.' I ask the Prime Minister: does she agree with that statement?",87
79,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will wait for the inevitable ‘Aha!' moment in the supplementary question. Let me be very clear with the Leader of the Opposition about my view. My view is that Australia should not lead the world but we should not be left behind either. We have a high-emissions economy. We cannot afford to be stranded with that highemissions economy while other nations change and the world changes. There are other nations that are changing; there are other parts of the world changing. Thirty-two other nations have got emissions trading schemes; 10 US states have got emissions trading schemes. The world is changing. Because we are, by the standards of the developed world, the biggest per capita emitters of carbon pollution, we have got a lot of changing to do. What that means is that we cannot afford to be left behind the world, and to make the amount of change we need is a major transformation and a major amount of change. That means we need to get started, which is why I have determined we will price carbon from 1 July 2012. To the Leader of the Opposition I say: of course the challenge of climate change is a global challenge; of course it involves more than Australia in meeting this global challenge; and of course we will continue to press in the councils of the world for the world to act on climate change. But at every point we should act in Australia's national interest. Australia's national interest demands that we do not get left behind with a high-pollution economy and that we transform our economy in a measured and sensible way. Pricing carbon from 1 July 2012 will mean we can start that major journey of transformation in a measured and sensible way; whereas, if we leave our high carbon polluting economy unreformed and then the world moves, and then we are left behind, it will be a dramatic shock for the Australian economy to then transform. My prism is Australia's national interest. My prism is Australian jobs. My prism is making sure our economy is a clean energy economy of the future. And my confidence is we have seen major economic reforms in this country in the past. They have been opposed at the time, but, when we look at the track record of what those major reforms have achieved, they have given us the prosperous economy we have today. The nation is up to this, the government is up to this and we will get it done.",87

84,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Why didn't the Prime Minister agree with her former climate change minister, Senator Wong, that a carbon tax will see Australian jobs transferred overseas?

88,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not quite sure, but I think the Leader of the Opposition is attempting to put to me the proposition that Senator Wong was opposed to pricing carbon because she was worried about Australian jobs. I say to anybody who has ever listened to Senator Wong when she held the climate change portfolio, or indeed since she has held the portfolio of minister for finance: Senator Wong you find someone with a deep understanding about the need to price carbon, a deep understanding about the benefits for the Australian economy and a deep understanding about the benefits for Australian jobs. I will check the quote used by the Leader of the Opposition, but my experience this week has been that, when quotes are produced by the opposition, the sentence is clipped to give a misleading impression. A direct question to me from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had that flaw, and it goes as part of a misleading campaign. On the premise of the Leader of the Opposition's question about rising prices: it was he in this parliament yesterday who was chiding the government for not giving sufficient information so that you could work out what price rises were going to be. So let us not have any of this hypocrisy from the Leader of the Opposition. Out of his own mouth yesterday, he said to this parliament he was critical of the government because he did not have enough information to know what price rises were going to be, and now, a short 24 hours later, he is back to making figures up and asserting price rises. I say to the Leader of the Opposition",88

The best way of doing that is to price carbon and where we want to get to is a market emissions based trading system where the price of carbon is set by the market and where the economy has a cap on the amount of pollution it can generate. That is the way forward. The in member for Wentworth is very perceptive about these things and the Leader of the Opposition should listen to his advice and the advice of economists around the world. That is the right thing to do. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the speech of the former climate change minister when she said, ‘Don't try to lead the world on it.' Leave not granted.

92,Dr LEIGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Terima kasih, Mr Speaker. My question is to the Prime Minister. How is the Australian government commemorating the service of our men and women in the lead-up to the 100th anniversary of the First World War and the centenary of ANZAC?",88
93,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fraser for his question. He joined me, with the member for Canberra, Senator Kate Lundy and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, at the War Memorial this morning to make an important announcement. I was at the War Memorial last week when the new Hall of Valour was opened. It was a very great privilege to be there with our VC holders-three very gallant Australians. It was a very great privilege to be there and to have the opportunity to speak. I described the traditions of the War Memorial and I recalled John Curtin's famous words that it is the ‘sanctuary of Australia's traditions'. I endorse those words today, as I did when I spoke at the opening of the Hall of Valour last week. I believe all members in this place, indeed all Australians, want to see the War Memorial properly resourced and maintaining its fantastic reputation as sacred ground for Australians and a place they can go to reflect on the costs and consequences of war and to admire the acts of courage, bravery and mateship that our forces have engaged in in every conflict that they have been involved in. In the course of last year, I became concerned about the long-term funding arrangements of the War Memorial. I wanted to see the War Memorial on a sustainable footing for the future. I also wanted to make sure that when we celebrate the centenary of ANZAC in 2015-it is preparation time as such a significant national and international event is not far away-the War Memorial has available to it the resources to do the job. Consequently, late last year I asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation to do the job properly, to work with the War Memorial, to work with the department and to make some decisions about long-term sustainable funding. I did not want to see a result which was worked out on the back of an envelope. I wanted proper advice and a proper and thorough look at the funding of the Australian War Memorial. In line with that review undertaken by the minister for finance and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I today announced that we will add $8 million per year to the funding of the War Memorial. This will join the $38 million already allocated to the War Memorial and will be indexed for the future. This is important for sustainability over time. But we also now need to be making appropriate preparations and arrangements for the centenary of ANZAC commemorations in 2015. In addition, today I announce that I am appointing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs as a minister assisting me with the preparation of the centenary of ANZAC commemorations and that we will allocate an extra $1.7 million to the War Memorial to enable it to revamp its exhibition of the First World War. As we move towards the centenary, more and more Australians will want to see that exhibition. I want it to be in first-class shape, and I know that the Australian War Memorial staff will do an excellent job with preparing that exhibition for 2015.",89

100,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will show the usual caution because not 48 hours ago the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was in here misquoting by cutting a sentence in half, deliberately only quoting a section of a sentence and thereby giving the Australian people and this House of Representatives a misleading impression. So what we know from performances just 48 hours ago is you cannot trust the opposition with much and you certainly cannot trust them to quote accurately. On the question of the views of the Minis- whichter for Resources and Energy and Tourism, I thank the shadow Treasurer for pointing out he has a very fine head of hair, and that very fine head of hair is on top of a head with a very fine mind inside it. The minister, using that very fine mind, is working with me and the government to price carbon because he knows, as I do, that our high carbon pollution economy needs to be transformed and we need to be using the clean energy sources of the future. If anybody wants a lecture on clean energy sources for the future, I would recommend to them spending eight to 10 to 12 hours with the minister, because he will be able to lecture for that amount of time because he has thought deeply about our need for renewable energy sources, he has thought deeply about our need to transform the Australian economy so it is a lowpollution, clean energy economy for the future. I thank the opposition for giving me the opportunity because the minister does take questions in this House but, given we have only been running at three or four for question time, he has not had an opportunity this week to explain himself, his vision for carbon pricing-the same as mine-his vision for a clean energy future, and to explain to the House his deep expertise in renewable sources of energy.

What we have seen is terrible floods, terrible fires, and terrible cyclone in Far North Queensland. We have seen devastation and we have seen very great need in our communities. That is why the government has worked with the Independents, the Greens and the minor parties to get support in place so we can get the reconstruction going. Today in data from the Bureau of Statistics we have further evidence of the damage that has been done in Queensland. Both the trade figures today and the building approvals figures today show the size of the challenge that we face-in particular in rebuilding in Queensland. The damage has been great-damage of private property and personal possessions, and also public infrastructure. Under the disaster arrangements the Commonwealth is up for something like 75 per cent of most of the critical infrastructure, and we have come to this task with good faith, understanding the damage that has been done in North Queensland, in Far North Queensland, in Central Queensland, in western Queensland, in South-East Queensland, in Victoria, and by the fires in Western Australia. So the passage of this legislation is absolutely essential-because the government understands that we have to pay as we go. We do have to pay as we go; there is no free way of doing this. Those opposite simply do not understand the challenge of the economic task before us, nor do they understand the urgent need to rebuild in Queensland. What we have had with the Leader of the Opposition is all opposition and no leadership. Not only is he saying no to the rebuilding of Queensland and other parts of Australia through the flood levy-just like he said no during the global financial crisis, just like he says no to the NBN-what we have is all opposition and no leadership. We have an opposition leader that becomes more extreme by the day, playing the politics of race, playof course a ing the politics of religion",90
107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Treasurer will come back to the question. If the Treasurer has not concluded, he will refer his remarks directly to the question.",91
108,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Everyone on this side of the House is proud to support a temporary levy to rebuild parts of Australia that have been damaged very badly by cyclone and flood. And what has been the opposition to that? It has been extremism from that side of the House, where they are taking their policies from One Nation.",91
109,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will go back to the question.,91
110,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You do not know whether it is Tony Hanson or Pauline Abbott sitting in that seat!,91
111,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer has the call; nobody else has the call. The Treasurer has the call; I have invited him to be directly relevant to the question or conclude his answer.,91
112,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,91
113,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I say to the member for Menzies-there must be something about that position on the bench!-that if he could just be a little quieter it would be a lot more helpful.,91
114,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The government and the minor parties and the Independents support this legislation because it is good for Australia. It is helping Australians in need. It is the positive approach we need to governing Australia. Carbon Pricing,91
115,Mr TEHAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Portland Aluminium, located in my electorate of Wannon, directly employs 600 people. Across the country there are 60,000 jobs dependent on the aluminium industry. Will the Prime Minister guarantee that there will be no job losses in the aluminium industry as a result of the carbon tax?",92
116,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for this question. Of course I am aware of the aluminium industry in Victoria, which he refers to. I am sure that he would freely acknowledge that it is there in Victoria because of the work of Labor Premier John Cain. His administration ensured that regional Victoria had the benefit of those jobs. I am sure the member acknowledges to his constituency every day the leading role of former Labor Premier John Cain! What I would say to the member who has asked the question is that I am all about tralian jobs. That requires us not to freeze our economy in time, not to look to the past, but to build for the future. I say to the ber who has asked me the question: presumably he could have got up in this parliament many long years ago, if he had been here under the Hawke government, and he could have asked a similarly phrased question about an industry that was having its tariffs reduced. He could have asked the Prime Minister then, ‘Will you guarantee no job losses?' What is the history of tariff nomic reform, floating the dollar, and trade liberalisation in this country? All of these reforms have built our modern economy. The legacy of those reforms is the prosperous economy we have today. If we had said, in the 1970s, 1980s or even the 1990s that we were going to freeze our economy in time we would be poorer today than we are now.",92
117,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,92
118,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will resume his seat. Mr Ewen Jones interjecting,92
119,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Did I say ‘his seat'? The Prime Minister will resume her seat. For once I thank the member for Herbert for his interjection! Mr Tehan-I rise on a point of order. The question was about guaranteeing that there will be no job losses as a result of the carbon tax.,92
120,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is responding to the question. She knows that she is required to be directly relevant. Up to now I believe that she has been.,92
121,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I was saying to the member is that during any of the waves of economic reform and transformation of our economy there are people who raise fears about job losses but economic reform and Auseconomic transformation, on every occasion, have left us stronger and more prosperous than we were before, and far stronger and far memmore prosperous than we would have been had we tried to freeze our economy in time. The future will be owned by those nations who are able to be nimble and adapt to a low-carbon future. I am for this nation being nimble and adapting to a low-carbon future. The course of freezing our economy in time is actually a course towards a poorer nation. It is a course towards fewer job opportunities for the constituents that the member reprereform, eco- sents in this place. If the member does not want to trust me on these propositions then he should turn to former Prime Minister John Howard, who was honest enough to say to the Australian people that we needed to transform our economy through an emissions trading scheme. I am being as honest as he was with the Australian people. We need to transform our economy. We need to price carbon. Former Prime Minister John Howard went to the 2007 election promising that, and the commitments I have made in this place and to the Australian nation are comparable commitments. We must price carbon. We must transform our economy. We must embrace the challenges of the future, not try and run away. So, do not be led down that path by the Leader of the Opposition. Play a role in shaping the future; work with the government to price carbon. Bank Fees",92
122,Mr BANDT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. The consumer watchdog Choice has today released a report demonstrating that consumers do not think it is fair that they are slugged for balance inquiries at ATMs. Does the Treasurer agree that people should not be charged for simply finding out how much money is in their accounts? If so, will the government guarantee that it will outlaw charges for onscreen balance inquiries at all ATMs once the current review of ATMs fees is complete in June?",93
123,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Melbourne for his very important question. I think that he, like everyone on this side of the House, is absolutely intent on making sure, for families and businesses, that we have the most competitive banking system we can get-a system that delivers the best value to Australian families and businesses in this country. Can I say that we do look forward to working with the cross-benchers and the minor parties both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate in the passage of our very important reforms to the banking system to make it much more competitive. To that end I met with the consumer group Choice this morning to discuss their reaction to a number of the very positive proposals that we are progressing. An example is the abolition of mortgage exit fees on new home loans-a very important reform-so that if people are unhappy with their banks they can go down the road. But of course those opposite are intent on opposing that. They are standing up for mortgage exit fees on new home loans as high as $7,000. That is the stance they have. We are looking forward to working with Choice and other community organisations and all the members from this side of the House on making sure that we do everything we can to progress account portability. This is very difficult and it is the case that no country in the world has yet achieved full account portability. But we have got Bernie Fraser working on this task and he will come back to the government with a report on that. This is a very important part of our financial system. Any changes have to be made in a methodical and careful way. So we do look forward to the report from Bernie Fraser. We also have the Treasury working with the Reserve Bank when it comes to ATM fees and charges and the question about account inquiries. Those two bodies will take that into account in their current deliberations. For our part, on this side of the House we are absolutely committed to a competitive banking system, unlike those opposite who just stand for high mortgage exit fees. United States of America",93
124,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister advise the House of the state of Australia's relations with the United States and of her visit to Washington next week?,93
125,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Banks for his question. I trust that all members of the House are able at this point to unite and say that our alliance with the United States has had bipartisan support for 60 years. Indeed we are celebrating the 60th year and that is a great celebration. There has been bipartisan support from the days when John Curtin said to this nation that we should look to America. There has been bipartisan support as we have made our way in the world in times of war and in times of peace. I have described the relationship between our two countries as being ‘great mates'. I have had the opportunity to meet with President Obama at the G20, at the APEC meeting, and at the NATO meeting discussing the further strategy in Afghanistan. When I met with President Obama at the APEC meeting he invited me to visit Washington early this year, and I will be accepting that invitation and travelling to America this weekend to meet with President Obama. In America when meeting with President Obama I intend to pursue discussions on a broad range of fronts for Australia. First and foremost, we will be discussing the way in which the globe is emerging from the global financial crisis. There are still challenges the global economy. Australia has emerged very strong indeed, but I think we are all aware that there continue to be challenges in the global economy that need to be worked through and discussed, and I look forward to those discussions with President Obama. Secondly, we will be discussing our joint mission in Afghanistan. This was part of what was discussed at the NATO meeting in ISAF format, which I attended late last year with the endorsement of the strategy put forward by General Petraeus, the strategy that informed the statement. I made to this House about our future strategy in Afghanistan as we move to transition. Of course I will be pursuing discussion on Afghanistan and the way ahead. I will be talking to President Obama about our region and the importance of the emerging new regional architecture including the East Asia Summit in which the US and China will participateMs Julie Bishop-No, no-Russia!",93
126,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, if I could just finish my answer without her catcalling, that would be very useful.",94
127,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,94
128,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will ignore the interjections and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,94
129,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. You do not want to trust her with a quote either. The emerging regional architecture involving the US sitting at the table, bringing the US to the table with China and with the other major economies of our region and with Russia at the table, is a very important development. And of course we will be talking about the Trans-Pacific Partnership. President Obama made it very clear at APEC that he has an aspiration to see the to Trans-Pacific Partnership concluded with an interim result in Honolulu when he leads APEC at the end of this year. I also will have the very great honour of addressing a joint sitting of congress in the US. I view this as an honour for our nation and I am very much looking forward to the opportunity. I will update the House when it next sits on my discussions in the United States. Carbon Pricing",94
130,Mr RAMSEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the comments of the CEO of BlueScope Steel, Paul O'Malley, on radio this morning. He said: When Australian manufacturing is doing it tough … the last thing you would expect to happen is for the Government to kick you while you are down … the policy is really an incentive to move steel manufacturing overseas rather than to lower carbon. Will the Prime Minister guarantee that jobs at Australian steel manufacturers BlueScope and OneSteel will not be exported overseas as a result of your carbon tax?",94
131,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. I would say to the member, of course people are going to put a variety of views in this debate, but in terms of what the business community is saying to this nation, I would refer him to the fact that the following major businesses have said that they are in favour of carbon pricing.",95
132,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,95
133,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have got to disagree with the members' interjections. There are more businesses in this country than just the ones referred to. There is a business called BHP, for example, and BHP is in favour of pricing carbon. There is a business called Telstra which is in favour of pricing carbon. Xstrata Coal, TRU Energy, AGL Energy, SantosMr Hartsuyker- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I would ask you to draw the Prime Minister back to the question. This is about the steel industry. Telstra does not make steel, the last time. I looked.",95
134,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister is aware of her responsibility to make her response directly relevant to the question and I am sure that she will relate her material in that way.,95
135,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked about jobs; I was asked about manufacturing. Consequently, I am giving the view of a number of businesses who would care about jobs. On businesses that deal with manufacturing I would point the member who asked the question in the direction of General Motors Holden. They are a manufacturer and they are in favour of pricing carbon. The member might want to think: why do these very big businesses, including a major manufacturing business, want to price carbon? It is because they know that the world economy is going to change. They know that our economy needs to change. They have prospered so far by innovating, by changing, by making sure that they are in front of world trends. We would not have Holden in this country if it had not been capable of innovating. If it were still making the cars of yesterday, it would be out of business. Telstra would not be a business in this country if it had not innovated. If it had said when the information technology revolution came along, ‘I know what we'll do, we'll stick with the fixed line network and we'll give all of that new technology to someone else,' Telstra would not be a big business in this country. Businesses in this country prosper because they look at the future, they respond and they innovate and that is what putting a price on carbon pollution is about: driving innovation. I am an incredible optimist about the dynamism and strength of our business community. I am an incredible optimist about the ability of our nation's economy to adapt to this challenge. Every lesson from history teaches me that we should be optimistic. The death of Australian manufacturing has been predicted from the days that Bob Hawke as Prime Minister determined to reduce tariffs. Everybody said, ‘That's it, manufacturinggone.' Earlier this week I drove the new Holden Cruze off the production line. Claims about the death of manufacturing were wrong then and they are wrong now. Of course, as we move to this low-pollution, clean energy economy there will be businesses that need assistance in the transition. I understand that and, as we work through the policy of pricing carbon, we will obviously be looking at the needs of Australian businesses. An opposition member-What is a car made of?",95
136,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member is helpfully interjecting, ‘What is a car made of?' I happen to know and I was driving a new car off the Holden production line this week, a business that has innovated. I say to him: stop trying to generate fear, stop underestimating Australian industry, stop talking Australian manufacturing down. They are smart, they are agile, they will keep up, they will innovate and they will prosper for the future. National Interest",95
137,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, how is the government working in the national interest and why is it vital to have responsible debate on the challenges facing Australia?",96
138,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Page for her question. We have spent a number of parliamentary weeks now and as parliament has sat it has become clearer and clearer that, whilst the government pursues day after day the national interest, we are seeing the opposition day after day pursue its political interest. We are seeing once again a day of a fear campaign. Today's theme is a fear campaign about Australian jobs. Yesterday's campaign was a fear campaign about not enough information. Curiously, two days before we had a fear campaign about price rises, which they said at that stage they could put a dollar figure on, so the inconsistency in these fear campaigns might cause some to pause and reflect. But it is a fear campaign. Where have we heard these fear campaigns before? Let's just think back on the short number of parliamentary weeks since the start of this year. We had a fear campaign about the flood levy. For a while the opposition thought that it was onto a winner. I announced the $5.6 billion package to rebuild Queensland, to rebuild the nation, and the opposition was straight out of the blocks ing: ‘Australians will never accept this. This will break the government. It won't get through the parliament. People will never accept this. They'll never take it. People should ring talkback. People should complain.' Of course the opposition was squealing with delight. Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, on a point of order, the honourable member for Page asked the Prime Minister to respond to the challenges facing Australia. She has been speaking for almost a minute and a half now and she has not identified one challenge facing Australia. All she is doing is using this as an opportunity to attack the opposition.",96
139,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Menzies will resume his seat.,96
140,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I was asked about the national interest and I do consider rebuilding from the most expensive natural disaster in the nation's history as a challenge. It is a challenge we are up to and a challenge that we have allocated $5.6 billion for and that is before we made the allocation for the damage stemming from the cyclone. Mr Andrews interjecting,96
141,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That of course has been a challenge the government has stepped up to in the face of an opposition fear campaign. I ask members of this parliament and the public to reflect today: where is that fear campaign? The parliament has indicated that it will pass the flood levy legislation-where is that fear campaign? Like all fear campaigns, when it was really held up to the light it just fell away. Mr Andrews interjecting",96
142,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Of course we have seen fear campaigns in other areas. We have seen fear campaigns about health.,96
143,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister will resume her seat. The member for Mensay- zies is now warned. But by way of response to his interjections, listen to the whole question; do not approach the dispatch box quoting only half the question. The Prime Minister is responding to the question and, I repeat, the member for Menzies is warned and I remind the House that a warning can also be a precursor to a naming.",96
144,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, we saw fear campaigns and criticism about our health package-condemned out of the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition before it was announced. But the government will deliver that health package because we need to reform health for the future. We have had opposition criticisms of our education reforms, but we will deliver those reforms, including MySchool 2.0 tomorrow, another step in transforming Australian education. We have heard opposition fear campaigns about the National Broadband Network, but we will build the National Broadband Network so that Australians have access to the jobs and services of the future. There is a theme here. It is: who is up to acting in the national est, dealing with the challenges of the future? Who is it that always looks to the short-term, narrow political interest and always says no? Australians want to see positive leadership for this nation's future and we will continue to provide that positive leadership. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: there will come a day when Australians will look at him and say, ‘Why is he incapable of saying yes to any positive proposition for the nation's future?'",97
145,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will come back to the question.,97
146,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,National interest versus political interest-that is the divide in this parliament. Carbon Pricing,97
147,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, I refer to reports today that consumers will be forced to pay even more in GST, stamp duty, capital gains tax and even council rates as your carbon tax feeds into the price of almost every consumable item. Prime Minister, how much more will consumers have to pay in these extra taxes? Isn't it true that there is no way to quarantine these impacts because the carbon tax applies and compounds at every stage of production?",97
148,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the-is it the finance minister? Whatever portfolio the member for Goldstein has today, I thank him for his question. Can I say to the member for Goldstein and, more broadly, to the opposition: I anticipate that we will be back here for the next sitting week and they will be saying: ‘Christmas will be cancelled! Children will not get Easter eggs! The tooth fairy will never come!' This is where we will get to in the next few sitting weeks-absurd proposition on absurd proposition. These people cower in the face of the challenges of the future. These people cower and they ask interthe Australian nation to cower with them. They ask the Australian nation to say to itselfMr Hartsuyker- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Once again, the Prime Minister is not being directly relevant to the question, which asked about the impact of the carbon tax on other taxes, such as GST and stamp duty.",97
149,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I thank the member for Cowper for approaching the dispatch box and making a point of order without any additions. I say to the Prime Minister that she must make her material directly relevant to the question.,97
150,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much. This is another part of the opposition's fear campaign. On this fear campaign we say to Australians: ‘Don't fall for it. They are asking you to cower in the face of the future.' They are asking Australians to believe that they are incapable of change. Australians are smart, competent people. They are up to this. They will get it done and they will leave the opposition stranded as history marches past them. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Or",97
151,Mr ABBOTT,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional ders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah moving immediatelyMr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We now have this every day at 10 to three so that the Leader of the Opposition can get on television before Play School at five past three.",98
152,Unknown,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,Opposition members interjecting,98
153,The SPEAKER,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"I thank members on my left for their advice. Like when it is done on my right, what you have now done is save the Leader of the House from a warning. If you do not think that I can deal with things by myself and if you continue to interject for the whole 50 minutes, I will not-I will not-have no reaction to that. The Leader of the House knows that that was not a point of order. The Leader of the Opposition has the call. The House might indicate that it takes these matters seriously by sitting there quietly. The Leader of the Opposition has the call.",98
154,Mr ABBOTT,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"Thanks, Mr SPEAKER Mr Stephen Smith- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The capacity to move for the suspension of standing orders during question time is afforded under the standing orders. The practice has been, for a very long period of time, that it is moved in exceptional or rare circumstances, not every day. To move the motion, as the Leader of the Opposition has done, every day this week at a particular time, is an abuse",98
155,The SPEAKER,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"Order! The Minister for DefenceMr Stephen Smith-I am making a point of order, Mr Speaker.",98
156,The SPEAKER,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"No. The Minister for Defence will resume his seat. I simply say ders that the action is permissible under the standing orders. There may be some vague strain in precedent that indicates and supports what has been put to me, but I have not actually orread it. The Leader of the Opposition has the call.",98
157,Mr ABBOTT,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"Mr Speaker, could I suggest that the clock might start again at 10 minutes.",98
158,The SPEAKER,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,The Leader of the Opposition has the call.,98
159,Mr ABBOTT,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah moving immediately-That this House censure the Prime Minister: (1) and the Government for recklessly introducing a carbon tax that will damage the economy, slug everyday Australians with cost increases they can't afford and drive manufacturing jobs offshore; (2) and the Government for recklessly introducing a new carbon tax without a mandate from the people; (3) for vacating the highest elected office in the land and handing control to Bob Brown and the Greens; and (4) and the Government for gross ineptitude in introducing yet another policy that hasn't been thought through, that hasn't been consulted, that risks jobs, that hurts everyday people and that isn't in Australia's national interest. This Prime Minister is committed to a tax that she cannot explain and she will not defend. This Prime Minister and this government are committed to a tax which is explicitly designed to raise Australians' cost of living and which is explicitly designed to drive manufacturing jobs offshore. This tax has to close down the coal industry because the coal industry is an emitter. This tax has to close down industries which are highemissions industries. That is the whole point and purpose of the tax-only she is not closing down the coal industry overseas, she is not closing down manufacturing industry overseas; her tax is closing down the coal industry here and the manufacturing industry here. That is why it is such a bad tax and that is why this Prime Minister and this government should be censured by the House. The very purpose of this tax is to make every single Australian's life more expensive when he or she turns on the light or when he or she gets into a motor car. That is the whole point of this tax. What has happened here is that the Greens have kick-started this great big new tax. They hijacked the Prime Minister's courtyard on Thursday of last week. They took over the Prime Minister's press conference on Thursday of last week. They have commandeered the government's climate change policy, as they have commandeered the policies on so much else. Whether it is climate change or gay marriage, the Greens are in charge and Bob Brown is the real Prime Minister of this country. Labor is in office but the Greens are in power. Julia Gillard might be in the Lodge but Bob Brown is calling the shots and he now seems to be running the government. I know members opposite have been described by one of their own number as lobotomised zombies, but even the zombies are noticing what has gone on. Notwithstanding the lobotomy, they have worked out that the Greens are in charge because that is why we had the three wise men",98
160,The SPEAKER,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. I read from page 333 of House of Representatives Practice: A Member debating a motion to suspend standing orders may not dwell on the subject matter which is the object of the suspension. I invite the Leader of the Opposition to debate the question as to why the suspension of standing orders should occur at this time.,99
161,Mr ABBOTT,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I take that point. It is very important that we should suspend standing orders so that the people of Australia might understand exactly what this government is doing. The three wise men of the Labor Party have woken up to the fact that the government has been hijacked by the Greens. That is why they were in the Prime Minister's office yesterday at 10.30 demanding that she change her position. What have we got here? This is why it is so important to suspend standing orders. We have got yet another big new tax on top of the mining tax and on top of the flood tax. This is the third new tax that this government wants to introduce this year. We have got a government that has no mandate whatsoever. In fact, if anything, it has a mandate not to introduce a carbon tax. Now we have deliberate disruption from members opposite. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, on a point of order that goes directly to relevance: the Leader of the Opposition must speak to the suspension motion, not to the substance of the motion.",99
162,The SPEAKER,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,The Leader of the Opposition will refer to the reasons requiring a suspension of standing orders and not go to the matters that are canvassed in the reason for the suspension.,99
163,Mr ABBOTT,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"It is absolutely urgent that this Prime Minister come into the House and explain exactly why it is that her government has been hijacked by the Greens and exactly why it is that she has breached her pre-election commitments to the Australian people. This Prime Minister needs an honesty transplant, but she looks behind her and she cannot find a single donor on the Labor Party benches. Oh, you are volunteering, are you? Mr Stephen Smith- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: how can a phrase such as ‘honesty transplant' be relevant as to the reasons why standing orders should be suspended? If it is not a point of order, Mr Speaker, the words were offensive and should be withdrawn.",99
164,The SPEAKER,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,Order! The Minister for Defence will resume his seat.,100
165,Unknown,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,Honourable members interjecting,100
166,The SPEAKER,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"Order! This should be a robust debating chamber where it is a contest of ideas and not name-calling, but from time to time things are said that are very robust. I would suggest to the House that they sit quietly and listen to all contributions to this bate-quietly. The Leader of the Opposition.",100
167,Mr ABBOTT,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"It is important to have this suspension because, as the member for new England said in his local paper, ‘This is a debate worth having and it's not all downside.' Why are members opposite so keen to shut down this debate when even the member for New England said, ‘This is a debate worth having,' because we should not destroy jobs and raise our cost of living in advance of- (Time expired)",100
168,The SPEAKER,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,Is the motion seconded?,100
169,Mr HOCKEY,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"I second the motion. We move this motion out of a sense of frustration that the Prime Minister will not answer questions on the most basic aspects of a new tax that she has announced. Last Thursday, the Prime Minister went with the Leader of the Greens into the Prime Minister's courtyard, they were asked questions on the details of the new carbon tax and they refused to answer those questions. Since then, we have had new evidence, from a Roy Morgan consumer confidence survey, that consumer confidence has dropped dramatically in the past week directly following that announcement. We came into this place to ask some questions andMr Albanese- Mr Speaker, on a point of order going to relevance: the shadow Treasurer must speak to the suspension and why standing orders should be",100

171,Mr HOCKEY,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"So, each day during question time, we have moved to suspend standing orders to bring on a debate about the carbon tax. After frustrated attempts by this government to close down proper dedebate; after the government has failed to explain to the Australian people how much the tax will raise, how it will be applied, what industries will be left behind, what industries will grow; after the Treasurer yesterday talked about specific job figures and then refused to acknowledge that they were calculated based on a carbon price of $45 a tonne, we are seeking to suspend standing orders so the Australian people can get some answers. The Australian people want to know exactly what this new tax is going to do to them and how they are going to pay their bills. Every time we come into this place seeking answers to simple questions, as my colleague sought a simple answer to a question about steel jobsMr Albanese- Mr Speaker, on a point of order on relevance: if they want answers, they should ask questions",100
172,The SPEAKER,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,Order! The Leader of the House will resume his seat. Mr Albanese-They have shut down question time,100
173,The SPEAKER,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,The Leader of the House will resume his seatMr Albanese-and now,100
174,The SPEAKER,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,and he is now warned! The member for North Sydney will relate his remarks to the suspension.,101
175,Mr HOCKEY,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"Because we cannot get simple, straightforward, honest answers from the government about a tax that they have announced, here in question time we have asked them question after question about the impact of their new tax, and the government refuse to answer. Instead, the sole approach of this government is to attack others-to attack the Leader of the Opposition, to attack others on this side of the House, to attack critics like Paul O'Malley from BlueScope Steel. That is their response to every question requesting information about the tax they have announced. That is why we are seeking to suspend the debate. That is why we want to bring on a proper debate about the carbon tax. If we do not get answers, we have to continue to do this, because if the government does not answer questions in the House of Representatives then there is no choice for the opposition other than to come into this place and suspend standing orders so that we can have a proper debate. But this Prime Minister does not want to have a proper debate. If the Prime Minister wanted to be open and honest when announcing a new tax, she would have told the Australian people how much that tax would be and whom it would apply to. Instead, the Prime Minister excluded the agricultural industry but would not comment on other industries, and that has created a climate of uncertainty right across the economy. And that is in a period when that uncertainty was reflected by the Treasurer in his own answer on building approvals today-a dramatic drop in building approvals following the events in Queensland-but the response of the government is two new taxes. We on this side of the House say the Australian people want some answers. They want a Prime Minister with courage. They want a Prime Minister who is prepared to explain in detail how Australians' cost of living is going to rise with yet another Labor tax-yet another Labor tax. Prime Minister, don't run away from the debate; give us the answers.",101
176,Ms GILLARD,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"The House is being asked to suspend standing orders to hear a debate led by the Leader of the Opposition. Well, frankly, Mr Speaker, why would we do that? The dogs are barking, but the caravan has moved on. I would say that to the bitter, shallow, hollow people on the front bench of the opposition. They are realising, day after day-and you can see it written on the faces of the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer; these Work Choices refugeesthat they will never sit on the government front bench again. Let us go through the misrepresentations of today's debate. ThisMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I ask the Prime Minister to keep to the debate topic.",101
177,The SPEAKER,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. The Prime Minister will be debating the suspension of standing and sessional orders.,101
178,Ms GILLARD,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"We are asked to suspend standing orders because the opposition, in part, says that it wants to reflect views from the business community. Mr Speaker, let me just take you to today's misrepresentations to show how the call for this debate is based on untruths, as every other claim they have made in this parliament this week has been. Let me take you to the words of the Alcoa managing director, going to the question raised with meMrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister is addressing this debate from the negative. She tells us they will not agree to the suspension of standing orders and, therefore, she has to tell us why that is the case.",101
179,The SPEAKER,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,The member for Mackellar will resume her seat. The Prime Minister has the call.,102
180,Ms GILLARD,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"This debate would be a waste of time because it would come from the party of the past and it would include more misrepresentations. Let me take you to today's misrepresentations. In question time the member for Wannon raised a question about the aluminium jobs in his electorate. I refer him to the words of Alcoa's Managing Director, Alan Cransberg. Alcoa is the head company of the jobs he talked about. This is the truth, not a misrepresentation that has been brought into this parliament. He said: A carefully designed carbon price can achieve both imperatives-an effective economic response to climate change that provides incentives and improvements while preserving the international competitiveness of important Australian industries-we believe this is what parliament should seek to achieve. Why would we have a debate to listen to more misrepresentations, given that misrepresentation in question time? Mr Hunt interjecting",102

184,Ms GILLARD,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"The opposition would only continue the misrepresentations if we had this debate. There has been the misrepresentation in the debate so far of the position  Steel, who actually said on Inside Business",102
185,Unknown,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,Opposition members interjecting,102
186,Ms GILLARD,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"They are not interested in actual words, because it stops their fear campaign. Listen to his actual words. This is what he said: In relation to energy, there is absolutely an argument that says there needs to be a carbon price so we can have natural gas base load generation in Australia … So I think a carbon tax around energy is a really good thing to do at the moment and will have a big effect in reducing carbon. The party of misrepresentation are asking for a debate so they can continue their misrepresentations. We should learn from these two misrepresentations that the Liberal Party is incapable of telling the truth on climate change, is incapable of telling the truth on carbon pricing and is incapable of doing anything under its current leadership-the embittered, leftover leadership of the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer. They are the embittered leadership, the sour people, who cannot accept the result of the last election and the fact that we are in government. The only thing they have left-they have not got any ideas, because they get their ideas from One Nation emails; they have no other source of ideas except what One Nation sends to them-is a fear campaign. They are in a shambles. Mr Speaker, look at the shambles that they are in. They are trying to get a backbencher to take a point of order. Here we have the fear campaign.  during the contributions of both the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer you routinely brought them back to the suspension of standing orders. I put it to you that the Prime Minister is speaking not even closely to the suspension of standing orders.",102
187,The SPEAKER,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"The same rules apply to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will relate her remarks to the suspension of the standing and sessional orders. If people listen, they might understand how that is being achieved.",103
188,Ms GILLARD,GILLARD GOVERNMENT,"This suspension should not be carried because the participants in this debate from the Liberal Party have nothing to say. They just have a fear campaign, and their fear campaign is not based on fact. Today's fear campaign was condemned out of the mouths of the businesspeople they were trying to rely on. Let us go across the fear campaigns of this week. They misrepresented the position of BlueScope Steel today. They misrepresented the position of the aluminium industry today. Yesterday they said that the government should be condemned because it had not given out enough information. The day before they were trying to persuade people that they would pay $1,500 extra for electricity and 6.5c extra for petrol. Every day these people will make something up to continue their fear campaign. Every day they come into this parliament and misquote others. Every day they intend to mislead the Australian people.

More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",107
227,Mrs MIRABELLA,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Indi) (3.32 pm)There is one job that this carbon tax is intended to save, and that is the Prime Minister's job. What price will we pay? Thousands of Australian jobs will be exported overseas and thousands of Australian businesses will go to the wall. For what reason? For the reason that this is a desperate minority government and a Prime Minister who will do ‘whatever it takes', in the words of Graham Richardson, to grease up to the Greens and give them what they want so she can hold onto that mantle of power. The more desperate the minority government becomes, the more desperate the Prime Minister becomes in trying to save her job, the greater the lack of judgment we see. We see scores of members on the other side wondering: why when making this announcement did she allow the Greens to colonise the Prime Minister's courtyard and effectively show the Australian people the reality of the desperation of this minority government? There is one thing I can guarantee you: the more desperate this Prime Minister becomes, the more she will fail in her judgment and the more, unfortunately, Australians will suffer. We heard her speak before about people being misleading. Let me tell you: the person who has more front than a mall full of shops is this Prime Minister. The mother of all untruths in the whole of political history has to be the one she told on the eve of an election. She was a woman desperate, a woman being leaked against, a woman being knifed with a former Prime Minister out to get her, and she was saying anything-in the words of Graham Richardson, ‘Whatever it takes.' She said whatever she thought she needed to say: ‘There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' She also said, ‘There is a great divide in this parliament.' Yes, there is. On that side they are interested in one job: the top job; the PM's job. On this side of the House we are inundated by calls from communities desperate for financial security, desperate to make ends meet and desperate to hold onto their jobs and businesses. We know there are small and medium-sized businesses that do not have the clout of big unions or the entree into the government, and they have told us they are hurting. They cannot afford another cost to seriously jeopardise their already thin margins. That is the big divide: there is one job is important on that side-the job of the Prime Minister, which will allow the Labor Party to hold onto power. They are desperate because they are about to lose power in New South Wales. They are about to lose the heart of the Labor Party, and it is going to hurt them, big time. So they need to hold onto this one job. We hear the Prime Minister quoting this CEO and that CEO. Behind the scenes, when people talk about what they really think, manufacturing and businesses are not happy at all. But the Prime Minister, of course, with her very tricky words, would like us all to enter the fantasy land she lives in on top of the faraway tree, where everyone out there in business wants this carbon tax and that it is the answer to all the problems. We know that is not true. She arrogantly dismisses the concerns of BlueScope Steel and she told us during question time, ‘They'll just get on with it; they'll just find something else to do'effectively she said, ‘Tough: you'll just have to put up with all the pathetic decisions we make, every decision that drives up cost and every decision that makes Australian businesses uncompetitive in the face of imports.' We have seen their mining tax. We have seen them go back on all sorts of promises, whether it was cash for clunkers and the Green Car Innovation Fund or securing our borders. But the mother of all deceptions was the promise not to introduce a carbon tax. She will keep her job for a short time, but during that time what will it cost Australians and what will it cost the Australian economy? She has reversed the public good. Usually we ask people to sacrifice a little of themselves for the greater good; on this occasion it is Prime Minister Gillard and the Labor Party asking thousands of everyday Australians to sacrifice their livelihoods and their standard of living for her job. What an that arrogant Prime Minister. What an out-oftouch Prime Minister. What an absolutely delusional Prime Minister. As the shadow minister for industry, it is my solemn duty to inform the House that this backflip is on the back of so many reversals and contradictions that have had an extraordinarily bad impact on Australian businesses. I note from some of the Prime Minister's statements that she thinks the implementation of this job-destroying new tax is going to result in businesses using less energy. But what she does not acknowledge is that in many cases the lights are going to get switched off forever and that this will be the industrial sunset for much of Australian manufacturing. Already in the past three years Labor has presided over sustained contractions in Australian manufacturing that have been the worse ever recorded by the AiG and the PricewaterhouseCoopers index. More than 87,000 jobs have been lost in Australian manufacturing during that time. And just to add to this depressing picture, insolvencies across Australian businesses have hit record levels in each and every one of the years of the Rudd-Gillard government. We have been lurching backwards in a period when manufacturing has been consistently expanding in places like the US, Italy, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. So much for trying to help working families or even the newly unemployed families and so much for moving forward. Not content with crippling a sector to which they have made all sorts of promises and whispered all sorts of sweet nothings just to get elected, the government now want to tax Australian manufacturing out of existence. As the shadow industry minister, I am constantly impressed by the resilience, the determination and the innovation of Australian manufacturers, but at the same time. I hear the constant refrain from them-from one end of the country to the other-that they cannot afford to stay in business if they are forced to compete with imports that do not have the cost of a carbon tax placed on them. Already, they have to compete against imports which have been manufactured by countries with cheaper wages but which do not the same environmental occupational health and safety laws as we have. This one additional cost is going to drive many to the wall. We have not heard from the government what they are going to do with government procurement. Are they going to say when they put out a government contract that they will put an extra tax, the carbon tax, on those who tender from overseas or are this government going to continue the practice of favouring foreign companies that are not subjected to the same laws, regulations and costs as those in Australia? Are they going to say that they will favour cheap tenders and give Australian taxpayers' dollars to foreign companies that are not subjected to a carbon tax? I bet you that is what is in their plan because that would be utterly consistent with their secret plans, like the secret plan to send Army camouflage fabric to China. If they can get away with it, the government will. Is it any wonder in this current environment that we have Managing Director and CEO of BlueScope Steel, Paul O'Malley, saying that this government is engaged in economic vandalism, that it has an antimanufacturing focus and that it displays complete ignorance? There is no shortage of industry leaders and bodies lining up behind him to make the same points. If the Prime Minister thinks that industry and workers out there want this tax, she is utterly and thoroughly deluded. She would stand there and say black is white until she was blue in the face just to keep her job. She will say and do anything. Everyone knows, even the people who sit behind her, this Prime Minister has worked all her life to get to the top job and she will do anything, sell anyone and sacrifice as many Australian jobs as possible if it means that she keeps her job. This carbon tax will make our industries less competitive against imports and will not only export Australian jobs overseas but also export carbon overseas to countries that use more energy and put more emissions into the atmosphere by making the same things that we do. As long as they have a competitive advantage over us and no carbon tax, the incentive will be for them to produce more, to make more, whilst they retain that competitive advantage. It is not only a policy that will destroy Australian jobs and send them offshore but also a policy that will result in even greater emissions. In an act of trademark Labor stupidity, it is helping to increase the amount of carbon in the world's atmosphere, but that breathtaking stupidity means nothing if it means that the Prime Minister will hold onto her job. I realise that the Greens are hell-bent on taking us back to a pre-industrial era, and we see the Labor Party complicit in all of that, but it is no surprise when they have a Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research such as Kim Carr who has rightly filled the business community with dread, given that his close to two decades in parliament have produced barely a whimper of economic literacy and only resulted, in government, in disastrous policies that have threatened to remove the incentives to innovation. The Prime Minister stood there in question time and said ‘Oh, manufacturing will be fine; they will just innovate.' So what have they done? In government they are trying to rip out the most important incentive to innovation, the R&D tax incentive. The Prime Minister is all talk. She also talks about looking into the future and transforming the Australian economy. Industry and workers know that the future under a carbon tax means almost no manufacturing. The future under a carbon tax is tens of thousands of people unemployed. The future under a carbon tax is the single greatest disruption to the Australian economy and the destruction of Australian jobs that we have seen. If you do not believe me, Prime Minister, instead of just speaking to the big end of town, why do you not go out there to smalland medium-sized businesses who invite you to go and speak to them, smalland medium-sized businesses who have mortgaged their house and taken the risk to compete out there in the marketplace, who are as efficient as they can possibly be, who are working on very small margins? Why don't you have the guts, be woman enough, to go and speak to them, look them in the eye and tell them this carbon tax is good for their business? Tell them that this carbon tax is going to create more jobs and then you will see-from real people who have spent real money and made real sacrifices to carve out a living, to get some independence in their lives-the incandescent anger right around Australia. If this Prime Minister cannot see how angry people are, if she does not understand that they are being pushed to the wall with the ever-increasing cost of living and the insecurity about whether or not they are going to keep their jobs, then she is truly the most delusional person who has ever occupied the position of Prime Minister. As much as Labor mightMr Bradbury interjecting",107
228,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The honourable member for Lindsay will have his say shortly, I suspect.",110
229,Mrs MIRABELLA,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As much as the Prime Minister might want to believe her own words, the truth out in the real world is very different. The last thing industry and businesses need is an arrogant, interfering government-not to mention the Greens; a gaggle of Greens-who do not care about Australian jobs. I am sure the Greens would want a lot of jobs to disappear and a lot of Australians to go and live somewhere else, so they could get rid of those smokestacks and big factories that create jobs. But on this side of the HouseMr Bradbury interjecting",110
230,Mrs MIRABELLA,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There is a big divide. On this side of the House we want Australian industry to grow, to be competitive. We do not favour foreign companies at the expense of Australian companies. We do not want to say to Australian manufacturers: ‘We will put a carbon tax on you, and you know what? We're still going to buy from overseas companies. As an Australian government we will favour foreign companies.' This Prime Minister will destroy Australian jobs in every single corner she travels to in Australia. As her marginal seat members will tell her, there is that great concern. People are afraid. Forget about the faceless men; the faceless men are starting to look pretty attractive compared to the Greens. The Greens have taken over and now, with the faceless men losing their power base in New South Wales, they are going to be very sad indeed. This Prime Minister will import not just products and manufacturing but jobs, and should be seriously condemned from every corner of Australia. (Time expired)",110
231,Mr CLARE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I welcome the opportunity to have this debate about jobs, the most important thing in Australia. This is a debate about jobs, and every time we have a debate in this place about jobs the opposition get it wrong. We had debates in this place in 2008 and 2009 about jobs, about what it would take to make sure the economy did not go into recession and to protect Australian jobs. We took the action that was necessary to stop a recession and to protect Australian jobs. The opposition took the opposite position. They decided to oppose the stimulus package, which would, if we had accepted the opposition's advice, have cost 200,000 Australians their jobs-that is two Olympic stadiums full of people, or two electorates represented in this parliament. In that debate, back in April 2009, the member for North Sydney, the shadow Treasurer, said: … 300,000 Australians are going to lose their in itsthe government'sfirst term. What happened? Because of the action that the government took, faced with the greatest economic crisis in 75 years, more than 700,000 more Australians have a job today than when the government took office just over three years ago-despite the GFC. They have made the same mistakes when it comes to the mineral resource rent tax. The scare campaign has been running now for close to 12 months. We keep hearing the story about how miners are going to lose their jobs. Since the government has announced the mineral resource rent tax, employment in mining has already grown by 10.3 per cent. Despite the Liberal scare campaign, companies are still investing in mining because they know it has a strong future. There are 18,690 more mining jobs today than before that tax was announced. If you want to go into history to have a look at how the Liberal Party performs when you have great economic structural debates about how to improve the economy, you need go no further than the debate that this parliament had in the early nineties about compulsory superannuation. I went back and looked at those debates to see what the Liberal Party said then. Mr Ramsey interjecting Mr Briggs-What about the GST, Jason?",111
232,Mr CLARE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is what some of your comrades said back in the nineties. David Connolly MP said compulsory superannuation was ‘absolutely abhorrent'. He said, ‘Australia does not need, and cannot afford, these proposals at this time.' That sounds similar to what we are hearing now. Wilson Tuckey-well missed!-said that superannuation was ‘stupid and dishonest'. Senator Alston said it would ‘be little short of lunacy job to introduce a massive new cost burden on employers'. Remember Senator Panizza? This is a good one: The worse case scenario is the loss of 100,000 jobs … … … … Businesses and organisations will simply not be able to afford it … … … … Small businesses will be closed down … … … … … 100,000 jobs are on the line … … … … I can see those 100,000 jobs quite easily going out the door within a very few years. Senator Watson said there would ‘be rising unemployment as a result of this levy'. Senator Crichton-Browne said compulsory superannuation was yet another threat to Australia's future economic prosperity. Allan Rocher said it would ‘have a disastrous impact on business' and it was ‘a tax on jobs'. Mr Buchholz interjecting",111
233,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member for Wright will return to his seat or remain silent.,112
234,Mr CLARE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What happened-did compulsory superannuation destroy the Australian economy? No, people did not get sacked. New businesses and new jobs were created and it proved to be one of the most important economic reforms of the last century. It created new industries, and it now funds more than a trillion dollars worth of funds under management, making Australia's superannuation savings the fourth-largest capital pool in the world. It created new jobs and more jobs. A report that was released in 2009 by the Association of Superannuation Funds estimated that 60,000 people are now directly employed in the superannuation industry. That is structural reform of the econthat omy, creating new jobs. The same scare campaign that we heard then, in the early nineties, is back and ning again on climate change. The member for Indi, in her contribution to the debate, started with, ‘1,000 Australian jobs exposed overseas'. Then she ramped up the tempo and said that there would be no manufacturing left. But that was not good enough; as she got towards the end of her contribution she said that 10,000 Australians would be unemployed. Then, just before the endMrs Mirabella-I rise on a point of order. Perhaps the member should check Hansard before inaccurately",112
235,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member for Indi will resume her seat.,112
236,Mr CLARE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am sure Hansard will prove this quote is correct. You went on to talk about the biggest destroyer of jobs in Australian history. Forget the Great Depression! That is right up there with comments about Gaddafi. Absolutely ridiculous! Mrs Mirabella-You should speak to Australian businesses.,112
237,Mr CLARE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Is that right? The contribution was about the biggest destroyer of jobs in Australian history. You just have to go back to quotes from previous debates to see how ludicrous those comments were in the past and how ludicrous these comments are today. They should be dealt with with the derision they deserve. Economic reforms-structural changes to our economy-create new industries and new jobs. That was the lesson of the eighties and the nineties. Remember the fear campaigns about tariff reductions and other reforms of the Hawke and Keating governments. It was said that those governments were selling out, that industries would be destroyed, that jobs would be destroyed and businesses would close. What did those reforms do? They did the reverse. Big economic reforms in the eighties and nineties run- made Australian businesses more competitive by forcing them to innovate. The lesson for us here, when we are contemplating these reforms, is that economic reform and structural reform create new jobs. The Hawke and Keating reforms set the Australian economy up for this century, to compete in new markets like China and East Asia, to make sure that we did not become the poor white trash of Asia. Creating new jobs is all about identifying the challenges of the future and acting upon them to give businesses the certainty they need. This reform is not easy; we do not say that it is. It is going to require a lot of hard work by all of us, but the longer we wait the more this will cost. If carbon pollution is going to be capped in the future businesses want to know what the rules are as soon as possible. They want certainty. The sooner that we set the rules the sooner they can make long-term investment decisions that will create the jobs of the future. If we fail here the cost of our indifference will be paid by our children and our grandchildren in their jobs, because the longer we take the more it will cost and the harder it will be to cut emissions and transform our economy to a low-carbon economy. The cheapest and most effective way to do that is by putting a price on carbon. That is what the member for Wentworth has said on many occasions. He has tried to convince his party of that. That is what John Howard, the former Prime Minister said on many occasions, and tried to convince his party of. That is what the member for Flinders said when he was at university. In his honours thesis he said: … a pollution tax is both desirable, and, in some form, is inevitable … He said: … even if some of the Liberal's constituents do respond negatively, a pollution tax does need to be introduced to properly serve the public interest. Mrs Mirabella- Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to draw your attention to the state of the House. The bells having been rung Mr Mitchell interjecting Mr Dutton-I rise on a point of order. I draw your attention to offensive statements made just then by a member who is out of his seat. I ask that you ask him to withdraw that offensive statement.",112
238,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,What were the offensive statements? Mr Dutton-I am not of a mind to repeat them but they related to the member for Indi. I think they are out of order. I took offence and he should withdraw them.,113
239,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I did not hear the remarks. If I am not told what the remarks are obviously I cannot have them withdrawn. If the member did make an offensive comment I would ask him to assist the House but unless I actually know what was alleged to have been said I cannot take any action under the standing orders. I thought I was listening to him. He certainly should not have been interjecting from outside his seat but I did not hear anything that was unparliamentary. (Quorum formed),113
240,Mr CLARE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As you will recall, I was just quoting from the thesis of the member for Flinders. It says that a pollution tax is desirable and that even if Liberals respond to it negatively a pollution tax needs to be introduced to properly serve the public interest. I think that if he were true to himself he would admit that today. Unfortunately, because of the extremists that have been involved in getting rid of the member for Wentworth and taking over the Liberal Party, he has now got to put together another plan, which will cost taxpayers $10 billion, and to be effective would cost $30 billion. It would mean that the taxpayers that we represent would end up paying an extra $720 a year on their bills because of an ineffective, badly designed, carbon pricing mechanism. What is clear-and you only need to see what the member for Wentworth said on Q&A the other night-is that no-one supports the opposition's plan on carbon pricing. He was asked if there were any economists that support it and he could not mention any of them. No wonder economists do not support the opposition's plan, because it is a carbon plan designed by One Nation. The same people who sent the emails to the Liberal MPs about the flood levy and Indonesian schools are from the same One Nation that sent emails to try to scare the pants off the Liberal Party to get rid of the member for Wentworth. If you go to the One Nation website and you hear them talk about times when Greenland was ice free and now you can grow melons in England and in the 1600s London's Thames River froze over, and then you go to 2009 and you see Tony Abbott saying the same things, what is clear is that they are now more One Nation than they are one Liberal Party. That is why when they were interviewed by Phil Coorey they were saying that they were now being run by One Nation. Another member said that they were in the thrall of right-wing nut jobs. That is what they are saying about their own side to the journalists. Robert Menzies would not recognise this party if he were alive today, and one thing you can be sure of, Malcolm Fraser would not vote for it. It is a party so right wing now that it makes John Howard look like Che Guevara. John Howard did a lot of things but he never took advice from Pauline Hanson. Mrs Mirabella-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, on relevance.",113
241,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,There is no point of order. Mrs Mirabella-He has not mentioned,114
242,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Indi will resume her seat. This is a wideranging debate. Mrs Mirabella interjecting,114

244,Mr CLARE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They do not like it. They can hand it out but they cannot take it, can they? The truth hurts. They are more One Nation than one Liberal Party. As your own colleagues say, you are now run by a band of lunatics and right-wing nut jobs. (Time expired)",114
245,Mr BILSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Dunkley) (4.02 pm)What a revelation we have just had. You must really feel for the hundreds of thousands of Australians that are worried about their jobs and the households worrying about how they are going to pay for the increased cost of everything when they get what is nothing more than a rant. This is supposed to be a matter of public importance about the impact of Labor's carbon tax on jobs. Did we hear a word about that from the melodious member who just spoke? No. We heard lots of volume but no content, a completely vacuous contribution about something that goes to the heart of the living standards and the opportunity for people in this country to secure a livelihood through employment, and the reckless way in which the government, to hang onto power, is pandering to a Greens agenda to introduce a carbon tax it cannot explain, an impact it does not understand, consequences for households it cannot even articulate, and a concern of business and for employment it does not even bother to talk about. What is going on here? We have heard all of these stories from those opposite and a complete inability to address what is going to be one of the most fundamental impacts on people's existence in this country, and they cannot even bring themselves to talk about it. This is a tax that does not just land once. This carbon tax will land over and over and over and over again on every stage of production, on every part of activity, on every element of what is consumed in this country and then, on top of that, there will be a GST. The consequences of that are clear. This carbon tax risks visiting carnage on small businesses across this country. And do you know what is most concerning? The small business community have had to sit by and listen to Labor talk about how clever they are while 300,000 jobs have been lost in small business since the election of Labor. If that atrophy within small business and the economic strength that small business brings to the economy is not enough, those people in small business have to cope with this apathy, this indifference, this complete disinterest in what should be the engine room of our economy. When the Howard government was last in office, 53 per cent of Australians in the private sector got their job in small business. It is now down to 48 per cent and diminishing-300,000 fewer jobsand here we have a poorly conceived plan and a change that the government cannot even articulate. It comes in here with a couple of agreed bullet points that have been workshopped with the Greens, and then argues that it is some blueprint for enormous reform within the Australian economy. When we ask about consequences, we get no answers. When we ask about the level of the tax, we get no answers. We ask about the compensation package and we get no answers. And the small business community gets no interest. They are never mentioned. They are not involved even in these workshopped slogans that masquerade as some kind of considered argument about a carbon tax. They do not even crack it for a mention. It is as though the small business community does not matter. It is the same dismissive, disinterested titude we got under Prime Minister Rudd's CPRS. Everyone was queuing up for compensation, and you know who got none? Small business. And what were they told? Suck it up! Suck up the extra costs or pass them on to consumers. That is what the small business community was told. This again illustrates how this Labor government does not understand what is going on in the economy. It comes in here and boasts about growth at the big end of town and in big mining and big minerals, but it does not see the harm and the hardship its policies are causing small businesses right across this country. If this economy is patchwork, it is threadbare for the small business community. There are no sloppy margins. There are no easy profits. There is no optimism that the government is even remotely interested in their circumstances or the tens of thousands of people in every community around the country who get their employment in small business. What have we got here? A carbon tax that is going to hit every stage of every piece of activity of every part of production on every input because cost of living pressures in the household represent cost input pressures in business and they just cannot pass them on. They cannot pass them on because Australian consumers are anxious, nervous and frightened about what is going to come next from this government. They are looking for bargains. They are worrying about balancing their own books. They have got rising costs everywhere they turn and they are also concerned about the impact of this carbon tax on their jobs, their livelihood, let alone their ability to balance their own budgets. They are not mirroring this government that does not seem to care about paying its way. Households do care, they live within their means; they have to. But small businesses do not have these great, sloppy profit atmargins to be able to say, ‘Suck up this extra charge.' This is a charge that will go on and on building at every stage of activity. Wherever there is energy consumed, wherever there is fuel being used, this carbon tax will be embedded in those input costs and they will cascade through and snowball, and add to the cost of those goods and services, and then the government gets a large lick at the end of the day from larger GST revenue. They just love it. Do you think that this government cares? Of course they do not. They could not bring themselves to talk about this very issue. The surveys are quite interesting. There have been some surveys out there where having heard the Prime Minister say, ‘There will not be a carbon tax under the government I lead'-you know small business people, they take people as they find them-they thought, ‘The Prime Minister of this country said that, we might be able to believe it.' Do you know, 80 per cent of small businesses in a recent survey said they had made no provision for a carbon tax because they took the Prime Minister at her word? Such is the democratic deficit we now face today. They are now thinking: ‘What is this? Is this Guatemala or something where these undertakings from civic leaders just do not count?' You are going to run your own show and when things get tough, you just tell everybody, ‘You're happy, you're happy, this will be good for you.' Everyone will go, ‘Yes, that's right, is it, Leader?' It does not work like that in Australia. If political parties make commitments, they should stick to them-that is what honourable people do. There is little wonder as you travel around this country that you see the nation's leading cartoonists have familiar themes. You have the Prime Minister sitting there as Bob Brown's puppet and the Prime Minister interestingly is characterised as Pinocchio. You know what is really interesting, though? Where would Geppetto be? Would Geppetto be manufacturing these Pinocchio puppets in Australia? No, he would be pushed offshore. If he were manufacturing these Pinocchiolike puppets mimicking our Prime Minister, he would have to go offshore because all of the energy costs would be embedded, all the costs of getting the timber to his workshop would have carbon tax loaded into every part of that transport task. The energy that he would use, even the machinery that he would use, would have your carbon tax in there, so he would be buying in these puppets from offshore. I wonder what the likeness would be like. Is that what is really going on here? Is manufacturing so non-bourgeois that you do not want it in this country? Why on earth would you burden our competitive industries that day after day have to be world class and take on competitors right around the globe with a carbon tax that builds up, snowballs and adds lead in the saddlebag every step of the way when their competitors do not have to worry about it? What a cunning plan not to have to worry about small business-wipe them out. When you ask this government to explain the impact on business, who do they revert to? Mrs Mirabella-Bob Brown.",114
246,Mr BILSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They revert to the big companies. They might get their economic advice from Bob Brown because we saw yesterday that the Treasurer has NFI-no fiscal idea-at all about what is going on, none whatsoever. The keeper of Australia's taxes was asked about the impact of this tax and he could not even answer the question. Then he referred to a document where the carbon price was $45 a tonne. For people listening, that is not a $300 a year increase in your energy prices, that is $600 a year. Then you look at what is going on over in the UK where they surveyed some of these funky things that the government wants to facilitate that will create jobs and you find they cost 3.17 jobs for every job created in Australia. Something has to happen here. Labor has to take small business seriously. It cannot keep treating them like some second-class productive trash in this economy. Small business used to provide more than half of the workforce opportunities in Australia-it is now diminishing as days go by. They do not factor in your policy and decision making; your minister is the Marcel Marceau of the front-bench. Who knows what the small business minister does? Even at COAG do you know what got cut the other day? It was the Small Business Council. You do not even care to have a chat about it now. Come on, guys, you have got to lift your game. You have got to be interested in the impact of tax, you cannot describe the impacts you dare not utter and the consequences for our economy and jobs without factoring in the very real concerns of small business. Small business will find their voice, believe me. They were inspired by your ignorance about the impact of the paid parental leave pay clerk role. They will find their voice. I just wonder whether there is anyone listening because Labor just does not seem to care that this carbon tax is going to damage employment in the engine room of our economy. The men and women of small business deserve better, they create wealth, they create opportunities- (Time expired)",116
247,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Before I call the honourable member for Page, I consider it is skating dangerously close to reflecting on the chair for the member for Dunkley to refer to my ignorance in the process of his debate. He ought to direct his remarks through the chair.",117
248,Ms SAFFIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am pleased to be able to speak about jobs in this debate because that is what the government is on about. That is what a Labor government is always on about-jobs, jobs and jobscreating jobs and protecting jobs. If the coalition want to talk about jobs they should start with the Leader of the Opposition. He was looking after his own personal, political interest and blew up a bipartisan agreed approach to introducing an emissions trading scheme so that he could get his current job. So in talking about jobs, the coalition ought to have a look at what they have done first. We on this side care about jobs. We want to make sure, not just in one year, in two years, in three years, in five years, but in 10 years, in 20 years, that we have an economy that keeps nurturing, adapts and transforms and makes sure that we have jobs for the this future-so jobs for the day and jobs for the future. I listened to the member for Wannon earlier, in question time and beyond, talking about wanting to protect jobs in his electorate in the steel industry. I say to him that he can join us and do the right thing. He can support the price on carbon. He can support moving to an emissions trading scheme. That way, he will actually protect the jobs in his electorate. The approach that is being taken by the coalition, by the opposition, is irresponsible. It is reckless. It is set to scare people. It is not about jobs. It is about their jobs as they see them-their own personal jobsbut not about the jobs that we want for people in regional New South Wales in particular. I draw your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, to a report that came out this week from the Climate Institute. I will quote a little bit from it. It starts off by saying: Australia is in the early stages of a clean energy boom, with tens of billions of dollars set to be invested in renewable energy in regional areas over the coming decades. I care about regional areas because that is where I live; that is where I come from. A lot of members care about regional areas. We in the Labor government do and we want more jobs there. We also know that the national 20 per cent renewable energy target that was introduced by the Labor government-by this government-is expected to drive investments of around $19 billion, projecting out to 2030. That is what we are looking at: transitioning the economy to a clean energy future. That is where we are heading. That is where we will go. Since I have been in this place, I have heard every fear campaign. I have heard every scare from the coalition.
