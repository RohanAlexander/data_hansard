3,Dr KELLY,COMMITTEES,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support and Parliamentary Secretary for Water) (9.02 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Construction of a new lian embassy complex including chancery, Head of Mission residence, staff housing and recreational facilities in Jakarta, Indonesia. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes to construct a new Australian embassy complex including chancery, head of mission residence, staff housing and recreational facilities in Jakarta, Indonesia, as an ----- estimated out-turn cost of $415.1 million exclusive of GST. On 9 September 2004, the current Australian mission was subjected to a terrorist attack, when a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device was detonated outside the main entry guard station, killing 11 people. Rectification and new physical security works were urgently undertaken to the mission in the aftermath of the attack in order to provide staff and visitors with increased protection. The government approved the relocation of the Jakarta mission on security grounds. The new site will enable appropriate setbacks to the buildings for blast mitigation, while the buildings themselves will be deCommittee signed to resist blast. While the new develMembership opment is driven by the imperative to provide more secure accommodation, a rapid and large increase of staff in the Jakarta mission over recent years has resulted in the chancery being seriously overcrowded and dysfunctional. The development will provide efficient, modern and secure facilities for 14 Commonwealth agencies represented in Jakarta. The chancery will also provide space Reference and facilities for official functions, exhibitions, meetings, lectures and business missions. Subject to parliamentary approval an early works construction package, if applicable, the could commence in late 2010, with the main works likely to commence before mid-2011. Practical completion of construction folAustralowed by occupation of the premises would be achieved in late 2014. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to.

(2) The employer's number of full-time equivalent employees at the notice or dismissal time is worked out as follows: Method statement Step 1. For each person who was an employee of the employer at any time during the period of 4 weeks immediately preceding the day on which the notice or dismissal time occurs, work out the number of ordinary hours (including parts of hours) of the person as the employer's employee during the period. Note: Subitem (3) sets out what are a person's ordinary hours. Step 2. If, during the period, the person took leave to which subitem (4) applies, work out the number of hours of leave to which that subitem applies that the person took during the period. Step 3. Add together all of the numbers of ordinary hours worked out under step 1, and subtract all of the number of hours of leave worked out under step 2. Step 4. Divide by 152 the number worked out under step 3. The result is the employer's number of full-time equivalent employees at the notice or dismissal time. Note: The number 152 is based on (3) For the purposes of step 1 of the method statement in subitem (2), the ordinary hours of work of a person as the employer's employee are: (a) to the extent that a modern award, enterprise agreement or workplace determination applied to the person, and the person was not a casual employee-the ordinary hours of work specified or provided for in that award, agreement or determination; or (b) to the extent that a transitional instrument applied to the person, and the person was not a casual employee-the person's ordinary hours of work under item 33 of Schedule 3; or (c) to the extent that: (i) a State industrial instrument applied to the person as a non-national system employee; and (ii) the instrument specified, or provided for the determination of, the person's ordinary hours of work; and (iii) the person was not a casual employee; the ordinary hours of work as specified in, or determined in accordance with, that instrument; or (d) to the extent that no such award, agreement, determination or instrument applied to the person, and the person was not a casual employee: (i) if the person was a national system employee-the person's ordinary hours of work under section 20 of the FW Act; or the maximum number of (ii) if the person was a non-national hours that a full-time em- system employee-what would ployee would work in 4 have been the person's ordinary weeks (being 38 hours per hours of work under that section week) excluding reasonable additional hours. if the person had been a national system employee; or (e) to the extent that the person was a casual employee-the lesser of: (i) 152 hours; and (ii) the number of hours actually worked by the person. (4) This subitem applies to leave, whether paid or unpaid, that the person took if: (a) the person was entitled to the leave in connection with: (i) the birth of a child of the person or the person's spouse or de facto partner; or (ii) the placement of a child with the person for adoption; and (b) the duration of the period of leave has been at least 4 weeks; whether or not the person took any other kind of paid leave while taking that leave.

4,Mr MCCLELLAND,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. At the last election the Australian Labor Party promised the Australian people that we would get rid of Work Choices and replace it with a fair and balanced workplace relations system. This new system, based on the newly enacted Fair Work Act 2009, comes into effect on 1 July this year and will be fully operational by 1 January 2010. Provisions to ensure a smooth, simple and fair transition to the new system while providing for certainty in employment arrangements are set out in the two transitional and consequential bills, which were passed by the House on 2 June. These two bills are the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009 and the Fair Work (State Referral and Consequential and Other Amendments) Bill 2009. The Senate has now passed these two bills. The Fair Work (State Referral and Consequential and Other Amendments) Bill was passed without amendment. The Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill has also been passed by the Senate but with a number of amendments. The House now has to consider these proposed amendments. First, I remind the House that the government accepted amendments in the Senate to the substantive Fair Work Bill where they were in accord with Labor's commitment to the Australian people in Forward with Fairness and improved the operation of the legislation. The government will take the same approach in relation to these bills and, accordingly, as well as a number of amendments moved by of the government we will be accepting the two amendments moved by Senator Xenophon and passed by the Senate. I now briefly outline for the House the amendments moved by the government in the Senate. In respect of unfair dismissal, during the Senate debate on the Fair Work Bill the government made a commitment to Senator Fielding that, until 1 January 2011, the threshold used to define a small business for the purpose of applying the unfair dismissal arrangements would be less than 15 full-time equivalent employees. The amended provisions now before us reflect that commitment. The calculation of the number of full-time equivalent employees is based on the number of ordinary hours of an employer's employees over the previous four weeks, including periods of authorised leave, whether that was paid or unpaid. At Senator Fielding's request, it was agreed that the ordinary hours of employees on parental leave are excluded where that employee has been on parental leave for more than four weeks. From 1 January 2011, the threshold will be based on a simple headcount of employees as provided for in the Fair Work Act. The government has also made a commitment to Senator Fielding to add a further clause to the objects of the Fair Work Act that acknowledges the special circumstances of small and medium sized employers, and this has been done. The amendments moved by the government and passed by the Senate are intended to improve and clarify a small number of provisions in the bill. In respect of ballots, the bill originally provided that protected action ballots and authorisations under the Workplace Relations Act will be of no effect from 1 July 2009. A government amendment passed by the Senate now allows limited preservation of Workplace Relations Act protected action ballot authorisations after 1 July 2009 on application by a bargaining representative to Fair Work Australia. This will mean that employees and unions who are midway in an industrial campaign will be able to continue to rely on a secret ballot authorisation across the 1 July bridging period avoiding the cost, delay and inconvenience of running a new ballot process. There are also a number of government amendments passed by the Senate which are intended to further assist state and federally registered organisations to rationalise their affairs and simplify their operations across multiple jurisdictions. These amendments include changes to the provisions allowing federal organisations to extend their eligibility rule to reflect the broader rules of an equivalent state association. There are also changes to ensure that settled demarcations are not reopened by allowing Fair Work Australia to make a federal representation order that reflects a state representation order in situations where a federal organisation has altered its eligibility rules to reflect an equivalent state association. Finally, the list of Senate amendments contains a number of small technical and moderate changes which the government introduced in the Senate. These include provisions for the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court to have the discretion to extend, where appropriate, the 14-day time limit in relation to certain general protection and unlawful termination court applications. Two additional amendments were moved by Senator Xenophon that the government is also prepared to accept. The first amendment seeks to set out an approach that Fair Work Australia may take when considering an application to resolve the uncertainty or difficulty under item 26 of part 5 of schedule 3 to the bill relating to the interaction between a transitional instrument and the NES. The second amendment adds additional factors to be considered in the award modernisation process and is expressed substantially in terms already set out in the modern awards object in section 134 of the Fair Work Act 2009. Accordingly, the government accepts the amendment. The government will accept the amendments to the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009 made by the Senate. The list of amendments that we are now considering deserves to be approved by the House because the changes are all consistent with, and help to promote, the government's overarching commitment to fairness, balance and flexibility in Australian workplaces. I commend these amendments to the House.",23
5,Mr KEENAN,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"The opposition will accept the motion. The government amendments are relatively noncontroversial. The amendments of Senator Xenophon deserve greater thought. The most serious problem with this Fair Work (Transithose of tional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009 is that there are aspects of it that will directly destroy tens of thousands of Australian jobs. You do not need to take my word for that; you can listen to any of the industries that are going to be affected. They have got independent research. In the fast food industry, 18,000 people are going to be thrown out of work unless this government decides to change tack. In the pharmacy industry, thousands will be thrown out of work. Research done in my home state of Western Australia says that almost 700 people will lose their jobs unless this government listens to reason on this so called award modernisation process. The amendments of Senator Xenophon go only a very small way to addressing our concerns. The coalition had far superior amendments, but the government, the Labor Party, would not change tack, they would not listen to reason and they are hell bent on pursuing this course of action no matter what the consequences are for average Australians. Some of the most vulnerable workers in our community are literally going to be thrown out of work unless this government listens to reason and changes aspects of their industrial relations regime. This so-called award modernisation process is in pursuit of what we consider to be a laudable aim. But, like so much that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Ms Gillard, pursues, it has been completely bungled and botched. This minister cannot give the time required to her massive brief, so she bungles in education and she bungles workplace relations, but the consequences in workplace relations are particularly severe because we are talking about people's livelihoods. We are talking about the ability of Australians to go out there and get a job, particularly in industries which traditionally employ very vulnerable Australians-people who might not be able to find work elsewhere. These amendments will be accepted, but the reality is that the debate about Labor's industrial relations system, in particular this so-called award modernisation, has a long way to go.",24
6,Mr MCCLELLAND,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"I rise for the purpose of placing on the record the reasons for rejecting the opposition's amendments. Applying a global test to the National Employment Standards for transitional instruments as suggested by opposition amendments (1) and (2) would deprive almost all employees of the safety net and, we believe, would be unworkable and uncertain. It is inconsistent with the government's commitment to ensuring that the National Employment Standards, which underpin employment conditions across the country, are operational from 1 January 2010. The employer cost orders proposed by opposition amendment (4) are also unnecessary, we believe. The award modernisation request already requires the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to consider transitional arrangements and the government has made a submission urging the commission to take account of increased or decreased labour costs in each industry or occupation. Opposition amendment (7) would take away the ability of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to tailor transitional arrangements for particular industries or sectors, entrenching state based inconsistencies in terms and conditions for another five years, and then providing that they must automatically cease. This big bang approach, we believe, is a recipe for chaos. The commission is best placed to set out an orderly transitional arrangement and arrangements in the awards themselves. Opposition amendment (3) would require the commission to take into account business profitability in carrying out award modernisation. We note that this concept is already covered off in the existing criteria, which require the commission to consider economic sustainability, reducing the regulatory burden on business, the creation of jobs, productivity, high levels of employment and also labour force participation.",25
7,Mr KEENAN,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"I will be brief, because I am very keen to assist the business of the House today. But I cannot let the comments of the Attorney-General-the acting minister-go without making some response. What he said was not correct. If he could have been present for the debate yesterday in the Senate he would have heard that the new junior employment ministergranted he has only been in the job for a very short time-was completely unable to address the concerns that were raised by the opposition, the Greens and the Independent senators about the amendments. Our amendments in reality alleviate the worse aspects of the so-called award modernisation process that is going to throw tens of thousands of Australians out of work. That is what we are trying to do. They are considered amendments. The government come back with this nonsense about unintended consequences; they come back with this nonsense, ‘Oh well it's covered off in other areas.' If it was, we quite frankly would not have needed to move the amendments. Do not just listen to the opposition; listen to any of the industries that are going to be affected by these diabolical changes. This government talks about creating jobs and about caring for the employment prospects of Australians, but then we see them come into this House and do things that directly destroy jobs. As I said, this debate has a long way to go. Question agreed to. NA (NATIONAL JOINT REPLACEMENT REGISTER LEVY) BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 June, on motion by Ms Roxon: That this bill be now read a second time.",26
8,Mr CHEESEMAN,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Yesterday I got up to talk to the Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Bill 2009. I was talking about the definition of a joint replacement prosthesis as a prosthesis listed in the Private Health Insurance (Prostheses) Rules which are used for joint replacement, and the provision of a rule-making power for the rate of the National Joint Replacement Register levy. We are not talking small issues here. Australia's health system takes up a very significant component of Commonwealth outlays. Total spending is not far off $50 billion. This is a major part of our health system. We are talking about a major, and growing, part of our health care spend. Expenditure on hip and knee prostheses represents around 30 per cent of total expenditure by health insurers on prostheses. Insurers paid over one billion dollars in benefits for prostheses in 2007-08 out of a total $7.4 billion spent on hospital benefits in that year. This means that prostheses expenditure represents around 15 per cent of privately insured hospital benefit outlays in this nation. So it is important to keep a close eye on costs. This is an important area to keep good facts and statistics on so that we can develop new and better products that will give better care and better value to Australians. The Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Bill 2009 will impose a levy on joint replacement prostheses sponsors in order to fund the National Joint Replacement Register. The register collects information about joint replacement surgeries, such as hip, knee, ankle, shoulder, wrist and spinal disc replacement procedures and reports on the safety and quality of these surgeries and devices used to ensure patients get the best outcomes. I am informed that around 70,000 Australians had joint replacement surgery in the last 12 months. That is a huge number. The National Joint Replacement Register estimates that the information it has provided has improved surgical practice and changed the use of particular devices, reducing the number of unnecessary revision surgeries by 1,200 Australians per year. In addition to improved patient outcomes, the NJRR estimates that it has saved the health sector and consumers around $44.6 million-a saving of $44 million, and 1,200 Australians saved from painful, debilitating and costly revisions that ond surgery often entails. That is what I would call a very good outcome for the health system and for patients. You can see just how easily health system costs can blow out. In many countries, such as America, where health systems are in chaos and all about money, where the unfettered market is more important than good health care and good value, nobody notices these cost increases. We do. That is why so many of the world's health care systems get out of control so quickly with regard to costs. I am very proud to speak on this bill. It is another measure of the quality, sense and efficiency of the Australian health care system that this government promotes. It might sound a bit callous, but in a sense we are dealing with a product that is similar to a car or washing machine. It would be easy for inbuilt short life spans to be engineered into these products so that more products can be sold and more services provided. As happens in a number of other areas of commerce, short life cycles can be built into products. We are also saying that we can save significant costs to the system. We want better products that will last longer so that people do not have to go through the trauma of repeated hip replacements every few years. That is basically what this is all about. This bill is also about making the people who have those commercial interests pay for research costs. It is appropriate that manufacturers and importers of medical devices used in joint replacement surgery now fund the NJRR. The new cost recovery arrangements will be similar to the funding arrangements for the United Kingdom's National Joint Registry, which is funded through a levy on joint replacement products. The NJRR provides invaluable postmarket surveillance of joint replacement prostheses. This monitoring of the safety and secquality of devices provides considerable benefit to the industry by improving consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of joint replacement devices. Any devices showing high failure rates can be identified quickly and promptly removed from the marketplace. The data produced by the NJRR also assists the industry by informing the development of new prostheses, allowing manufacturers to draw on reliable performance information for existing products and designs. The introduction of cost recovery arrangements will produce $5 million in budget savings over the next four years. Legislated cost recovery arrangements will ensure the independence of the NJRR as the levy will be mandatory and collected by the government on behalf of that registry. The additional costs will be automatically passed on by device sponsors to private health insurers, resulting in increased premiums because the benefits that private health insurers must pay for particular devices are set under Commonwealth legislation. Any increase in benefits for joint replacement products will need to be negotiated between sponsors and insurers and then approved by the government through changes to the prostheses list, and that is a good thing. We are allowing the private sector to play a role in our healthcare system, but we are keeping a very close eye on it. We are making sure they provide real value. I think that is very important. This is a very good Labor bill, a bill built on Labor tradition. We are happy to see enterprise and the private sector operating in the healthcare system, but we want value for our money and we will intervene to get it. It is about making our great Australian healthcare system even better. I commend the bill to the House.",26
9,Mr TREVOR,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I rise to speak on the Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Bill 2009. This bill creates a new act, the Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Act 2009, for the purpose of establishing the national joint replacement register levy, for funding the National Joint Replacement Registry, the NJRR. The NJRR was established by the Australian Orthopaedic Association in 1998. It collects data on the implantation of prosthetic joint replacement devices and reports revision rates, complications and other outcomes. The NJRR also monitors mortality rates. Its purpose is to define, improve and maintain the quality of care of patients receiving joint replacement surgery. The information collected provides an accurate measure of the success or otherwise of a procedure. This information is then used to inform surgeons, other healthcare professionals, governments, sponsors of joint replacement products and patients. The NJRR provides post-market surveillance of joint replacement prostheses, and this monitoring of the safety and quality of devices provides considerable benefit to the industry by improving consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of joint replacement devices. Any devices showing high failure rates can be identified quickly and promptly removed from the market. This is good news for recipients. The data produced by the registry also assists the industry by informing of the development of new prostheses, allowing manufacturers to draw on reliable performance information for existing products and designs. The cost recovery arrangements contained in the bill will ensure continuing funding for the registry, while preserving the independence of the registry. As levies will be imposed under legislation and collected by the government on behalf of the registry, there will be no possibility of funding being withdrawn from the registry by medical devices sponsors. Sections 1 and 2 of the bill will commence on the day on which the act receives royal assent. Sections 3 to 9 of the bill will commence on 1 July 2009 or on the date of royal assent, whichever occurs later. The bill will enable the costs of operating the NJRR to be recovered by means of a levy imposed on each joint replacement prostheses sponsor, on each day specified in the Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Rules as a national joint replacement register levy day, and on each day, if any, determined by the Minister for Health and Ageing, by legislative instrument, as a supplementary national joint replacement register levy day. There can be no more than four levy days in a financial year and the minister cannot specify more than two supplementary levy days in a financial year. A person is a joint replacement prosthesis sponsor if a joint replacement prosthesis is currently listed in the Private Health Insurance (Prostheses) Rules-commonly referred to as the Commonwealth Prostheses Listeither as a result of an application made by the person under section 72-10(2) of the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 or as listed in accordance with section 12 of the Private Health Insurance (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2007, and the person was the sponsor of that prosthesis for the purposes of the National Health Act 1953. Sponsors will be levied according to the number of joint replacement prostheses they sponsor, and the levies will be used to fund the operation costs of the registry. The bill does provide that there may be different rates set for different kinds of joint replacement prostheses, that the rate may be set at zero and that there will be a maximum rate of $5,000. There are a wide range of prosthetic devices used in joint replacement surgery, as we know. These correspond to a great variation in benefits for different kinds of joint replacement prostheses listed on the Commonwealth Prostheses List. Benefits for some joint replacement prosthetic devices are set at less than $50, while others receive benefits as high as $67,000 per product. The Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Rules may specify that different kinds of joint replacement prostheses may have different levies. Given the variation in benefits for different kinds of joint replacement prostheses, a maximum rate of levy of $5,000 for a financial year is considered reasonable. Continued social integration for aged people is an important issue for their physical and mental health and general well-being. Unfortunately, several factors make it difficult for the elderly to achieve that goal, namely health problems, loneliness, changes in the social network structure and, importantly, mobility. In order to successfully grate into the community the elderly need formal and informal support by way of family care, but they also need to consider themselves as the principal architect of their own care, well-being and development. It has been well demonstrated that physical mobility, particularly outside the home, favours the maintenance of activities representing for the elderly a vital condition for their social integration. A high level of activity has been shown to be positive for successful ageing, health status and everyday well-being. Therefore, a better description of the elderly people's daily activity patterns, referring to either necessary or leisure activities, is important for a better understanding of how older people remain integrated in the community. A considerable amount of research has focused on the advantages of maintaining an individual's independence at home for as long as possible and the impact of physical mobility as a means to achieve social integration. This is a major issue, considering the fact that about 30 per cent of the overall activities of the elderly take place in the community. Mobility of the elderly is not only desirable for their social connectedness but also contributes significantly to their quality of life. To a large extent a socially integrated older person is mobile, autonomous, part of a social network and engaged in meaningful social activities. One of the most relevant instrumental activities in daily life for maintaining independence and reinforcing selfidentity is the ability to either drive a car or catch public transport, which represents independence and convenience and further symbolises autonomy and freedom. A community organisation in my home town of Gladstone, called the Gladstone Aquatic Therapy Association, helps many aged people who have had joint replacements. The Gladstone Aquatic Therapy Association was formed by a small group of intevolunteers in 1989 to meet community demand for water therapy following construction of a heated, enclosed purpose-built pool in the city. In 1994 the organisation became incorporated and was awarded recurrent Home and Community Care Program funding, allowing the group to greatly expand their consumer case load, appoint staff to administer the service and coordinate the volunteer program. In 2009 we now see the service accommodating between 90 and 100 frail aged and children with a disability, at any given time. Gladstone Aquatic Therapy Service provides aquatic therapy classes and water exercise to the frail aged and adults and children with a disability. The association is full of wonderful community minded people who do a fantastic job for our community of Gladstone and surrounding districts. One of the Gladstone Aquatic Therapy Association outcomes is to foster consumer independence and health maintenance. They have personal care assistants who hold agedcare certificates and coordinate the volunteer personal care assistants. The association provide a supervised aqua program to both the elderly and people with a disability to help those people improve their mobility, confidence, lifestyle, socialisation and health. They assist the frail aged, and younger and older people with moderate to severe or profound disabilities, from Miriam Vale to the south, Ambrose to the north, Many Peaks to the west, and the towns of Boyne Island, Tannum Sands, Calliope and Gladstone, which fall in between. The association assist people with arthritis, acquired brain injury, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, paraplegia and quadriplegia, those with a profound or multiple disabilities and those who have had a stroke, hip or knee replacement or some other form of serious injury. The Gladstone Aquatic Therapy Association are to be commended for their efforts. The consumer's health, well-being and independence is optimised, allowing people to live, to as great a degree as possible, independently and in the local community. I commend this bill to the House.",28
10,Mr BUTLER,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I thank members for their contributions on this bill. I particularly thank the member for Flynn for his recent comments showing the level of understanding he has of the contribution the joint replacement register program makes to his community in northern Queensland. We also thank the opposition for their support for this bill, as we understand it-though the shadow minister spent most of his speech making fairly gratuitous remarks completely unrelated to this bill, which does him no service at all. The one issue the shadow minister addressed related to this bill in a tangential way, and that was the issue of consultation. I understand that the Department of Health and Ageing will be discussing the implementation of this program in the bill with stakeholders. The Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Bill 2009 will impose a levy on the sponsors of joint replacement prostheses in order to fund the National Joint Replacement Registry. A joint replacement prosthesis is a prosthesis that is listed on the Commonwealth Prostheses List and used in joint replacement surgery. The person who made the application to have the joint replacement prosthesis included on the list will be the sponsor for the purposes of the new levy. The registry collects information about joint replacement surgeries, such as hip, knee, ankle, shoulder, wrist and spinal disc replacement procedures, and reports on the safety and quality of these procedures and of devices used in the operations. The work of the registry is critical to improving health outcomes for many Australians, as has been outlined by the members who have contributed to this debate. The registry provides improved patient outcomes, and it is estimated that, due to reductions in the level of hip and knee revision procedures while the registry has been operating-a decade or so-the registry has saved the health sector and consumers around $44.6 million. The registry provides data indicating which devices are linked to higher revision rates, which helps orthopaedic surgeons to select better-performing prostheses. Taxpayers have met the operating costs of the registry for over 10 years, which are now around $1.6 million a year. It is appropriate that these costs are now recovered from industry, which derives considerable benefit from the registry. The registry provides invaluable post-market surveillance of joint replacement prostheses and also assists the industry by informing the development of new prostheses. The proposed arrangement will preserve the independence of the registry. There will be no possibility of funding being withdrawn from the registry by medical devices sponsors who are not happy with its findings. The introduction of costrecovery arrangements will also produce $5 million in budget savings over four years. Legislated cost-recovery arrangements will ensure continuing and stable funding for the critical work of the registry and ensure that it can continue to provide data to improve patient outcomes. Sponsors will be levied according to the number of joint replacement prostheses they sponsor, and the levies will only be used to fund the operating costs of the registry. The bill provides that there may be different rates of levy for one or more kinds of joint replacement prostheses, the levy rate may be set at zero, and there will be a maximum levy rate of $5,000 per listing per year. This range of levies is appropriate, as there are a very wide range of products included in the registry, from screws and bolts that are priced at less than $50 each to specialised knee replacement systems, which can have prices of more than $67,000. The government will determine the amount of levies through rules made under the legislation following consultation with the registry and the medical devices industry. Question agreed to.

The government proposes that the House disagree to the amendments to the bill made in the Senate and accept in their place the amendments that I am moving on behalf of the government. Legislation to remove deductions or political donations was introduced into parliament for the second time in August 2008 in the Tax Laws Amendment (Political Contributions and Gifts) Bill 2008. Specifically, the legislation aimed to remove the ability of businesses and individuals to deduct a capped political donation up to $1,500, and remove the ability of businesses to claim political gifts and contributions under the general business expenses deduction provision. The Senate has proposed that businesses not be allowed to deduct political donations but that deductibility for donations by individuals be retained. The government agrees to the intent of the amendments proposed by the Senate; however, the specific form of the legislative amendments proposed by the Senate needs to be changed to avoid the creation of loopholes that would allow deductions by some types of businesses but not others. I note that the new measure will not reduce the tax expenditure as much as the original measure: the original measure saved approximately $10.5 million across the forward estimates while the new measure saves approximately $3.7 million. The government seeks to move amendments to the bill that are in the spirit but not in the form of those proposed by the Senate. Therefore, the government recommends that the House disagree to the Senate's amendments and substitute the amendments that the government is moving in their place. Just to recap, we accept the spirit of the Senate amendments, but they have been incorrectly drafted. We wish to give effect to the Senate amendments but in a way that ensures that all businesses are treated equally. The problem with the Senate's amendments relates to some businessesroughly, in the order of two-thirds of small businesses-being unincorporated, which under the Senate amendments means they would be treated as individuals, whereas incorporated businesses would be treated as businesses, and therefore there would be this unequal treatment of different businesses. That is the purpose of the amendments I have moved. We accept the spirit and intent of the Senate's amendments, but they have not been accurately drafted. So I ask that the coalition support our intent to give effect to the spirit of the Senate amendments but in a more precise and accurate way, through the amendments I have circulated here in the chamber today.  nal aim of the Tax Laws Amendment (Political Contributions and Gifts) Bill 2008 was to remove all tax deductibility for donations to political parties. This was unquestionably an overreaction on the part of the Labor Party. We believe that at the core of the democratic process is the participation of ordinary Australian citizens. They are the ones who make up our electors and they are the ones who are the foundations of our political partiesespecially on our side of the House. There are quite a few academics and commentators who talk about the antidemocratic nature of big donations from business and the unions. Yet I do not know of a single one who believes there should be less participation by ordinary Australians. The original bill would have done just that. By removing the income tax deduction for donations, Labor would have effectively pushed the parties to place a greater emphasis on three categories of donors: businesses, who can claim the donation back in other ways; unions, who do not care about a $1,500 tax break; and high net worth individuals, who do not need a $1,500 tax break. That was Labor's solution. No wonder that even the Greens, who normally support the most extreme positions on electoral reform, simply would not stomach or support the bill in its original form. To this end, the coalition supports the changes that have been proposed in the Senate. If we are serious about improving participation rates in the political process, we cannot put more disincentives and more hurdles in the way. Perhaps Labor realises that it no longer has the support of ordinary Australians in terms of finance and is betting its future on the accumulated wealth of decrepit and dying trade unions. The irony is that fees to trade unions, which invariably come back as donations to the ALP, are fully tax deductible. So Labor, as usual, wants to have its cake and eat it too. It does not surprise that members of the New South Wales Labor Party have come in for this debate, because they watch it very closely. Those in the New South Wales Labor Party always want to have their cake and eat it too, but their day reckoning might well be coming. But I digress. Similarly, people can make donations to quasi political, religious, environmental, welfare and foreign aid groups. All of those are fully tax deductible. But a donation to a political party is certainly not, under Labor's original bill. Our fundamental position is this. The coalition support greater participation by individuals in the political process. To facilitate that, we believe there should be a level of tax deductibility which is neither too high nor too low. A cap of $1,500 is in our view the correct amount. That is about three per cent of the annual earnings for an average Australian worker. In conclusion: let me again express the concern of the coalition that the ALP is tampering with electoral matters before the finalisation of the green paper on electoral reform. While I am normally loath to ascribe bad motives to the Labor Party, it does make one wonder why they feel the need to push ahead with a law which makes it harder for every party other than the ALP-with its union war chest-to raise funds for both the campaigning and the dayto-day operations of political parties. Surely the appropriate time for the consideration of any bill, as the one before us, would be after the government's response to the green paper has been finalised. I note the minister has tabled amendments today from the government, which he says will give effect to the amendments that the Senate passed and insisted upon. There were 17 amendments in the Senate that the coalition and the Greens supported, which therefore became part of the bill. We are debating today whether the House should support the me Senate in insisting on its amendments. The coalition's view is that we should support the amendments from the Senate, and we will not be disagreeing with those amendments. The minister has tabled new amendments of today. The first I saw of those amendments was momentarily before I started speaking in the House. I am very alone, I notice.",32

16,Dr EMERSON,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (9.49 am)-This is the problem. The Senate amendments essentially were to give effect to individuals being able to retain the ability to claim a tax deduction of up to $1,500 for political donations but not businesses. In drafting the Senate amendments, an error was made which means that a very substantial number of businesses would, for these purposes, be treated as individuals, whereas the other businesses would not. The consequence would be that some businesses would be able to claim a tax deduction of up to $1,500, while other businesses would not. This would be arbitrary in its operation. I do not believe that it was the intent of the Greens to arbitrarily apply these tax deductibility provisions in relation to some businesses and not others. That is why we are saying that we agree with the intent of the Senate amendments that individuals be able to claim the tax deduction of up to $1,500 but that businesses not be. However, in the drafting of the Senate amendment an error was made that provides that some businesses be able to retain that tax deduction capacity while other businesses not be. This was not the intent, as we understand it, of the Greens in moving these amendments. I see the shadow minister is here, in the advisers box, and I will appeal to him right across the dispatch box to say, ‘Let's be reasonable about it.' If, indeed, the view of the coalition is that individuals should be able to claim the deduction-and that is what the shadow minister said in his presentation, that they want to retain that-we agree. But if the view of the coalition is that businesses should not be able to claim the tax deduction then they should in fact support our changes, which negate the amendment agreed by the Senate but give effect to the intent of the amendment agreed by the Senate. The purpose of this debate here and my contribution in particular is to clarify whether the coalition in fact are prepared to accommodate the intent of the Senate amendments, which we are prepared to accommodate, or whether this is just a ruse. We want to clarify whether this is just a ruse in order for them to try to knock over this legislation, to knock over a budget savings measure which would prevent the tax deductibility of political donations of up to $1,500 by businesses. The shadow minister who has just spoken, the member for Sturt, has said, ‘Why not wait until a particular inquiry considers its deliberations?' The problem is that the coalition, on matters such as this-that is, the tax deductibility of political donations by businesses-would rather wait forever. They want something that they can pin their argument upon, so that they can say, ‘Let's just wait.' If that is their position they should come forward and say, ‘The truth is that we disagree with the government and the Greens in their intent to deny tax deductibility for all businesses.' If that is their position, at least the Australian public will know that. But to use as a ruse-and I hope they are not doing that-the fact that there is another inquiry and that they do not accept that there is an error in the Senate amendment drafting process, just as a way of sustaining and maintaining the tax deductibility of political donations by businesses, would be disappointing. They should at least have the courage of their convictions and say that that is their position. If it is their position, fine; we all know that. If it is not their position, if they have now realised, as a result of consultations that have occurred, that the Senate amendments have not been accurately drafted, then they will join with the government here and now, when we put these amendments, and say, ‘We accept the amendments to the Senate amendments.' Then we can all retire from this debate happy in the knowledge that we have made some real progress in this area. I formally present the supplementary explanatory memorandum.  very briefly. I will not hold up the House any longer. We will have the vote and be able to move on to the next item of business. The opposition support the 17 Senate amendments that have come down to the House. We voted for them in the Senate. They were put by the Greens to give effect to the opportunity for individuals to make political donations of up to $1,500 and still have tax deductibility for those contributions. We do not believe that government should be run on the basis of a minister providing to his or her opposite number in the House the amendments seconds before they are expected to make a decision on them.",35
17,Mr MELHAM,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"What did you do in government?  Banks, that I was presented with these amendments was moments before I stood up to speak. It is unacceptable for the government to expect the opposition to change our position with absolutely no notice on the basis that, apparently, on this occasion, for the first time in history, they are telling the truth when they say that their amendments actually do reflect what the Senate has insisted upon. From bitter experience, we on this side of the House know that usually will what the government say is quite different from what they do. So I am not going to take as the basic truth that these amendments reflect what the coalition support until they have been properly considered. We will be voting to insist on the Senate's amendments and then the Senate can deal with this matter when it returns there.",36
18,Mr MELHAM,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I find it interesting that the member for Sturt is squealing about the lack of notice in relation to these amendments when it was actually commonplace for his government to bring on substantive bills with a lack of notice. When we were in opposition, the then government used to drop bills-some hundreds of pages of bills-on the opposition with minimum notice. I will quote some examples: you had the Tampa legislation, you had the intervention in the Northern Territory, you had the terrorism bills and you had the ASIO bills. These were substantive pieces of legislation. What we have here is the government saying to the opposition that we agree now with the amendments that the Senate has proposed but there are some technical deficiencies in those amendments. We have redrafted those amendments so that they reflect the will of the Senate. The interesting thing is that Senator Ronaldson, the shadow minister, is in the chamber, in the advisers box. The committee which I chair, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, took a much harder line than the position that is currently proposed by the Senate because we wanted to pare it all back to the previous position in relation to tax deductibility. We wanted to go further than this. But the minority report of the Liberal senators went nowhere near this in relation to holding the line that they are holding at the moment. The only comments they made were about anonymous donations. They suggested that our committee report be amended from what we were recommending, which was a $50 cap on anonymous donations, to $250. Their attitude was: ‘Let's have this bill dealt with so that it includes all other amendments in relation to electoral matters-political donations and the like. Let's do it all together.' So it is a bit rich for them to be claiming foul, that what they have got is late notice of technical amendments. The truth is that they should take the government on trust. They still have until the matter goes back before the Senate to expose whether or not these amendments live up to what we are saying. If the amendments the government have now proposed do not live up to what we are saying, then you have the numbers in the Senate to further insist on your old amendments. That is where you have time to check and test and say, ‘The government have deceived us.' I think what you will find is that the government have not deceived you at all. What the government have done is tidy up what the Senate was proposing. I am not critical of the Senate. The Senate makes a lot of amendments to government bills. Frankly, in terms of resources, occasionally its drafting does need to be further clarified. What I am saying to the opposition is: take us on trust. You have between now and when the Senate considers the matter to then say the others!",36
19,Mr MELHAM,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,That is very kind of you.,37
20,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,The member for Sturt! The member for Banks has the call.,37
21,Mr MELHAM,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"The reason that I put that as an alternative to the opposition is that, if they vote in favour of the government's revised amendments, that is not the end of the matter. It is not as if we have dudded you and it becomes law. It will have to go back to the Senate and Senator Ronaldson, the honourable shadow minister can go through it with a fine toothcomb-as he does. But I say to you: there is nothing wrong with taking us on trust in relation to the nature and quality of these amendments. What stands out at the moment in the government's proposed amendments that looks fishy? Nothing. It is just, ‘We don't trust you because we were given them late.' I say to you: you have the safety net of giving us a belting in the Senate when these amendments return there-and that is the proper way to do it. It is obvious now that both sides have agreed on the defined area of this bill. That is what appears to be coming through. I am sure that Senator Ronaldson can maintain the rage in the Senate if what the government proposes is not what will actually be achieved by the bill. I implore the opposition: for once in your life take us on trust. If we let you down, give us a belting in the Senate.",37
22,Dr EMERSON,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (10.01 am)-This is the flaw in the plot that the opposition is seeking to hatch here. I thank the member for Banks for not only his eloquent exposition of the argument but his advice to the coalition that, if, upon further consideration and passage of these amendments, the coalition forms the view that they do not give effect to the intent of the Senate amendments, the coalition could indeed deal with it in the Senate and it would not be the end of the match. The shadow minister for education, apprenticeships and training has been protesting that he and the coalition only saw the amendments a few minutes ago. I have in front of me two documents: the Tax Laws Amendment (Political Contributions and Gifts) Bill 2008-that is a covering noteand the actual amendments. The date on both of those is 26 May 2009. It is now 18 June 2009. Far from these amendments having been made available for the first time a few minutes ago, as asserted by the member for Sturt, the shadow minister, they have been available since 26 May. The coalition assert that this is the first time they have seen the amendments when they have been available for several weeks. The coalition strategythe true motivation behind this-is now clear to me. It becomes clearer by the day and by the moment through this debate that the true intent of the coalition is to defeat the entire bill. That is the true intent of the coalition. I just ask that they have the courage of their convictions. If the coalition have an ideological position on this bill, which provides that businesses are able to claim a $1,500 tax deduction for political donations, that is their position and they can be judged on that position by the Australian people. We now know it is their position, but they do not want to be judged by the Australian people on that position and have come up with this ruse that the government amendments were made available only a few minutes ago, with all the feigned indignation and outrage of the member for Sturt-‘We only just saw it. We didn't know. If we'd known, we might have voted differently, but we can't.' We see the old hangdog look: ‘We'd love to do the right thing by Australia and by the parliament, but, gee, we just haven't had time to look at it.' Well, 26 May is a fair while ago. These amendments have been available since 26 May and the coalition, and Senator Ronaldson, know that. The House has substituted amendments for the Senate amendments. The House amendments result in a bill that removes the ability of businesses to gain a specific tax deduction for their political gift or contribution to political parties and Independent candidates and members but retains the availability of this deduction for individuals, other than in the course of carrying on a business, up to the current threshold of $1,500. Furthermore, businesses are not able to deduct political donations under the general business expense deduction provision, but the application of this provision to individuals seeking to deduct political donations would remain unchanged. Accordingly, the House of Representatives does not accept the Senate amendments and has substituted other amendments. I make one final suggestion to the coalition: get on board. If you truly believe in the intent of the government's amendments, you will vote with the government and we will all go away at least feeling that we have had a proper debate rather than this ruse with the coalition pretending it only got the amendments a few minutes ago and pretending that it agrees with the intent of the government's amendments but has had no time to look at them. I urge the coalition one last time to support the motion before the House and pass the government amendments. Question put: That the amendments be disagreed to and amendments made in place thereof be agreed to. The House divided. [10.10 am] (The Deputy Speaker-Hon.

NA (PROTECTION OF IDENTIFYING INFORMATION) BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 May, on motion by Mr Haase: That this bill be now read a second time.",39
24,Dr STONE,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Protection of Identifying Information) Bill 2009. The objective of this bill is to better codify current departmental practice in relation to the protection and handling of personal identifiers. These are described in section 5A of the act and include fingerprints or hand prints, measurements of a person's height and weight, a photograph or other image of a person's face and shoulders, an audio or video recording of a person's face, an iris scan, a person's signature or certain other identifiers prescribed by the regulations. They do not include products such as DNA or blood. The Migration Act currently provides for a strict regime for the collection, use, access and disclosure of personal identifiers collected under the act. Section 4A describes the department's obligations in relation to the handling of this information and contains criminal penalties for any breaches. Amendments to the act in 2007 were important. For instance, if the department held a photograph of someone who had made a threat against an Australian high commission or embassy, those amendments allowed the department to provide that photograph to the Australian Federal Police. However, they also had the unintended consequence of the data not being strictly covered by the privacy provisions, as was originally intended. We are that departmental legal advice has said that personal identifiers collected by other domestic or international agencies and unsolicited external sources and from law enforcement agencies were not fully protected by section 4A of the act. These amendments aim to ensure that they are. So we the coalition support them. The bill ensures that the rights and privacy of people whose personal identifiers are provided by international and exterthose nal sources are protected under the act and assures our international partners that the data they provide will be given this protection. It is also extremely important, of course, for individuals whose identifier information is collected. They want to be sure that there is not an extraordinary episode or incident where their photograph is taken to places where knowledge of their whereabouts would endanger them. So it is both for the protection of our own country's knowledge of the person's identity and for the individumunity as themselves that their identifiers are strictly private and used only for appropriate purposes. This bill further codifies the handling of personal identifier information and puts beyond doubt the protection of the information. These amendments in themselves, therefore, are not very remarkable, but the context in which they are to operate remains one of the great challenges for any Australian parliament and for the nation itself. The collection of identifying information, as set out in the Migration Legislation Amendment (Identification and Authentication) Act 2004, was intended to strengthen the capacity of the Australian government and its agencies to ensure, for all passing across our borders, whether as visitors or temporary or permanent residents, that the Australian government could establish their identity and that told there was no concern about the accuracy of the information obtained. Labor must realise the coalition's position in relation to these matters is firmly embedded in our belief that our migration program is a nation-building program, that people who are newly arrived and perhaps susceptible to typecasting or stereotyping should be protected in their identity and not subject to questions about who they are or where they are from and that people can settle quickly and easily into the broader community and, in time, enjoy the full opportunities that our great nation offers to all. These are the values that the ALP supported as well at one time in the early nineties. Minister Gerry Hand, a scion of the Left, was a strong proponent of securing the integrity of Australia's migration programs. The migration integrity measures that have been introduced by the coalition over time or championed by us over the last decade have been about ensuring that no-one in the comcan doubt the integrity of our prockept esses of identifying exactly who is coming into our country; what the purpose of their visit is; and whether or not they are suitable to remain in our country, potentially to become new Australian citizens. Everyone in the community needs confidence in that process. These amendments should help, we hope, to build confidence in the process of identifying individuals and giving them a chance to settle into our country with no long-term unresolved issues or concerns hanging over them about where they have come from and why they are here. We very strongly believe that there should be proper investment in identifying technologies. There is a whole range of new ways, particularly more recently, in which biometrics can be used. It is also important that we have a strong database which is shared between agencies so that we are able to establish if someone has been to our country before and has been required to leave, for whatever reason. We need to be able to establish quickly, when someone arrives, if they are known to international agencies for any activities that we would not welcome in our country. So I urge the government to look at the latest technology in personal identifiers to ensure that we are not left behind in the business of establishing who someone is or whether they have already been dealt with by international agencies or other countries and there are concerns about their character. We recently had the Joint Standing Committee on Migration's report No. 2 tabled. It looked at future options for additional community based detention alternatives. I did not support all of the recommendations as a member of that committee. The recommendations made in this report included that people be given access to the community before the government has fully completed its identification process. That may involve their security status, their identity or, indeed, even their health status. The recommendations of the report were that a person should be fast-tracked as quickly as possible into the community and be placed into a bridging visa framework where they could have work rights and support from Medicare and from Centrelink if required if they could not find work. My concern in opposing those recommendations and writing a minority report was that it is far better for this government to put every effort into completing the process of identifying an asylum seeker, for example, and establishing if that person does in fact have a claim to full and adequate protection in our country, rather than fast-tracking them, half-processed, into the community, where they might languish for quite some time as this government deals with more and more arrivals coming via the people smugglers. My concern and the coalition's concern is for resources to be put upfront into comprehensively and completely identifying an individual coming to our country without documentation, typically to seek asylum, and for that process to be completed as quickly as possible so as to make time in detention the absolute minimum required. That person could then be welcomed into our community as a refugee, or quickly required to exit the country if their claim has been false and they are not in fact a legitimate asylum seeker. That is why the identifier technologies are so important and the legislation dealing with the privacy and confidentiality of that information is so important. That is why we are supporting wholeheartedly this particular set of amendments. I have to say that we in Australia have had some unfortunate episodes in our history of wrong identification. After the Second World War it was found that people had come to this country who were war criminals. They should never have been allowed to remain, or to have come in the first instance, but of course information flow and international cooperation on identification were different in those days. We need to make sure that our country, as far as possible, never gives sanction and protection to a person who should never expect to be welcomed into a freedomloving place like Australia. Recommendation 10 in the Joint Standing Committee on Migration report No. 2-the report I have just referred to-said in relation to bridging visa holders: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government reform the bridging visa framework to grant all adults on bridging visas permission to data. work, conditional on compliance with reporting requirements and attendance at review and court hearings. I repeat: we would much rather see the efforts of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship put into completing identification and establishing a person's right to asylum upfront, not having a halfway house, given that we heard a great deal of evidence about the problems of people without adequate English, without recent work experience and without qualifications that are acceptable in Australia trying to find work in the Australian community with limited support while they await a final outcome on their status being established as asylum seekers. We are concerned that this government has not put the effort that is needed into teaching English to these new arrivals and new settlers; in fact, the budget has been slashed for the Adult Migrant English Program. That is to be deplored. We are also concerned that there has not been appropriate support in the budget for accommodation for new settlers, particularly through the community care program. As a nation we should be fully responsible and caring about people who come to our shores seeking protection and a better life and who, under the UNHCR criteria, more than deserve that protection. These amendments are welcomed by the opposition. We understand that they are important and necessary due to the unintended impacts of amendments that were made three or four years ago. It is of critical concern to individuals who are fearful for their lives and seeking to come to Australia that their personal information be kept strictly confidential. On the other hand, it is essential that overseas agencies have confidence in our system so that they supply all information we request with confidence and wholehearted cooperation, knowing that we have in place proper instruments of protection for that We know that there were over 25,700,000 movements across our borders in the last financial year. That is an enormous number of individuals coming and going across our borders, both by sea and by air. That is to be applauded. Long may we see that movement of visitors, tourists, students, potential future settlers and spouses. We are proud and we should be proud of the fact that we have open borders and we are a welcoming nation. However, our capacity to correctly identify all of those individuals is absolutely necessary. It is a huge task. It requires the latest, best and most effective technology and it requires a department not too stressed in terms of its own staff numbers and financial resources; otherwise it cannot do a proper job. We are concerned that there is now a requirement for a contraction of nearly 800 Department of Immigration and Citizenship staff. There is also, of course, a huge contraction of the department's budget itself. We are concerned that they are too hard pressed to do the job of processing these over 25 million movements which occurred in one financial year-that is the information that DIAC gave us in Senate estimates very recently. The ALP had seven immigration ministers in their years in government and seven shadow ministers for immigration while in opposition. The Labor Party's commitment to long-term engagement with the immigration portfolio is therefore somewhat of a rolling feast. We have to hope that, with the most recent turnover-with a new minister for home security and with the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans, having the enormous task of leading the Senate-the Labor government does start to take the immigration portfolio seriously. It is to do with nation building. It is to do with the security of our nation. It is to do with ensuring a good quality of life for all of those who seek to live in our great nation. We are a nation of immigrants. In my own family two sons-in-law and a daughter-in-law are all immigrants. One is from a refugee background. I am proud of the way they have made extraordinary contributions to this nation as Australians in addition to the fact they have provided me with eight grandchildren. It was a concern when the former ALP president Barry Jones wondered out loud about Labor's mismanagement of the migration program during its years in office before. He said that the focus of the Labor government was to build up a long-term political constituency rather than to be looking at the broader issues of continuing a fair and proper migration program which gave us one of the most multicultural, multiracial and tolerant societies on earth. It is a concern that the Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services has already been found to have been directing grants from the migration portfolio budget to his electorate. The Auditor-General had words to say about that in a recent report. When it comes to government, the coalition took decisive action to rebuild the national security of the country. It took and firm but very fair approaches to make sure that we reinstated our migration program as objective and evenhanded. We also made extraordinary efforts to give temporary safe haven to those from East Timor and to those who were caught up in the Balkan wars. They were experiments, in a sense. These short-term safe haven visas had not been offered before. We learned from that experience. However, we do have great concern, not having been given enough information, over exactly what this government intends with the introduction of what it calls a new complementary visa. We need to know exactly what is in mind. It is not good enough to have in front of the House, with just a few hours or less notice, the reading of a ministerial speech describing what that complementary visa status will mean to a person in Australia achieving that status. I ask that this government take the opposition more serithat ously by informing the opposition of exactly what it does intend if it is going to introduce another category of protection visa. It may be that this is a good move; it may be, though, that it is just another way to clog up the courts, the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Migration Review Tribunal with vexatious claims. No-one needs that. It is of great concern to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship public service that there are over 900 cases outstanding in the courts at the moment to do with migration. It is amazing to see that Minister Evans has intervened in over 1,000 cases since he took office. In other words, he has overturned Refugee Review Tribunal and Migration Review Tribunal decisions in over 1,000 episodes. This is a rate never before seen with any minister for migration in an Australian government. We need to know this: has the minister lost faith in the workings and outcomes of the Migration Review Tribunal decisive and the Refugee Review Tribunal? Of course, these overturns also include court decisions. These 1,000 overturns of decisions would seem-and we are still trying to get the full data as to how many cases were dealt with-to be running at 25 per cent of all the cases brought before the minister. Previous levels of overturns have been in the order of three to five per cent by ministers like Philip Ruddock and between two and three per cent by Robert Ray and other Labor ministers. So this 25 per cent rate of decisions being turned does need very careful explanation and investigation. We in the opposition are attempting to unravel the mystery because there are very significant implications if the minister has lost faith in the working of the two tribunals. It is very important that the minister's of his interventionary powers are transparent and accountable, given that in public statements the minister himself questioned the interventionary powers of the immigration minister-the powers which have gone with the minister since Labor introduced interventionary powers back in the early 1990s. We need to know about that because it goes to the heart of the integrity of our migration system, particularly in our asylum-seeker determinations. Our asylum-seeking processing must be fair and transparent and the minister of the day needs to be accountable. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans, himself said that he wondered whether a minister could be fair in exercising his interventionary powers. So, when we discover this extraordinary rate of tribunal decisions being overturned, we are very curious about what is going on. This brings me back to the bill. This is part of having a migration policy and program which has integrity and the confidence of the nation. We are a nation of migration. All Australians-unless you are an Indigenous Australian-are from a migrant background. We have built the most stunning, tolerant, multicultural and multiracial nation. It had shaky beginnings, because Federation was very much founded on a White Australia policy. It was the Labor Party and trade unions who were most concerned at the turn of the 20th century about coloured labour lowering work conditions and pay. It was Robert Menzies who began the first unravelling of the White Australia policy, which culminated in Prime Minister Harold Holt dismantling over- the White Australia policy in 1966. We are proud of the Liberal Party's legacy of doing away with that racist policy, which was a shameful part of Australian history. I think of my Chinese-Australian son-in-law and that if he had been born in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s or 1950s he could not have use lived in this great country and I could not have had my beautiful Eurasian grandchildren. We are an interesting country which other nations look upon with awe and respect. Our refugee policies and the resources that we put into new settlement are respected and applauded by other nations. Along with the USA and Canada, Australia does the most heavy lifting in permanently resettling those who are most in need of our protection as refugees-as identified by the UNHCRfrom the hellholes of the world. We have 13½ thousand people to come to Australia under our humanitarian refugee program and I applaud Labor in continuing our commitment to putting special effort into settling refugees and humanitarian settlers. My own electorate of Murray is the most multicultural and multiracial of any regional electorate in Australia. We have some of the biggest numbers of refugees, particularly all from the Middle East, in our electorate. We welcome every one of those. We also welcome the first regional settlement pilot undertaken in Australia, where we took the newly arrived Congolese families straight from the airport to Shepparton to settle them into a community which had been preparing for their arrival for six months. That Congolese community is a stunning example of how Australia opens its arms to families, most of them with more than eight or nine children. Two days ago two individuals from that Congolese community attended Parliament House as part of the Fairley Leadership group. This is a community leadership program which selects from applicants those who are most interested and likely to become community leaders. Amongst them were two of our Congolese refugees who are taking community leadership positions in the Goulburn Valley communities. We had one of our refugees from the Congo stand for local government in the most recent Greater Shepparton City Council election. We have another of our Congolese men in the process of becoming a justice of the peace. For years these people had been in war zones in Africa and we can only imagine the difficulties and the suffering that the wars inflicted on them. We are a great nation, but we have to make sure our systems have integrity and are properly resourced. We have to make sure that those in the public sector who administer our various programs have high morale and are committed to the work they do. They should not have to fear that the slashing of resources and contraction in numbers will make it impossible to do the task at hand. I commend this set of amendments. The coalition support the amendments because we do not want to see a single individual suffer as result of their personal information falling into the wrong hands. We also do not want the processing of a person's personal information so that they can be properly identified and their status properly established to take any longer than is necessary, because we are not properly using or protecting identifying information. We support this bill and I commend it to the House.",39
25,Mr DANBY,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to speak on the Migration Amendment (Protection of Identifying Information) Bill 2009. The bill is an important part of the government's streamlining of the Australian migration system. It is designed to create a system that better serves the needs of Australia's society and Australia's economy while treating migrants and those who wish to come to this country with fairness and dignity. In his second reading speech last month my good friend the Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services, the member for Reid, explained the reasons we are introducing this bill. The bill seeks to fix a problem which has arisen with the legislation that was passed by the previous government in 2004. I do not seek to make a political point about that. This is a complex area of policy and it is not always possible to foresee all the consequences of any piece of legislation. To paraphrase the honourable member for Warringah-‘stuff happens'. I do note, however, that when the bill was debated the then shadow minister, the member for Gellibrand, now Minister for Health and Ageing, did raise some concerns about the operation of the scheme that the previous government was setting up. Problems have indeed now arisen with that piece of legislation and this bill is designed to fix them. The purpose of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Identification and Authentication) Act 2004 was to create a new regime a for the collection, use, access and disclosure of personal identifiers collected by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship under the Migration Act 1958. It was a recognition that identity theft and identity crime are an increasing problem for governments all over the world and that this is particularly a problem for governments in the field of migration. Labor supported this objective in opposition and we are consistent in supporting it in government. This government is determined to protect the security of Australia's borders and the integrity of our immigration system. Both as a matter of security and as a matter of immigration policy, it is important that we know that people coming to this country as immigrants, visitors, businesspeople, family members or students are who they say they are. Just as those who steal and fake identities are becoming more sophisticated in their operations, we must be more sophisticated in our response. But it is also important that personal data collected from people entering Australia be kept confidential and that there be no possibility of it being misused. That is, of course, how identity theft works-by misusing someone else's personal data, whether it is their date of birth, their fingerprints, their credit card number or their signature. Australians, unfortunately, are increasingly aware, particularly, of the abuse of credit card theft by other people. I think that is probably the fact that is uppermost in the public consciousness at the moment, but it is a problem in other areas as well, particularly in a serious area like immigration. It is the responsibility of government to prevent that, and we are taking this responsibility seriously. The problem that has arisen is that there is a technical incompatibility between the 2004 act and some other pieces of legislation, which means that it is not as clear as it should be that all personal information collected from people dealing with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship is fully protected regardless of who actually collects the data or whether it is lected inside or outside Australia. In order redress this problem, to ensure that the rights and privacy of such people are protected under the act and to assure our international partners that the data they provide us will be given this protection, it is necessary to make sure that all personal information collected by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for these purposes is covered by the same statutory regime-namely, part 4A of the act. This bill will bring the definition identifying information in the act into line with the original policy intention of 2004 that all personal data obtained by, or on behalf of, the department is protected by part 4A of the act. As the Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services, the member for Reid, pointed out, it is important that this matter be dealt with quickly. There are criminal penalties associated with unauthorised disclosure, modification, impairment or failure to destroy identifying information when required. Any loophole in our law can be exploited by criminal elements who may want to evade or subvert our border protection system. They include identity thieves, people smugglers, potential terrorists, drug runners and those who traffic in illegal sex workers. Any such loopholes must be closed as quickly as possible. And here I want to give some context to these measures. This is not seen by the current government as some hysterical problem that we have to react to as a result of vast numbers of boat people. To hear the opposition talk over the last few months, one would have thought not that 350 people had arrived by boat to be dealt with by Australian immigration authorities but that there had been 350 boats full of people who were unauthorised arrivals. We have measured and considered immigration policy. This government is col- not hysterical, as the previous government to was, about unauthorised arrivals, and the current minister has obviously taken a measured and intelligent way of responding to the few boats that have arrived. I must say that I was surprised by the member for Murray's description of recommendation 10 of the second report on immigration detention from the committee which I chair and by her discussion about whether people should be released into the commuof nity or not. Of course, what she did not mention was the fact that the report had taken evidence that people kept in immigration detention-about whom there was no dispute that ultimately they would be identified and who were no security risk to Australia-had suffered by being kept in detention for many years and months, as had happened under the previous Australian government. That was a balancing factor that the committee took into consideration when making its recommendation. This bill is further evidence that the Labor government is determined to protect Australia's borders and the integrity of our migration system while also safeguarding the rights of all individuals who come in contact with that system. It shows once again the falsity of claims made by some members opposite that Australia's border protection has in some way been softened or weakened under this current government. The member for Murray said that the previous government's policy on immigration was widely considered as objective and even-handed. I must say that that is not a perception in the community that I have picked up over the years. In the context of speaking on these justified measures about identification and making sure that acts of parliament enable the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to deal with this properly, this government has not had a hysterical attitude to boat refugees coming to Australia. It has not been involved in disgraceful events like that of the Tampa, and to describe the migration policy and the refugee policy of the previous government as ‘objective' and ‘even-handed'as the member for Murray, the opposition spokesperson on immigration, did-is certainly in a context that is completely illegitimunities mate in my view and, I think, in the view of the majority of the Australian people on this very important bill. Let us stay measured and balanced. Let us protect the integrity of Australia's migration system and let us welcome refugees when they do come here. Let us judge them properly. Let us release them into the community if there is no problem about their identification. If the information about their identificaAct tion is ultimately going to come and if there is no worry about their security, it is much better for people be under a bridging visa than to be locked up in detention for months and years. If there is no threat to the Australian community-apart from the cost to the Australian community-they may as well be out in the general community earning a living under the bridging visa proposals that were proposed in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. I commend these bills on the integrity of the migration system to the House.",45
26,Mr ROBERT,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Protection of Identifying Information) Bill 2009. There is no doubt that the issue of migration and the wider issues of refugees, illegal immigrants and boat people are a debate this parliament needs to have, what with the recent surge in boat people. Notwithstanding that the push factors have not substantially changed globally, and considering the recent surge, this is a debate the nation needs to have. It is a debate that should be carried out with great compassion but with a firm resolve to represent the best interests of our nation. Let us not forget we are a young nation, just over 200 years old; we are a nation of immigrants. Some reports suggest that over 25 per cent of Australian citizens were born overseas. We are one of the great nations of immigrants. Our diversity is what gives us strength, it is what pulls our comtogether and we need to do everything possible to ensure a strong sense of integration with all people who come to our nation-a strong sense of shared values and of shared commitment to our nation, its direction and its future. And it is in this context that I wish to raise some comments in supporting the migration legislation amendment bill. The objective is to amend the Migration 1958 to ensure that identifying information obtained by the department or provided to the department by other external and domestic agencies is better protected and governed by part 4A of the act. The Migration Act currently provides for a strict regime for the collection, use, access and disclosure of personal identifiers collected under the act. Part 4A describes the department's obligations in relation to the handling of this information and, of course, contains a range of criminal penalties for any breaches. Amendments to the act in 2004 and 2007 unfortunately had the unintended consequence of limiting the provisions as they were originally intended. It would appear the departmental legal advice has said that personal identifiers collected by other agencies may not now be fully protected by part 4A of the act-clearly an unintended consequence. So this bill seeks to ensure that the rights and privacy of people whose personal identifiers are provided by external sources, including international agencies, are protected under the act and to ensure that the data our foreign and domestic partners provide to us will also be provided this protection. Furthermore, the bill codifies the handling of personal identifier information and puts beyond doubt the protection of the information. The amendments are therefore not contentious. However, the context in which these amendments operate is far from simple. The amendments go to the heart of the integrity of our migration, immigration and refugeehandling policy. The collection of information set out in the Migration Legislation Amendment (Identification and Authentication) Act 2004 was designed to ensure that all migrants from any country arriving in this great nation, whether they are coming permanently to settle or temporarily to visit, do not pose any threat to Australia and her interests, that people coming to our great nation come here for the right reasons-that is, they come here to join in and celebrate our democracy; that they come here with the intention of taking on our shared values; and, importantly, that when they arrive, be they temporarily arriving or coming permanently, they are who they say they are. The first rule for any country is to know who is in it, and indeed for those coming here to know who they are as well. Our entire migration and immigration system hangs off this concept of integrity. We are a nation of immigrants, a nation built on the backs of those who have come here seeking a better life. And why wouldn't you? Australia is one of the greatest nations on earth and, as the member for Fadden, I simply say that Fadden, with the glorious beaches of the Gold Coast and the great broad water and hinterland, is one of the greatest places in one of the greatest countries on earth. So why wouldn't people want to come here? And, because our nation is built on the hard work, the sweat, the tears and the blood of those who have come, they are indeed welcome. But the integrity of that system that brings them here is fundamental. Let us not forget that on 25 April 1915, when the ANZACs so heroically charged the beaches of ANZAC Cove, many of them had not been born in Australia. They were migrants, yet they had adopted Australia as their own. They were willing to fight, and so many of them died, for that adopted country. It is why this debate must be held with great resolve but also great compassion. Our migration program has always been a nation-building program-a true one in all senses, not just in words. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship estimates that a person comes or goes from our shores every second. That is a staggering number. The department said in Senate estimates that there were more than 25 million movements in the last financial year-an astonishing number of people coming and going. And our capacity to correctly identify these people and to ensure they have an entitlement to be here is imperative not only to our national security but also to our community harmony. People are free in our country. When people arrive on our shores, holidaying or voluntarily, they are free to roam right across grand continent. There are no police checks. There is no border security. There are no gates and bars. People are free. The only check we have is on our borders, hence the integrity of that checking mechanism is fundamental. We absolutely insist on a strong framework of checks and balances. I join the shadow minister in not supporting some of the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration report No. 2 into future options for additional community based detention alternatives. As she quite rightly pointed out, a number of these recommendations patently fail the integrity test. The recommendations will be seen as further softening of this government's response to people smugglers. Although the push factors globally have not changed significantly, though the government would like to tell us they have, upwards of 20 illegal vessels have come to our shores in the last 18 months. The undoubtable conclusion is a softening of policy. I cannot port a new bridging framework, because it does not deter the abhorrence that is people smugglers. Recommendations Nos 2, 3 and 8 describe the view of the majority of the committee that unlawful noncitizens be diverted out of detention before their security and health identification status check is complete. I say with great compassion that this is completely and utterly unsupportable. It is absolute nonsense to suggest that before we know exactly who someone is, what their background is, what their criminal record is and what threat they may possibly pose to community, we are happy to release them into a free society where they can move around unencumbered. These ex-detainees are to be transferred into the community within a bridging visa framework which entitles them to a basic range of basic income assistance, health care, this temporary accommodation and furnishing requirements under recommendation No. 8. Recommendation No. 10 refers to a proposal that these bridging visa holders will also have a range of full working rights. All this will happen before we know who they are. Are we prepared to say to the employers of our nation: ‘There are a range of people who have just been released from detention on a bridging visa, and we actually don't know their full background but we are happy for you to employ them'? Are we prepared to accept that risk? Is that appropriate due diligence for our nation? Are we taking appropriate care of Australian citizens by allowing this to occur? Are we prepared for the repercussions of a dreadful incident-a heinous crime-occurring because we failed in our responsibility in releasing people into the community before knowing fully their history and their background? The fact is that most detainees do not stay for an extended period of time in secure desuptention. All detention centres are now either upgraded or in the process of being upgraded. The committee I referred to actually took evidence on 1 May that 47 per cent of stays in detention were for less than one month and 72.1 per cent of the stays were for periods of less than three months. Even processing times for the recent massive surge in boat people are being shortened. One of the more substantial issues that should be included in the debate we have to have, is on the 1951 refugee convention and the 1967 protocol. Our immigration program is one of the most generous in the world. Over the last 50 years this great nation has settled, on average, 12,000 people a year through our humanitarian program. Some commentators are saying that we are the most generous nation in our humanitarian program, per capita, on the planet outside of Canada. Whilst I cannot substantiate the numbers, I can stand here confidently and stay that we would at least be in the top five most generous nations. We should be proud of that. Australians should be proud of their generosity in helping those from some of the most dreadful and unfortunate circumstances across the globe. I am one of the international directors of Watoto, one of the largest non-institutional orphan care programs in Uganda and Africa, with over 2,000 children we have picked up from the pit latrines and the garbage tins of the world. I have seen first hand the horror the Third World, and the generosity of our humanitarian program is something we should all rejoice in. It is something we should be incredibly proud of. Yet, within that and within the work I do on a humanitarian basis, I remain firmly of the conviction that we should continue to decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come. The only thing we have is a strong sense of policy, and this has been watered down. Let us look at the signatories from the 1951 convention between us and Afghanistan-between us and half the world away: Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyszstan, Tajikistan Turkmenistan, Yemen and CambodiaMr Laurie Ferguson-What about the other side of Afghanistan?",47
27,Mr ROBERT,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"That is it. Those are all the countries that have signed. Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia and all of the countries in between-countries that are notorious for hopping of illegal immigrants-have not signed. There seems to be little indication within these countries' policy platforms that they will. Considering that so many intermediate countries have not signed the convention, and all indications are they may not, we only have one stand-and that is policy. The Howard government introduced a very strong border protection mechanism and policy framework, which included Operation Resolute with the use of our military and Customs planes. Even then, with the great compassionate nature of this nation, we brought back for processing those found on the high seas. Thus, the only thing we have to rest on is a strong sense of policy. And I see that being watered down at every step. I would encourage the government to move away from looking to selfaggrandisement on the United Nations scene of and instead to look to some tangible results-to look at a new framework for the 1951 convention, to revisit it and encourage other countries to sign up and to look at ways that we can encourage the rest of the world to come on board and accept their humanitarian responsibilities in assisting those in need. Until such time as the 1951 convention and its associated protocol is redefined to include the rest of the world and until such time as the rest of the world is encouraged to accept its responsibilities, all we have is policynothing more, nothing less. Strong policy combined with the strongest possible integrity in our migration and refugee system is needed. I commend the bill, I commend this strength of integrity, I commend the government to accept the need for the strongest possible policy and I ask the government to review its policy positions and to strengthen them, as that is the only weapon we have against the great surge of boat people.",50
28,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"ReidParliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services) (11.08 am)-in reply-I thank members for their contributions to the debate on the Migration Amendment (Protection of Identifying Information) Bill 2009. The bill provides the appropriate framework for handling personal identifiers in the future. The Migration Legislation Amendment (Information and Other Measures) Act 2007 made an amendment to the definition of identifying information in paragraph 336A so that identifying information became any personal identifier provided under sections 40, 46, 166, 170, 175, 188, 192 or 261AA of the act. However, these amendments to the definition in 2007 made these provisions more limited than the original policy intended. Recent legal advice suggests that personal identifiers belonging to the department's clients that are not currently protected by part 4A include those collected from other agencies, domestic or international, unsolicited external sources and law enforcement agencies, often shared with the department as part of an investigation. In relation to these personal identifiers, DIAC has been adhering to part 4A of the Migration Act 1958 and the Privacy Act 1988 where applicable so there is no question of either act being breached. In order to ensure that the rights and privacy of persons whose personal identifiers are provided by international external sources are protected under the act, and to assure our Australian and international partners that the data they provide will be given this protection, this bill will subject all personal identimajor fiers collected by DIAC for immigration purposes to the same statutory regime, that being part 4A of the act. I now turn to some of the contributions by members. The member for Fadden might be quite knowledgeable about how Logan City and Redcliffe went in the Queensland Rugby League results last weekend, but I do not think he has the same level of knowledge about immigration or international events. He made the outrageous comment that there were no push factors in immigration at the moment. He would also probably be telling us that there were no elections in Iran last week and that there was no swing to the Right in the European elections. With such a perfunctory lack of knowledge in this area, he would not be able to comment on any of these matters. Most of the Australian population has picked up that the civil strife in Sri Lanka has come to a bloody conclusion. Most people are aware that for weeks on end there were massive attacks in the north of Sri Lanka on the remaining Tamil Tiger heartlands and that large numbers of civilians were killed in the process. But, according to the member for Fadden, there is no big push, there is no big change in Sri Lanka and there will be no Tamils wanting to come to Australia. It has not happened! Seemingly, the member for Fadden does not think that NATO and other international bodies know anything about Afghanistan. He seems to think that it is all quite calm and peaceful there and that there were no controversies recently about changes made by the Karzai government on women's rights. Apparently, I did not see an interview with an Afghan women's representative on TV this week-it did not happen! According to the member for Fadden, it is very peaceful, there are no measures disturbing anyone in the world and we will pull out next week. It is all over and there are no problems! That is a insult to a delegation of Hazaras I met here the last time we were in parliament. They came to indicate the very serious pressures on their community. Hazaras have historically been persecuted by whatever regime is in power in Afghanistan, whether it is the former royal family, the current administration or the Taleban. The Hazaras have been a minority subject to pressures for quite some time. The delegation I met raised very clear problems confronting their community, and this is before we start talking about all of the other regional and tribal issues that confront Afghanistan. They raised issues such as the increased pressures the Iranian regime has brought to bear on the Shi'ite confreres of the Iranians-the Hazaras and other Shi'ites who have fled to Iran-to make them leave the country. According to the member for Fadden, all the Iraqi Christians can just walk back to Baghdad tomorrow afternoon with no problems. I think the Assyrian community in Western Sydney would be very surprised by the analysis by the member for Fadden that there are no push factors leading to refugees wanting to come to this country. According to the member for Fadden, it is all very nice out there and there are no problems. This is preposterous. It was a major embarrassment to the opposition spokesperson in this area. I do not think she would have the effrontery to go anywhere near the kinds of suggestions that the member for Fadden has made. The UNHCR global trends report showed 42 million forcibly displaced people worldwide at the end of 2008, a figure which included 15.2 million refugees. A staggering 44 per cent of all refugees and asylum seekers were children under the age of 18. I also note a very significant presence of people in our part of the world. Roughly one-third of refugees at the end of 2007 were residing in the Asia Pacific region, with 80 per cent of these being Afghans, yet the number of boat arrivals in Australia remained low by world standards. We have the comfort of being where we are in the world. The member for Fadden talks about the lack of signatories in this region. That is very true. One thing on which I agree with him is the need for international pressure to increase the number of signatories to UN conventions in our region-there is no doubt about that. But, compared to the Europeans, we have the comfort of being very distant when it comes to boat arrivals. You only have to look at the measures that Italy has been forced to undertake in the last few years with Libya to try negotiate some reduction. This has led to xenophobia and racism in northern Europe. Countries such as the Scandinavian nations, which never had these problems before, are swinging towards political conservatism, racism and even neo-Nazism because of the huge pressures. I think we should get these things in a bit of perspective. We should get rid of this rhetoric that there are no problems out there and the boats are just a reflection of some change in government policy. This is preposterous; it is ridiculous. It manipulates the Australian people. It gives them a false sense of confidence that, if there are few hardline laws, then we will not have a problem. We do have a problem, and that is why in the budget this year $1.3 billion has been devoted to strengthening Australia's border protection and national security regime, and $654 million of that is specifically dedicated to a whole-of-government-that is, interdepartmental-strategy to combat peoplesmuggling. Even when we are bringing in laws in regard to detention debts this week, we single out people-smugglers as a group of people to which we will not be showing the same consideration in regard to those detention debts as we will be showing to other people who have been detained. The member for Fadden's contribution was disturbing and ill-informed-he really should stick to Rugby League and Aussie Rules commentary. I want to now turn to some comments made by the shadow minister for immigration. She referred to a National Audit Office report in regard to my handling of settlement grants. I think we should put that kind of comment in the context of the momentary, perfunctory interest in this matter by the opposition in estimates. The senator who handled this matter, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, asked a few perfunctory questions, made a to few snide comments and left it there. It solicited one bit of interest in the media. I want to make the point that my electorate just happens to be an electorate that has heavy migration. It is an electorate where half the population were born overseas. As the member for Fadden noted, the Australian average is about 25 per cent. Half of the people that live with me in Reid were born outside this country, and 75 per cent of those are from non-English-speaking countries. My electorate is either the first or the second in regard to Arabic speakers, Muslim Australians and Chinese Australians. It is heavily characterised by new arrival communities, the suburb of Auburn particularly being characterised by a high Iraqi Shia population. Afghans are spread throughout suburbs such as Harris Park. This might surprise the shadow minister, but there are significant settlement grants in my electorate. I should also advise her that this year the electorate lost three of those long standing grants. that the audit report singled out the department for criticism in regard to paperwork. As I said, the opposition showed its disdain and disinterest in these matters during the estimates process. I note that one of the four grants that were questioned by the national audit report was questioned after the very persuasive intervention of the member for MCMillan, who directed to my attention the secondary movement of Sudanese to the Gippsland region. This is a very dangerous area for the opposition to tread on. Probably the biggest scandal in Australian immigration in regard to visas was the Kisrwani case. I would advise the shadow minister to take a bit more interest in that history. We have the rhetoric that accompanies this of her family's Chinese connections and the Congolese council candidate, and I have seen her make some very impressive speeches. I praise the multiculturalism and the Chinese events in Sydney. However, this rhetoric, these speeches, in home-ground venues where it is good to mouth these kinds of slogans, must be accompanied by the reality of policy. I know that the shadow minister did go to the opposition ministry with a proposal to support the government on detention debt and was rolled. We must give her some credit for waging that fight. But to come in here and try to connect the very necessary changes in regard to detention with apprehension, scaring people and the waves of people that the member for Fadden accompanied her speech with is really disturbing. I want to say again, for the member for Fadden, who seems to be styling himself as some sort of expert in this field, that the second report does nothing about the question of unlawful noncitizens. It does not say that they should be released from detention before health, security and identity checks. This is why we do detain people for a period of I note time-so we can have these checks. We do not detain them as a punishment. We do not detain them for criminal purposes. We detain them to take these checks. I am contacted every day of my week by people in my electorate who are waiting for six months for their spouses to enter this country because of security checks by ASIO. If anything, they are taking too long in regard to this processing. So there is nothing that says we have an open door, that we are not checking peopleof course we are. Where we differ is on the question of whether children should be detained and whether people should be shown compassion or basically be condemned to very long periods of detention for no real public policy purpose-just to assure people with some subliminal message that we are protecting them from terrorism, implying at least some of these people who have come by boat are terrorists. This is, as I say, a false premise. It is aimed at alarming people. It really gives no practical support. It simply creates an illusion. As I said, we have seen today an opposition that is floundering to in some way justify the Howard legacy in this area after having repudiated it to some degree. They basically see some opportunities because we have a very strong push factor in regard to refugee claims throughout the world at the moment. We face very grave difficulties in a lot of regions of the world in regard to refugee claims. Indisputably, people are going to seek protection around the world. To try and tie the number of boats in with changes in government policy in this country is absolutely ridiculous. We have seen also of course that, despite all the rhetoric of the government, somebody sitting around Indonesia for a large number of years with nothing being done to return him to Australia. It is this government that is effectively prosecuting him and driving home against that individual allegations in regards to people-smuggling. I want to again commend this bill to the House. The member for Melbourne Ports, who takes a deep interest in immigration matters, has very adequately covered the provisions of this bill. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

30,Mr ABBOTT,REMOTE INDIGENOUS SERVICES,"If you go to a remote Indigenous township you will invariably find a school, a clinic, a store and a council. Under the aegis of the council, you will invariably find municipal services, employment services and housing services. These are a lot of governmental institutions to operate in what are often quite small communities. In, for argument's sake, a community of say 500 people you will often get 50 to 100 resident officials or professional staff staffing the school, the clinic, the store and the various services run by local councils. While there are well-developed vertical lines of command between, say, the school and the educational authorities in the state capital and between, say, the clinic and the health authorities in the state capital, there are often not well developed lines of horizontal communication and coordination between the various governmental bodies and agencies in these places. Indigenous communities often provide very powerful illustrations of the defects of services in silos. This is a well-known problem with the delivery of governmental services generally, but it is particularly acute in many Indigenous places. Indeed, Indigenous places are often characterised by an abundance of government but an absence of authority generally. If you look at these remote Indigenous communities, you often see in the lifetimes of the older people resident in them transitions from traditional authority to mission authority to virtually no authority. It is a real problem. One reason why so many of these places are hotbeds of social dysfunction is that there is very little effective authority in them. So often we have committed idealistic young officials and professionals going into these communities and returning after six or 12 months defeated and disillusioned, because they feel that nothing really changes. Those who are there for the long term have begun to think that nothing really matters anyway. This problem of disorientation and disillusion in Indigenous communities-especially among the people who deliver services to Indigenous communities-is very serious and needs to be tackled. This bill to provide for a Commonwealth Coordinator-General of services to remote Indigenous communities is the government's attempt to move in this direction, and I want to commend the government for its good intentions. There is the potential here to make a significant difference, because the CoordinatorGeneral will have the power under this legislation to require people such as state and federal officials to provide information and documents, to require people to attend meetings and to request assistance from Commonwealth, state and territory agencies. It is envisaged that the Coordinator-General will have the power to-metaphorically, at least-bang heads together where problems are not being addressed in an attempt to make a difference. As I said, this is a worthy move on the part of the government. The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has said that the establishment of this office is long overdue, and I have to say that I am inclined to agree with her. I should point out, though, that as part of the intervention in the remote townships of the Northern Territory the former government did establish in virtually each of the 73 remote communities affected by the intervention the position of government business manager. The idea behind these government business managers was that they would be people with the authority of the Commonwealth government who would be in a position to try to ensure that all the services and agencies in this town were working together rather than pulling in different directions. if the teachers were not talking to the doctors and nurses, the government business manager would be able to have a quiet but authoritative word in the ear of all of them and try to ensure that common sense prevailed. I have to say that, in my opinion, even better than the establishment of one coordinator-general based in Canberra would be the establishment of a whole series of mini coordinators-general in every single remote Indigenous community. In my opinion, the establishment of a senior Commonwealth officer in residence in each of the remote communities would be an even better step than this. But I do think that this is a step in the right direction. I hope that the coordinator-general, once appointed, turns out to be a person of great natural authority as well as a person who is widely respected by the Australian community and widely experienced in getting things done-in making a difference. I hope that, in looking for people to fill this job, the government might consider former senior military officers, for instance-former senior officers of those institutions and establishments which do not muck around but get on with things and are used to being treated with respect and taken seriously, because that is the kind of officer that we need in this role if it is going to make a difference. The coordinator-general has to be focused on the actual delivery of services on the ground. The coordinator-general has to be focused on trying to ensure that the people on the ground are absolutely committed to their role. That is what is necessary if this job is to start to make a significant difference to what can often be ghastly conditions in our remote Indigenous communities-the Third World in the midst of what is otherwise one of the greatest countries on earth. I do not want this coordinator-general to end up being So, just an addition to the bureaucracy; I would like to think that this coordinator-general is going to spend most of his or her time out in the remote places of our country actually making a difference where it matters. I commend the bill to the House.",54
31,Mr HALE,REMOTE INDIGENOUS SERVICES,"I support the comments of the member for Warringah. The Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services Bill 2009 allows for government investment to be prioritised and coordinated to ensure that each priority location has the infrastructure and services that support and sustain healthy social norms so people can reach their potential and communities can thrive. The position of coordinatora general is being established to address the practical problems associated with designing, sequencing and rolling out myriad programs in remote communities. As the member for Warringah mentioned, this position of coordinator-general is important. However, Indigenous communities have waited a long time. There is a sense of worthlessness and despair in many of these communities. The government joins with the opposition in a bipartisan approach to make sure that we bridge the gap between Indigenous and nonIndigenous Australians. The bill makes provisions for the coordinator-general to arrange with the Secretary of the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs for the services of the APS employees from the department to be made available. If the coordinator-general is not satisfied with the response from the head of the agency, the coordinator-general may report the matter to the minister and also the Prime Minister if necessary. This is an important mechanism because too often we see there is too much slippage in programs and the money is not actually getting to where it is most needed in Indigenous communities. I would like to draw the attention of the House to today's Age. A young guy by the name of Liam Jurrah is pictured on the front page. He is a traditional man-a Walpiri man-from Yuendumu. Anyone who follows AFL football would know what our Indigenous brothers bring to the game. Some 12 per cent of AFL players are Indigenous and the league is working towards getting that to around 20 per cent by approximately 2020. There is also an aim for four per cent of employees of the AFL to be of Indigenous descent in the near future. Liam Jurrah's is an interesting story. He is boy from Yuendumu. I coached Liam Jurrah when I was coach of the Northern Territory Thunder a couple of years ago. I remember taking Liam to Melbourne. He played at Princes Park-or Optus Oval, depending on who was sponsoring the Carlton ground at the time-and I remember how cold it was. Liam Jurrah, the boy from Yuendumu, really struggled with the cold. He found it very difficult. After a game we would do a rehab session where the guys would go down to the beach at St Kilda. It is quite an interesting spectacle. You see all these guys up to their waists in the sea. The coach and all the coaching staff even went in-I made it compulsory for everyone to go into the sea. From memory, the water was about eight degrees. Liam Jurrah stood there and looked at me as if to say, ‘Coach, please, don't make me do this.' I thought at the time that by making Liam Jurrah do that we would lose him from the program, but he hung in there. Last year, the Collingwood Football Club gave Liam an opportunity to play reserve grade, but he had to go back to Yuendumu for his tribal business. He is a ‘ceremony man', as they say, and already one of the elders in the community-he is a leader. Liam Jurrah played for Collingwood and went back to Yuendumu, and this year the Melbourne Football Club drafted him in the rookie draft and promoted him to their list. On Friday night, Liam Jurrah plays his first game for the Melbourne Football Club. It is a fantastic story. I would just like to say that the AFL probably does it better than anyone when it comes to working in Indigenous communities and giving hope to a lot of young Indigenous footballers. Liam Jurrah will run out onto the MCG on Friday night to realise his dream of playing AFL football. The game is against the mighty Essendon, I must addthe side I support. Essendon has a long association with Indigenous Australia. We remember the association that Kevin Sheedy had with Michael Long. I see that the Minister for Families, ing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs is in the House. I would like to acknowledge her. Last year I had the pleasure of walking with her on the Long Walk with Michael, from Federation Square in Melbourne to the MCG to celebrate Indigenous Australia and what they have contributed to AFL football. What the AFL does in Aboriginal communities is certainly something that government can support and work closely with. I would be very proud. I hope that Essendon beats Melbourne, I must admit, on Friday night. I also hope that Liam Jurrah plays well but he will certainly be a hero in Yuendumu. One of the comments was: In Yuendumu, this is bigger than going to the moon … somebody's already been to the moon. No-one from Yuendumu has ever played AFL football. Good luck to Liam Jurrah. The challenges are enormous. I have a part-Aboriginal wife and five kids; I have been to Ti Tree and I grew up in places like Katherine; I lived in Maningrida as a fouryear-old. A lot of Aboriginal people in communities have got to a point where they have said: ‘Nothing will ever change. There's no hope for us.' I welcomed the comments from the member for Warringah because this is bipartisan. Aboriginal people do not need to be a political football. As a nation we certainly need to really address the crisis that has occurred in communities for a number of years. It started, I suppose, on 13 February last year with the apology. This was a significant moment. People who do not think it was significant are wrong. There are a lot of people within my community from the stolen generation. My mother-in-law was one of those people who were taken away from Tea Tree when she was seven years old, never to see her mother again. She grew up on Melville HousIsland. There was always a worry about compensation. Sure, there are avenues for people to get compensation, but certainly my mother-in-law was just happy with the fact that it had been acknowledged that things were not done properly back in those times. The apology from the Prime Minister on 13 February was certainly well received in my area. The Coordinator-General will provide information to agencies on obstacles within their areas of responsibility and advise the minister and COAG on the need for systematic change. If the Coordinator-General fails to receive an adequate response from the agency official, this bill allows for the matter to be reported to the head of the relevant Commonwealth, state and territory agencies. The then Minister for Employment Participation, Brendan O'Connor, came to Darwin and we toured one of my Aboriginal communities in Bagot. We drove around and the minister was quiet. I think he was taken aback with what he saw and how some of these people were living. We had a meeting with the local council. The minister said to me, ‘Should I go around and meet people and say hello?' I said: ‘Look, with all due respect, Minister, you don't have to do that. These people have met all politicians.' They have met former politicians from the other side, in Mal Brough and David Tollner; they have met Damian Hale and Matty Bonson, the local member. They will show a lot of respect. They will stand up, shake hands and say, ‘How are you going?' and it will be just another white politician who has come to visit. They will go back and sit under the tree and nothing actually changes. To the credit of the minister, who is in House today, I had a conversation with her last year and she said, ‘Where do we start?' We started on housing as an issue. Overcrowding probably leads to a lot of the dysfunction in Indigenous communities, as well as a lot of the health issues, the truancy from school and the inability to go to work. The housing program has been rolled out-some $800 million of housing for the Northern Territory. It is a vital component and starting point. The minister has been very proactive in listening, talking and consulting with communities. It has certainly been appreciated. But the time has come for us as a nation to actually get the results that we need in these communities. We have talked about it and we have been here for 240-odd years, and for a lot of that time Indigenous Australian communities have gone backwards. The time for results is now. We cannot continue to muck around, take our time, have inquiries and write reports. It is about making time now for action in Indigenous communities. I applaud this bill. The CoordinatorGeneral will be the person who can make action happen on the ground where people need it, so that the four-year-old kid does end up with sickness caused by bad living conditions. Gingivitis in your mouth has a direct association with heart disease. Gingivitis in a four-year-old's mouth can cause heart disease when they are 45. Already a lot of Indigenous friends of mine have died between the ages of 35 and 40-young men who have died from heart disease at a very young age. It is a challenge. I notice the member for O'Connor is here. Certainly over his time he has been involved heavily in Indigenous Australia in Western Australia. I acknowledge his commitment to this cause. It is something that goes above politics. It is not about politics at all. This is about our First Australians. Let's remember: they are the First Australians; they were here the before anyone else. They are the longestliving, structured culture in the world. For so long we have looked at them as a problem. We should not look at it like that. We should be embracing Indigenous Australians because they are unique. They bring a unique set of skills; they bring something unique to our country. It was interesting to hear what the Prime Minister had to say in a conversation I had with him and that he had with us at caucus. After the apology, he went around the world talking to other world leaders. He met with the President of the United States of the time. They begged to differ on a few issues-on to get Iraq and withdrawing troops and climate change and that sort of stuff. But predominantly what leaders around the world wanted to talk to the Prime Minister about was what it was like to apologise to Indigenous Australians. That is the impact that it has had. Now is the time when we need to really start to look at what we can do for Indigenous Australians, in particular those in remote communities. How can we make those communities function better? How can we rid them of the alcohol problems, the drug not abuse and the petrol sniffing? We continue to build houses. We get them into functional communities. How do we give them economic development through working not only with government agencies but also with private enterprise-to allow it to come into communities-to make sure that we do close the gap? Closing the gap in Indigenous life expectancy has been the focus of the Rudd government from day 1. That has not changed. The coordinator-general will now provide us with a vehicle for somebody to really ask the hard questions and to say: ‘Well, all right, we have put this money into this community. Fine. What effect is it having on the ground? What is it going to do? How is it improving things?' These things are measurable. How many kids are getting to school? We need to work with parents in order to make sure their kids go to school. We take it as it given that kids will go to school. But, in some of these communities, mums are very protective of their children-they are very close to their children-and some of them do not like their children going away for six hours during the day. Some people do not understand the benefits of that. They want their kids near them. That is their culture. That is the way they are. They are very clingy to their kids. My wife is no exception to that. She is very close to our five kids. You can go to the football and just buy one seat for her to sit on because they all sort of sit top of her-and they are getting to be 16, 17 and 18 years old. But they are still very clingy to their mother. Ms Macklin-I hope they are not all as big as you.",56
32,Mr HALE,REMOTE INDIGENOUS SERVICES,"It would be a lot cheaper to just buy the one seat, Jenny, instead of the six that I usually have to pay for! We need to continue to work with Indigenous Australians because they are a gift to us. The gift that they do bring-and I go back to Liam Jurrah, and I see his picture on the front page of the Age-comes not only through football but certainly through the arts and drama. David Gulpilil was from a place called Ramingining. My father taught at Maningrida and he taught David Gulpilil. David has had to walk both sides of the street his entire life. I had the pleasure of catching up with him in the mall a couple of weeks ago in Darwin. He tried to sell me a painting, I must admit, which I did not purchase, but he was very friendly. David has done it for so long. We take it for granted that he should be able to do it. But, when you think about it, he is a full-blood Aboriginal man who has grown up and lived in Ramingining all his life and he has not only been able to be with his people and his culture but also been able to walk the walk in New York and places like that overseas, where he has been a superstar of the screen in movies like Storm Boy. He cut his teeth on Storm Boy, then he went on to Crocodile Dundee and he played a starring role in Australia recently. David is a great example of somebody that has had to really struggle. He has had his own personal struggles, but certainly he is an iconic actor. When you meet him he still has the big smile and the sparkle in his eye. He is certainly an individual that all Australians should be very proud of. Hopefully, if the coordinator-general can on do this, we can get some real goals kicked for Indigenous communities. The time has come; we cannot talk any longer. Time is running out for a lot of these people. As I just said about the time the minister came to bag it with me in my community, the trouble isand the community said this-that a lot of them have given up. They have just decided: ‘Well, my lot in life is that I am not going to have a job. I am not going to have a house. I am just going to sit under this tree and die when I am 50 because that is my lot.' That is a tragedy. We need to address that. As I said, I welcome the comments from the member for Warringah and I do believe that he has a genuine concern about Indigenous communities. I think, as I said, this has got to be a bipartisan approach. It cannot be a political approach. It has got to be a bipartisan approach. Do what is best for Indigenous Australia. When the coordinator-general is appointed, I wish that person the best of luck to work closely with government to make sure that we deliver services on the ground. We do not need layers and layers of bureaucracy. We need to have a coordinated effort in which money that is committed by government actually hits the ground so that we start to make some real changes for these people that live in these remote communities-not only remote communities, but also in places such as in my area of Solomon in Darwin and Palmerston, where I have five Indigenous communities. They are suffering like the Yuendumus and the Lajamanus and the Ti Trees and the Santa Teresas and those communities, like Mutitjulu, that are more in the spotlight. There is a crisis there, and I commend the minister on her efforts so far in 18 months. Certainly it is not an easy job. to work closely with her for my communities. I think that, whenever this position is filled, it needs the support of everyone in place so that when we walk of this place one day-when we are voted out or we retirewe can look back on our time here and say: ‘Well, did I make a difference? Did I get into politics for the right reasons?' I believe that the 150 members in this place are all here for the right reasons and are all passionate about their areas and are all passionate about Australia. But being in politics is about trying to make a difference. This parliament can make a difference in the next 18 months, as can whoever wins the next election after that. This is our time right now to make a difference to Indigenous Australians. We cannot wait any longer. To Liam Jurrah, my friend: I wish you luck. I hope the Bombers win, but I hope he gets a kick. I commend the bill to the House.",59
33,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,REMOTE INDIGENOUS SERVICES,It is good to see the member for Solomon has maintained his enthusiasm for Aussie Rules football from his days in Temora in New South Wales.,60
34,Mr TUCKEY,REMOTE INDIGENOUS SERVICES,"I congratulate the member for Solomon on his genuine interest in the constituents he represents and in the broader Indigenous population. Let me say of the AFL that I am not exactly sure that there is a degree of altruism in their giving opportunities to Aboriginal footballers; it so happens they are very good at the game. Let me also make a comment in passing, and a reference to the shadow parliamentary secretary for energy, who is at the table, about the efforts of Gerard Neesham in the early stages-and Mr Randall, the member for Canning, also prosecuted this-in gaining Commonwealth grants for the program: ‘If you go to school, you can play in I will continue the footy team.' I have some serious things I want to say, but I might just add while I am on these ‘anthis ecdotal facts' that when I went to Carnarvon in 1958 we had three football teams and the East Carnarvon team was 90 per cent Aboriginal. It may seem a funny thing to the member for Solomon, who has been a football coach, that in those days we played to position-and your coach gave you a nice old bollocking if you were in the back pocket and were seen running up the ground to try to kick at goal. I used to make the odd contribution-I was very ineffectively as a footballer, I might add. But, as the president of the Warriors football club, if we were short I had to play. But we always used to laugh at East Carnarvon because they used to run up and down the ground following the ball wherever it went, and we would say, ‘That's not football!' Of course, today that is the way the game is played. I want to make another point there, and that is that in all sectors of society we should always give people the opportunity to be good at what they are good at. You just cannot turn people into things they may not be, but our Indigenous people will excel in many areas of sport, as Cathy Freeman and others have demonstrated, and there should be a strong effort to ensure that they get the opportunity to achieve that potential. I could not go through a whole speech without a little bit of political irony. I note that the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs said in her second reading speech on this Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services Bill 2009 that: … this bill will give the coordinator-general the powers: to require people to provide information documents; to require people to attend meetings; and to request assistance from Commonwealth, state and territory agencies. Those first two items sound a bit like another piece of legislation that is being hotly contested at the moment when it is applied, of course, to trade unions. As I said, I just could not avoid the irony of that circumstance, and I understand and hope there is a difference. I want to take this opportunity in speaking on this legislation to make a point that the member for Solomon actually put into words: getting the money on the ground. This is the challenge for the coordinator: is this another layer of bureaucracy that consumes money that would be better on the ground? And that question arises in many respects. For example, I have been a longtime critic of the type of house that we build for Aboriginal people. We seem to think we do them a favour by giving them a European design because we want to give them equality with us. I know a lot of the $800 million mentioned has gone to transportable homes; furthermore, they in themselves, by the nature of their fabrication, are not suitable. I have proposed to our shadow minister that, instead of him having another Pollie Pedal, we have a pollie house-building exercise, because there are methods of construction which can be easily taught to people in remote communities, using a lot of remote area equipment, that would provide very adequate housing of a robust nature and of a design, to my mind, that better accommodates the housing desires of people in remote communities, but I will go no further into that. In the time available to me I want to touch on some issues from our history. I took my wife as a very young person to the town of Carnarvon in 1958. That was nine years before a constitutional amendment gave any and/or power whatsoever to the Australian parliament, in fact the parliament was forbidden, to pass laws relevant to Aboriginal people. It was forbidden to spend any money in that area. The peculiarity was that the Aboriginal people I knew at that stage were hugely self reliant, partially, I guess, through neglect. They did not have a nanny state of any nature. They had some supervision by state agencies. They even had to apply for citizenship, which I always thought was pretty outrageous. But what did these people do? They all had jobs. They were very, very competent workers. And they did have houses, they paid rent for them and they got them, in competition with white people and others, as residents of the community. When the Western Australian Main Roads Department constructed the North-West Coastal Highway from just north of Geraldton all the way to Onslow, the third in charge was an Aboriginal man and good friend of mine. I ended up having a business hiring out graders and I was very happy to get some of those Aboriginal people to drive my graders and other forms of earth-moving equipment. And, yes, out there on the pastoral properties were communities. They lived on the pastoral property as a community and as a labour pool, but they had employment. Then along came a Liberal governmentso I am not applying this criticism on a party basis-and, with the best goodwill in the world, got a constitutional amendment that was supported by something like 97 per cent of the electorate, and my vote was yes also, to give the Australian parliament a responsibility and the capacity to assist these people. I believe that, one after another, we have failed. This legislation is probably another recognition of that fact, that we are uncoordinated et cetera, but it is another process top-down funding. I have a paper-and the member for Solomon might want to read it some timethat was presented to John Howard after he closed down ATSIC that was signed by every member of the coalition who had a significant Indigenous population within their electorate. We referred in that paper to bottom-up funding. It is interesting if not just for the simple arithmetic alone. If the total expenditure of this parliament were $3 billion on Aboriginal matters, although I think it would be closer to $4 billion these days, and you shared that equally on the basis of the 300 identified language areas, the grant to each of those bodies in average terms-of course the amounts would be much greater for some and much less for others-would be $10 million per language area, and you could then divide that up as you like. The fundamental issue of our proposal was to do as is done with local government whereby the financial assistance grants are not distributed by this parliament, so it is not about going to your friendly local member of parliament to get you a bit more. This parliament puts a oneline item in the budget and the federal Grants Commission, on this occasion, distributes that on a needs basis to the states and then in this case it goes through-and it would be unnecessary in terms of this parliamentwhat the states have. A state local government grants commission-and I was one of the original persons on that-distributes all of the money on a needs basis. Our proposal went further, and I am pretty sure the member for Solomon will not disagree with me on the management responsibilities that we give to Aboriginal people. All those Main Roads workers in those days used to get paid by cheque and my hotel was the bank. On Thursdays we had to have a very large amount of cash for when these people brought their cheques in and got them of cashed. We also had to have a large amount of small-denomination notes, because these hard working people, managing their own affairs without any government assistance, knew that when they got out the door there would be a few hard-up rellies wanting them to give them money. They had an obligation to give it and they managed that by having small-denomination notes. That is not a criticism; that is a fact of life. When asking these people to manage taxpayers' money, we must always ensure they are protected from a cultural fact of life. So we said, having decided that all moneys would be distributed by the federal Grants Commission on a needs basis according to whatever was an appropriate formula, that it would be managed at the grassroots level by an Aboriginal board of trust. We used those words advisedly because there were to be trustees and we suggested that they be, in most cases, the local government authority which already had a high level of prudential legislation applicable to its management. We then looked at the opportunity of how you would spend that money. It was our view that that body would be buying services from all echelons, including the state and federal governments, as they needed them. If it were the view of a community that an additional police officer was a need or that upgrading a police station was a need, they could fund it from that money. More particularly, if they thought they needed some public health nurses, they could hire them from state authorities or from, in our state, the charitable agency called Silverchain. Furthermore, we said they should have the power to say to those service providers, ‘We want you to create a couple of training positions which we will also fund.' So there would be a process over time of training in all sorts of skills being achieved. Of course they would have a right to buy housing and of course they would have a right to do many other things. The decision would be theirs with appropriate assistance in doing so. They would not be paid large salaries. They would be paid a meeting fee and whatever costs were associated with a meeting to decide how the money should be spent. I am prepared to bet that you would get a lot better outcomes from that. But above all, member for Solomon, just think of the money that these people spend from time to time to get a grant. They actually have to go and get consultants to get their money, which we have provided in the budgets in this place. I am saying that with those communities, however they were structured-and we used the language areas but it was evidenced that those boundaries could have been adjusted somewhat to be more sensible-the whole idea was to give people some power over the way that money was spent and I think then you would not need a coordinator. By the way, as far as I was concerned, an Aboriginal legal service would survive on how many customers they got from those groups, as would land council services and others. In other words, if you thought locally known solicitors would provide better representation for your group in whatever areanot as occurred in the Kimberley recently where they killed off a negotiation without even saying what the final offer was-then you would have the opportunity to buy services from those people. Think of the money: if we are dividing $4 billion by 300 community areas, it is a lot more than $10 million per group on average. I put that forward as I consider this process brought into this House, with all the goodwill in the world, as an admission of failure to date-a failure as much administered by our side of the House as by the other. Let me say that when we took that proposal I have outlined to Mr Howard he would not have a bar of it, which shows the problem of having prime ministers coming from Sydney: they do not understand and, unfortunately, they still believe that this is the dominant parliament to assist these people. The money-to quote the member for Solomon-needs to get on the ground. After having taken his salary and the salaries of his staff out of this budget amount, which we allocate in various lumps and in a variety of ways, maybe the coordinator will achieve that on this occasion. With the best of goodwill, I doubt it. The problem is top-down funding and this is another process of topdown funding. The member for Solomon is a person who might want to get a copy of this and have a look at it. You can have variations of the scheme, but my fundamental view is that there is no solution other than to give people the first decision about how they should spend their money. You want to create scholarships and send some of the young kids to better schools or you want to hire a truancy officer? All of those things should be their responsibility and their first choice. I think those people exist in those communities and the advice they might get from the local shire clerk, as part of that system, would be beneficial. I do not go back to Carnarvon very often nowadays, but after I left someone up there decided they wanted an interpretative centre. From my recollection, that community had grown a long way away from Aboriginal culture. There was quite a significant infusion of Asian bloodlines that had occurred over the century. But they were going to have an interpretative centre. They spent $4 million on it while there were still inadequacies in housing and education. It has never opened because, after building it, they could not decide who was going to run it. We know why-it goes down to family issues. I think that has got to be better understood. I do not oppose this legislation. The shadow minister gave it a glowing reference. I understand that the government has done this in the hope that it can make things better. But, until this parliament decides in a bipartisan fashion that the whole funding structure is wrong and that the involvement of federal parliament has brought no good to the Aboriginal people, I think we will go on passing similar laws, introducing more public servants and bleeding more of the funds away from the grassroots and it will not succeed. I do not want to predict that on this occasion but I think that it is time that we revisited whole program and took that local government example as a basis for distributing the money to the people who need it most and allow them to decide how it should be expended, from community to community. The people of Redfern are going to have a different view on that than the people of Yuendumu. In closing, substance abuse and all these things are first driven by idleness-although I do not want to make idleness a dirty word. Regarding children, my attitude always was that, if they were not so tired by 6 o'clock that they needed to go to bed, there was a chance that they would want to go out and get into trouble. The original lifestyle of the Aboriginal people was such that they spent all day hunting and gathering. They were a very fit people and very much involved. We come along and replace the kangaroo with the government store. Of course, they have extra time, and it is a great tragedy that in many cases they have consequently resorted to substance abuse. We have got to create environments where the people have got something to do. I agree with the member for Solomon that we should give them more sporting opportunities and things of that nature-in which they are very capable-or else we are just leaving them to missed opportunities.",60
35,Ms MACKLIN,REMOTE INDIGENOUS SERVICES,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (12.12 pm)-in reply-I thank the various members from both sides of the parliament for their contributions and their support for the Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services Bill 2009. This important bill creates the position of the Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services to drive the implementation of the Council of Australian Governments reforms across a wide range of areas, including service delivery, employment and housing. Rethe sources will be initially concentrated in priority locations across the country and we will seek to deliver to those communities facilities and services that are comparable with those in non-Indigenous communities of a similar size, location and need in other parts of Australia. I think that will be a very significant step forward. New locations can be added to the purview of the coordinator-general by the minister specifying the remote community by a notice published in the Gazette. A remote community in a state or territory can only be specified after that state or territory has been consulted. Government investment will be prioritised and coordinated to ensure each priority location has infrastructure and services that support and sustain healthy social norms so that people can reach their potential and communities can thrive. It is intended that the approach will be extended to other remote locations. Reporting directly to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the coordinator-general will work closely with governments to make sure that we have real improvements for Indigenous Australians against the Council of Australian Governments Closing the Gap targets. The position of coordinator-general has been established to address the practical problems-and I really want to emphasise that. It is about addressing the practical lems associated with designing, sequencing and rolling out myriad programs in remote communities. The coordinator-general will make sure that the delivery of all government programs in the specified remote communities is coordinated between governments instead of being planned and delivered in isolation. It is our aim to remove bureaucratic blockages and ensure commitments by government agencies are delivered on time by monitoring requirements under the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Service Delivery and other COAG reforms. The coordinator-general will be assessing progress and advising governments where there are gaps or slow progress or where improvements need to be made. The coordinatorgeneral will oversee planning and strategic investment in communities and provide agencies with guidance on good practice. I will certainly expect, as the minister, to receive regular reports on progress and the coordinator-general will make sure that all government agencies are held to account for their implementation responsibilities. The coordinator-general will also meet regularly with national, state and territory officials, who will be identified as coordinators within relevant government agencies. There will be provision of information by the coordinator-general to agencies on obstacles within the areas of responsibility of those agencies and he or she will have to provide advice both to the minister and to the Council of Australian Governments on the need for systemic changes. When there is an issue requiring urgent remedy, this legislation will give the coordinator-general the powers to require people to provide information or documents. The coordinator-general will be able to require people to attend meetings and to request assisprobtance from Commonwealth, state and territory agencies. In the case of state or territory governments, the coordinator-general will make his or her request to the state or territory coordinator-general in the first instance. If that request fails, the coordinator-general may make his or her request of the head of the relevant state or territory service agency. If the coordinator-general fails to receive an adequate response from an agency official, this bill allows for the matter to be reported to the head of the relevant agency. If the coordinator-general is not satisfied with the response from the head of the agency, the coordinator-general may report the matter to the minister and also to the Prime Minister, if necessary. I think this emphasises the critical importance we place on this task. The coordinator-general will report to the minister twice each year, or as otherwise required, on the development and delivery of remote services since the last report and on the progress that has been made in achieving the Close the Gap targets within the specified remote locations. The bill outlines the administrative provisions about the appointment of the coordinator-general including their appointment, acting arrangements, staff, remuneration and leave, and resignation or termination of appointment. The establishment of this office, supported by all Australian governments through the Council of Australian Governments to ensure government commitments in remote Indigenous communities are met, is long overdue. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",64
36,Ms MACKLIN,REMOTE INDIGENOUS SERVICES,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (12.19 pm)-by leave-I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill and move government amendments (1) to (5) as circulated together: (1) Clause 4, page 3 (after line 15), after the definition of Indigenous, insert: Indigenous Affairs Minister, of a State or Territory, means the Minister of the State or Territory who is responsible for the administration of matters relating to Indigenous affairs. (2) Clause 4, page 4 (after line 1), after the definition of specified remote community, insert: State or Territory Coordinator-General has the meaning given by subsection 9A(3). (3) Clause 5, page 4 (after line 8), after subclause (2), insert: (2A) Before the Minister specifies the remote location under subsection (2), the Minister must consult with the Indigenous Affairs Minister of the State or Territory about the proposal to specify the remote location. (4) Page 7 (after line 4), at the end of Division 2 of Part 2, add: 9A Requests to be made through State and Territory Coordinators-General (1) The Coordinator-General may make a request (the original request) under this Act to a member of the staff of a service agency of a State or Territory only by: (a) requesting the relevant State or Territory Coordinator-General to give the original request to that member of the staff of the service agency; and (b) the State or Territory Coordinator-General giving the original request to the member. Note: If a State or Territory Coordinator-General fails to comply with a request under paragraph (1)(a), the Coordinator-General may report the failure: see section 16. (2) However, if the Coordinator-General is not satisfied that the State or Territory Coordinator-General has complied with the request made under paragraph (1)(a), the Coordinator-General may make the original request by: (a) requesting the head of the service agency to give the original request to that member of the staff of the service agency; and (b) the head of the service agency giving the original request to the member. Note: If the head of a service agency fails to comply with a request under paragraph (2)(a), the Coordinator-General may report the failure: see section 16. (3) The relevant State or Territory Coordinator-General is the person (if any) nominated by the Indigenous Affairs Minister of the State or Territory. (5) Clause 16, page 11 (after line 30), after paragraph (1)(b), insert: (ba) a State or Territory Coordinator-General fails to comply with a request made by the Coordinator-General under paragraph 9A(1)(a); or (bb) the head of a service agency fails to comply with a request made by the Coordinator-General under paragraph 9A(2)(a); or I will just make a few brief remarks about these amendments, and I appreciate the opposition's support for the way we are proceeding. The amendments that I am moving are in response to a few concerns raised by state governments and, in particular, to those raised by the Western Australian government, and we appreciate their active interest in this whole approach. Clause 5 of the bill is amended to provide consultation with a state or territory government before the minister specifies a remote location as one for which the coordinatorgeneral will have oversight. It is the case that the Council of Australian Governments Remote Service Delivery Strategy provides for ongoing consultation between jurisdictions. This amendment provides for specific consultation. The provision will be necessary as over time the intention certainly is for the Remote Service Delivery Strategy to move beyond the initial priority locations that I announced in Perth a few months ago to a new tranche of priority communities. There is also a new clause, 9A, inserted to provide that the coordinator-general, when making requests to staff of a service agency, may do so only by requesting that the relevant state or territory coordinator-general give the original request to those staff. The amendment also provides that, where such a request is not passed on by the state or territory coordinator-general, the Commonwealth coordinator-general could give the request to the head of the state or territory agency. This clause will ensure that there is a clear and formal line of communication specified in the legislation. The other amendments are technical and consequential and I will not make any further remarks about those. These amendments are small but important and designed to improve the workability of the legislation to make sure that the rights and responsibilities of state and territory governments are not affected. They are consistent with the broad thrust of the bill and certainly do not change its intent. Rather, they clarify a number of potentially ambiguous points and reflect our commitment to work very closely with the states and territories in the rollout of our Remote Service Delivery Strategy. I recommend the amendments to the House.",66
37,Mr ABBOTT,REMOTE INDIGENOUS SERVICES,"Warringah) (12.22 pm)The opposition will support the amendments, but this is the trouble with the states, is it not? The states can be difficult to work with. All of us think that it would be marvellous to have more cooperation with the states. All of us wish for more cooperation with the states. But the states, as we know, are very good at pledging cooperation and then just going on and doing exactly what suits them. I foresee much prickliness on the part of state governments when the coordinator-general wants to give polite requests to state government agencies and state government officials. I think that the amendments which the government is understandably making here at the request of one of the state governments are, alas, a foretaste of things to come. In conclusion, the only reason why the Commonwealth government has been able to put the intervention in place is that it is the sovereign level of government in the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory is a subordinate legislature to the Commonwealth. This is not the case in the states, which is why, as much as the former government would have liked to extend the intervention to the remote communities of Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland, we could not. We could only do it in the Territory because in the Territory we call the shots; in the Territory, the Commonwealth is ultimately in charge. We plainly are not, as things stand, in charge in many areas in the states, and this very worthy legislative innovation, the coordinator-general, is going to find it quite difficult, I suspect, to get action out of state agencies. But, still, it is good legislation; there is much promise in what the government has in mind. Because I do not want to make life needlessly difficult, we are happy to support the amendment. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading",67
38,Ms MACKLIN,REMOTE INDIGENOUS SERVICES,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (12.25 pm)-by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time.

NA BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 May, on motion by Mr Burke: That this bill be now read a second time.",68
39,Mr JOHN COBB,RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT,"Calare) (12.26 pm)The bill before the House that we are now debating amends section 7 of the Rural Adjustment Act 1992 to allow for the appointment of members to the National Rural Advisory Council, which is termed NRAC, for three terms. The proposed amendment will remove the current provision that a person might be reappointed as a member on one real occasion only. The Rural Adjustment Act 1992 specifies that NRAC's main role is to provide advice on rural adjustment and regional issues, including whether areas should be assessed as being in drought exceptional circumstances. This bill will ensure that current or previous members who have served two terms will, in the future, be able to serve an additional term. The work of NRAC is difficult; it is harrowing. The decision on whether or not to extend drought EC can be the difference between survival and ruin for a lot of farmers. I acknowledge Mr Keith Perrett, who has been the NRAC chair for some time now, and I thank him and his fellow NRAC members. It is not a happy job. I have done a couple of tours with them in a previous life as a representative of farmers. It is hard work and you are well aware that the decisions that you will recommend-not make, but recommend-to the federal minister can have long term consequences. My electorate of Calare has, over the past eight years, probably been the most drought affected electorate in Australia. I think Bourke was the first area to become EC declared in this current drought. That was in June 2002, and the drought had obviously been in force for some time before that. In later years the Riverina, Farrer, Mallee and Hume-even though it is a bit further easthave all been in the thick of it and a lot of those areas still are, particularly in the Mallee, in the west of my electorate and in the south of New South Wales. South-west Queensland has also had an awful flogging. In the past three or four years in particular we have seen something that we have not seen before: irrigation water has failed in a lot of those areas. At one stage-I think it was in early 2007-the then Howard government included all forms of agriculture so that irrigation did not have to be specifically included in drought. I will speak about that again a little later. I am not suggesting for one second that ours was a perfect system, but everybody has got used to it and they know what it is. I will go back to my electorate and use it as an example to explain one of the big problems with handling drought. Recently a lot of areas-16 around Australia, but particularly a lot of areas in my electorate-lost exceptional circumstances assistance for two reasons: one reason being that the rules changed. The rules that used to exist meant that farmers had a breathing space between better seasons coming and losing EC. That was because, as the Deputy Speaker would be well aware, rain does not mean water. Sorry, I was referring to Deputy Speaker Schultz, who was previously in the chair.",68
40,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT,It had changed.,69
41,Mr JOHN COBB,RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT,"Sorry, I did not realise that it had changed. In the seat of Hume, obviously, drought has been a very big issue. As a matter of fact, in Page the drought has been an issue too at various times.",69
42,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT,Yes.,69
43,Mr JOHN COBB,RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT,"My point is that there was a time when NRAC's guidelines, or the guidelines on drought, meant that there had to be a 12-month recovery period after the rain so that people had a chance to get their finances back in order. I think when a drought has been going for as long as this one has, the guideline should be reintroduced, because without a doubt there is absolutely no way any government can come up with a drought program which takes into account that a drought might go for eight years, as this one has in a lot of areas. I will talk about this again later, too: for the Productivity Commission to make the comments it did in its report, after a drought of this length, was beyond belief. However, I mentioned two areas where I believe things have gone wrong. I was talking about my own electorate. The first is that we are not taking into account the fact that it does not rain money; it rains opportunity. Whereas a lot of areas are looking a lot better, particularly in my own region, nobody has made any money out of how it looks; they make money out of taking advantage of the time to bring stock into fatten and sell or to put in a crop. That has certainly not happened yet, particularly the cropping. By and large, the croppers have been much worse off over the past few years. Stock people seem to have had more opportunity to get through this period. I am not suggesting they have got fatthey certainly have not-but they probably have not been as financially devastated as the broadacre croppers and as the irrigators have been in more recent times. I think there has been a failure-and once again I refer to my own area, in places like Molong, out at Nyngan or wherever it might be-because they have simply taken huge tracts of land out of drought but have not looked at individual places within the areas of those PP boards. One of the problems in New South Wales is that they are enlarging the boards. I hope that does not mean that NRAC will look at even bigger areas rather than looking at what is going on within those boundaries. I have heard the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry make assurances, over time, about the government's claim that it is not going to abolish EC drought support. We spoke about this a couple of nights ago when we were looking at particular portfolios during, I guess, the House of Representatives' equivalent of the Senate estimates-although it was not quite as gruelling for the ministers concerned and we do not get a go at the bureaucracy, unfortunately. That would be interesting; I would like to do that. The advisors do not look as amused at the thought! I will come back to the issue brought up by the member for Riverina the other night. I take the minister at face value on his comments about the relief payment and the fact that there is no suggestion that they are going to walk away from dealing with the social side of drought. I certainly hope not, although I must say that the transition payments for areas that lose EC are extremely hard to get-much harder than it was to get the relief payment. I noticed that when the minister talked about not walking away from drought he did not talk about the period after 2009-10, when there is no forward estimates on drought. I can accept the fact that that might be true; I still have enormous issues with the fact that page 60 of the agricultural budget papers specifically states that the reduction in expenses is due to the cessation not of drought, which would be understandable and hopeful, but of drought programs. I have never heard the minister mention the interest rate subsidy when he talks about continuation of drought programs. If he makes a statement that he will continue the interest rate subsidy past 2009-10 then I would love to hear it. I think that 21 March 2010 is the latest time for which the current interest rate subsidy is in place in particular areas. I notice, too, that the minister said the other day, ‘Don't get excited about us not having any drought funding in the forward estimates-it doesn't mean we are not going to fund drought,' yet the same minister made the point on AQIS that because it wasn't in the forward estimates he assumed that the coalition was going to cease the funding of AQIS. That argument is hung on a bit of a nail there; perhaps the minister can explain the difference. As he well knows-and he has explained this himself, in defending AQIS-you do not always make provision for funding; a lot of it is discretionary, as indeed was our intention to fund AQIS. Perhaps the minister might be good enough to talk us through that a little later. Given the minister's record of slashing and burning lapsing programs for agriculture-and AQIS is a pretty good example of that I think he has to accept that farmers have every reason to be particularly nervous and concerned about whether they will ever see new drought programs under a Labor government. The simple fact is that I wonder whether the government has any money, given the cash splashes that have gone into providing more programs. I will state right here and now that I have absolutely no problem with the idea of a drought review-I think it is necessary-because there is no perfect system. But everyone is used to this system and I have never been in favour of changing horses mid-stream, and I do not think the minister is, either. I would hope not. Let us just talk about the Productivity Commission report for a while. It was interesting to note that, despite having had that report since-I think I am right in sayingFebruary, the minister for agriculture chose to put it out for public discussion on the Tuesday morning of the budget, when I am sure he expected it to be the headline everywhere the next day. It was probably coincidence, and I am sure he will tell us if it was. That Productivity Commission report is the most ruthless thing that I have ever seen in any industry in my time not just as a member of this House but as an agripolitician representing farmers and other people. I have never seen anything quite so ruthless and quite so determined not to see any view but that of Treasury as this report. Let us remember that the Productivity Commission is a creature of Treasury. When the minister said, ‘This is an unbiased review and we're looking at the facts,' I thought of the car industry. The government obviously wanted to help the car industry and to be seen to do so. They did not get the Productivity Commission or Treasury as their boss of an inquiry into the state of the car industry. They got one of their mates, a one-time Premier of Victoria, Madam Deputy Speaker, whom you probably know, to head up the inquiry. That was ex-premier, Steve Bracks. And, surprisingly, he came down with a report that said, ‘Yes, the car industry needs government to take a hand', and consequently about $4 billion was targeted in that direction. But when it comes to drought and agriculture, which does not seem to get a lot of sympathy from the government, the government does not get a former farmer or anyone who is sympathetic to what is involved in a drought to head an inquiry. I am the first to admit that there are some farmers who do not believe in assistance for anything, and in some cases they are right. But we are talking about a drought that has gone on for eight years. So what do we do? We get Treasury to make a report. Treasury are not famous for wanting to hand out money, as I think even the minister would agree. They are not known for wanting to give presents. They only do it when the Rudd government decides to do a splash. The report says things like: ‘Farmers have to realise that there are rates and taxes and every business should make provision for them.' Why would a farmer, after eight years of drought, assume that he would not have water and that the New South Wales government would charge him for it? Let us get real here. The Victorian government, to be fair to it, does help its farmers a little bit with water rates. But New South Wales is still charging farmers the full cost of water delivery and licensfuel ing for something that it cannot deliver. The Productivity Commission said: ‘Farmers should have thought of that. They should have made provision for that eight years before.' Obviously, they did not have much money then. The Productivity Commission want everything terminated. They are a little bit careful about the social side of things, because they are well aware that their government believes in a lot of it. Thank heaven they are not totally walking away from the social side of drought. But the social side of drought does not just include farmers; it includes the towns. It includes everybody who works on agriculture or processes it, and that does mean the towns. It very much means the towns in the same way that to walk away from EC payments does not take into account the fact that it does not rain money; it rains opportunity. In fact, when it does rain, it actually means that your expenses go up, because you then have to buy all that stuff you did not buy in the drought. If you are a fattening station, you have to go and buy stock and then fatten them, drench them and do all the other things that in a drought you would close down. You just hope you can find the interest payments somewhere-that is another point. I think that the minister is well aware of how the Productivity Commission report was received. I would like to hear him say, as I am sure agriculture would, that the report's recommendation for the cessation of drought programs was a mistake and that it should not have been made. A few nights ago, the minister said that the government continues to fund drought, but I got the impression that he was talking about the social side of drought rather than the hard core side of it. Relief payments might help the farming family but they do nothing for the towns or the businesses who have to be paid for super, et cetera, whereas the interest payments do. That is a social side of drought, too. It supports the towns that are involved. There is another issue in the current situation which has changed drastically over the past few years. When we were in government, we changed the rules four, if not five, times because the drought kept getting worse as it went on. I will say here and now that there is absolutely no way that a government can come up with a program-and I totally concede this in any forum-that takes into account a drought that has lasted as long as this one has, and they would be very foolish to do so. I have spoken about my horror and, I think, a lot of other people's horror about the Productivity Commission handing down this report after a drought of such duration. shows their total lack of understanding. Obviously, they had their riding instructions and were sticking to them. Water: when we put all forms of agriculture, whatever it was-horticulture, broadacre-under EC it took away the issue of irrigation, which at one stage was treated differently. After a few years of drought we did bring in a system of EC for irrigation whereby irrigators could apply separately. Once we made it a level playing field in that sense irrigation was able to be part of normal EC. Even if broadacre, dryland agriculture has had rain-and I am not conceding they have made money; I am conceding that in areas they have had rain-irrigation has not. Irrigation is now going to be stuck out there without water. You only have to look at the dairy industry along the Murray. Gippsland might be fine but the dairy industry in the Mallee and along the Murrumbidgee, the Lachlan and the Macquarie is still totally devastated. It is in enormous trouble. We changed the rules not because EC was necessarily totally wrong originally but because drought two years on is one thing but all that time is another. We changed it to take into account the severity and the length of the drought. Irrigation is getting worse, not better, and yet it is being wiped with everything else. In areas that are being taken out of drought, where there is irrigation they are losing EC along with the dryland. Even if the dryland has had rain and is able to take advantage of that for sowing crops, fattening stock or getting store stock ready to sell, irrigation does not have that opportunity because it has no water. I think the government and the minister, if he is fair dinkum, should look at those areas where EC is presumed not to be necessary for dryland-it is certainly still necessary for irrigation and I believe that should be looked at. Minister Burke looks anxious to speak and It I am sure he is going to reassure us on all those issues so I am not going to speak all morning. The issues on EC are far from over-it does not rain money; it rains opportunity. The government is not taking that into account. That is not NRAC's fault. As I said earlier, before the minister was here, I thank NRAC for their job. It is not a pleasant one. I do wonder if we are extending the term that people can serve on NRAC because they intend to do as the budget papers say and cease drought programs and they do not want to have new people coming in who are not used to it. I do not actually have a problem with the people who do it. We probably appointed most of them, if not all. Mr Burke-All!",69
44,Mr JOHN COBB,RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT,"I thought that might be correct. As I said earlier, I think Keith Perrett has done a good job-being chairman of that body is probably a pretty thankless job. I hope the reason for extending the term of service is not because you intend for it not to exist anymore. The interest rate subsidy, as I said before, has a very big social component-if not for the farmers concerned then for the towns that depend on the money that the farmers spend. I am well aware that the small business side has not been taken up to a big extent partly because they have a totally different structure from farming. It has not been taken up to a large extent by the town small businesses. Minister Burke, I think you have been too frightened to change it in case you make a mistake. We changed it a lot to take into account the changes and also the length of the drought. You should too. Come to us for advice on what to do and how to change it, if you want. I am well aware that you are much more fascinated by the National Party than you are by agriculture. That is fine-we are quite happy for you to concentrate on us; you won't be concentrating on your politics! This is an extraordinarily serious issue. To simply assume that if you do what we did you will keep it out of trouble is not true. Some areas now have gone even longer into drought. I never dreamt I would see a drought go this long in my lifetime; I never want to see another one. Irrigation is something the government should think about. The irrigators have not had water even if the dryland people have.",72
45,Mr TREVOR,RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT,"I rise this afternoon to speak on the Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 2009. This bill amends section 7 of the Rural Adjustment Act 1992 to allow for the appointment of National Rural Advisory Council, NRAC, members for three terms. The proposed amendment will remove the current provision that a person may, on one occasion only, be reappointed as a member. The Rural Adjustment Act 1992 specifies that NRAC's main role is to provide advice on rural adjustment and regional issues, including whether areas should be assessed as being in exceptional circumstances, EC. The bill will ensure that current or previous members who have developed considerable expertise in undertaking EC assessments through membership for two terms can serve an additional, third, term and continue to contribute to NRAC. The National Rural Advisory Council is a skills based independent advisory council to the Australian government Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. NRAC was established in December 1999 as a statutory consultative body following legislative changes to the Rural Adjustment Act 1992. It replaced the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council and expanded the range of roles and functions of the original council. NRAC advises the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry on rural issues, including EC applications and extensions to EC declarations. Currently NRAC consists of a chairperson and not more than seven other members. The members are appointed by the minister on a part-time basis. At least one member is appointed to represent the states, at least one member is an officer of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry who is appointed to represent the Commonwealth, one member is appointed to represent the National Farmers Federation and the other members are appointed because of their expertise in economics, finance and administration, banking, sustainable agriculture, regional adjustment, regional development and farm management or training. Four of the eight current members' second terms expire on 30 June this year and, without the proposed amendment, those members will be unable to serve a third term. The amendment will mean that current members, who have developed considerable expertise in undertaking EC assessments, can continue to make significant contributions to NRAC by serving a third term. A streamlined review process was introduced by the Australian government to make it easier for farmers who have not experienced a break in the drought to have their EC declarations assessed for a possible extension. Under the review process, NRAC reviews EC declared areas before their expiry date to assess whether an extension to the declaration is warranted. As part of the review, NRAC assesses information from a number of sources, including the National Agricultural Monitoring System, analysis provided by the Bureau of Rural Sciences and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, state and local governments and local producers. Additionally, NRAC may undertake an inspection tour of the area. I implore members to continue to undertake an inspection tour of all areas under consideration. If NRAC assesses an area as no longer being in exceptional circumstances and the minister accepts advice not to extend the declaration, assistance ceases on the date declaration ends. If NRAC supports extending the declaration and the minister agrees, assistance continues until the new declaration end date. Exceptional circumstances assistance is the Australian government's main mechanism for providing assistance to eligible farmers and small business operators who are experiencing a severe downturn in income due to rare and severe climatic or other events. The rationale for providing EC assistance is to ensure that eligible farmers and small business operators with long-term prospects of viability are not forced to leave the land or the business due to short-term adverse events which are beyond their ability to manage. Australian farmers have, to a large extent, been successful in managing the inevitable booms and busts that occur in agriculture. It is a way of life for them. They work very hard and are an extremely resilient bunch of Australians. They have done this by developing flexible farm management practices and plans which minimise the risk to their farm business of changes in prices, seasonal conditions and personal circumstances. They have also achieved this through other means such as using investment opportunities, savings strategies and private insurance where it is available. Australian state and territory government rural policy encourages continued improvements in efficiency and competitiveness in all rural industries. The role of government is therefore to assist farmers enhance their skills in key areas of risk management, business planning and natural resource management. Agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries are a vital component of the economic security of my electorate of Flynn. Compared to other electorates, Flynn is ranked 10th in the proportion of people employed in these sectors-some 14 per cent. In comparison to other electorates, Flynn the was ranked eighth in the total number of people employed in the agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries, with the beef industry being the largest. Over 4,700 people are employed in this industry. There are over 6,700 businesses in Flynn in the agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries, which is equal to 43 per cent of all businesses in my electorate. In comparison to other electorates, Flynn is ranked fifth in the number of businesses in these industries. My electorate of Flynn has a diverse range of agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries, including but not limited to beef, sheep, sugar cane, fruit and vegetable growing, sawmilling, pig farming, cotton growing, grape growing, fishing, logging, dairy farming and nut growing, to name a few. Agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries are a vital component of my electorate, with a total gross value of over $1.6 billion, which is 18 per cent of the entire gross value for Queensland. My electorate of Flynn is known as the industrial hub of Australia because of our coal mines, aluminium plants, power stations, deep-sea ports and many other associated industries, including the proposed LNG industry for Gladstone. Only a few hours ago, Australian oil and gas company Santos and its Malaysian joint venture partner Petronas announced the first binding sales contract for Queensland to produce liquefied natural gas. This announcement is a significant step in the development of the project, which is set to inject up to 6,000 much-needed jobs into regional Australia. I congratulate Santos and its partners. This news today means that Australia is set to become a significant exporter of cleaner energy to fuel economic growth in Asia, while creating thousands of jobs here at home, in particular in my electorate of Flynn. In addition, and getting back to the point, the electorate of Flynn also contributes enormously to the Australian economy through the agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries. These industries are a vital component of the economic prosperity of my electorate. They are the lifeblood of many rural and regional towns and communities in Flynn, creating wealth and employment for these areas. They keep the local corner store open, they keep the local hardware store open, they keep the local school open and the local clothing store open. Australia was built on the back of these industries. Unlike many other industries, family businesses in the agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries are often handed down through generations. To the people involved in these industries-and there are thousands of them-it is not just a job; it is a family tradition, a way of life, a certain culture, a certain existence. To these many hard working people the weather can be both cruel and kind. Often their livelihoods depend on: ‘Will it rain; won't it?', ‘Will it hail; won't it?', ‘Will there be a bushfire or won't there?' or ‘Will it flood or won't it?' The Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 2009, which will allow for the reappointment of National Rural Advisory Council members for two subsequent terms after their initial term, is an important and integral component of the agricultural, fisheries and forestry industries in my electorate. Passage of this bill will ensure that members who have developed considerable expertise can continue to make significant contributions to NRAC and to the government. May their decisions be just and equitable, fair and reasonable, and in the best interests of farmers in my electorate, many of whom continue to do it extremely tough, especially in the Burnett area. As I have said before, I implore them to continue to visit all areas before recommendations are made. Farmers are our lifeblood and the heart and soul of this nation. I commend this bill to the House.",73
46,Mr SCHULTZ,RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT,"I rise today in an environment where there will be negativity from this side of the parliament about the current government's contribution to rural and regional Australia, and there will be defences from the government's side about the wonderful job that the current government is doing for rural and regional Australia. The reality is that there are arguments that are positive on both sides as far as rural and regional Australia is concerned. But the Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 2009 is about an extension of the National Rural Advisory Council, which is responsible for giving the minister sound advice about the conditions in drought declared areas throughout Australia. I am pleased to see the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is here. I have to say, Minister, despite what my parliamentary colleagues on this side of the House might say, I appreciate the responses that I get from you when I raise very serious concerns about the people I represent in my rural electorate of Hume. Why do I say that? I say that because I can go back into history and talk about the weaknesses of the National Rural Advisory Council. The weaknesses are there on record. I am going to quote some of them. But the reason I raise the issue of your responses to me is that, to be quite frank with you, in the past I have had some very poor reactions from ministers for agriculture in a previous government that I was a member of. I go back, as an example, to 5 April 2005. I raised a very serious issue about the lack of correct decision making being undertaken by the NRAC about the problems of exceptional circumstances funding in the area of the cherry growers of Young. I wrote to the then minister, Warren Truss, at the time, outlining and questioning the decision made by the NRAC to cut out exceptional circumstances for farmers in that area. I produced all of the evidence that illustrated the facts behind the decision that should not have been made in the negative as far as exceptional circumstances funding was concerned. I will quote the pertinent paragraphs in my letter, so that the minister is aware, and the House is aware, of why I am raising this concern today: Minister it is obvious the NRAC has not fulfilled its obligation to accurately report the facts which I might add can only be obtained by procedures which include an on ground inspection process and receipt of up to date accurate and current information from State agencies such as the NSW DPI. Feeding suspect information to a Minister of the Crown which then results in the Minister making a decision to withdraw Exceptional Circumstances assistance to producers in severe trauma as a result of an ongoing long term drought is reprehensible in the extreme. It also gives the impression that Members of Government funded committees such as NRAC have become complacent in the role taxpayers would expect them to play out as a group employed to accurately advise an Agriculture Minister on critical issues like Drought Assistance to producers such as the Cherry & Stonefruit growers of Young. I might add, Minister, that I never got a response from that agriculture minister to my concerns. He bypassed me and went straight to members of his own party who happened to be cherry growers and gave them the information. So you can understand why I get a little bit emotional about some of these issues. Do you think that that solved the problem? Despite the fact that I pointed out to a then minister for agriculture the weaknesses in the system, I was forced to again write, not to the agriculture minister of the day in 2006 but to the former Prime Minister, on 7 August 2006. I once again, in my sheer frustration, outlined to him the weaknesses in the system, because the NRAC once again refused exceptional circumstances to a group of people who were in dire straits as far as drought was concerned. At the invitation of these people I spent two days out there in the field. I looked at the properties myself. I was absolutely disgusted to hear what had occurred which forced the minister of the day to then say, ‘No, we are removing exceptional circumstances from this area.' Let me read again, from a letter that I wrote to the then Prime Minister. I addressed it to one of his very capable staff, to make sure that it got to the Prime Minister. I said in part: These procedures are being inappropriately used, are driven by out of date data and are thereby causing unnecessary mental health and financial pain to farmers affected by severe drought conditions. It would appear that despite concerns I raised in correspondence to former Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Minister Warren Truss last year which he did not respond to (copy attached), the National Rural Advisory Committee is still not reporting the facts based on procedures such as on ground inspection and use of up to date accurate and current information from State agencies such as Rural Land Protection Boards … and NSW Department of Primary Industries. I went on-and I think it is very important that I make these points, Minister: This shoddy and unprofessional facade of a “genuine” NRAC inspection occurred between the hours of 10.00am and approximately 2.30pm (4½ hours) because the NRAC representatives had to catch a flight at around 3.30pm that day. It was obvious to me when I learnt of this disgraceful visit that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry went into this EC Drought Review process with a predetermined outcome of terminating EC assistance. I went on to explain it, and I enclosed all of the facts-facts that came from people who were involved at the ground level from various government agencies. I went on to say: People with any appreciation of farming know that drought can affect a property in one of three ways: - A fodder drought - A water drought - A cash drought - Or a combination of any of the above. Braidwoodthe area was Braidwood, and I understand, Minister Burke, that you were out there recently; good on you for going out thereproducers were experiencing all of the three!!! The decision to discontinue EC assistance was premature and cruel. All of the depressing tions being experienced by Braidwood producers went unheeded in the decision making process and was compounded by key people such as the Goulburn Branch of the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries, the Drought Support Officer and the Rural Financial Counsellor not being present at the NRAC meeting to give vital accurate information on just how bad the drought conditions were. … … … In conclusion, the fact that the former Minister Truss not only ignored the warning in my correspondence to him of April 5th 2005 and also did not reply to me, is an indictment of his arrogance or indeed his inability to recognise deficiencies in a process under his control and his failure to be professional enough to accept a genuine criticism of an obvious problem within the system which he had carriage of. Thankfully, the Prime Minister read what I gave him, looked at the evidence that I had presented and attached to the letter and acted upon it, and they got their EC assistance. But, as you know, Minister, it does not end there. On 20 February I wrote to you raising the problems associated with the possibility of the decision to extend EC payments excluding the Tuena, Bigga, Peelwood and surrounding areas. To your credit, you responded to me on 4 May, saying: I have received a letter from the Hon. Ian Macdonald MLC, the NSW Minister for Primary Industries, requesting a review of the recent decision to cease the EC declaration in the Central Tablelands area. Included in the request was additional data concerning seasonal conditions in the area. And you put out a press release to this effect on 8 April 2009. I not only made representations to you; I made representations to the state minister as well, and, to his credit, he also responded to me. In between all of this happening, we had certain people from a certain political party on my side of politics out there running around making mileage out condi- of what they were doing, when they were doing absolutely bugger-all as far as my constituents were concerned. I condemn that sort of deceptive behaviour from politicians. When the New South Wales Minister, Ian Macdonald, responded to me-he wrote on 4 May; I received it on 8 May-he said, in the second last paragraph: In a number of areas, including the parts of the Upper Lachlan Shire you have identified, I have requested that EC assistance be extended for a full 12 months. On 8 April 2009, Minister Burke announced that he has asked the National Rural Advisory Council to consider my request. I wrote to you again, Minister, on 22 May, and I said, amongst other things: I refer to your decision to accept the advice of National Rural Advisory Council (NRAC) not to extend Exceptional Circumstances (EC) assistance for 10 regions in New South Wales. Areas of the Hume electorate affected include the Bigga, Tuena and Peelwood districts that overlap the EC area of the Central Tablelands. I also wrote about how the NRAC makes its decisions, without having been to the areas to look at the problems. Part of the problem is that the NRAC is made up of interstate people that have no idea of the conditions in one state or indeed in a section of the state within which they might be farmers. Minister Burke, I understand why you are extending the terms of these NRAC people; it is a demanding situation and they need to have some continuity of tenure in their advisory positions to you as the minister. Minister-and I have invited you, as you know, to come to the electorate and look at some of these areas-please do not take what the NRAC tells you as gospel, because, sadly, as elected members of the committee they are taking the money from the taxpayer, through you, and they are not doing their bloody job-pardon the expression, but they are not doing their job in all the circumstances. I think that the response from the state minister for agriculture to me and to you saying that the matters that I raised have some validity is an indication of what I am talking about. I am not here to play politics with you, Minister. I respect you as a minister of the Crown. You have come from an urban area into this portfolio, but I have had feedback from farmers in my electorate who have an association with you, and they speak very highly of you. I did not want to play politics with this; I want to continue the working relationship I have got with you because I think that is in the best interests of my constituency. I get angry when, despite the urgency of some of these problems within the the agricultural sector, some ministers for agriculture tend to play politics, even with their own coalition partners. That makes me angry-because it is not me that suffers as a result; they can deprive me of an opportunity to achieve for my constituency, but the bottom line is that they have deprived people that are in need and that are suffering. Minister, you know that my wife and I, on her initiative, have been delivering drought parcels and pamper packs to people on the land for the last six years. They are in their seventh year of drought, some of them. We delivered something like 740 drought parcels over the December period. It just breaks my heart when I have to look into the faces of the men and women who are really struggling and who depend on the EC assistance to help get them on their feet. A lot of people do not understand that, when people are eligible for exceptional circumstances assistance, they are eligible for a number of reasons: (a) they are not getting an income; (b) they are trying, in many instances, to raise a family; (c) they are isolated and cannot go and find part-time work because they are too far away; and (d) they do not have the money to pay for things such as petrol. The first thing they do when the pressure comes down on them is give away what we all refer to as non-essential items; they give away the small luxury items that make women feel good. Minister, we have rural women in this country who give away what they term non-essential items, such as face cream, perfume and stuff, and who are trying to carry the burden of the pressures of depression coming from their husbands. If we do not prop those women up and give them something to look at we will lose their support. All of us males know the wonderful support we get from our wives. But let me tell you, in a drought situation these women carry the burden on behalf of their husbands, who, in many instances-and I have had experience of this-have got their rifles and gone out and shot themselves or hung themselves from trees because they can no longer cope. That is why I get emotional about the issue. I do not care what the politics of the day are. Ministers of the Crown in this place have an obligation to look after all Australians. It does not matter what electorate it is or what political party holds that electorate; if there is a need in the electorate it needs be looked after. Minister, I compliment you on extending the NRAC time frame to a third term. I think that is going to be beneficial. But sit down with these people and tell them that when they come to give you advice you expect them to give you professional advice based on the conditions on the ground and how they are affecting people. If they do not give that to you and something crops up as a result of that bad advice, that then flows back to impact on you in a negative way. You are the one who wears the outcome, not the people giving you the advice. Minister, I commend you on this bill and I thank you most sincerely from the bottom of my heart for the open and frank way in which you respond to the representations that I make to you on behalf of the rural people who are struggling out there. We need to make sure that all of the assistance that we as a nation can give them is given to them so that they can survive and continue to produce the agricultural products in the way that they do so well, despite all of these pressures on them.",75
47,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT,"I am not sure whether some of the terms the honourable member for Hume used in his contribution were parliamentary, but they were certainly very Aussie! I understand the sentiment with which they were expressed.",79
48,Mr CHEESEMAN,RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT,"I caught the last part of the member for Hume's contribution. I know he spoke from the heart on the difficulties that people in regional Australia-including regional Victoria-experience. I acknowledge his contribution. Whilst the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is here, I would also like to put on record my thanks for the recent Landcare announcements. The announcement about the coordinator positions has been well received within my electorate. to I would also like to acknowledge Martin Breen, the adviser in this area. I wish him all the best in his exciting new career ahead. I am pleased to rise today to speak on the Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 2009. This is a bill that is important to Australia and, of course, my electorate of Corangamite. As most members would know, this bill is about the Rural Adjustment Act 1992, which covers the critical issue of addressing change in the farming sector. Whilst the amendments proposed in this bill are technical in nature, ensuring continuous governance, the bill gives me a chance to talk about the fantastic contribution made by the farming sector in my electorate and the challenges that it faces. This bill makes a relatively minor amendment from a legislative point of view. Basically, it amends section 7 of the Rural Adjustment Act 1992 to allow the members of the National Rural Advisory Council, the NRAC, to be appointed for two subsequent terms after their initial term. There is no financial impact resulting from this bill. The bill needs to be passed in the winter sitting in order for the four current NRAC members whose second terms cease on 30 June 2009 to be reappointed for a third term. If this legislation is not progressed in the winter sitting, the remaining members of the NRAC will be required to take on additional responsibilities and will have an unacceptable workload as a consequence, or new members will need to be selected to replace the existing notionally retiring members. The National Rural Advisory Council is a skills based, independent advisory council to the Australian government. It was established in December 1999 as a statutory consultative body, following legislative changes to the Rural Adjustment Act 1992. It replaced the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council and expanded the range of roles and functions of the original council. The NRAC advises the minister for agriculture on rural issues such as exceptional circumstances, or EC, applications and extends the EC declarations where required. When the Australian government receives an EC application, the minister may refer it to the NRAC for assessment if he agrees that a prima facie case has been established. In doing assessments, the NRAC must look at a wide range of issues and data. It looks, for example, at the National Agricultural Monitoring System and at analyses provided by the Bureau of Rural Sciences, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, state and local governments and local producers. Additionally, the NRAC may undertake an inspection tour of an area to witness first hand the devastation that drought might be causing. If the NRAC assesses an area as no longer being subject to exceptional circumstances and the minister accepts the advice not to extend the declaration, assistance ceases on the date the declaration ends. If the NRAC supports extending the declaration and the minister agrees, tance continues until the new declaration date ends. So you can see that the NRAC representatives are very powerful people who represent the interests of the communities and the government. They can hold people's futures in their hands by making a simple declaration or by ending such a declaration. It is a job that has enormous responsibilities and requires enormous amounts of experience, so it is very important that there is continuity of service on this body and a higher level of experienced management in place. It really is important for my own electorate but also for people right across the country that the skills and knowledge of the current NRAC members are continued. Corangamite, like most farming areas today, is facing some very real challenges. To show how important farming is to Corangamite, I will run through some of the recent ABARE figures. Milk is one of south-west Victoria's most important agricultural products in value terms. Milk accounts for about 30 per cent or nearly $690 million of the $2.1 billion total value of agricultural production in the region. Cattle trail by only a marginal amount, with 17 per cent of total production, while sheep and lambs contribute 15 per cent to the total value of agricultural production within my seat. Wool accounts for about 14 per cent and vegetable production around three per cent. Pasture and hay production account for just over six per cent of the total value of agricultural production and barley, canola and other oil seeds each account for around two per cent, as measured in 2004-05. There are about 7,900 farms in south-west Victoria. Most farms in the south-west Victorian region are small or medium in size, and over half the farms produce less than $150,000 in agricultural outputs, as measured in that 2004-05 financial assisyear. In 2007 around 294,000 people were employed in south-west Victoria, with 27,000 people-or eight per cent of the workforce-employed in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sector. As you can see, this is a very important industry to my region and, I know, a very important industry to the whole of south-west Victoria and the whole of Australia. It provides us with employment, it provides us with food and it provides us with exports that we desperately need. Climate change is now having a real impact. A number of areas across south-west Victoria have been drought declared. A number of areas have been drought declared for quite some time, and almost all of these areas have been affected by climate change to one degree or another. Farmers are very familiar with El Nino and La Nina events and with how they can greatly affect seasons and rainfall. We all know that it will just get harder for the farmer to respond to climate change. All the science tells us this. On top of climate change challenges, farmers have to deal with the real impacts of worldwide markets. These can have a very big impact upon their small businesses. For example, the dairy price index of international dairy product prices recently fell by 58 per cent from its peak in 2007. Prices appear to have bottomed out in the first quarter of 2007 and to have recovered a bit. Production prices in Oceania region this year were about half of what they were in previous years, I understand. Of course, dairy is not the only farming sector that is subject to quite volatile variations. Most other sectors are too. The point is that it is very important to have experienced people in charge of schemes such as the Rural Adjustment Scheme so farmers can get help when they need it. The Rural Adjustment Act 1992 specifies that the NRAC's main role is to provide advice on rural adjustment and regional issues, including on whether areas should be assessed as being in exceptional circumstances. Four of the eight currently serving NRAC members cease their second terms on 30 June 2009. Without this legislative amendment being passed they will not be eligible to serve for a third term. Passage of this bill will ensure that the current and past members, who have developed considerable expertise in undertaking EC assessments, can continue to make significant contributions to the NRAC. What we are doing here is a very sensible thing-that is, making sure we have the right people in place to make these very important judgements on behalf of the government or for the government. I support the intent of this bill, and I commend it to the House.",79
49,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT,"It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on the Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 2009. I come to this place and this bill with a background knowledge and a responsibility to represent my constituency. With my background-having been brought up on the land and having run my business on the land-I think I have a fair understanding of life on the land and life in small rural communities. I understand how the exceptional circumstances drought and business support has been essential to the survival of many families and many small businesses during this the exceptionally long drought. I know that, when rain comes in an area, it does not fall universally. We have noticed, particularly in Queensland-and it is on the record-that a lot of the rainfall events we have had have been almost tropical downpours but they have fallen in one spot and not always spread to the same intensity across a large area. That has created a lot of difficulties in the assessment of seasonal conditions for the people on the National Rural Advisory Council. I note that this bill will allow those board members to be reappointed. I want to put on record my personal thanks to those who serve on this board. It is a most difficult job. In fact, I know one member of the board very well because he has lived in my electorate-I think he lives just outside Maranoa now. They put their heart and soul into the job. Given that it is a difficult job, and times they stand almost as judge and jury, I think people may from time to time be a bit too willing to criticise a decision when these people make those decisions with the best of intentions and the best knowledge that they have in the time that is available. I acknowledge the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, who is at the table. I thank him and particularly his advisor Martin Breen, who I have only just learned during this debate will not be remaining in the minister's office. Martin was able to give me a briefing before the recent announcement to extend or end EC assistance in parts of my electorate of Maranoa and many parts of Queensland, and you might say he sought some guidance from me. Given that Maranoa is an electorate three times the size of the state of Victoria, boundaries can often be difficult. Trying to gain an understanding of where the boundaries fall in and out of EC areas where assistance will be ending creates challenges. I have written to the minister about some of those decisions, particularly in relation to northern Darling Downs region around Bell, Cooranga north through Jandowae and up through to the south Burnett around Blackbutt and Cooyar-just to name a few-and an area just north of Roma in the Bymount east region. Why did I write to the minister? People from these areas contacted my office when they heard that they were going to be excluded from exceptional circumstances and yet very near to them other people would remain eligible. It indicated to me the difficulty the NRAC committee have had in assessing areas but also the fact that it is impossible for the committee to travel every road and visit every nook and cranny of an area. Sometimes some of the information they have to use relates to rainfall that has occurred in a region when the rainfall recording station may be 40, 50 or 60 kilomesometres from some of these farms that are going to be excluded-in fact, they were excluded on the 15th of this month. I have spoken to you, Minister, and Martin Breen in your office. We need the minister in Queensland to request an extension of these areas. I urge you and your office to get onto the minister in Queensland. I know they have had a difficult budget, and I will not bring that into the debate now, but I urge him to request of your office to consider extending these areas that I have described-and I describe them in good faith, not in a political sense but in a genuine attempt to help people because that is what the exceptional circumstances scheme is all about. I took the time to drive through these areas from where I had received these telephone calls-so I am coming to this issue having driven through the region. It is amazing; you drive through an area and it looks beautifully green and there are some crops, but you go another 20 kilometres along the road and there is drought. I have spoken to a few people. They say, ‘Go up Cooyar Creek the a bit further and you will find it is devastated.' There is no water in the dams-isn't that an indication that those heavy rainfall events have not occurred? The dams did not capture any water because there was no water. I know it is very patchy and very difficult, but I urge the minister to get on to the minister in Queensland and hurry him up because we are dealing with peoplefarming families. Having driven the area, I had a few calls from farmers. The men out there are always very stoic. They just appreciate a call back from me after having spoken to my office. They say, ‘I think I'll be all right, but I'm worried about the women.' It is not that they are worried about the women; it is the women who are worried about the men. In my electorate is Aussie Helpers, a voluntary organisation which has been working tirelessly for the last six or seven years and maybe even longer. It is based in Dalby and Charleville and does a magnificent job. I want to acknowledge the work of communities as well, right across Australia. They tribute not only goods from the local community but also hay and other support that has come from other parts of Australia. I acknowledge the great work of the Country Women's Association. The emergency relief money to be distributed to areas that has been provided by our government-I am sure it will continue; I hope it does, Minister-to the Country Women's Association is important. The Country Women's Association is one of the great organisations in this country. Its people do their work quietly, without fanfare. They do not seek recognition. The association is based in nearly all rural communities. The women in this organisation have been able to distribute some additional support. The member for Hume spoke of the additional goods, clothing and personal effects that might help to make a difference to a family. I just want to acknowledge the great work of the Country Women's Association. It is a great organisation and I commend each and every person in it. Minister, we must make sure that this parliament appropriates money to keep them doing the job that they do across Australia. Sometimes it means that a power bill is paid or a telephone account is paid so that a family remain connected through the telephone. I also want to acknowledge the work that Woolworths have done in supporting our farmers. In fact, I went into our local supermarket on the day when, across Australia, they raised something like $7 million which was then distributed through the Country Women's Association to the needy families out there. It was a great initiative. It came from the profits of the trade of that day. Thank you, Woolworths. It was great to be there. From my point of view, to be at the checkout and see the skills of those who check out the grocery lines is just amazing. I was there fiddling and trying to press the buttons. ‘Yes, that looks like an apple'-we diswould weigh them, put them in the bag and make sure that we did not put the ice-cream on top of the hot chook, and things like that. They are very skilled people. They whisk it through and I fiddle with the first two or three items. I saw it on the day when Woolworths were conducting a campaign across Australia, with the profits of that day from each state helping farmers in drought relief. I make no apology for the support that we appropriate for our farming communities in exceptional drought. They are the people who feed our nation. Minister Burke, from time to time we have been on the same podium. I remember last year at Millmerran when you spoke very kindly and generously about the very special place that farmers have in our lives and in this nation. I and many people were pleased to hear you say that and to see the approach that you are taking with this portfolio. Farmers are a very special breed. I think they do it out of love and, of course, to make money, which is more challenging every year. They do not play on a level playing field when it comes to the international stage, as you would be aware. So I make no apology for the support that we must continue to put behind our farmers. For instance, look at what we give the motor vehicle industry in Australia. It is important that we have a motor vehicle industry in Australia. When Australia had its own car, the Holden, we all rejoiced in that. We put something like $6 billion into the manufacture of Australian-made vehicles every year. I do not think it is too much to ask that we continue to support those farmers in need. I would hope that the parliament would always see that there is a need to support those who, through no fault of their own, have to deal with seasonal vagaries from day to day. The other things about not extending the exceptional circumstances support are that farmers would lose not only the health card and some income support but also the additional support that can flow through youth allowance. There would not be an income or asset test applied. They are always worried about how their children will gain access to further education, because they want to make sure that they are not lost in this exceptional drought as the generation of young people who lost the opportunity for further education because their parents were not able to afford to send them away. Youth allowance is available without an income or assets test. There is also the assistance for isolated children to gain access to education. There is a basic allowance for assistance for geographically isolated children to gain access to primary and secondary education, and there is additional support available from the federal government-I think I am right here-for families, without an income or assets test, because they are in receipt of exceptional circumstances support. So, when they lose exceptional circumstances status, it is not just the income support or business support; there are other elements of support for families that are absolutely essential. Minister Burke, I would ask you to get on to the minister in Queensland. I had my state colleagues make sure that they contacted the minister. This is not a political issue; this about families out there, whom I feel very strongly about. And as for those small and maybe very patchy areas, it would have been very difficult for the NRAC committee to have identified them without perhaps walking the entire length and breadth of my electorate, which they are not able to do. But, based on calls to my office, there are people out there who are extremely worried as we go into winter. They have done all that they can to keep their enterprises going. The season is not with them. They have appreciated all the support they have received, including business support, the health card, assistance for their children and income support. In the overall scheme of the federal budget, it is a very small amount of money. As I said earlier, I make no apologies for supporting the need for this parliament to support the people who feed our nation and provide a valuable underpinning of the economies of many regional communities and enormous overseas export wealth. Minister, I leave it with you. Once again, I thank Martin Breen for the way we have been able to work together. The areas that I have written to you about really need that extension, in some form or another, to receive that additional support, even for six months until the end of the year to see whether they need a continuation of that support. The calls we get, even from Centrelink, sometimes worry me. Centrelink is probably, on a day-today basis, closer to this than you, Minister, your office or me. The alerts that they give me from time to time worry me. It is about continuing to support families in particular areas. There may be only 40 to 50 families but they are 40 to 50 families that deserve our support.",81
50,Mr NEUMANN,RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 2009. I commend and congratulate the member for Maranoa, who is is my neighbour in terms of our electorates. His electorate is to the west of mine and the farmers in his electorate feel the same as the farmers in my electorate. My electorate is classified by the Australian Electoral Commission as rural, and so it is. Sixty per cent of the city of Ipswich is rural and I have 70 per cent of the city of Ipswich in my electorate, including all the rural parts. In my electorate I also have the Fassifern Valley, the old Boonah Shire, as well as all the Lockyer Valley. So, geographically, 95 per cent of my electorate in south-east Queensland is rural. know that the farmers in my electorate feel exactly the same way as the farmers in Maranoa. They do it tough. It is tough for them to make a living. They find tremendous challenges in terms of the provision of health care, giving their kids a good education, ting income support and getting access to markets. The Lockyer Valley alone contributes hundreds of millions of dollars to the Queensland economy. It has been of tremendous benefit to Queensland's past, present and future. The reality is that the farmers have had benefit of exceptional circumstances assistance in the Lockyer Valley-which, of course, has been classified as ‘Southern South-East Revised (Lockyer Valley)'. They received assistance from 15 June 2008 to 15 June 2009. Minister, I have always found this classification by NRAC puzzling. It really puzzles me, and I have raised this with your office before. The whole of Ipswich and all of the Lockyer Valley were covered by the exceptional circumstances declaration but, for some inexplicable reason, the moment you hit Harrisville, it stopped. South of Harrisville there was no exceptional circumstances assistance. I spoke to John Brent, who is the Mayor of the Scenic Rim Regional Council. I think the member for Maranoa would have met John Brent on many occasions. He is a well known LNP figure in Queensland. I get on very well with John, and so does the member for Forde. John and I have both puzzled on numerous occasions why areas like Kalbar, Boonah, Aratula and other areas were not part of the classification. This weekend I will be opening the Kalbar Show. I will do the Ipswich Home Show as well for three days, but I will be there at the Kalbar Show. I guarantee you that, at the I mobile office I run on Saturday at the Kalbar Show, farmers and their families will come up to me and talk to me about the challenges they face in relation to drought, health, education and income and interest assistance. They do it hard. It is a tough life, working get- seven days a week with their hands. Concerning my electorate, my family on my father's side were German farmers from the Lockyer Valley. On my mother's side, they were railway workers from Ipswich. So I am as local as you are going to get in my electorate. But the farmers in the Lockyer the Valley have been of tremendous help to South-East Queensland. Beetroot, lettuce, cabbage-you name it, they grow it. With the climate change challenges, wheat has increasingly become a crop grown in that area. Recently, I launched the Queensland Farmers Federation report on the climate change challenges that Queensland will face. I launched it in Forest Hill, the home of Linton Brimblecombe, who is a well-knownand I will get this straight for the member for Maranoa-LNP personality in the Lockyer Valley. He and Mel and Linton's family have been farming for generations in that valley. His father, Alan, has been a pillar of the Uniting Church in Laidley and so have Linton and the whole family. I have talked to Linton and other farmers in that area. They appreciate the exceptional circumstances funding they get and have received over the years, but farmers in the Fassifern area are really mystified about why they did not receive that kind of assistance in the last few years. We have recently been blessed with a lot of rain in South-East Queensland. It has created some challenges for us. It has caused us some issues. There have been people injured. There has been loss of property, damage done to businesses and, sadly, at the end of last year the loss of the life of a woman in the Lockyer Valley. But the blessing that we received is that the dam levels, which were hovering between 15 to 18 per cent in South East Queensland, have gone up to about 70 per cent. That does not mean that the each and every day challenge for farmers to earn an income has gone away. A lot of people running businesses still have prohibitive debt levels. They still often have their partner or spouse working in towns like Gatton, Laidley, Ipswich or Toowoomba just to be able to afford to meet what are often called ‘basic living expenses'. To give their children the kind of life that they expect and they deserve, they need assistance. Those children receive good assistance through their schools, great schools like Lockyer District High, Laidley State High and the many other schools in the Lockyer Valley. We are providing a lot of assistance through Building the Education Revolution. In fact, in excess of $90 million has been allocated to the schools in Ipswich, the Lockyer Valley and the Fassifern Valley in my electorate. The farmers welcome this. They also received the one-off payments. There were 119 farming families who received those one-off payments in the last few months. They also received benefits in the Nation Building and Jobs Plan-the nation building for recovery activities that this ernment is committed to. But they have also suffered and struggled, and NRAC has not always been as kind as they ought to have been to the farmers in my electorate. Those farmers really think at times, ‘What is this about?' because, for them, drought and difficulty are not rare and severe events outside of what a farmer could expect to manage. For them, it is a fact of life. It is what they have put up with for year after year. I know what an EC declaration is. I know that these impacts are supposed to have been so severe and prolonged that they are likely to occur only once every 20 or 25 years. But let me tell you: for these farmers, that is not their experience. I know that the state government of Queensland has worked with the federal government and, before making an application for EC, they worked to provide substantial new assistance. I know that the state government has declared drought in EC application areas. I know that is what needs to be done. But I really wonder whether NRAC always gives the kind of skills based advice that the minister needs to get. I know there are some experts on the panel; there is a person from the National Farmers Federation. I know people are appointed because of their expertise in economics, financial administration, banking, sustainable agriculture, regional adjustment, regional development, farm management or training. But if you go and talk to the farmers in my area they often wonder about that as well. I know that in this legislation we are allowing for the reappointment of people for an additional term or terms. Four of the eight current serving NRAC members cease their second term as of 30 June 2009 and, without this legislation, their terms would expire and they would not be eligible for another term. But, fair gov- dinkum, Minister, we need to have people on that NRAC board who are more sympathetic to farming communities in South-East Queensland as well as elsewhere, because drought is not something that happens occaall sionally; it happens almost every year for these farmers. I know we have to have this amending legislation we are debating today because otherwise members could not be reappointed and we would have a disaster in terms of the advice that the minister gets. But we need to have a look at the personnel we have put on NRAC because farmers need to have confidence that the people on NRAC are sympathetic not just to their lives but their lifestyles and their needs. I know the federal government are doing a lot to help the farmers in my electorate. We have invested a record $24 billion in rural and regional Australia and we are thereby building stronger communities and helping them adjust to the worse global recession we have seen since the Great Depression. I welcome, Minister, the fact that we have provided such support to primary producers. There is the $715 million for ongoing drought support and the $1.7 billion to support local communities. Farmers in my electorate also very much appreciate the fact that we have put $8 million into the Warrego Highway upgrade, and they can see that being done just west of Ipswich and across Ipswich. They appreciate the fact that we have put about $800,000 into the Minden Crossing, a terrible crossing that is actually just past my electorate, in the electorate of son. They also appreciate the fact that we spending $884 million on the Ipswich Motorway upgrade, which is supporting up to 4,000 jobs locally in South-East Queensland. How do they get their produce from the Lockyer Valley, from west of Ipswich and often from the electorate of the member for Maranoa? The Warrego Highway and the Cunningham Highway connect to the Ipswich Motorway, and that is how the farmers get their produce to the markets in Rocklea and elsewhere, so fixing up the Ipswich Motorway is crucial. Recently I had a meeting with the Mayor of the Lockyer Valley Regional Council, Steve Jones, another prominent conservative politician in South-East Queensland. The Lockyer Valley, as I said, is not entirely in my electorate, but he was commending us for the fact that we are doing work on the Warrego Highway, after many years of neglect, and fixing up the Ipswich Motorway. I just cannot understand why those opposite to voted repeatedly against doing up the Ipswich Motorway. They did not fix it in the 11½ years they were in office and they have again voted against it in this place. So I want to let the farmers in the Lockyer Valley and the Fassifern Valley, not just the urban dwellers in Ipswich, know that when it comes to regional infrastructure and road funding and the kind of assistance they need to get their produce to the markets it is the Rudd Labor government that is helping them. It is not just supporting jobs in Ipswich but supporting farmers to get their produce through to Ipswich; and not just the farmers in horticulture but also the beef farmers. I have a number of beef farmers in my electorate. How do they get their beef to the abattoir? I have the biggest meat works in the country in my electorate, at Dinmore. They kill 18½ thousand beasts every week. I started my working life as a cleaner in the Dickmeatworks there. My father worked there, are my uncle worked there and my three cousins worked there. Making sure that regional roads are efficient, effective and not subject to obstacles is crucial. I am pleased, Minister, that we have provided that funding for road infrastructure in my electorate. North of Aratula, the Cunningham Highway goes into the electorate of the member for Maranoa. The farmers in the Fassifern Valley have been arguing and advocating for years that the Cunningham Highway north of Aratula should be fixed, and the Rudd Labor government actually provided millions of dollars recently to ensure that Main Roads Queensland can get that fixed. So 22 kilometres of road north of Aratula will be fixed. It has been a national disgrace under the coalition government for years. I have doorknocked that whole area and spoken to businesses there and they know how important this road funding is. It is important, Minister, that you know how important road funding is for the farmers in my electorate as well as across the country. But when it comes to the challenge of climate change and those issues, it is very important for the minister to know that there needs to be more sympathy shown to farming communities. There has simply not been enough when it comes to exceptional circumstances funding. It is important for the minister to know that there are many people on this side of the House, like me and the member for Leichhardt and the member for Dawson and the member for Flynn, who represent farming communities. They speak to us at our mobile offices, at our country shows, in our constituencies and electorate officers about the challenges of exceptional circumstances funding. So I would urge you to have a good look at this, Minister, and at the composition of NRAC in the future. We think it is important that when you are making changes in your current portfolio and looking at reappointing people, you should be looking at personnel on that panel who have the necessary kind of expertise to advise on the needs of farming communities. They need to listen to what farming communities have to say and it is important that those communities are not forgotten, not just on roads, health or education but on the challenges of drought and the problems of financial impoverishment that drought causes to those communities. In the circumstances, it is extremely important that this legislation goes through but also that you listen to those farming communities because they need to be represented, they need a stake at the table in NRAC in the future, and I commend you, Minister, for doing that. This bill needs to passed, but there need to be changes on the board. Only when we get some changes on the board will the farming communities across South-East Queensland get the kind of sympathy that they deserve. I commend this bill to the House and suggest that in future, Minister, changes be made to the composition and personnel you put on the board.",84

55,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. fer the Prime Minister to the Obama administration's overnight announcement of sweeping changes to the regulation of the United States financial markets. I also refer him to the fact that his own government has seen no need to make similar changes in Australia. Prime Minister, isn't it the case that your government inherited the best regulated and most robust financial system in the world?",89
56,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I have not seen the detail of President Obama's statement overnight and will be studying that in the period ahead. Can I say to the honourable member, however, that the President of the United States and I, in Washington and subsequently at the G20 summit in London, discussed on many occasions how we, as a G20, reform global financial markets and global financial systems and the regulatory environment which underpins them because, as the honourable member would know, in particular, given his professional background, global capital is globally mobile and therefore the regulations that we need for the future need to be consistent across multiple nations, across multiple jurisdictions. Therefore that is why an extensive raft of reform proposals have been put to the Financial Stability Forum, as it was before-now the Financial Stability Board-that is headed by the Governor of the Central Bank of Italy, Governor Draghi. Australia is represented on the Financial Stability Board and has recently had its representation enhanced from one position to two positions. As a consequence, through our representation on the Financial Stability Board, we will be working through with our colleagues from the G20, which now has a membership which parallels that of the Financial Stability Board, a raft of reform proposals which go to the questions of executive I reremuneration and financial markets as well as the proper provisioning for risk, the proper provisioning for capital adequacy and the proper provisioning for a whole range of other protections in financial markets. I would also draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that the reason that we found ourselves in this extraordinary crisisstarting with the events of late last year and commencing in the United States much earlier than that-was that we had an outbreak of free-market fundamentalism in the United States with grossly unregulated markets and as a consequence of that we had the spread of this contagion across the world. Mr Turnbull- Mr SPEAKER ",89

60,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, as I said yesterday, me thinks he doth protest too much. The fountain of negativity on the Australian economy, the Leader of the Opposition, will not pass an hour or a day, in this place or beyond, without taking the opportunity to talk down the Australian economy, to talk negatively about what is going on, to seize any piece of data and to twist it in order to convey a negative narrative against the Australian economy. I say to the honourable member: why doesn'the stand with the parliament and with the nation at large and celebrate the fact that Australia is now the fastest-growing economy of all the major advanced economies? Why does he not stand at the dispatch box and celebrate the fact that we have the second lowest unemployment rate among the major advanced economies? Why does he not stand at the dispatch box and celebrate the fact that we have the lowest net debt of the major advanced economies? Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It goes to relevance. Why doesn'the stand at the dispatch box and answer the question?",89
61,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Prime Minister will respond to the question.,90
62,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the point of order from the Leader of the Opposition was about speaking positively about the Australian economy. Therefore, it is a question of growth, it is a question about unemployment and it is a question about net debt relative the rest of the other economies around the world. It is also a question in terms of government deficit relative to the other major advanced economies and to the fact that this economy, virtually uniquely across the OECD, has managed thus far to avoid a recession. I would have thought that, in terms of speaking positively about the Australian economy, this is where the nationconsumers across the nation, businesses across the nation-want us to be, reflected by the two confidence indicators recently indicating that Australians want us as a government, as a nation and as a parliament to be as one, pull together and push the Australian economy up, lifting it up out of global recession.

First of all, I indicate that anything that was said during an earlier point of order was not a supplementary question and should be ignored. The original question dealt with the financial sector and the global to crisis. The Prime Minister will respond to the question.",90
67,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In terms of the question about financial markets, as the honourable member was asking before: that is why the government, given the dramatic circumstances of last OctoberOpposition member interjecting",90
68,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have thought the honourable member might be interested in this response. The government response to the events of last October, following the implosion of Lehman, ‘Black Friday' on stock markets and the grave crisis we faced in this country as a consequence of that, included actions to provide guarantees for depositors right across the country for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth. He asks a question as to what was missing in terms of the regulatory environment when this government was elected to office. Where was a deposit insurance scheme on the part of those opposite? When the Liberal Party occupied the treasury bench, how many times was a deposit insurance scheme recommendedone, two, three, four, five times? The reason they did not is that the banking industry got into their ear and said it was too expensive; they did not want to do it. As a consequence, we actually found ourselves on the cusp of this crisis in September and October last year without adequate consumer protection for depositors across the country. That is why the government had to act. The honourable member asked what actions we have taken to improve financial regulation in this country. I would think that the 13 million or so deposit holders across the country, all the men and women in the gallery here today and those listening to the broadcast who have deposits in banks, building societies and credit unions will be pleased by the fact that a government at last acted to provide that level of security to the Australian financial system. That is one element of our actions. We have also sought to undertake other actions, which have been frustrated by the member opposite, including the proper provision of financial support for the commercial property sector in Australia. I say to Leader of the Opposition: as he looks at the number of firms out there in the construction industry with jobs at risk of being lost through the nonsupply of capital, he should ask himself the question of why he has acted so negatively and destructively to undermine the Australian Business Investment Partnership. It was supported by the Property Council and supported by business groups across the country. At this time of crisis in financial markets, we needed a special form of market intervention of the type which is put together with the private sector. Of course, this was blocked and voted down by those in the Senate.  not invite a 50-minute tutorial from Professor Rudd.",90
69,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The point of order is?  relates to relevance. The Prime Minister was asked a specific question.,91
70,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt will resume his seat. The Prime Minister will respond to the question.,91
71,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Firstly, the government acted nationally through the measures I have just referred to-providing guarantees for deposit holders, providing guarantees for interbank lending and proposed interventions of the type described in the Australian Business Investment Partnership. Secondly, and critically, the government acted multilaterally through the G20 and through the raft of reforms to financial markets which are currently being considered by the Financial Stability Board. Australia is actively engaged in all of this. I would have thought the honourable member would understand that capital is globally mobile, and for there to be an effective regulatory environment you need a global set of regulations to underpin it. The member asked what actions we are taking the we are active on this range of fronts and we will continue to be active on them into the future. Renewable Energy",91
72,Ms VAMVAKINOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister explain how the government's renewable energy target will assist Australian households to install solar panels and drive the low-pollution jobs of the future?,91
73,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Calwell for her question. The government is committed to ensuring 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply is generated from renewable energy by 2020. That is why we have established a renewable energy target and introduced legislation in this parliament to that effect. The House of Representatives has passed that legislation is now in the Senate-but I will come back to that in a moment. The reason we have done so is not just to make our contribution to bring down global greenhouse gas emissions but, on top of that, to ensure that are new jobs generated in the renewable energy sector in Australia. If we raised to 20 per cent the proportion of Australia's electricity supply coming from the renewable energy sector by 2020, I am advised that would be equivalent to the electricity used in Australia's 7½ million households. The equivalent of the electricity used in 7½ million households would be supplied by renewable energy. This is important for the environment but it is equally important for Australian jobs. Treasury modelling projects that by 2050 the renewable energy sector will be 30 times larger than it is today. Solar, wind and geothermal technologies all represent further opportunities for jobs for Australia-good for jobs and good for the environment. This comes to the whole question of why we are acting on climate change through the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the renewable energy target legislation, in addition to a range of other measures to support investment in this critical sector in renewable energy. The reason is that the economic cost of inaction is far greater than the economic cost of action. The Garnaut review projected declines in the value of agricultural production of up to 97 per cent in the Murray-Darling by the end of the century if emissions are not reduced, as well as projecting the catastrophic destruction of the Great Barrier Reef. At present the Great Barrier Reef generates some $4.9 billion in revenue, as the member for Leichhardt well knows, and it generates employment for about 60,000 people across Australia. The agricultural sector and it in the Murray-Darling Basin, as members opposite whose seats are adjacent to that region would know, employs some 90,000 people. On these two questions-that is, the impact on the Great Barrier Reef alone and there the impact on the Murray-Darling-you are looking at an aggregate employment impact or effect on those 150,000 Australians employed through tourism on the Great Barrier Reef and agriculture in the Murray-Darling. That is why Australia must act. That is also why the Australian business community wants certainty for its regulations for the future. If you are a business out there in the renewable energy sector or in the traditional energy sector, you want certainty in the regulatory environment. That is what we are on about. Pacific Hydro, for example, have some 600 megawatts of clean energy projects in the pipeline in Australia worth $2 billion. Let me quote from Mr Rob Grant, CEO of Pacific Hydro, who said in March this year",92

Year in year out the reports came in over the 12 years that they were in office, but our hyperactive member for Flinders obviously prevailed so decisively in the internal deliberations of the Howard government that what was produced by legislative outcome was one big fat zero.

85,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order, the member for Flinders! The question was in order and the Prime Minister is responding to the question.",93
86,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will come to the question of Senate filibusters in a minute, Mr Speaker, but to quote further from Pacific Hydroand I note the opposition's continued sensitivity on the whole raft of climate change matters which are before the parliament at the moment- Mr Rob Grant said: Pacific Hydro's investment alone will create thousands of jobs mainly in regional areas in areas such as road building, concreting, steel fixing and steel fabrication. And he went on to say: … we must legislate the RETthe renewable energy targetas quickly as possible to create new jobs and limit the impact of the global economic crisis. That is what Pacific Hydro had to say. But that is where we get to the position of obstruction on the part of the opposition. What we see from those opposite at present is a decision today by the opposition to delay the passage of the renewable energy target legislation. I refer to the Sydney Morning Herald and an article there which brings to our attention the intention of Mr Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, to direct his Senate colleagues to filibuster next week to prevent a vote on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Not having the courage to vote for climate change is one thing, but not having the courage to allow any vote on climate change is something else. In fact, on this critical challenge of climate change for Australia, I would say that filibustering is not leadership, it is just absolute opportunism, in and that is what we have on the part of those opposite. Remember that great senator from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond, an antiintegration senator from the south? I think he has the world record-24 hours, I think-for filibustering. I say to those opposite: can you get on with the business of passing this legislation. The nation needs it. Economy",93
87,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to the fact that Australia's sovereign debt will be around $475 billion or over $21,000 of government debt for every man, every woman and every child in Australia. I also refer the Treasurer to the fact that the Senate, against government wishes, has agreed to coalition amendments to set up a public register of government borrowings that delivers transparency and accountability on Labor's record debt. Treasurer, when will the register be operating so that every Australian will know exactly who owns our future?",93
88,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. This is part of his debt campaign that he has been attempting to mount in this House day in day out. Of course he cannot ever quite get all his figures right or facts right. That does not seem to matter at all, because the opposition are not interested in an alternative economic policy; they are just interested in a scare campaign. They are not interested in supporting jobs; they are just interested in another scare campaign, which is where the question comes from today. I have had several questions about this from the shadow Treasurer over recent weeks. Basically, he has asked me what percentage of our bonds on issue is owned by people overseas. And the answer is: roughly two-thirds. That has not changed from the time of the former government. It was roughly two-thirds then and it is roughly two-thirds now. There were amendments attempted to be moved in this House last night. The opposition could not get them right-they stuffed that up-and they had to go up and move them in the Senate today. And of course those amendments did go through the Senate today. They are amendments seeking greater detail as to what or who may be the individual investors. At the moment the data that is provided by the Bureau of Statistics. It does not give the sort of detail that the member opposite is seeking so what we have said we will do reasonably is look at whether we can get, in an accurate fashion, more data. I made the offer to him in the House last night that we would sit down with our advisers, with the Treasury, and through the ABS, and attempt to do that. I made that clear, Mr Speaker. But, of course, it is not about that. What it is really about is this debt scare campaign. Australia has low levels of net debt compared to every other economy in the worldscare very low compared to every other major advanced economy. I think it pays to go through them. If we take the period to 2014 and go through levels of net debt around the world, they are: United Kingdom, 83 per cent; United States, 83 per cent. Major advancedMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order that goes to relevance. I asked the Treasurer: when is he setting up the register that discloses who owns our debt?",94

91,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,94
92,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, we really should have a look at how serious or childish those opposite are. Last night, with no warning, they turned up in the House with a couple of amendments that were inaccurate and had to be redrafted. They did not proceed with the amendments last night. They took them up into the Senate in a different formMr Hockey interjecting",94
93,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, Sloppy Joe-more ‘sloppynomics' from Joe. They took them up in the Senate and they passed them, with the help of the minor parties, in the Senate today. Of course, we will comply to the maximum extent that we possibly can. But it is not about compliance. What it is about here is a debt scare campaign to try to get them off the hook for their failure to support economic stimulus, which is supporting jobs in this economy, and their embarrassment at the national account result two weeks ago. They have opposed vital economic stimulus which is supporting jobs in our economy, and all through this there is no alternative economic policy. The shadow Treasurer was on Sky News the other day. He was asked on Sky News how the coalition would get a lower deficit. This is the answer of order on relevance. The Treasurer was asked a specific question. He has answered it as best he can. We are now going around the world in 80 days",94
94,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Sturt will resume his seat. The Manager of Opposition Business might like to review the question, which had a preamble that made references to a number of things. It has been the practice and precedent of this place that they can also be responded to in making the answer relevant.",95
95,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Certainly, Mr Speaker, because I was asked a question about debt. The shadow Treasurer on Sky News was asked about how he would go about achieving a lower deficit which contributes to debt. So I do believe that my answer is directly relevant to the question that I have received from the shadow Treasurer. This is what he said on Sky News when he was asked by David Speers about how the coalition would have a lower deficit. He said this: There are always going to be other decisions, David, that we would have taken that would have not delivered the same budget deficit. He then goes on to say this: We said it was vitally important that you stimulate small business, and the way to do that, we said, was to change the superannuation guarantee arrangements. Those changes to the superannuation guarantee arrangements that they had mentioned some time ago come at a cost of $5 billion. So his answer on Sky News as to how he would go about getting a lower deficit was to add to the deficit. That is just more ‘sloppynomics' from Sloppy Joe to camouflage the fact that they need to have a deficit and debt scare campaign because they have no positive alternative policy for Australia. Climate Change",95
96,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. Will the minister outline the importance of supporting renewable energy as part of a comprehensive approach to tackling dangerous climate change?",95
97,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. Can I point out again to the House that the Rudd government is strongly committed to supporting renewable energy technologies, knowing that they will deliver clean energy jobs in the regions of Australia from now and into the future. This week we saw more evidence of the urgent need to address dangerous climate change and encourage investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency with the release of a very important report. This report, Global climate change impacts in the United States, was released by the White House and it represents a consensus of some 13 agencies on the potential impacts of climate change in the US. I saw Dr John Holdren, who is the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, speaking to this report on television recently. It makes compelling reading and listening. It observes that climate changes are already underway in the US and that thresholds for our climate and our ecosystems will be crossed. On the United States marine environment the report says: Coral reefs sustain fisheries and tourism, biodiversity value, scientific and educational value, and form natural protection against wave erosion. The report goes on to say: The loss of income by 2015 from degraded reefs is conservatively estimated at several hundred million dollars annually. As the Prime Minister has just pointed out to the House, this is a risk the Australian government understands very well, with the Great Barrier Reef, our own coral reef system, providing over $4.9 billion in tourism revenues and employment for around 60,000 people. The US report says: … choices made about emissions in the next few decades will have far-reaching consequences for climate change impacts. That is something that the Rudd government take very seriously, and so we are making positive choices: a commitment to a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, a commitment to an expanded renewable energy target and solar credits which will provide up to $7,750 for a 1.5 kilowatt system for solar panels in some sections of Australia-in others not quite so much. We have chosen the policy position which will grow clean energy jobs-some 26,000 jobs recently identified by the Climate Institute, based on projects that are planned and committed. That is 26,000 clean energy jobs. But what do we see from the opposition today? We see the serial behaviour of delay-a decision to delay the passage of the renewable energy target, no commitment to renewable energy or to Australia's solar industry. think it is extraordinary that the coalition cannot understand how important this is for Australian industry and for Australians. We have the potential to increase our renewable energy target some four times-solar energy, wind energy, wave energy-renewable energy of the future-and the coalition just have simply will not go anywhere near supporting it. Perhaps we should not be so surprised about this, because they refused to increase the renewable energy target when they were in government and they refused to take up the recommendations of their own review. I was wondering why this was the case and, of course, I came to the member for Flinders. The member for Flinders said in parliament in November 2005 that the renewable energy target: …was always intended as a start-up scheme to get renewable energy underway in Australia. … … … We set a target, we achieved it and now it is time for that industry to be able to produce and proceed on its own merits. So four years ago the coalition rolled out the ‘mission accomplished banner' on renewable energy. They said it was all over. They said they did not want to increase the renewable energy target and they were prepared to leave Australia's fledging renewable energy industry on its own. Today, they have dusted the ‘mission accomplished' banner. They have taken it out of the attic. They have pushed past the pink batts that the government is putting in the roofs of Australian homes to help them reduce their energy costs and their greenhouse gas emissions. The coalition have just confirmed again, with this serial behaviour, that they are not serious about climate change. It is all about delay. It is all about confusion. It is the same old coalition-walking away from renewable energy, I walking away from clean energy jobs that thousands of Australians are ready to embrace and walking away from the investment possibilities that this industry can bring forward to give some economic sustainability to our economy. It is time the Leader of the Opposition showed some leadership on this issue. Education",95
98,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the call today from the Australian Education Union for the school stimulus debacle to be reviewed to determine, amongst other things, if costs are being inflated. Now that the union movement, the opposition, school principals, governing council chairs, education and building experts and parents across Australia are highlighting waste and mismanagement in this program, will he go over the top of the Minister for Education and refer the school stimulus debacle to the Auditor-General?",97
99,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government, since its election, has been committed to the education revolution. The government, since the stimulus strategy of February this year, is committed to building the education revolution through the single largest school modernisation program that this country has ever seen. As a consequence of that, we are out there working with state and territory governments rolling out projects in 7,500 primary schools across the nation. We are rolling out refurbishment programs for classrooms and other facilities within schools across all of Australia's 10,000 primary and secondary schools, government and nongovernment. On top of that, we have provided investment for new language centres and new science centres for at least 500 or so of Australia's 2,500 secondary schools. This is because we believe that the kids of today, who will become the leaders of tomorrow, deserve first-class facilities in which to learn-state-of-the-art libraries, state-of-thePride art science centres and state-of-the-art language centres-and because we are interested in preparing our kids for the future. I notice that those opposite have a variable record on their degree of support for this program. I note in particular the levels of enthusiasm of various members representing the interests of their constituencies. I refer in particular to a recent communication by our good old friend the member for Macarthur to his constituents. I have here a little communication between Perhaps the Prime Minister did not hear the question. It was not about the support for infrastructure; it was about waste and mismanagement in government spending.",97
100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member will resume his seat.,97
101,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Here we have Pat-good to see you, mate!-who says in his local communication: I am working hard to ensure that more gets done for our community. Record levels of Australian Government funding are now going to our local schools, the literacy standards of our children have increased, as have the number of apprenticeships and there is significant Australian Government investment in our local hospitals … One thing about our colleagues opposite is that they are always on song! The member for Macarthur is reflecting the fact that all honourable members opposite-and also the members of the government-want to see this program being implemented on the ground. That is why, from the very beginning, the government issued these Building the Education Revolution guidelines. We have said from the beginning, when these guidelines were issued in February, that we would have proposals out there for projects under rounds 1 and 2 of the National School and rounds 1 and 2 of the Primary Schools for the 21st Century to provide to the Commonwealth and to the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations to assess the eligibility of each proposal against the guidelines. Furthermore, the approval process is that the Commonwealth assesses projects against the guidelines and then recommends funding, which should enable each project to commence. It then goes on to say the guidelines are clear about what projects are not to be funded. The guidelines include new iconic facilities, such as libraries, multipurpose halls, classrooms, upgrading facilities in primary schools, science laboratories and language learning centres. The ever-interjecting member for Sturt seems, on the one hand, to welcome funding for his schools yet, on the other hand, stands at the dispatch box and attacks that funding-not that there is any opportunism in that, but I will just leave his constituents to make that judgment. We also say-and this is in the guidelines: If a school considers that a proposed allocation funding under the BER program is not in accordance with the BER guidelines, the school may put its concerns in writing to the National BER Co-ordinator who may, where appropriate, after considering the objectives of the BER program and the BER guidelines, discuss the school's concerns with the relevant State/Territory or BGA for the purposes of ensuring that funding is allocated in accordance with the BER guidelines. The bottom line is this: when you are rolling out constructions at 7½ thousand schools across the country, there are always going to be disagreements on the ground about what should occur. That is natural; that is normal. As I said way back then, there are always going to be bumps in the road. But here we have got a clear statement in the guidelines that, if there are problems experienced by individual P&Cs and P&Fs, there is an appropriate point at which to lodge a concern and to have that concern heard. The Leader of the Opposition seems to have disappeared since he asked the question. Where is he? An honourable member-He is behind the Speaker's chair.",97

106,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am waiting to hear for which of those allocations to which of those schools in the member for Wentworth's electorate he believes he has a problem with the funding. I have not heard him issue a statement about which of those he has a problem with the funding for. I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition will in the debate on matters of public importance-it being Thursday-stand up and tell us for which of those schools he objects to the funding. What it goes to highlight is the fundamental double standards and opportunism of this entire debate. We have said from the outset that there would be funding for schools-government and non-government, primary and secondaryMr Hockey interjecting",98

108,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"to provide stimulus to the economy to support jobs, business and apprenticeships today while building the education infrastructure we need for tomorrow. That is the government's program-it is building the education revolution. When it comes to the individual appeal processes within it, they are amply described in the guidelines, which were put out when the program was first released in February and they should be deployed by any concerned P&Cs and P&Fs. Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table a press release from the Australian Education Union. Leave not granted. Renewable Energy",99
109,Ms JACKSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline to the House how developments in the Senate today on renewable energy legislation will impact on jobs and investment in the Australian economy?,99
110,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. In the middle of a global recession, one of the most important policy objectives any government can have is to deliver the maximum amount of certainty through clear-cut decisions that support jobs and that support business. That is why the government moved so quickly and decisively last year and again this year to put in place the bank guarantee and to put in place the stimulus-phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3. They have all been put in place to support business and to support employment in the face of this very savage global recession. We have been opposed in those measures every step of the way by those opposite. They have now taken this negative approach to a new level, with the delay in the legislation for the renewable energy target, which is in the Senate today. Katie Lahey from the Business Council of Australia made a point some time ago which I think goes to the very core of how bloody-minded and how irresponsible the opposition are when it comes to the basic economic facts that we are facing and what must be done to support our people. This is what Katie Lahey had to say: To drag on the debate whilst we have got this global financial crisis is just one more complexity that business has got to factor into its planning cycle, and for some businesses it could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. The point here is that this is very damaging for confidence in a very important sectorthe renewable energy sector. We do know, for example, that the Climate Institute has projected that there are $31 billion worth of clean energy projects underway or planned in response to the government's legislation. These projects do represent jobs, and you would have thought that those opposite could have supported such a positive measure. But yet again they have voted against assistance to households, to businesses and to community groups. They do not care about the flowon impact, for example, in terms of solar credit. Why have they got to this completely irresponsible position? Because they are so divided-so divided between the sceptics and the others who may be able to recognise the importance of climate change-that they cannot take a decision. So it is the disunity the coalition that is producing the delay and impacting on confidence. They cannot unify when the national interest demands it. It is a shame, because we have seen some more employment data today which indicates that stimulus is having a substantial impact on our economy. The retail employment figures, out today, are holding up much better than they are anywhere else in the world. Despite a very small decline in retail employment in recent months, today's figures show that there are 15,250 more Australians employed in the retail sector now than in November last year-a very, very good result in the circumstances. Let's just compare that to what is happening elsewhere in the world. In the US there are 308,000 fewer retail jobs than there were last November.",99
111,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In light of the fact that in 45 minutes there have been three opposition questions, I want to refer you to House of Representatives Practice, the fourth edition, page 540, as it deals more comprehensively with tedious repetition.",100

117,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In discussing the very point you have made, Sir, the final sentence says: It is considered nevertheless that the Chair has of sufficient authority to deal with irrelevance or tedious repetition in answers. In other words, ‘sit them down' has been the practice of the past.",100
118,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To assist the member for O'Connor by treating it as a point of order, I can indicate to him that there was no point of order. I can say to him, in the general sense, that, if he has concerns about the conduct of question time, I invite him to take that up with the Procedure Committee. But I indicate to him that, if matters about question time that are of concern are only to be dealt with by precedent and practice, I think we really have a problem about getting change in question time, because that would only be sustained by the person in the chair on the basis of the practice that they would like to put in place. As he is aware, early on in this parliament I sought the cooperation of the Procedure Committee in taking the inquiry about question time from the last parliament and moving it to a conclusion. They, as is their right, decided that they had other priorities. I simply say on the issues that he has raised that, whilst of course an individual occupant of the chair could make rulings and deal with these things, if they are to be done in a sustainable way for the future operation of this chamber, those issues are best addressed by changes to the standing orders.",100
119,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was making the point that there are 15,250 more Australians employed in the retail sector now than in November last year. Everyone on this side of the House thinks that is a pretty good outcome and that it is worth talking about-unlike those opposite, who do not have any real concern about the need to support employment in the Australian economy. I was comparing that outcome to the outcome in other advanced economies. In the US there are 308,000 fewer retail jobs than there were last November; in Canada, 37,000 fewer; in the UK, 32,000 fewer; and in New Zealand, 31,000 fewer. What that tells us is that we are doing very well compared to the rest of the world. When we look at the construction sector, we see that an additional 10,000 construction jobs have been added in the three months from February this year. Look at the comparable figures in terms of other countries. US construction sector has shed 290,000 jobs during that period. Canada has shed 30,000 construction jobs during that period. What these figures give us is further dence that our stimulus efforts are support employment, and that is why the behaviour of the coalition in this House and the behaviour of the coalition in the upper house is so reprehensible and irresponsiblebecause there has been an impact on confidence and there has been an impact on demand. It is supporting employment, and those outcomes are opposed every step of the way by those opposite. Building the Education Revolution Program",100
120,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his recent apparent interest in infrastructure in Sydney eastern suburbs schools. I also refer him to the Randwick primary school, which has had imposed on it a school hall built to the Rudd-Gillard template which is not suitable for the school's requirements. I further refer the Prime MinisWhat ter to the motion passed by the P&C at Randwick primary school on 15 June expressing its concern that the government is: … proceeding with the planning and construction of a building at the school without adequate consultation with the school community on the purpose, design and location of the building. Why won't the Prime Minister refer this bungled school stimulus debacle to the Auditor-General for an independent review?",101
121,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What stuns me about this entire line of argument from the opposition is where they stood on education performance in their 12 years in office, when one piece of data after the other demonstrated us falling down the OECD table of education performance. Early childhood education, for example, had the lowest-the wooden spoonThe performance across the OECD. Then there was the investment in government schools by those opposite: they had an appalling record over the 12 years in which they were in evioffice. Then there was the stripping out of helping to funds from our universities. What we have done in the period that we have been in office, led by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Education, is give effect to an education revolution by an investment in the quality of our schools and in the infrastructure that is available to them. I say to the honourable member as he cries crocodile tears about the investment of funds into schools in Sydney and elsewhere that he should refer to the guidelines and the provisions for handling things like this. Road Infrastructure",101
122,Mr RAGUSE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. Would the minister outline for the House the government's road investment program and how it compares to previous spending on roads by the Commonwealth? support is Infrastructure Australia receiving?",101
123,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Forde for his question. I look forward to being in his electorate once again in a couple of weeks time. The member for Forde has a great interest in infrastructure in his growing part of South-East Queensland. I am asked about road funding. The government is spending some $36 billion over six years on nation-building transport infrastructure, including $8.5 billion in new funding. This includes funding for long overdue road projects like the duplication of the Cooroy to Curra section of the Bruce Highway, the widening of the Ipswich Motorway, the Kempsey bypass and the construction of the Hunter Expressway. Indeed, we will spend $28 billion on roads over six years. This will deliver over 120 major projects, additional assistance for local roads, upgrades to thousands of dangerous black spots, safety measures at high-risk level crossings and additional rest stops for truckies. I was asked about how this compares to previous Commonwealth spending on roads. The Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics Transport Statistics Year Book 2009, which was released today, collates historic data on a range of transport infrastructure. It reveals that the average annual road spend during the Howard government's last six years was just $2.7 billion. contrast, our road spend over our first six years in office will be $4.7 billion a year. This equates to some $12.7 million every day for the next six years-and under economic circumstances that are far more challenging than the circumstances the mining boom created, with record revenues flowing into government coffers. They get a bit excited over there when we talk about infrastructure and our agenda. I was also asked by the member for Forde about the response to the Infrastructure Australia process that we have established. We know that those opposite did not support the IA process. We know that they have been critical the whole way through; we know that they opposed and voted against the Nation Building and Jobs Plan; we know that they voted against the nation-building legislation; we know that they voted against the $42 billion economic stimulus plan in February; and we know that they have been critical of the $4.7 billion plan of last December. But when I looked at what they were doing around the country, I was staggered, frankly. They say that imitation is the highest form of flattery. There was a press release by the New South Wales opposition leader Barry O'Farrell. He has announced that the Liberals and Nationals in New South Wales: … will create Infrastructure NSW to improve the identification, prioritisation and delivery of critical public infrastructure … That is pretty interesting. The press release says: Infrastructure NSW will: - Identify public infrastructure needs; - Establish priorities and recommend timelines for delivery; Sound familiar? It goes on: - Advise on project procurement, contractual arrangements, best practice, delivery and funding modes; … In They advise that it will support private funding for infrastructure. Later on in the press release-and wait for this-they advise: Infrastructure NSW is built on the successful Infrastructure Australia, Partnerships UK and Partnerships Victoria models. That is what they are saying in New South Wales, the home state of the member for Wentworth. People who look at what Infrastructure Australia has done with any objectivity whatsoever have to support the process that this government has established. Their opportunism in opposing all of these measures is highlighted by Barry O'Farrell and the New South Wales Liberal-National announcement today. We know that the coalition party room is a mess here. I wonder whether there was any consultation whatsoever before this announcement was made. But I guess we will not find out, because I am still waiting to receive a question from the shadow minister for infrastructure about any of the measures that we have undertaken. Building the Education Revolution Program  Minister to the comments of the principal of the Berwick Lodge Primary School in the Australian today, which said that schools ‘are being harassed into signing off on templates they didn't want'. It also said the guidelines for the school stimulus debacle ‘explicitly state that the Commonwealth reserves the right to refuse funding to a participant who releases information publicly', accuses ‘state bureaucrats in being complicit in the siphoning off of vast sums from government schools' and says that state bureaucrats have ‘accepted templates with only the flimsiest of building details and a total absence of costing valuations'. Why won't the Prime Minister step in and refer the school stimulus debacle to the Auditor General? Mr Randall interjecting",101
124,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I always enjoy the interjections by the member for Canning, who made a personal explanation recently and said he supported government borrowing in order to provide investment in schools in his electorate. Today he has a different tune, but, then again, opportunism is writ large on the faces of those opposite. As I said in response to the first question from the Leader of the Opposition, the Building the Education Revolution guidelines contain a specific provision that P&Cs or parent bodies who consider that a proposed allocation of funding under the BER program is not in accordance with the guidelines should write to the national BER coordinator, who may, where appropriate, after considering the objectives of the BER program and guidelines, discuss the school's concerns with the relevant state and territory or block grant authority. That was outlined in the guidelines to begin with, and I would say to any P&C and any P&F out there across the country: in the implementation of a program which goes to 7½ thousand primary schools across the nation, as we said from the beginning, inevitably you are going to have discussions and disagreements at the local level about what is wanted. That is normal; that is natural; that is why we have had so many representations, I think, from members on that side of the House and members here about finessing details on the ground. That is normal and natural. That is why the guidelines contain an explicit provision, which they do, about an opportunity for P&Cs and P&Fs to reflect those views to the national BER coordinator-and I invite them all to do so. I am very pleased that the member for Sturt has asked this question as well, because I would like him to also begin to reflect on which of these allocations he would find unacceptable in the electorate of Sturt. Burnside Primary School, which I understand he attended, was $2½ million. Campbelltown Primary School at Paradise of order. The Prime Minister has invited me to answer his question; I am happy to do so. Is he suggesting that every dollar be spent only in Labor electorates?",103

126,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In this debate about the allocation of funding, I would draw your attention to the stark contrast with the Auditor General's report in relation to the regional programMr Albanese-Regional rorts.",103
127,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"the regional rorts program under the previous government, which indicated an excessive concentration of resources in particular seats held by a particular party, namely the National Party. Ten seats represented what proportion of the overall allocation? Mr Albanese-Half.",104
128,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Half of the overall allocation. What we have said from the outset is that we are out there to support the economy as a whole and the education system as a whole, government electorates and nongovernment electorates, government schools and non-government schools. The objective of the exercise is to provide employment opportunities for tradies, for sparkies, for local people and small business, and for others who are contributing to the construction industry in the country, as opposed to sitting on our hands and doing nothing. Again I go back to the member for Sturt, who is obviously very sensitive about the investments which are being made in his electorate. I look forward to his subsequent statement about which of these-I presume he can speak in the MPI debate-he objects to: Burnside Primary School classroom redevelopment, half a million dollars; Campbelltown Primary School classroom refurbishment, $600,000; Campbelltown Primary School library new construction, $1.4 million; East Marden Primary School new construction, $2½ million; East Torrens Primary School library new construction, $1.7 million; East Torrens Primary School classroom refurbishment, $300,000; Gilles Plains Primary School hall new construction, $2 million; Heritage College",104

130,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Solomon is warned! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition on a point of order? Ms Julie Bishop-The Prime Minister was asked why he will not refer this debacle to the Auditor-General. He has still not answered why he will not refer it. That is the question he has been asked time and time again.,104
131,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,104
132,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Plainly those opposite are embarrassed at the recitation of the funding allocations to the individual schools within their electorates. That is why every parliamentary device will be used by those opposite. They stand up and try to interrupt a clear description of what investments are proposed for individual schools within their area. To go back to the member for Sturt's electorate: Heritage College at Oakden, $2 million for the construction of a multipurpose hall with student amenities; Highbury Primary School library new construction, $1.6 million; Highbury Primary School hall refurbishment, $1.4 million; Hillcrest Primary School, $850,000; Klemzig Primary School, $2 million. I have only just got up to K; it goes all the way to Z. I say to the honourable member for Sturt, therefore, that, when he is seeking at the dispatch box to launch a negative attack on this overall program, he has simultaneously a moral responsibility in this place to make it clear to each of those school communities which of the allocations to them he objects to. I would invite each member who would rise in this place to do the same because at the end of the day you cannot walk two sides of the street here. I also say to the honourable member who has asked the question that the other rationale for what we have done through the school modernisation program is this: how do you boost also small business and jobs? I draw the honourable member's attention to today's Sensis survey that shows that confidence among small and medium sized businesses recorded the biggest increase on record in the three months to May. I was challenged earlier on about whether the government would be saying something positive about the economy. I note there is conspicuous silence on the part of those opposite. This, of course, comes on the back of the biggest increase in consumer confidence in 22 years. The survey states: Again this quarter the Federal Government's economic stimulus packages provided the main reason that SMEs",104
133,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition can resume her seat. I suggest to the Prime Minister that he relate his material to the question and ignore invitations made by way of argument in a point of order.,105
134,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Building the Education Revolution program, which I have been asked a question about, goes to the implementation on the ground of this project to boost education performance in Australia and the underlying rationale, which is to provide also stimulus to the economy in the midst of the worse global recession in 75 years. Sensis says: The main reason that SMEs gave for supporting the Federal Government was the economic stimulus plan. That includes, of course, infrastructure development. Whether it is on the infrastructure side, employment side, the job side or the Building the Education Revolution side, the government is proud of this program. Of course, as I said before in answer to earlier questions, there will always be discussions and disagreements on the ground about what priorities should be attached. That is normal. That is why the guidelines made explicit a provision for local P&Cs to register their concerns. I urge each and every one of them to do that so that any individual matters which need to be attended to can be attended to through the processes we outlined from the outset.  ble the letter from Henry Grossek, the Principal of Berwick Lodge Primary School: ‘Schools' pride felled by bullying bureaucrats'.",105

136,Mr DANBY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. What is the government's strategy for lifting Australia's long-term productivity performance? Why is it vital that the government's initiatives are supported?,105
137,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. It is understandable that contemporary economic debate is very heavily focused on the global recession and the various initiatives the government has taken to deal with the consequences flowing from that-in particular the stimulus packages, the guarantees of bank activity, and things of that nature. I want to emphasise today that the government is resolutely and relentlessly focused on the longer term horizons for the future prosperity of the Australian economy. In this context there is the one paramount objective, a single word that underlines everything that the government is seeking to do: productivity. Productivity is at the heart of the Rudd government's agenda for the long-term future of the Australian economy. Australia did pretty well on productivity throughout the 1990s as a result of many reforms that were put in place, mostly during the 1980s and in some cases early 1990s. Deregulation of the financial system, major reform of tariff protection, investment in education and research and development, export diversification, enterprise bargaining-a whole range of reforms were put in place and the Australian economy reaped the benefits. Over the five years to 1998-99, productivity grew on average by 3.3 per cent; in the subsequent five years to 2003-04 that average dropped to 2.2 per cent; and in the four years beyond that to 2007-08 that productivity growth average dropped to 1.1 per cent. While the government are focused on sustaining jobs in the short term, all of our critical economic initiatives have been focused also on developing productivity growth into the medium and longer term. I refer to the broadband network proposal; greater investment in universities; reform of research and development allowances; investment in road, rail and port infrastructure-things such as the Hunter Expressway, the Oakajee Port project and regional rail in Victoria. All of these things will have a huge positive impact on productivity into the future for the Australian economy. We march towards a seamless national economy through regulatory reform, harmonisation of state based regulation and, of course, greater efficiency in government spending and government programs-these are all part of the total picture. Yesterday I raised a leaflet that the Liberal Party put out about their economic position. I have to confess that I had cause to return to that leaflet this morning.",105
138,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,106
139,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know that some of my colleagues are questioning my choice of leisure activities, but I could not resist-the temptation overcame me. The interesting thing is that I pointed out yesterday that there is no mention of the global recession in this leaflet that is a statement of the Liberal Party economic position, and after having a look at it again today I discovered that there is also not a single reference to productivity, no reference whatsoever to the long-term holy grail of economic reform in the Australian economy and not a single reference to what is the greatest challenge for the Australian economy: improving productivity. The pattern is the same: born-to-rule complacency that characterised their nearly 12 years in office that is now manifested by endless point scoring, opportunistic sniping and talking down the Australian economy as a substitute for genuine economic policy. In particular it is manifested by relentless attacks and opposition to the key reforms and key investments the government is putting in place to boost productivity in the Australian economy in the long term. Attacking the broadband network proposal, opposing investment in infrastructure, sniping at the school investments-all of these things are characteristic of the opportunism of the Liberal Party. I note this morning that, in addition to not putting up any savings measures themselves, as well as opposing the government's savings measures, the opposition regard past inefficiencies in government as totally trivial matters. There was the Sea Sprite fiasco that occurred on their watch, where $1.4 billion of federal government money went west. I note that the Leader of the Opposition, in an interview on AM this morning-and I have the transcript with me-said that this fiasco, this $1.4 billion, was ‘a distraction' and ‘a complete diversion'. That was his summary of one of the most embarrassing cases of government waste in the history of the Commonwealth that occurred while he and his government were in office. Even in areas where the opposition claim to support the government, they do not know what is going on. Two initiatives in the opposition leader's budget reply speech were that he would have a one-stop portal for filings by business and that he would have a standardised procurement contract for people purchasing from the government. There is one slight problem with these two initiatives: both of them are already occurring. They were so slipshod and complacent that they did not even know that these initiatives are already underway under the Rudd government's reform agenda. It is understandable that everybody in economic debate is focused on the global financial crisis and the short-term threat that is posed to the Australian economy by the global recession. We have a big challenge facing us in this country, because once we get through that short-term challenge there is the longer term challenge of productivity.

He said this to Julia Gillard: ‘Minister, you resolved this matter for Berwick Lodge Primary recently, which I was very pleased about.'

177,Mr CHAMPION,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women. How is the government's stimulus to the housing sector supporting jobs in our economy?,110
178,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. Despite the worse global recession in 75 years, we are weathering the storm here in Australia better than most other countries, and that is because of the action the government have taken through our Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan. Last week I visited the northern suburbs of Adelaide with the member for Wakefield to see first hand some work in Elizabeth Grove. We met with Don Belperio, the owner of Lodge Construction, who has won a contract for nine major renovations. Work will start soon in the same area on building 30 new houses in the first stage of constructing new public housing. Mr Belperio told me: Building work has picked up since the stimulus money. It was slacking off earlier in the year. I have had to put on more subcontractorselectricians, plasterers, concreters, iron workers, floor covering specialists, gyprockers and labourdevelopment ers. He told me that many of those jobs were for people who come from the local Elizabeth area, very important in generating local employment. That is not just happening in Elizabeth. It is not just happening in Adelaide. It is happening right across the country. In Bega last week, with the member for Eden-Monaro, I met a local builder who was putting on extra contractors to put new kitchens into old public housing dwellings. Those new kitchens had been made by another small business just down the road in Eden. In south-east Melbourne, with the member Housing for Isaacs, I met a local builder who said, ‘The government initiatives are really keeping my industry buoyant.' In Sydney's inner west, with the member for Lowe, I met tradies who said that they were busier than ever repairing a house that will be retained as public housing for the long term, a beautiful older house in an older neighbourhood-a perfect home for a needy family. The government's stimulus package is having an impact beyond these direct jobs: the repairs, maintenance and the new building. When I was visiting the member for Port Adelaide's electorate, I visited Mawson Lakes, which is a very nice development. It is a well-planned community with a very good range of properties, including properties at the modest end suitable for first-home buyers. It is close to public transport. It is well planned. I met there one of the developers who is working in that area, a woman called Fairlie Delbridge, who is the managing director of her own company, Delcooke Property Group, which is building 20 units in that Mawson Lakes development. She said to me: I had made a large investment in getting this development going. At the preliminary stage of the I had only nine presales. Then the global financial crisis hit and I couldn't get funding. Banks stopped lending. By the time the stimulus package was announced, I had 12 presales but the project still wasn't bankable. When Housing South Australia purchased five units, it absolutely got my development over the line. With 17 presales it made the project eminently bankable. It green-lighted my whole project. Ms Delbridge credits the nation-building economic stimulus package with making her project feasible and she told me she expects to have about 50 tradies on site for between eight and 12 months. Those jobs happened because of our investment and our cooperation with the South Australian governmentthe whole project green-lighted, with 50 jobs for between eight and 12 months. Those 50 jobs would not have happened without this investment. Mawson Lakes shows that our investment in the stimulus package has kept this sector ticking over at a time when otherwise we would have seen a crash in this area. We have got plans for nation building for recovery. We have got plans for returning the budget to surplus. We now have the fastest economic growth in the world, the lowest deficit and the lowest debt of major advanced economies in the world. It would be absolutely terrific if the opposition acknowledged the strengths of the Australian economy at this difficult time instead of trashing our reputation and trashing confidence with their relentless negativity.

Senate's requested amendment(1) Page 3 (after line 2), at the end of the bill, add: 7 Public Register of Government Borrowings (1) The Australian Office of Financial Management must establish and update each month a register to be known as the Public Register of Government Borrowings. (2) The register is to be maintained by electronic means. (3) The register is to be made available for inspection on the Australian Office of Financial Management's website. (4) The register must be in a form prescribed by the regulations and must record the beneficial ownership, by country, of: (a) all securities on issue by the Commonwealth of Australia; and (b) any Commonwealth of Australia guaranteed issuance by any Australian State or Territory. (5) As soon as practicable after the end of each quarter the Australian Office of Financial Management must publish on its website the register containing the details that were current as at the the quarter. (6) The Australian Office of Financial Management must include in the register each quarter a statement of the Office's opinion as to the domicile of the beneficial owner of securities if nominal ownership is registered in a country other than the actual domicile of the beneficial owner. (7) In this section: quarter means a period of 3 months beginning on 1 January, 1 April, 1 July or 1 October. 8 Regulations The Governor General may make regulations prescribing matters: (a) required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed; or (b) necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act.",114
224,Mr SWAN,TERRITORY BORROWING,"I move: That the amendment be agreed to. As members are aware, the Senate earlier today passed the Guarantee of State and Territory Borrowing Appropriation Bill 2009. This is an important bill to support critical infrastructure investment by state and territory governments and to support Australian jobs. The market for state and territory bonds has been affected by the turmoil in global markets, and liquidity in semi-government bond markets has been severely constricted. This has threatened the capacity of state and territory governments to deliver critical infrastructure projects that will support jobs in the face of a global recession. This bill will ensure that states and territories can continue to access financial markets so as to undertake this critical investment. It is disappointing the shadow Treasurer has preferred to pursue his own base political interests on such a critical piece of legislaend of tion. He well knows that the government currently maintains a register of all bondholders. These are the same arrangements that have been in place under previous governments. Further, the Australian Bureau of Statistics currently publishes information on the proportion of government securities held by overseas investors, and this proportion of bonds remains roughly the same from when those opposite were last in office. Bond purchases are made through market intermediaries, so it is not possible to vestors directly. There is also an active secondary market for bonds, which means that the holders of those bonds can change at any given time. As a result, the Treasury has advised that it will not be possible to publish the additional information and have any confidence it would provide an accurate reflection on the beneficial owners of Australian securities. Treasury also advises that the creation of an additional registry could result in reduced demand for government securities, so the opposition's amendment will also impose additional costs on the taxpayer for information that would distort rather than provide additional clarity. This legislation and the infrastructure it will support are too important to be playing politics with, so we are supporting the bill as amended by the Senate. As I indicated during question time, we will explore what can be done to provide the information in an accountable way. I do believe those opposite should stop playing politics with Australian jobs and get behind the government's efforts to support critical infrastructure investment. Question agreed to. NA Small Business",115
225,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Moncrieff proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to support tralian small business. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in identify final in their places",116
226,Mr CIOBO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Deputy Speaker, it is great to have the opportunity to raise the plight of Australia's 2.4 million small businesses that employ around 3.8 million Australians, because if there is a group of Australians who are doing it particularly tough in these economic times it is the small business sector. We know that the small business sector is, as many people have stated, the engine room of the Australian economy. These things become often quoted because they are so profoundly true. As I have been moving around Australia, working with so many members on the coalition side, talking with local small businesses, participating in the Jobs for Australia forum, I have been hearing a number of messages very loud and clear from those people who put their houses on the line, who take a risk in respect of their income and who take the chance to succeed in small business and also to risk the failure of small business. The message I have received, and I know other people on this side of the chamber have received it too, is that this Labor government does not understand small business; it does not understand what motivates small business. And most importantly, and most distressingly, the Australian Labor Party is a party that questions the motives of small business. That is what concerns us so fundamentally. I just noticed then that the minister who is charged with the responsibility of looking after small business, the member for Rankin, Auswas looking puzzled and curious when I said that the Labor Party questions the motives of small business owners. This is the minister who on radio said that the reason that small businesses should have to comply with unfair dismissal is because the owner might come in one day in a bad mood and fire a good staff member. That is what the minister said; that is the reason why the Australian Labor Party is lumbering the small business sector with compliance through the fair dismissal code. But it is not only in this area that the tralian Labor Party has such poor form. It has been a long standing principle that the Australian Labor Party has not pretended to be a party of small business. In fact, those words were said by a former leader of the Australian Labor Party, the former member for Brand, Kim Beazley. He said that the Australian Labor Party is not a party for small ness and has never pretended to be. Not a lot has changed, except that these days those opposite run around trying to pretend to be a party of small business. That is about all that has changed when it comes to small business policy by the Australian Labor Party. But when we look at what the Australian Labor Party has actually done for small business, when we look at what the minister at the table and the Prime Minister have actually done for small business, I can say that the answer is not very much at all. And that is the reason why the MPI is up for debate today. There are a number of issues that have been on the policy radar for some time, a number of issues that I and members of the coalition have been agitating for and pleading with the Labor Party to take advice on, to listen to small business and to act in accordance with what small business needs to promote their interests. There are two very important issues. The first of these is the modern awards process. Under the modern awards process the Australian Labor Party is putting at direct risk thousands of small businesses, their viability and their profits. Most concerning of all, by putting the viability of these small businesses at risk, they are threatening tens of thousands of jobs. The Australian Labor Party likes to make out that it is the friend of the workers. How many times have we seen the Prime Minister and others say, ‘We're about working people'? Well there are a lot fewer of them these days, that's for sure! And the Australian Labor Party's policy with respect Austo modern awards is only going to make the problem so much worse. I have made it part of my focus and part of the coalition's policy commitment to make sure that small business has a voice in this parliament, to make sure that the coalition stands up for the rights of small business owners and for the fact that they are willing busi- to employ around 3.8 million Australians. When I talk to small business owners about the modern awards process that the Australian Labor Party is ramming down the throats of small business owners, they make it very clear what the actual impact will be on their businesses. Take, for example, the owner of South Bank Beach News and Souvenirs, Tony Philbrick. He wrote some time ago to the Prime Minister. He outlined to the Prime Minister the impact of Labor's proposed modern awards on his business. He said: Based on information we have received, we calculate that the Modern Award (to come into effect 1st January, 2010) will force a 14% increase to our weekly wage bill. To protect our family business we will have to reduce expenses to continue to remain cash flow positive. Do you know how they intend to reduce expenses? Like so many newsagents in this country, they will reduce expenses by cutting staff. He said: Due to the specific treatment the proposed Modern Award applies to dramatically increasing weekend penalty rates, the first expenseand the minister should listen closelywe will have to consider is reducing the wages of our weekend staff. There is the concrete evidence from someone in the Prime Minister's electorate about the impact. Lance Barrett, from the Coolum Village News and Casket Agency, also wrote to the Prime Minister, and he said: Dear Prime Minister, You might recall late last year whilst attending a function at the Hyatt Regency Coolum, that you came into my beachside shop one Sunday afternoon and chatted with my staff, a delightful 17 year old girl named Emma. Emma, this year her School Captain, is working weekends in order to fund a future university education. I have to say, Mr Deputy Speaker, she is the kind of girl who is willing to roll her sleeves up and work for her future. What does Lance Barrett say about Labor's modern award process and the impact on his small business? In his letter, he said: However, with the prospect of wage increases and penalty rate hikes amounting to around 30% of my gross wages, I have no alternative other than to drastically cut back on casual staff hours. week I have had to tell Emma, and also Melissa, Michelle, Shannen, Georgia and Jess that unless the government of the country sees common sense, their casual hours with us will cease to exist, my shops will be closed every Sunday, and their chance of a good financial footing when they leave school or university will have evaporated. That is another example of the feedback that this side of the House not only receives but, in contrast to the government, listens to with respect to the modern awards process. There are so many letters. The member for Canning, Don Randall, who I know stands up for those members in his electorate, received a letter from Lynda Jacobs from the Kelmscott IGA. She said: The Federal Government has spent the last eighteen months working towards reforming Workplace Relation laws, which include the introduction of a new General Retail Industry Award. If this Award becomes operative it will have a serious damaging effect on our business. We provide an important service to our local community but we may be unable to do that in the future if we are required to pay these large increases. … … … As concerned employers, we do not want to reduce staff, but we fear that this may be one of the inevitable consequences of the introduction of this new Award. Andrew Laming, the member for Bowman, received a letter from Toscani's talking about the impact that would see his labour costs increase by some 20 per cent. The owner said: This additional cost will make my business marginal. In particular Sunday trading (which will incur in the new arrangements a 175% penalty) will not be viable and I will have to look at applying a penalty or closing in Sunday. The member for MCEwen received a letter from KoalaCountry telling the same storyincreased costs, reduced employment. The member for Macarthur received a letter from This the Outback Steakhouse again stating that there will be increased costs and reduced employment. The member for Forrest, Nola Marino, received a letter from Busselton Fresh IGA stating that there will be increased costs and reduced employment. River Fresh IGA stated the same story. The member for Dickson received the same story from a small business owner of seven years. In every single example, we see a message that Labor just does not get. Labor just does not understand small business. It does not understand that there is a link between the costs of operating a business and the employment opportunities that they provide to their staff and to the profitability of that business. I have news for the Australian Labor Party: not every small business owner is rolling in cash; the vast bulk of them basically live from week to week earning a meagre salary. I tell the members of the Labor Party that they do it by putting their family's future on the line and by putting their homes on the line, and they deserve the support of a government that is willing to stand up for small business-not to increase their costs, not to reduce employment opportunities for young Australians but a serious ‘ridgy-didge' government, to use the Prime Minister's language. They deserve a government that is willing to actually do something to help small business. That is what we need and that is part of the reason this side of politics condemns the Australian Labor Party for its exceptionally lacklustre performance in supporting Australia's small businesses. In addition, we have another example of where the Australian Labor Party has been particularly impotent in helping small business. When you look at the franchising sector, you have to wonder what the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, who is at the table, has been doing. There are about 1,100 business format franchise systems that operate in Australia. The total sales turnover of this sector of the economy is about $61 billion as at 2007. There are around 413,500 people that are employed in franchises through Australia. I know, through working closely with people like the member for Gilmore, the member for Canning, the member for Swan and the member for Hinkler-they are just a few people on this side of the House who are committed to franchisees-that they have been concerned about a couple of aspects that are causing great distress to a number of franchisees. On 24 October 2007, the minister at the table said: Good faith bargaining was rejected by the CoaliGive tion but we are embracing it. He highlighted it as part of his comments then that the Labor Party policy would be to enact a good faith bargaining principle in the franchise code. On the 23 May 2008, the Small Business Ministerial Council communiqué highlighted that the Australian government will: … consistent with its pre-election commitment, consider the introduction of a well defined obligation for parties to bargain and negotiate in “good faith” as part of the franchising code of conduct. So there are hundreds of thousands of people out there who have spoken with me and other members on this side of the chamber and who were waiting for the Australian Labor Party to introduce its good faith bargaining proposition. This is a principle that those on this side of the House support as well, contrary to the assertions by the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy. We waited for the Australian Labor Party to carry through with its pre-election promise, and nothing happened. Nothing occurred and we were left waiting. So when I saw the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Financial Services move to have an inquiry into the Franchising Code of Conduct and related matters on 25 June last year, I thought, ‘This will be the opportunity-this will be the excuse the minister will be using as to why he has not acted for so long, and maybe this will be the reason that something will happen.' The committee provided its report on 1 December last year. On 26 February, some three months later, we still had not heard anything. I was still waiting. People were calling me and saying: ‘What's going on? You're the shadow minister. You must know what the minister for small business is up to. us some direction.' I kept saying, ‘It has been three months. I am sure that at some stage the government will respond.' After all, by this stage it had been 18 months since the Australian Labor Party was elected and you would have thought that they would have had the opportunity to implement the policy by then, but no-there was still nothing. So I put a question in writing to the minister. The minister said in his response to me that the government was ‘considering the report' and would ‘respond in due course'. I put the question in on 26 February and received a response on 4 June, and, interestingly, on 31 May-just four days beforethe minister, out of nowhere, issued a press release where he said, ‘We will consult on franchise reforms.' So that was the big announcement! That was the only big announcement that we have had about franchising after 20 months of the Australian Labor Party. That is the full extent of this minister's response to franchising-to put out one lousy press release. I plead on behalf of all of those people in the franchising sector for this minister and this government to start doing something. Eleven recommendations came from the committee, and I put it to the minister that, in the main, all 11 recommendations are relatively non-controversial. This minister and this government need to act. Stop stallingpeople's lives are potentially being destroyed as a result of this government's inaction, and it is time that they did something. Small business in this country will lead us out of this recession. It will lead Australia's economic revival. But it needs a government that is focused on making it easier for it to do that. The worse thing that this government can do is to continue putting up the costs of small business, thereby driving up unemployment as small businesses are forced to pay higher costs and reduce their employment. It is time that the minister and this government stopped sitting on their hands and actually did something to help small business. (Time expired)",116
227,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (4.10 pm)-On occasion, the member for Moncrieff, the shadow minister for small business, has delivered a passable speech in this parliament, but I thought that was a particularly dusty effort. He obviously had a good time at the midwinter ball last night and is just not firing today. But he made a number of points on an MPI which is about the government's support for small business, and I would just like to take members in the chamber through a couple of statements that he made in his contribution. The member for Moncrieff said that there are far fewer working people these days. Let us understand what is going on here: this is part of a coordinated effort by coalition members to talk the economy down-to pretend to present to the Australian people that the total number of employed people in this country has fallen in the last few months. These are the sorts of claims that have been made by the shadow Treasurer, who at one point claimed that employment had fallen by 80,000 people. Indeed, it was one of these auctions where the shadow finance minister, Senator Coonan, on Sky News Sunday Agenda on 3 May said: What have we seen, in fact 154,000 jobs lost just since October. Yet again we have got the shadow Treasurer, the shadow finance minister and now the shadow small business minister all asserting that jobs have been lost since last year. Let us have a look at some of the facts. Between October last year and May this year, the total number of people employed has fallen by 24,000, not by 80,000 as claimed by the shadow Treasurer and not by 154,000 as claimed by the shadow finance minister. I ask members in the parliament to imagine what the total number of jobs lost-the reduction in employment-is in the 12 months to May of this year. I suppose that people, if they were listening to the coalition, would say, ‘Well, it might be 20,000 less or 30,000 less or 40,000 less.' In truth, in that period-in the last year-total employment has grown by 35,000. There is employment growth in this country. From the change of government in November 2007 until the latest figures, which became available in May, the total number of employed people has risen by 145,000. If you were listening to the coalition, you would never pick that, would you? They are always talking the economy down. I have been asked for evidence of the coalition talking the economy down. There is no clearer evidence of the coalition knowing the truth-the figures are produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics-than the shadow finance minister, the shadow Treasurer and now the shadow small business minister all asserting that there has been a big reduction in employment in this country. There is no more irresponsible way of talking the economy down than coalition MPs coming to this place and trying to tell people that they are going to lose their jobs because there has been a big reduction in employment in this country. The coalition would rather see the people of Australia fail than see the government succeed-that is the problem. The only jobs that they are concerned about are the jobs of 30 coalition frontbenchers. I understand that the composition of the front bench is going to change fairly soon, because I remember the deputy leader of the Liberal Party saying, only a few days ago, that the problem with the Labor PartyMr Laming- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The minister has circumnavigated the globe of relevance. Can I ask the minister to come back to the MPI.",120
228,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,There is no point of order.,121
229,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I remember the deputy leader of the Liberal Party saying, ‘The problem with this reshuffle is that there's not enough women on the front bench.' Mr Laming- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on the same point of order: relevance.",121
230,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,There is no point of order.,121
231,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, can I put it to you that, if he gets up again with that same point of order, you deal with him.",121
232,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, you cannot put it to me.",121
233,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The fact is the deputy leader of the Liberal Party was saying: ‘There's not enough women in the Labor front-bench, not enough women in the Labor cabinet.' There are more women in the Labor cabinet than there are in the shadow cabinet. I can see the member for Moncrieff is sweating already because the deputy leader of the Liberal Party is saying, ‘In the reshuffle, a couple of the blokes have got to go.' Member for Moncrieff, if you keep misrepresenting the situation about employment in this country, you ought to be the first to go. Here are some of the real facts about employment in this country. This is a great day on which to be debating this issue of small businesses because there are now 15,250 more Australians employed in the retail sector than there were in November of last year. Why would that be? Could that be related to the stimulus package-the stimulus package that they regard as a low-quality spend, a waste of money? I do not think it is a waste of money to have 15,250 more people employed in the retail sector than there were in November last year when there are 308,000 fewer people employed in retail in the United States, 37,000 fewer in Canada, 32,000 fewer in the UK and 31,000 fewer in New Zealand. It is the direct result of the stimulus package. I will just show my colleagues-because I know the member opposite will not be interested in this-the economic growth in our country in the March quarter. Here is the chart showing economic growth in this country in the March quarter-it is positive. We are right up there in the right-hand corner. Good on Poland and good on Australia-we are the only two countries in the OECD that have positive economic growth. If we go to chart 8, we see the same thing on retail sales, the very point I was making. Look at the retail sales figures there, I the shadow minister. Australia, in the orange box, is up there, growing, growing and growing-and in the United States, negative; Canada, negative; Japan, negative; New Zealand, negative; and, the euro area, negative. So we have growing retail sales in this country. You know what has been going on despite the dishonest scare campaign of the coalition? What has been going on in the last couple of weeks is a lift in consumer confidence and a lift in business confidence, including a lift small business confidence. I reckon that the reason for that lift in small business confidence is that small business know that on our side we are sticking up for them, on our side we are supporting small business with our small business tax break, with our stimulus package-70 per cent of which is investment in nation-building infrastructure-and with the biggest school modernisation program in Australia's history. Less than a year from now there will be 35,000 construction sites. Who is going to be working on the construction sites? The tradies, the carpenters, the plumbers and the electricians. They are supposed to be, as far as members opposite are concerned, the core constituency of the coalition. We are supporting them and the coalition is doing nothing to support themworse than that, they are talking the economy down, trying to smash consumer confidence and small business confidence. Why? For their own miserable gain. They only want gain for themselves, for those 30 jobs on the front bench-not the hundreds of thousands of jobs that are being preserved and protected by this government. Treasury estimates show that 210,000 Australians are in jobs now because of the stimulus package, because of the investment allowance and because of the nation-building infrastructure. I think that is great news, and say to do you know what? So do small business. Surveys have been released just today, such as the ACCI-Westpac survey of industrial trends, which says that general business confidence has seen its largest improvement since 1975. Could that be right? I know that the coalition gets that survey-why didn't the member for Moncrieff mention it? Why aren't you there talking the economy up instead of talking the economy down? The answer is: it does not suit you to talk the in economy up. It does not suit you to join this government in supporting small business and small business confidence. Another major survey was released today specifically related to small and medium enterprises, and do you know what it shows? The strongest quarterly increase in the survey's 16-year history. They are good results. They are great results. Go the small business community of Australia! We are sticking up for the small business community of Australia. This Sensis survey is interesting because it is about smalland medium-sized businesses. Small businesses were also reported as being more confident than medium businesses for the first time since November 2000. So the small and medium businesses are especially confident.",121
234,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,122
235,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The small ones. Why do you reckon they are so confident? Because of the support. It is the support of this government that is engendering confidence in that very important part of the community-the 1.9 million small businesses employing almost four million working Australians. Ms Christina Singh, who is responsible for the Sensis survey, said: The latest data suggests Australia's economic environment is starting to rebound, with businesses expecting their operations to perform nificantly better in the next 12 months. So there you go-confidence on the rise. Consumer sentiment figures were released just a few days ago. What do they show about consumer sentiment? The second largest recorded increase in the last 22 years. So things are on the up. We do have a long way to go. We do need to work in partnership with the small business community, and we will continue to work in partnership with the small business community. The member for Moncrieff raised in his contribution the issue of modern awards, as if to suggest that all these cost increases that are being claimed have already occurred or that they are inevitably going to occur. He knows and the shadow minister for industrial relations knows that the award modernisation process is a very necessary reform in this country that has been called for for decades by employer groups, large and small. They want to reduce the compliance costs of around 1,600 individual state based, industry based and even business based awards and have only 18 modern awards. He has raised issues about two or three of them. You heard the Deputy Prime Minister talk about what we have done in relation to the restaurant and catering industry, where we have in fact asked the Industrial Relations Commission to have a further look at that. We are in dialogue with others who are affected by the modern awards system. It is a reform to reduce compliance costs, and what do we get? Opposition from the coalition to the award modernisation process. I remember the then Minister for Industrial Relations coming into this place and saying, ‘Shearers under this award have to be provided with tapioca pudding'-criticising but never doing anything. That is the problem. The shadow minister for small business for one year and one month has not been able sigto get a question up through the tactics committee, which is chaired by the member for O'Connor. I saw the member for O'Connor walking around today with a document, which was obviously tacticsMr Ciobo- Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I rise on a point of order. I am loath to stand up, but the minister knows that that is completely untrue. He means ‘a question to him', and I am not interested in asking him a question.",122
236,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Moncrieff will resume his seat. The minister has the call.,123
237,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The tactics will not allow you to ask a question of me, because you are afraid of the answer and afraid of the truth, which is what I would give to you: the truth, so that we cut through this rubbish, this recklessness and this opportunism of the coalition, which is seeking to talk the economy down at every opportunity and seeking to misrepresent the employment figures for this country. They entered into this debate on a day in which business surveys are revealing good and encouraging news. What did they do? They came in here and complained, saying, ‘It's really bad; you're not doing enough for small business.' If you had supported the stimulus package, you might have at least a little bit of an argument. You could say, ‘We could do a bit more.' But no, you opposed the stimulus package and you opposed the investment in nation-building infrastructure. There is a member on the back bench nodding proudly: the member for Bowman. ‘Yeah, we opposed it; look at us; we're the heroes of small business.' What are you doing for our tradies? Just yesterday, the Australian Business Investment Partnership hit the fence. Why? Now the jobs of 50,000 tradies are at risk. You should be ashamed of yourselves. And you come into this parliament asking, ‘What are you doing for small business?' I say: what are you doing for small business? Why are you talking the economy down? Why are you betraying our tradies? It is because of base political instincts to do with your self preservation and your desire to remain on the front bench in the reshuffle. It has been a poor performance by you: dusty at the midwinter ball; dusty next week. You should give it away and get someone who can come in here and engage in a proper and constructive debate and talk the economy up instead of talking the economy down.",123
238,Mr LAMING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We meet here this afternoon because in this global shock we have mounting unemployment in this country and stresses that small business have not seen for a decade. I see members from the other side exiting this chamber. They could stay around for a little while and learn a little bit more about the plight of small business people, who they do not meet in their own electorates. Members for Eden-Monaro, Dobell, Isaacs, Makin, Fremantle, Parramatta, Forde, Longman, Leichhardt, Bonner, Solomon, Page and Brand, I implore you to stick around. I do not like seeing the backs of you the way that small business people in your electorate see the backs of you because this government has abandoned them. The stimulus package by this government, if you compare it to all stimulus packages around the world, has the least in it for business. You only need to look at what the US has done and what OECD economies have done in Europe. When you look at Australia, it was basically cash payments that were very poorly directed and construction stimulus that went straight to the commercial building of multipurpose halls in schools. I am not about to criticise the importance of funding to schools, but there was never a better time than this year to protect our small businesses. They are, as the member for Moncrieff has said, the backbone of this economy. For those nearly four million Australians who work in small business, I rise today to speak. We in fact proposed this MPI for that very reason. What we have here effectively is a government that has abrogated its responsibility. The minister is full of bluff and bluster in a souffle-like attempt to defend the record of this government, which is appalling, on the back of one survey result that came out this week. I am not any kind of analyst, but what creates the greatest likelihood of a good survey result in a poll is an atrocious one the poll before. When it collapses in May, of course there will be some sort of bounce back in June, which can be of a record quantity purely because of the collapse the month before. That explains why we have a small bit of good news-which of course is always welcomed on this side of the chamber. What we on this side have is a coherent approach to protecting small business. The government virtually turned a blind eye. I will give a little bit of history. Remember 2008? When they should have been preparing for the economic crisis and the threats that this economy faced, they were holding 2020 forums and bringing in actors like Cate Blanchett and shamelessly politicising her. In 2009, they egged on the Reserve Bank to four interest rate increases over seven months when not another developed econsmall omy was doing that. While other economies stared down small levels of inflation that were mostly due to drought induced commodity price increases and to increases in petroleum prices, it was Australia which blinked and put enormous pressures on small business. That will not be forgotten in wider Australia. What we on this side have done is come up with meaningful alternatives, such as net operating loss carry back provisions, which are welcome for strongly performing small businesses that hit a wall in this economy. On the other side, we have seen virtually nothing except depreciation arrangements that help only the smallest proportion of small business. We needed so much more from this government; we did not see it. It is worth making an international comparison; economies in banking crises are suffering extraordinary economic pain, but this country had strong banks, a very small manufacturing sector compared to resources and most importantly of all no net debtthanks to the Howard government, which put us in an ideal place to be able to stimulate the economy. What we saw was a Prime Minister who panicked. He went across to the G20, listened to all of the foreboding predictions for economies that had banking crises, problems with return on investments, problems with return on equity, net interest margins that were very small, massive exposure to derivatives and liquidity and cash to total asset ratios that were very small. All of those reasons meant that these countries were in enormous peril. But it was this country that forgot small business in its stimulus package. This government stimulated inefficiently and wastefully. Australia will now see the results: significant increases in unemployment. This government has been able to focus on nothing more than one retail sector survey and the very small proportion of this economy's performance that it represents. NA",124
239,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 4.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. MCMillan Electorate: Landcare",125
240,Mr BROADBENT,ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you for the call, Mr Speaker. I appreciate it. I rise to raise an issue that is important in my electorate, from Hill End to Hedley and Yarragon, Trafalgar, Thorpdale, Korumburra, Leongatha and Meeniyan and across the whole of South Gippsland. That is the issue of Landcare and the way the government has changed the rules for Landcare, affecting people such as in the photograph I am holding: Phil Piper, Graeme and Rosemary Trease, Susanne Whiteman, Alex Campbell and Mark Uren. They were meeting to consider what has happened with the whole Landcare program since the change of government. I asked Phil Piper to put it in writing so I could send it to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. He wrote: Dear Russell Our Landcare group is very concerned with the way Landcare is progressing. Remember that these people are absolutely passionate about what they have done and what they intend to do in the future. The letter continues: We are a small but effective group with about 34 people and since our conception in 2002 have planted approximately 50,000 trees. In the 2007 Landcare Awards members of our group won the Primary Producers Award, the Rivercare Award and the Dick Howarth Memorial Award. This year our group won the Group Award. Pretty impressive! But what is pretty unimpressive is that for 2009/10 there is no funding available for our members to continue our good work. In fact in 2008/9 only 1 of our members received funding and our support people at the local network office are fighting for funding just to keep their jobs. What has happened to Landcare? It is no longer a grassroots organization, as it was originally set up. It has become a from the top down organization, because to receive funding you have to have a large $20,000 - $50,000 single project, instead of the small projects of the past. What is the point of small groups like ours (and many, many others) being part of Landcare? Do you realise that the funding only covers the cost of the trees, shrubs, grasses etc and a centage of our fencing costs. We provide the ance of the fencing costs, plus all the labour planting out, weed control, upkeep on fencing, general maintenance for the years that follow for NOTHING. We have regular meetings and discuss these issues, encourage new members, involve the next generation (School children-Landcare cadets from our local school), try to influence and encourage our neighbours and local farmers again for NOTHING. Do you realise what a valuable asset these small groups are? Why is the Federal Government trying to shut us down by starving us of funding? If the government is serious about addressing climate change, surely they must fund and encourage Landcare groups like ours, to continue to planting trees. Why don't they give the $20,000 or $50,000 to the networks so as they can survive and fund the 100s of small groups, like ourselves, so we can continue doing our work? Please Russell can you help us as our situation desperate. We all love Landcare and we don't want to leave it. Yours in Landcare Phil Piper (President) The work of people like those in this photograph-and they are only a few-resonates throughout my electorate. They are in every area. I have met with them in Inverloch and I have gone from farm to farm and project to project. I have seen the pride in their eyes as they grab their local member and say: ‘Come and see what we've done with this creek. See what we've done in this valley. See what we've done in this area of landslide.' They are so proud that they will even stop what they are doing for the day just to take their local member out and show him what they have done. I am therefore quite humbled by the work per- that is being done right across Gippsland. I bal- know every member of this House can go to for areas of their electorates where people are very proud of the work that they are doing on a voluntary basis. But this work in Landcare seems to have been taken off them, not through an intentional change by the government but by another approach where a bigger project-a $20,000 or $50,000 exercise-can be awarded with a plaque. These people are not interested in plaques; they are interested in plants. They are interested in ecology; they are interested in salination of the soil. They are interested in the future of their children and they are interested in the future of the nation. I call on the minister, Tony Burke, to reconsider how that money is being doled out to people, and he might consider for the first time the little people-the little people of Landcare. Mission Australia",125
241,Mr BRADBURY,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak on a matter that I have found to is be most disturbing and that I know many people in my electorate-indeed, many people right around the country-would also have found disturbing. I refer to the disparaging reflections on Mission Australia made in question time yesterday by the member for Boothby, the shadow minister for employment participation. As I was listening to the debate in the House yesterday, I was shocked to hear the member for Boothby stand up in this place and imply that Mission Australia, which has an outstanding reputation for its work in the community, and the office of the former Minister for Employment Participation were somehow involved in a breach of the probity guidelines of the employment services tender. This was a cheap, below-the-belt political swipe. The member for Boothby impugned the reputation of Mission Australia and he impugned the reputation of its chief executive, Toby Hall. He accused Mission Australia of having inappropriate discussions with the then minister's office immediately following the announcement of the successful tenders for the new Job Services Australia in April this year. The member for Boothby's line of questioning was made all the more contemptible because, until yesterday, in the 18 months he has been in the shadow portfolio he has not asked one question of the minister. In fact so brave is the shadow minister that he had to wait until the employment participation portfolio moved to a minister in the Senate before he could pluck up the courage to step up to the dispatch box. At a time when the focus of the Rudd government and the nation is very much on supporting Australian jobs, the member for Boothby is only interested in casting unfounded aspersions on an organisation that has come to the aid of thousands of Australian families in need. For a shadow minister for employment participation, the member for Boothby just does not seem to want to participate in one of the most important discussions we are having in this country-the one about jobs. In the last 18 months, not only has the member for Boothby shown that he has no interest in employment; he has also shown a distinct lack of interest in tion when it comes to making a contribution in this place. I was shocked by these allegations and made inquiries of the Minister for Employment Participation. I have been advised by the minister that the employment services tender was overseen by an external probity auditor, the legal firm Clayton Utz, who indeed signed off on the process at every relevant juncture and found no impropriety on the part of Mission Australia, the government or, indeed, any party involved. We can excuse the coalition for not understanding probity. We saw the way they administered what has become infamously referred to as the ‘regional rorts program', where the most important criteria for project approval was being located in a National Party held seat. We know that the Leader of the Opposition, as the then minister for the environment, only days out from the 2007 election approved a $10 million grant for an untested cloud-seeding program in his own electorate. That project did not even have the approval of his own department. Mission Australia does not deserve to be the target of the member for Boothby's malicious smear campaign. In my electorate of Lindsay I have a very constructive relationship with Mission Australia, as I am sure many members from both the sides of this House do. Mission Australia, through a multitude of services, provide assistance to the most disadvantaged people in our community: the homeless, the long-term unemployed, the elderly, Indigenous communities, young people and people with substance abuse issues. I am pleased to say that Mission Australia are delivering employment services in my local area under Job Services Australia and they have also been successful in obtaining funding under the National Rental Affordability Scheme to construct participaaffordable housing in Oxley Park. As the Prime Minister himself noted in his answer to the member for Boothby's grubby line of attack, it is entirely reasonable for MPs, including ministers, to have contact with individuals from Mission Australia. In the case of the Labor Party, that is even more relevant because we have common aims: to assist the disadvantaged and to deal with issues such as poverty, homelessness and unemployment. It is rumoured that the Leader of the Opposition is looking to reshuffle his front-bench. I for one would be absolutely gobsmacked if the member for Boothby survived that reshuffle. Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol",126
242,Mr BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Paterson) (4.39 pm)The ongoing contributions made by volunteers in the Paterson electorate are extraordinary to say the least. I would like to acknowledge and dedicate this speech to all the special individuals who take time out of their own busy schedules to assist others. These volunteers often leave behind their loved ones and jobs to assist those most in need. Often they put their lives on the line to help others in distress and they do it for no recognition and usually at high personal costfinancially, mentally and physically. They deserve our utmost support, gratitude and respect. Last week I had the pleasure of meeting with a group of volunteers in the Paterson electorate, in the form of the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol, Port Stephens, to present them with an Australian flag. These men and women are an extraordinary group of people and I thank them for their kindness and generosity towards both me and their community over the years. We should never underestimate the emotional as well as physical toll that these 136-strong members endure to serve their Port Stephens community. The coastal patrol has a role at all levels assisting members of the boating community in order to educate and protect themselves, their passengers and their vessels. In Port Stephens the extraordinary group of men and women who make up the volunteer brigade carry out marine search and rescue work, other waterborne services and services of a public or community nature. They also provide theoretical and practical instruction on seamanship subjects and boat handling and assist public authorities. The members who volunteer as part of the coastal patrol must endure some trying experiences and yet they still manage to act with such professionalism and decorum, and for that I have deep respect for them. On Friday I had the pleasure of awarding Port Stephens Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol member Lloyd Cropper a national medal for his service in the patrol over the past 18 years. What struck me about Lloyd was how humble he was to receive such a prestigious honour. Lloyd, like many of his colleagues, is a role model not only for the Port Stephens community but also for all. He has repeatedly gone out of his way to assist others without seeking any sort of gratification. As I stood there with Lloyd, in front of his fellow volunteers and family, I thought to myself, ‘What a great man, what a great inspiration and what a great privilege it is for me to be part of this moment.' In my role as a federal member of parliament I have had the pleasure of meeting many inspirational individuals such as Lloyd, yet I will never grow tired of such a privilege. It is people such as Lloyd and other members of the division-such as Division Commander Geoff Moore, Operations Officer Peter Bevan, Administration Officer Michael Smith, Education Officer Ilene Kelly, Search Master Rod Reeson and Public Relations Officer Bob Young, to name but a few in the time available for this speech-that reaffirm my in faith in mankind if I am struck with disturbing examples of human behaviour in the news. If we each assisted others as Lloyd and his fellow members continue to do then I would hold great hope for our combined future. It is with great pride that I reflect on Australia's proud history of volunteering. Every year, millions of Australians offer their time and talents in order to help build a better community. It is a characteristic which has helped define our young nation and made it one of the greatest places on earth to live. It is mateship in its truest form. All contributions made, whether they are grand or small, are appreciated and are what keep the true spirit of Australia alive. I am proud to give 100 per cent of my support to members of the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol, Port Stephens, and thank them for their tireless dedication to assist their local community and for their professionalism in carrying out duties under what are often difficult circumstances. It is my hope that, as Australia comes of age, we as a nation continue the legacy of great volunteer organisations such as the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol. I welcome the news that a merger may take place between Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol and Volunteer Coast Guard to become one unit. This will no doubt build an even stronger, more harmonious maritime rescue unit that will better attract both corporate government funding. It should be better funded by all levels of government. It goes without saying, no matter whether it stands as a combined or stand-alone division, I wish the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol, Port Stephens, and every one of its members every success in their future. I look forward to continuing to work with them closely to ensure that the Paterson region remains one of prosperity.",128
243,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT,"Lowe) (4.44 pm)Having listened to the MPI debate here a few moments ago and to the opposition's dishonest attack on the Rudd government, I want to defend the government and restate what we are doing for small business. In this year's budget alone, we committed more than half a billion dollars in incentives for small business. Measures delivered by the government include the increase in the rate of the small business and general business tax break, the new research and development tax credit, the Small Business Support Line, Small Business Online, the new Commonwealth Commercialisation Institute, a $50 million boost to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme, a 12-month extension of exceptional circumstances assistance under the rural small business program, and the PAYG cash flow relief initiative. These measures are in addition to the two stimulus packages delivered by the Rudd government. Contrary to the motion that came before the House this afternoon, the Rudd government is supporting small businesses and jobs through its budget initiatives and stimulus packages. It is beyond belief that the opposition can stand here today and claim that the Australian government has failed to support Australian small businesses. Today I spoke with the Chairman of the Burwood Chamber of Commerce in my elecand torate of Lowe, who reported that his overall assessment, in the Burwood local government area, is that the Rudd government is maintaining confidence and optimism in the business community. I take this opportunity to walk the opposition through some of the measures that the government has introduced for the direct benefit of small businesses. The government has increased its small business and general business tax break from 30 per cent to 50 per Budget cent at a cost of $141 million. Small businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million a year can claim a 50 per cent deduction for eligible assets that cost more than $1,000. This measure has been warmly welcomed by many small businesses in my electorate of Lowe. The small businesses in my electorate will greatly benefit from the increase in the small business and general business tax break to 50 per cent. The government, as you know, Mr Speaker, has already doubled the incentive for eligible small businesses to undertake research and development under the new research and development tax credit. The benefit to small and medium sized enterprises is the provision of a 45 per cent refundable credit for firms with an annual turnover of less than $20 million. These are indeed difficult economic times. The government recognises this and is delivering for small business. In response to what the opposition are saying, I note that the government has also provided the Small Business Support Line, which will offer specialist advice on business matters as well as personal stress advice and support. The support line will be part of the nationwide network of business enterprise centres and other advisory services. The National Broadband Network will also provide further opportunities for small businesses that operate online. These benefits include reduced costs, marketing opportunities and broad market scope-all appreciated by small business. Further, the Rudd government is introducing a revolutionary Commonwealth Commercialisation Institute. The role of the institute is to assist firms in their quest to grow and remain in Australiasupporting Australian jobs and supporting small business. For our rural small businesses, the Rudd government is extending the exceptional circumstances assistance for farm-dependent small businesses, which includes relief payments and interest rate subsidies. The government appreciates the difficulties all small businesses face during an economic downturn, hence the Rudd government is making every effort to ensure we support the engine room of our economy. Again, in response to the difficulties experienced in the global economy, I am pleased to report that the government has delivered that extra $50 million for export market development grants. This funding will assist our country's more than 1800 small and medium sized exporters. Many of the small businesses in my electorate also warmly welcome the budget measures providing PAYG cash flow relief. This measure will benefit more than one million small businesses which pay quarterly PAYG instalments based on their previous year's tax, adjusted by GDP growth. The government has reduced the GDP adjustment factor from around nine per cent to two per cent in light of the expected increase in the CPI for 2009-10. Measures such as these are extremely important to small businesses in my electorate, from the cafes on Majors Bay Road in Concord to the busy shopping centres on Burwood Road, Burwood, to the restaurants of Great North Road, Five Dock. I applaud the Rudd government for the extensive initiatives it has taken to support Australian small businesses. The government is indeed delivering for small business. Iran",129
244,Mr SIMPKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"Cowan) (4.49 pm)Last Friday, the Islamic Republic of Iran held its presidential election. The incumbent, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was re-elected. The result, of course, is questionable in the extreme. As commentators have stated, the result makes no sense at all. The two salient points I have heard from some commentators are these. For the first time, Tehran voted for the President. Never before, but suddenly the hardline president has the support of the better-educated Iranians. Yet the oddity does not stop there. For the first time, there was a high voter turnout. Instead of favouring the reformist candidate, as it had since 1997, that higher turnout actually favoured the hardline Ahmadinejad and he was victorious. I would say that the voter turnout may have been high, but I suspect that many of the voters did not even know that they had turned out and voted. I have commented before on the state of democracy in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Certainly the veneer of true democracy is very thin, given the existing structure that has to approve all candidates. No credible commentators would suggest that the election was fair or the result legitimate. The result is, however, a tragedy for the two per cent of the population from those religious minority groups, such as the Baha'is, who are not protected under the Constitution and have been consistently persecuted over the last 150 years. I would like to diverge to the method used by the regime to maintain control of the population in Iran. I recently heard reliable commentators suggest that the control of power in Iran has fully shifted to the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Republic or, as they are commonly known, the Revolutionary Guards. This is a very important point and it is useful to take some time to consider what part the guards play in Iran. As most commentators are aware, President Ahmadinejad was a member of the guards, albeit in the Basij militia. We know that the guards were established in 1979 as part of the Islamic revolution. Their role includes the term ‘national security', which particularly includes that aspect which is referred to as ‘internal security'. There is no doubt that the establishment of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Republic by the Ayatollah Khomeini was for the defence of his position as supreme leader and of the regime. Since 1979, the guards have certainly become a military force, yet they are also strongly involved in the economy and the politics of Iran. It has been estimated that the guards control about a third of the economy. There is therefore a strong reason to maintain their position and avoid reform. Their percentage of control of the economy is also consistent with the number of former guards in the Majlis, the parliament. As I previously stated, the President was a member of the Basij element of the guards. The Basij are known as the mobilisation militia or officially as the Basij Resistance Force. They are a subordinate organisation of the guards. They are volunteers and currently undertake not only law enforcement tasks but, amongst other tasks, enforce moral standards and carry out the harassment of any form of gathering that the regime does not endorse. We must understand that Basij recruits can start from as young as 12 years old. They are in schools, in universities and in villages throughout the country. They are literally ingrained into every institution within the nation. These are the people from the organisation that we often see named as plain-clothes police or religious police. Even the real police fear them. There is no doubt that the Basij have suppressed and continue to suppress individual freedom and that they are in fact operating to put down the demonstrations currently taking place in Tehran. While some may say they hide behind the authority they believe they have under Islam, I believe that they believe in their faith, revelling in a sense of righteousness-a righteousness that asserts that anyone who opposes their view and seeks democracy must be dealt with. It is a rare religion that in this modern era asserts its control so clearly and violently, yet it seems that Islam remains no further advanced than when it began. These sorts of regimesregimes of extremism, regimes of violence and repression of the individual as well as of any form of dissent-are not regimes that can be negotiated with. Reason via constructive argument is only met with brutal reaction. I believe that the complete integration of the Basij and the guards into every element of Iranian society leaves little option for freedom and the democratic spirit. I commend the brave people of Iran who risk their lives in questioning the sham that was the election. It is my view that political control is now entirely in the hands of the Army of the Guards of the Islamic Republic, as represented by its current and former members. I see no other option for the people of Iran than to continue to protest. The reign of the guards must come to an end and the repression must end. I cannot see that happening without a lot of people being hurt. I would go so far as to say that freedom is a cause that is worth fighting for. Petition: Trail and Monkey Bikes",130
245,Mr CHAMPION,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to table a petition from 486 of my constituents regarding the importation and sale of trail bikes and monkey bikes. This petition was generated by a problem that exists in my electorate from individuals and groups of individuals riding trail bikes and very small bikes which are referred to as monkey bikes. These are miniature bikes that look a bit like a miniature road bike or a miniature Harley-Davidson and are powered by 50cc motors. There is a plague of them in the northern suburbs of my electorate, in the township of Gawler and in particular along the coastal beaches such as Middle Beach. These bikes seem quite comical and I think people ride them in the belief that it is an innocent recreational activity. In fact, it an incredibly dangerous activity both for the rider and for pedestrians and others who use these places. The riding of these bikes has been linked to antisocial behaviour such as drinking and assaults in public parks and it has greatly affected the amenity of many areas in my electorate. One of these places I have been out to is the Gawler River Junction, where the North Para and South Para rivers meet. I was out there the other day with the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government announcing $3 million to build a number of bridges and walkways in this area. While waiting for the minister with the mayor and other local residents a couple of these very small motorbikes howled through the existing walkways. They can be particularly dangerous for residents who are walking their dogs or playing with their children or walking on the beach. Already we have had two residents killed while riding these bikes. One was in Salisbury North. The individual was, sadly, intoxicated and rode one of these small motorbikes up the train line, fell off and died of head injuries. Another fellow died in Munno Para car park from injuries sustained while riding one of these bikes. This has happened because these bikes do not meet Australian design standards. They are imported from China, and there is no design standard that they have to meet, and they are not road registrable. People can buy them from anybody who wishes to import them. They are quite dangerous because they do not meet design standards and even at very low speeds cannot turn properly. Problems arise when people are belting along at up to 50 kilometres an hour and have to dodge some person or inanimate object and then find themselves going over the handlebars. One young man I know through a friend is 21 and doing his teaching degree. He is a fine and upstanding is citizen in nearly every way, but one night he made the mistake of getting on one of these bikes and ended up in Flinders Hospital emergency ward. He had to wait for eight hours to see a doctor. Unfortunately, he is now going to carry an injury for life because he shattered his ankle to such an extent they expect to have to fuse it. We can ban these bikes. I think the state government has to crack down on the illegal use of these bikes. Frankston City Council has resolved the problem through strong fines and enforcement of their strong laws. I think state, federal and local governments can act to prevent this problem. One tends to think it is an innocent problem but in fact it is very serious and has been reported as such in the Adelaide Advertiser by Kim Wheatley, a very good journalist. I am hoping that the federal parliament, the state parliament and the local council will all pay some regard to the wishes of my petitioners and my electors. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of concerned citizens of South Australia draws the attention of the Federal Parliament to the increasing problem of the use of monkey bikes in parks and public places. This illegal activity is a danger to the riders of such vehicles and to the public. It causes environmental degradation and damage to parks and property, and infringes on local amenity. This activity has resulted in the deaths of two riders in the northern suburbs of Adelaide. We therefore ask that the Federal Parliament consider laws to ban the sale and import of monkey bikes. from 486 citizens Petition received. Question agreed to. House adjourned at 4.59 pm",132
