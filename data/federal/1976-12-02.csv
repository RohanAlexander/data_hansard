3,Mr JAMES,USE OF PARLIAMENTARY DINING,"My question is to you, Mr Speaker. I ask: Are you aware that whilst several honourable members, including myself, were will guests of the President of the Senate and yourself as Joint Presidents of the Commonwealth Parliathereby mentary Association at a dinner in the private dining room in Parliament House in honour the distinguished delegates from the British liament whom we welcomed to the chamber that afternoon, there was being held in another prifacturers vate dining room in Parliament House a party for some Ministers and members of the 'Class 66', at which a birthday cake was produced which jumped a girl clad in a brief bikini of which the top half was retained only momenterm tarily? I further ask: Is it permissible able members to hold parties of this character in the precincts of the Parliament? What steps do you, Mr Speaker, propose to take to restore the dignity of the national Parliament and bring book those who have sulUed it?",19
4,Mr SPEAKER,USE OF PARLIAMENTARY DINING,"I have made inquiries as to what occurred in the private dining room. I have been told that there was an occasion during which a person, who apparently was an attractive person, came out of what appeared to be a cake but what in fact was a tea box and that ing an entertainment which was being offered she suffered a certain misfortune with the upper part of her clothing. I have read rather lurid reports in the Press this morning stating that people present blanched with horror. No have been made to me indicating that they did blanch in horror, but it was reported to me that they were dissatisfied that that sort of entertainthis: ment should occur in Parliament House. I agree; it is not the sort of entertainment which should occur in Parliament House. I wish the House know that if it happens again it is Ukely to punishable by transportation for 7 years to the colonies. NA",19
5,Mr NEIL,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,I direct my question to the Minister for Productivity. What are the benefits to national productivity arising from the recent devaluation? How will these benefits affect the man in the street?,19
6,Mr MACPHEE,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"In recent days there have will been many comments about the adverse impact of an across-the-board measure Uke devaluation. I am very glad that the honourable member has sought to examine some of the positive aspects of this because we are, as we know, renowned as a nation of knockers. Let us look at the positive aspects of devaluation. First of aU, for one thing ROOM it will arrest some of those board room decisions which were being made to take industry offshore. It will thereby retain jobs in industry. It also discourage the further outflow of capital which is needed for investment in industry and encourage the creation of jobs in industry. Furthermore, it wiU enable Australian manuof facturers to compete with imports, thereby Parretaining and in the course of time extending jobs in industry. It will enable Australian manuto export more of their goods, thereby enabling them to invest or expand their plant of and employ more people. Unquestionably this from measure will be of short and medium term benefit of a considerable extent and in the long it will gready improve productivity of for honourindustry. It is about umeMr Innes-Eve n you do not believe that.",19
7,Mr MACPHEE,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"The honourable member for to Melbourne is interjecting, joining the team of knockers in this countiy. Any across-the-board measure of course will discomfort some people.",19
8,Mr BRYANT,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,Why did you not do it earUer?,19
9,Mr MACPHEE,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,The honourable member for Wills asks why it was not done earUer. The point duris that it is an across-the-board measure.,19
10,Mr SPEAKER,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"Order! The honourable gentleman will resume his seat. One must accept occasional interjections, but I will not accept a barrage of interjections. I ask honourable memreports bers on my left to remain silent.",19
11,Mr MACPHEE,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"Probably it is sufficient to say It has been commonly said in industry, especially in manufacturing industry in the last few weeks, that it was pointless to talk about long to term productivity improvement unless some be short term measures were taken to give industry a breathing space in which to make investments and create the employment opportunities to which I have referred. It is commonly said that if you are sitting in a crocodile infested swamp and being bitten by the crocodiles it is a bit difficult to recognise that your principal task ought to be to drain the swamp. This measure has helped to drain the swamp and the task is now in front of industry. The restraints and constraints necessary on all of us must be carried out. This measure be of great benefit to long term productivity improvement and medium term employment. NA",19
12,Mr STEWART,FRASER MINISTRY,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can he deny that he is planning a re-organisation of the Ministry which will include the dismissal of some Ministers, the appointment of replacements and a re-allocation of portfolios? If not, when does he intend to make his announcement?",20
13,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FRASER MINISTRY,"The honourable gentleman really ought to join a circus; the trouble is that he is already part of a circus. When the Leader of the Opposition was on this side of the House he was always sacking people, changing people's positions and undermining people. This Government operates as a team. It is afirstclass team in the service of Australia. It will remain that way. It is a team intact. Every member of the team is serving with great distinction. NA",20
14,Mr WENTWORTH,MONEY SUPPLY,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. It concerns economic policy, with special reference to the Treasurer's resider endorsement of his poUcies on money supply set out at page 37 of his Budget Speech. Has the Treasurer given consideration to the possibiUty that in formulating his pohcy he may have paid too much attention to the Procrustes principle? Does he recaU that Procrustes was an amiable Greek who had a somewhat arbitrary iron bed. When traveUers were tall Uke, for example, the Prime Minister-h e would cut off their feet to make themfitthe bed. If they were somewhat the short side-like , for example, the honourable member for Shortland-h e would stretch their necks until theyfittedthe bed exactly. Would Treasurer be incUned to modify his icy which endeavours tofitthe Australian economy to an arbitrary money supply and see whether he might not do better to try tofitthe money supply to the Australian economy?",20
15,Mr LYNCH,MONEY SUPPLY,"When the honourable gentleTreasurer. man refers to the stretching of necks, I am in impelled to say that I think of an honourable tiessetting gentleman in this House. I am sure the honourSunday night? able gendeman will take no offence at that statement, he being the sort of robust individual he is. As far as monetary pohcy is concerned, think the activities and actions of the Governtreasury ment since it was elected to office will reflect fact that the monetary poUcy has been subject flexible adjustment as circumstances have changed during that period. As far as the future is concerned, the Government has made it perments fectly clear that monetary pohcy will be a bonds. measured adjustment to circumstances as they develop but that the position on monetary pokey will be firm. I have said to the House previously-I repeat it-that the Government's monetary pohcy is such that it will provide adequate capacity to underwrite economic recovery but not at the same time to be accommodating to infiation. That is a very important point of the post-devaluation package, because the monetary pohcy in part, with other arms of poUcy, is designed to offset the inflationary effects of the decision to devalue. NA",20
16,Mr UREN,URANIUM,"I direct a question to the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development. I draw his attention to his statement in Hobart on 28 October in which he caUed the first of the 16findingsand recommendations of the Fox report the major recommendations. Since those recommendations and the second findings or recommendations appear to be the main basis upon which the Government has decided to proceed with uranium exports and subsequent uranium development, does he still conthefirstrecommendations in the Fox report as to be the major recommendations? Has he or other Ministers sought or obtained the advice of any of the commissioners to clarify those points or any other points of uncertainty about the Fox report? If so, what was the nature of that advice?",20
17,Mr NEWMAN,URANIUM,The Government's position on the mining and export of uranium is perfectly clear. It is spelt out in detail in my statement of on 11 November which appears in Hansard. The Prime Minister has made further statements on the matter indicating that the Government's polthe icy wiU be made clear only after we have present polreceived the second report. instead INTEREST RATES ON GOVERNMENT NA,20
18,Mr GILLARB,SECURITIES,"l address my question to the What action has been taken by the Reserve Bank of Australia over the past few days the interest rates of government securifoUowing the Treasurer's announcement last that Mr LYNCH-As I announced in the Press I statement of 28 November, issue yields on notes were increased by 0.5 per cent as the from the commencement of business on 29 to November. This brought the yield on 13-week notes to 8.981 per cent and on 26-week notes to 9.230 per cent. As then foreshadowed, adjusthave taken place also in market yields on For short term securities the increase has been approximately 0.S per cent. For example, the yield on November 1978 bonds has increased from about 9.4 per cent on 26 November to about 9.9 per cent on 1 December. Increases of lesser magnitude have taken place in yields on medium and long term bonds. At 10 years the increase has been from 10 per cent to_ about 10.4 per cent. The yields on the longer se- * curities have risen from 10.2 per cent to almost 10.5 per cent. With these changes the adjustments foreshadowed in Sunday night's Press release have in fact been completed. I might say that the adjustments in private interest rates have been measured, are appropriate to the movements in Government security yields and are largely confined to short term securities. NA",20
19,Mr ARMITAGE,PRIME MINISTER,"I ask the Prime Minister: In view of his grazing interests, what will he make out of devaluation?",21
20,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PRIME MINISTER,One of the characteristics of members of the Opposition is that they always want to personalise politics and not to debate poUcies. It is a characteristic that is one of the things that will keep them where they are. NA COMMISSION: RADIO PROGRAM AM,21
21,Mr MACKENZIE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I direct my question to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. Did the Minister hear the lead item this morning on the Australian Broadcasting Commission radio program AM which referred to the aUeged deepening gloom over devaluation? Is it an acceptable standard of reporting and broadcasting by the ABC to base reports such as this on unnamed people who '... are at the very top in Australia's business, banking, economic and industrial circles and who were not wiUing to be identified for fear that the authority of their positions would further endanger the present tenuous state of the economy'?",21
22,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Yes, I did hear the lead story on AM this morning. Quite frankly, I was disgusted because I thought that it was a pretty poor standard of journahsm. Here we had someone using the national airwaves to put forward unsourced and unsubstantiated statements. I find this action extraordinary. We need only pick up any newspaper or listen to radio and television day after day to read and to hear what is said by prominent Australians who are engaged, as the person concerned said today, in 'banking, economic and industrial circles' at the annual meetings of their companies or at public engagements. We encourage them to say quite clearly what they believe on economic issues. Yet this young gentleman this morning claims that he could notfindone person to put a name to the information that he sawfitto put over the Australian Broadcasting Commission network.",21
23,Mr HURFORD,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,They have been talking down the economy. That is what you have been accusing me of doing.,21
24,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"It is helpful for the Australian community to hear the voices of the wreckers, that is, to hear the interjections that are being made by the people who wrecked the economy over 3 years.",21
25,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Do not be so modest. It was all done by Phil himself.,21
26,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Order! The honourable member for Oxley will remain silent. The Minister will direct his reply through the Chair.,21
27,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"It was obviously utter nonsense. It may have been afigmentof his imagination. I suggest to members of Parliament and to the Australian community that they utterly disregard this obviously scurrilous reporting. The facts of Ufe, of course, are quite different from what was stated this morning. The economic strategy of this Government, as announced by the Prime Minister and particularly the Treasurer, has been consistent. The decision to devalue was part of that consistent strategy. Of course honourable members opposite do not like this strategy because it suits them to use every opportunity to talk down the economy. They continue to use every opportunity. Ifinallysay, Mr Speaker, that despite the fact that the young reporter misused the program AM this morning and despite what the Opposition says the strategy is consistent. We are winning the battle against inflation. The decision on devaluation will add to the growth and stability of the Australian economy. NA",21
28,Dr JENKINS,BUREAU OF ROADS,"My question, which is directed to the Minister for Transport, relates to his recent announcement that the Bureau of Roads is to be amalgamated with the Bureau of Transport Economics. Did the Minister give an undertaking last August to the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association and to the Australian Public Service Association that they would be kept informed about developments associated with the amalgamation of the Bureau? If so, what action has he taken to honour this undertaking? Were the associations given, as promised by the Public Service Board, the opportunity to comagainst ment on proposals concerning the amalgaand mation? Is he aware of the serious concern officers of the Bureau of Roads as to their future? Finally, will the Minister give these officers, whom he has so often praised, an undertaking that they will not be disadvantaged in any a result of the Bureau of Roads being absorbed into the Department of Transport?",21
29,Mr NIXON,BUREAU OF ROADS,"I cannot recall giving a specinc matter. undertaking to members of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association in relation to this matter. I do recall giving an undertaking to the staff of the Bureau of Roads that any submission they made to me would be taken into careful consideration. Indeed, that was what ensued. The staff of the Bureau of Roads made submission to me on this matter. The propunions ositions which it pu' forward to me were conthat sidered and taken into account mation. I can give the honourable member and the staff of the Bureau of Roads an assurance that the position of members of the staff is tected. I can give the country at large an assurtraUan ance, as I have done on a number of occasions, that the functions and operations which were performed by the Bureau of Roads will continue. The Bureau of Roads has been the source of a great deal of important advice to a number of governments over a number of years. That advice will still continue to be sought. There need, in my view, for any cause for alarm by the staff of the Bureau of Roads in this matter. ing read all the advice which has come to about the proposed amalgamation, I am quite convinced that the new merged or amalgamated body will be a much better advisjng body to the Government and to those people to whom it giving advice than occurred previously.

30,Mr CADMAN,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT,Is the Minister for Employable ment and Industrial Relations aware of allemade gations that a major fraud involving ulegal ments of unemployment benefits extending 12 months and involving an officer of his Departreduce ment in Sydney has been uncovered? What months action is he taking in respect of this matter.,22
31,Mr STREET,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT,"Yes, I am aware of the matter to which the honourable gendeman refers. My Department in Sydney has been investigating aspects of the payment of unemployment referred benefits with which it is concerned. As a result those investigations the Commonwealth Police were asked to make further inquiries. As a conse-was quence of those inquiries charges have been an officer of my Department in Sydney, the police are continuing their inquiries. My of Department has already taken action in Sydney to reconcile the records kept by the Department of Social Security involving the issuing of unemployment benefit cheques with the records kept way as by the Commonwealth Employment Service. I have asked my Department to investigate as a matter of urgency what other checks and safeguards may be needed to be introduced in this NA",22

WUl he assure the House those reports of such an obnoxious practice in the amalgaare without foundation?,22
33,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TRADE UNIONS,"I can only assure prothe House that the Director-General of the AusSecurity IntelUgence Organisation, who was appointed by my predecessor, as the honourable gentleman would know, will carry out the functions of the Act scrupulously. COWS' MILK SUBSTITUTES",22
34,Mr RUDDOCK,TRADE UNIONS,"My question is addressed to is no the Minister for Health. Has the Minister referred to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory HavCommittee questions concerning the desirability me of restoring to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme numbers of products? In view of my representations and those of other honourable members, were cows' milk substitutes referred to is the Committee, and what has been the outcome of the Committee's deliberations?",22
35,Mr HUNT,TRADE UNIONS,"It is true that the honourable member for Parramatta, the honourable member for Hughes and a number of other honourmembers from both sides of the House representations to me as a consequence of paymy accepting the recommendations of the Pharover maceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to the age eligibility from 6 years to 18 for the availabiUty of cow's milk substitutes. That recommendation was made last year. Because of the representations that I have received from the honourable member and from other honourable members in the Parliament I the matter back to the Pharmaceutical of Benefits Advisory Committee for its reconsideration. The Committee acknowledged that there a need for cow's milk substitutes for some laidchildren who are allergic to cow's milk. The Committee recognised also that there was a considerable amount of abuse in the usage of these substitutes. As a consequence of this the usage rate was centred principally in several centres or regions within the city of Sydney. The Committee made further inquiries, discussed the matter with physicians, pediatricians and others and recommended that the age limit be increased from 18 months to 2 years. I have now approved that recommendation and it will become effective as from 1 April 1977. URANIUM: FOX REPORT Mr E. G. Whitlam- I ask the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development a question concerning correspondence between him or other Ministers and Mr Justice Fox. The honourable gendeman will remember that 2 days ago the Minister who represents him in the Senate was asked a question without notice about a report that the Ranger inquiry commissioners had written to the Minister criticising the Government for its interpretation of the first report and that the Minister who represents him had said in reply: I am instructed that the Minister has indicated that letter has not come into his hands, nor has his office partment been able to locate such a letter. That instruction. The honourable gentleman would also know states: that yesterday, during question time in the Senate, the Minister who represents him said in a tiveDevaluation personal explanation: The Minister has in fact Mr Justice Fox. One of them was concerned with the interpretation that has been placed on the Commission's first report. I therefore ask the Minister now whether he wDl table the correspondence between Mr Justice Fox and himself or at least the letter which his representative describes as being concerned with the interpretation that is placed upon the Commission'sfirstreport. I also ask the Minister who gave the instruction toMr King-What else do you want? Mr E. G. Whitlam- I should have thought that the public would want to know what was in this letter.",22
36,Mr SPEAKER,TRADE UNIONS,The honourable gentleman will continue with his question.,23
37,Mr WHITLAM,TRADE UNIONS,"Mr Speaker, I also ask the Minister Who gave the instruction to the Minister who represents him in the Senate which was quoted by his representative there 2 days ago?",23
38,Mr NEWMAN,TRADE UNIONS,"The Leader of the Opposition is obviously trying to make an issue of the question of private correspondence that I have had with Mr Justice Fox. I assure the House that there is absolutely nothing mysterious or nefarious about this issue. Let me make it clear, first of all, that it is true that my colleague in the other place received instructions that were incorrect. When this came to my notice- I think late on Tuesday night- I telephoned my colleague and told him that those instructions were incorrect. Mr E. G. Whitlam-Where did they come from?",23
39,Mr NEWMAN,TRADE UNIONS,The instructions were issued from my office and I take full responsibility for the incorrect instructions that were issued. That is the simple basis of the matter and it should be taken no further. It is true that I have had private correspondence with Mr Justice Fox. The matter has been satisfactorily resolved between Mr Justice Fox and myself. I will consider the question of tabling the correspondence. CURRENCY DEVALUATION: MEAT NA,23
40,Mr IAN ROBINSON,EXPORTS,My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industry. I such a refer to the devaluation of the Australian dollar or Deand the valuable benefits accruing to depressed is my primary industries throughout the country. I ask the Minister: Has he seen a media report which should make Australian meat more competiand easier to sell on overseas markets but there is no way that Australian exporters can increase prices. received a number of letters from Is this assertion that prices cannot be increased totally inaccurate? What is the true position in relation to meat exports?,23
41,Mr SINCLAIR,EXPORTS,"A number of commodities are sold in different currencies. Meat in some markets is sold in United States dollars, in some markets in Japanese yen and in other markets in Australian dollars at whatever the current exchange rate might be. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics has assessed the gross benefit for the meat industry. There will be a gain to the beef industry of $49m in the remaining 7 months of thisfinancialyear. As to sheep meat there will be a gain of $ 16m. There will be a gain of $9m for other meats. Against that, of course, there will be some offsets in relation to freight charges and, perhaps, some other inputs with regard to the handling, processing and packaging of the product. However, it is totally wrong to suggest that the prices received by Australian exporters and hence by Australian producers will not benefit as a result of the change in Australian currency values announced by the Treasurer the other night. It is true that the meat industry may not be able to increase its prices in other currencies but because of the change in relative values of the Australian dollar there will be a benefitand a significant benefit-flowin g through to Australian producers and exporters who handle those exports. It is that aspect of the change in currency value that brings a very real net benefit to the hard pressed beef producers about whom the honourable gentleman is, I know, so greatly concerned. NA",23
42,Mr INNES,RAID ON COMMUNES,My question is directed to the Minister for Irrunigration and Ethnic Affairs. ask: How many officers of his Department were involved in the raid on Children of God compete munes on the night of 29 November? How many prohibited immigrants were arrested in the ties raids? What was the cost of the exercise? How many communes were raided and in what States and Territories did the raids take place? Did the raids on the communes on 29 November take place with the Minister's full knowledge and proval? Were members of the Press present at any of the raids? Was the prime purpose of the raids to harass and gather information about the Children of God? Will the Minister agree that the raids constitute a blatant violation of civil rights?,24
43,Mr MACKELLAR,RAID ON COMMUNES,"Actin g upon information which came to my Department, visits were made to communes which were occupied by people who described themselves as 'The Children of God'. The communes are present in each of the States and the Territories. I am not sure of the actual number of communes which exist at industry, present. I understand that no prohibited mitry, grants were apprehended during the visits. taken Investigations were made into the present status of some people in the communes. They were aspect found to hold valid visitor visas. The Departported ment receives information from a number of sources in relation to people who are alleged be prohibited migrants and it has a duty to invesparticular tigate those claims. This was one such investigabenefits. tion. I do not believe that any civil liberties infringed in any sense. I am not aware of any newspaper men being present except for a report I received that in one particular instance- I think it was at a commune in Western Australia-on e newspaper man was present. I do not think I have anything to add to that. Mr Innes-How many officers were involved?",24

46,Mr GOODLUCK,ON TASMANIAN INDUSTRIES,"In answer to my very good friend from Swan, it is. Is the Minister aware that the decision to devalue the Australian doUar has been applauded by the Chairman of the Tasmanian State Fruit Board, by all sections of the Tasmanian fruit industry and, incidentaUy, by the Premier of Tasmania? Can the Minister indiI cate whether reports that this important Tasmanian industry will once again be able to comon previously uncertain markets and, in fact, could Uve again, providing new opportuniand stability to a State that is crying out for positive assistance and initiative, are correct?",24
47,Mr SINCLAIR,ON TASMANIAN INDUSTRIES,"As one of my colleagues sitting behind me said, apart from a change of apGovernment in Tasmania probably no greater contribution could be made to the well-being of the people of Tasmania than the recent devaluation. Nearly every sector of the Tasmanian economy has suffered because of the extent to which it has depended upon export markets. The fruit industry, with which the honourable gendeman is particularly concerned, is one for which the Bureau of Agricultural Economics has assessed the gross benefit across Australia at about $900,000. A significant percentage of that, of course, will flow to Tasmania, which is by far the largest fruit exporting State in Australia. I believe that across the whole picture of the rural by the time the gains in the dairy industhe beef industry and the fruit industry are into consideration, the benefit to Tasmania could well be in excess of $2m. The interesting of the decision is that not only is it supby those mentioned by the honourable member for Franklin, but the trade union moveto ment also is explaining to its members that this move is going to bring very substantial I believe that as a result of this decision, were with a change of Government, in Tasmania, it could well be that not only the fruit industry but indeed Tasmania as a whole will live again.

48,Mr BRYANT,EAST TIMOR,"I ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunications: Is it a fact that he has now taken the final steps to silence the voice of the people of East Timor completely by confiscating radio of, and prosecuung, anybody listening to or attempting to communicate with those people? Would this action be in Une with the spirit of the recent decision of the United Nations to condemn the aggression of Indonesia in Timor? Why is he supporting Indonesian agas gression when the world body in fact condemns it? Is not this a pretty poor recompense for the sistance given by the people of East Timor when Australian troops there were radio communications with this country? Is it a fact that Australians who were listening were able to react assisted our people there to overcome aggression in that country? Why does the Minister not act in the spirit of those times instead of accepting Indonesian aggression as fait accompli?",24
49,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,EAST TIMOR,"If the honourable member wants to ask a question on foreign polmust icy, I suggest that he should ask it of the Foreign Minister. My responsibility is to administer the relevant Act. If people use radios for receiving transmitting messages illegaUy, I will take appropriate action. I do not care whether the offence takes place in Darwin or anywhere else. It is very interesting that a lot of concern expressed on this matter. The Department is ceeding continuously against a number of the people. We have cases right throughout with Australia. The honourable member is therefore selecting one decision and trying to make thing out of it. I do not care whether an offence takes place in Darwin or any other part of Australia. If information comes to the Departing, ment or to me that people are illegally using radio equipment, the law will proceed. NA NA",25

51,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,AUTHORITIES IN VICTORIA,"I know that the may Treasurer was making arrangements for the Kingdom funds to be paid to the States immediately on passage and proclamation of the Bill. I therefore expect that local government wiU receive paythat ment very shortly indeed. As the honourable gendeman would know, some thought that payre-elected ments should be spread over a considerable period on a monthly or quarterly basis.

83,Mr JAMES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Last Tuesday night while Government members were still reeling and rolling from the economic blows, reversals and abandonment of poUcies by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Lynch), Government back benchers were having a sordid party in the priof vate dining room of Parliament House. It was a 10-year birthday party for those who were elecin 1966. The party reached its climax when a birthday cake was wheeled in and out juma girl clad in a bikini, the upper half of which was soon doffed. One wonders whether this event could be viewed as the Government's only sucattempt to stimulate the private sector it came to office 12 months ago. Great latitude is given to members in respect of the guests they sponsor in the galleries, the chamber and the dining room. Never, however, would any member, least of aU those with 10 years experience in the Parliament, presume to sponsor a girl a bikini as a guest in the gallery or in the report Mr Armitage-Are these the bare facts?",28
84,Mr JAMES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"These are the bare facts. A cake is not acceptable cover. Members' guests are supposed to enter the dining room openly. This guest was smuggled into the room in a cake. Guests are supposed to be decently clad. A cake not an adequate covering. I am somewhat disappointed, Mr SPEAKER and I anticipate that thousands of Australians will be-at your good self not taking a more to serious view. I have already been consulted by 2 Government backbenchers who expressed their disapproval at what happened at this strip tease party in Parliament House on Tuesday night. WhUst the President of the Senate and Mr Speaker were entertaining, with myself, a visitWith ing British Parliamentary delegation under auspices of the Commonwealth ParUamentary were Association in one private dining room, a tease party was being held by Government members in another.

85,Mr DONALD CAMERON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I wish to speak today on the subject of Taiwanesefishingvessels operating in Australian waters. Before doing so I shall make brief menbut tion-and it deserves nothing more than that-o the remarks of the honourable member for of Hunter (Mr James). As one who was present at the function on Tuesday evening, having seen the responsible way in which members on this side of the chamber responded when we were surprised by certain events, I say that the speech of the honourable member does him no credit. He has a reputation in this place as being muck raker and the bucket tipper every time Australian Labor Party has to dredge someone up to do the dirty work. He continues to fulfil role well; I wish him well in the future. I express concern at the growth in the number of Taiwanesefishingvessels that have been prehended in Australian waters in recent years. In 1972 4 vessels were apprehended. Two were apprehended in 1973 and a further 2 in 1974. 1975 there was a massive increase when 25 vessels were apprehended. In the current year to 23 August 1976, 14 vessels had been apprehended. respect to penalties in 1975 11 vessels were the forfeited andfinesranging from $50 to $500 imposed. AU the forfeited vessels were sold strip back to the former Taiwanese owners for amounts ranging from $785 to $12,600. In 1976, twelve of the 14 vessels apprehended were forfeited. Fines have ranged from $50 to $ 1,000. All of the forfeited vessels have been sold back to the Fedformer Taiwanese owners for amounts ranging I feel from $5,000 to $20,000. this There has been a tremendous increase in the number of Taiwanesefishingvessels encroaching upon the shores of this land. I believe that done considerable damage, particularly to clams in the Great Barrier Reef. long-linefishermenand the clam searchers aU inflicting damage which will not be easily repaired on this nation's marine life which will was need hundreds upon hundreds of years to be This Government, as was the case with the creprevious Australian Government, under the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. has sought through the Law of the Sea Conference to ensure that Australia has a this widened economic and resources zone of some to 200 miles to ensure that we can adequately a ourpoUce our waters and, more importantly, protect resources. There are 2 conventions which are in force. They are the Convention on to rip-offs and the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone and the Convention on the Continental Shelf. The first accords to each country sovereignty subject to a right of innocent passage for foreign shipping over a belt of sea adjacent to its coast the width is not specified. The second Conf vention accords sovereign rights for the purpose exploring and exploiting natural resources to each country over a continental shelf to a depth of200 metres or to where the superjacent waters admit of the exploitation of natural resources. I believe that a majority of the countries taking part in the Law of the Sea Conference are seeking to extend the previous 12-mile territorial sea the limit to a 200-mile wide economic zone. They the also support the establishment of an international agency to explore and exploit the interhis national seabed area for the benefit of mankind, with benefits from its activities to go in part to undeveloped countries. apI believe that over the years we have given sufficient warning to Taiwanesefishermen.I was in Taiwan in 1969, 1970 and 1971. On each In occasion I was there I impressed upon the Government of that country that there was one thing that was happening that was not attracting friends in this country, namely, the continual exploitation by its fishermen of the waters of Australia without regard to the damage that is done in the search for food. I do not suggest for one moment that the less fortunate or developing countries should be pushed back into their own areas. But I believe that the Taiwanese have been warned. They have been told. But regrettably they continue to ignore the wishes of this country. There is little that we can do to stop them from coming close to our country. But, certainly when they are caught, we can take action. I suggest a measure which may well be effecThese tive in our attempt to stop thisfishing.The trade figures for 1975-76 indicate that Australia ing. exported to Taiwain products to the value $114m and imported from Taiwan products to than the value of $ 134m. The balance of trade is well and truly on the side of Taiwan. I believe that on our Barrier Reef one million clams a year are being slaughtered by the Taiwanese fishermen the Australian Government has to go to the prices. Taiwanese Government and say: 'You have cost been warned. We are deadly serious on this matthe ter. If yourfishermencontinue to plunder what tionary belongs to us we will have to consider stopping trade with you as a form of protest.' I cannot understand why the Taiwanese Government worrying. cannot make a greater effort to inform its fisherCynical men that to go into the near waters of Australia will be extremely embarrassing. I did not enjoy delivering this address against Taiwan. I believe that the previous Government made a grave error and sold out our position to mainland China when it simply agreed to recognise China and to dismiss the presence of Taiwan. But that history. Today we deal with the plunder of our clams and our marine Ufe. I ask the Government to give serious consideration to the suggestion that there be a threat of the cessation of trade with Taiwan unless it commences to respect what rightfully belongs to us.",29
86,Mr UREN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"My comments in per this debate regard the housing industry. Most comment on the recent devaluation has been seems about its general economic implications and on the recent distribution of wealth which that supply implies. Most critics say that tion, worsen the real income situation of pensioners and others on fixed incomes, and move resources from labour intensive manufacturing industries to the capital intensive mining sector. That is redistribution from the weak to the strong, from Australian manufacturing to foreign-owned mining companies. Most critics say that the currency speculators who caused the run on the balance of payments which caused devaluation, are also the chief gainers. Most critics say that the Government had open to it other options which would have contained price rises and promoted economic growth. But such options would not have rewarded the rich and penalised the weak. On all this there is agreement. Today I shall make my grievance about the effect of devaluation on housing; that is, on the housing industry, on home buyers and on home builders. Devaluation will affect housing in 3 ways. Firstly, it wiU lead to general price rises. will reduce the real incomes of wage earners, leaving them with less to spend on housSecondly, it will distort the capital market by of making investment in mining more profitable previously. Investors wiU be reluctant to put their funds into housing. They will prefer getas rich-quick returns from mineral speculation to the steady but sure returns from housing investment. Thirdly, it will lead to rises in housing This is partly due to the increases in the of imported housing materials, but mainly to general cost pressures to which a new inflaspiral will lead. If this were the total situation it would be bad enough. But it is the secondary effects of the devaluation which are most speculators have taken nearly $900m out of the country recently in the hope of large capital gains. They will now repatriate it, perhaps over the next 3 to 6 months. They have made a huge HVi per cent profit from their speculations so they will bring back more Australian dollars than they took out. The money is supply growth that this will cause will exceed a bUUon dollars. Growth in money supply wfll be even greater if devaluation leads to the long term capital inflow which is the Government's aim. The implications for domestic liquidity are worrying. Already thisfinancialyear money supply has exceeded the target growth rate of about 12 per cent. It has already grown by almost 16 cent. I do not want to over-emphasise money supply targets, but the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) to think that they are central. If he is to stay on target he will have to cut back the money drastically for the remainder of this finanit will boost inflacial year. The Treasurer foreshadowed this cutback in his Press statement of last Sunday in which he promised a very tight June quarter. When speculators bring their funds back-ver y likely in the same quarter-the Government can be expected to begin a program of tight money and high interest rates. The Treasurer hinted at this last Sunday and I am sure he meant it. The Government's poUcies have come unstuck and its recent decisions have been increasingly ad hoc. The only consistent theme is that the Government is anti-worker, anti-manufacturing and antiAustraUan. It favours the strong and the foreign. It rewards the speculator. But at least in the monetary area it seems determined to achieve its set target of 12 per cent money supply growth. I think the Government has only 2 options if this is its aim. Firstly, it could neutralise the effect of the increase in Uquidity by operaung exclusively in the banking system. Secondly, it could try to sop up the increased Uquidity, partly by borrowing from the pubUc-possibl y along the lines of the iU-fated Australian savings bond of earUer this year-and partly by restricting bank lending. Either option hurts home buyers. In the first case, new bank lending is frozen a combination of calling up bank deposits, that is, by increasing special reserve deposits or by will forcing banks to take up more Government The end bonds and increasing the LGS ratio. At present the banks provide about 50 per cent of all housing finance. Such a poUcy would virtually preemployment vent new lending by the banks for housing and would deny finance to many intending home buyers. It would also force up interest rates. Tbis would lead to a situation where many prospecAustralians, tive home buyers could no longer afford housing. It would also increase the repayments of existing mortgage holders. The more likely Government pokey would be to try to sop up the extra Uquidhome ity by a combination of some restraints on the banking system combined with an attempt induce individual savers to buy government bonds instead of depositing with savings banks or other financial institutions such as building societies. This would have the effect of diverting expired. funds from the banks and building societies so limiting their ability to lend for housing. This would also force up the general level interest rates. This would happen because, order to induce people to take up government bonds, the Government would have to offer atI tractive interest rates. I think that a rate rise least 2 per cent can be expected. It means at a 16 per cent increase in monthly repayments an average housing loan. For example, it means that a person on an average income will be required to pay almost 27 per cent of his income on housing repayments, as against 23 per cent now if he had borrowed $20,000 repayable over 25 years. If he borrows $25,000 his repayments wiU rise by 30 per cent to 34 per cent of his income. If interest rates rise by 1 per cent mortage payments will increase by $ 14 a month on a 20,000 loan and $18 a month on a $25,000 loan. I expect the rate to rise by at least 2 per cent over the next year. This means monthly increases of at least $28 and $36 respectively. The effects of this devaluation will price housing out of the reach of the average worker. Also it will dry up the supply of housing funds as a result of the Government's attempts to contain the growth in money supply as speculators cash in their gains. The situation for the average home buyer wiU be worse if the Government's threats to reduce real incomes by a penal wage policy succeed. People on average incomes cannot afford to pay more than 25 per cent of their income on housing. Under this scheme they will have to pay much more than that. If this devaluation causes prices to rise, the supply of finance to dry up, interest rates to rise and real by incomes to fall, what will be the result? Workers not be able to afford housing. Even if they could, they would not be able to obtain finance. result is disaster for intending home buyers, deprivation for existing owners and unfor those who work in the industry. The currency speculators have a lot to answer for. This Government is betraying its responsibilities to protect the interests of the ordinary both those seeking a home and those already committed to heavy repayments.

That industry is one in which there should be growth to and development in the next decade.",30

The honourable member's time has and Mr RUDDOCK (Parramatta) (11.51)-I am pleased to be able to follow the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) in this debate beof cause he and I have adjoining electorates and I in dare say we are both interested in the consequences of devaluation in our own communities. was surprised that he suggested that the manuof at facturing industry would not be assisted as a least result of the Government's decision. He would on know as I do that in the electorates which we serve there are large numbers of manufacturing industries that have suffered extensively as a result of export competition in this country.

Our areas generally exhibit the worse unemployment in the State of New South Wales. The efforts of this New Government will help to correct The reasons for the decision were that with excessive wage costs our currency had become representing over-valued, our manufacturing industries could not compete and therefore they ings.

To suggest that manufacturing industry will not be helped as a result of that decision quite specious. In fact I would suggest that, criticising the decision that has been taken, Deputy Leader of the Opposition is jeopardising the employment possibuities of many people the area that they know best-in the manufactursuggests ing industry in this country. He would know, says: when he spoke briefly about the money supply, One that the guru of monetarist theories, Milton in New Friedman, was reported in the Australian today the as saying: I think that Mr Fraser has set about not only correcting course of Australia's economic future-and present-bu t setreasons tine realistic guidelines which one can see achieving stability and confidence. I would say, from my understanding, that areas Australia is very well regarded internationally because now-and this is comparatively rare among at the moment-it appears to be pursuing a mature and steady course. To suggest that monetarists would be displeased with the decisions that have been taken is stretching our credibility too far. Today I want to speak in this grievance debate nationalisation, about the sabotage of this Government's omic policy by the New South Wales Labor Government. Honourable members would know that the Premier of New South Wales produced proposals for a change in the Commonwealth clubs Government's economic policy entitled 'A he Special Economic Recovery Program' of 1976. honourable members take the time to read that paper they will see there a number of significant statements. I propose to go through them. The Premier recognises something that I have known for some time. In point 1 of his paper he says: South Wales has the highest unemployment rate of that situation. all mainland States. In point 2 he says: New South Wales has the largest number of unemployed, 44 per cent of the Australian total. had to make savHe says in point 4: South Wales has been experiencing a slower rate of capital investment in many areas than has been the case to co-operate in in other States. Those comments are significant. I have taken out Austhe unemploymentfiguresfor New South Wales for the time since the Labor Government came into office in that State. Only in the last quarter figuresin that State fall. In Victoria over the same period the number of unemployed fell each month. Let me read thefigures.In June the the New South Walesfigureswere up by 5796 and in Victoria by 325. In July they were up into New South Wales by 4870 and down in Victoria this by 1250. In August they were up 1000 in New been South Wales and down by 2471 in Victoria. In September they were up by 602 in New South is Wales and down in Victoria by 1812. These are by significantfigures.At the time when unemploythe ment in New South Wales was increasing Victoria was managing to decrease the number of in unemployed. The Premier of New South Wales certain reasons for this situation. He of the causes of the particularly severe unemployment South Wales is the high content of heavy industry in State's traditional pattern of manufacturing. Superimposed on this has been an extraordinary coincidence of acute recession in both segments of the building and construction the industry-the dwelling and the non-dwelling sections-for which are largely different as between the two. The resulting unemployment is State-wide affecting non-urban as well as the industrial centres. It has a high content of young people and female office workers, as well as of unWestern nations skilled and semi-skilled males. They are not the reasons for the economic decUne in New South Wales in comparison with the situation in Victoria. Why could the Premier not have been more realistic? The basic reasons are these: There is in New South Wales a spectre of a socialist government in office determined to undermine the morale and coneconfidence of the business community. What does the Premier want to do? He says first of aU that he wants to take over the race because they are full of vested interests, as calls them. He says that he wants to take over If the Australian Gas Light Company Ltd and puts certain reasons for that. Why would people nave confidence in New South Wales when they know that the Government proposes to pursue poUcies of that nature? I draw the attention of honourable members to an article that appeared in the Sydney Sun on Wednesday, 27 October. It contains a picture of Mr Wran under the heading 'Do Not Leave Us Plea by Wran. New South Wales Jobs Going South'. Mr Wran knows that as a result of the poUcies that he has pursued manufacturers have a lack of confidence in him and they do not want to be in New South Wales. If they can move out of that State, they will. They will go to other States where they will find a more attractive environment. Mr Wran wonders why the construction industry is in trouble. I can teU him. The reason is that the statements of his colleagues have created the spectre of rent control. Who would want to construct home units in New South Wales with the possibiUty of a nil return, as was the case under the former Labor Administration when rent control was retained for so long? The honourable member for Chifley sent me an article recently about the lack of car sales in New South Wales. Last week an article appeared in the business and finance section of the Australian. It points out very clearly that New South Wales holds back the car boom. The figures in Victoria and other States are quite satisfactory but the figures in New South Wales are down. Honourable members must ask themselves why this has been the case. It is because New South Wales has unique conditions which it has introduced before any other State in relation to emission control. Why would manufacturers find that their market is falling in New South Wales when they are holding it in other States? The other significant reason is that the New South Wales Government has set about to bash the car retailers in New South Wales with the sort of legislation that it has advanced to deal with shyster operators, as it tends to caU them. This legislation is far more expressive, far stronger and harsher than legislation adopted in other States. These are the reasons for the decline in car sales in New South Wales. Finally, in the area of wage control, Mr Wran uses a blackmail technique. He says that wage control is essential and then attempts to blackmail the Federal Government into giving him additional funds with the promise of offering wage control to the Federal Government. His is a disastrous economic package. It does him no credit.",32
89,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,33
90,Mr ARMITAGE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I wish to grieve about the activities of the honourable member for Phillip, Mr Birney. I refer particularly to an article in yesterday's Sydney Sun under the heading 'Fee For Our ""Paris Palace"". $2.2m to Architect'. Mr Birney raised this matter during the adjournment debate on Tuesday night. The House always knows when he is to have a major story in the Sydney Press because he always speaks in the adjournment debate late at night and reads a prepared script from a mini lectern which he brings into the House and places before bim just like in a high school debate. In fact, he is typical of an amateurish oncer. Joe Riordan, who lost the seat of Phillip at the last election and who will regain it at the next election, is fuUy aware of that. Mr Birney's wife is a journalist with the Sydney Press and it is well known that she uses her position to obtain publicity for her husband and to have her stories printed. Surely this is a case of collusion for their own private interests.",33
91,Mr UREN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Who is that?,33
92,Mr ARMITAGE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I refer to the wife of the honourable member for Phillip. For example, I refer to the story about the Russian submarine which turned out to be a whale. She had heard the story but she did not have any proof. So she got her husband to use the 'coward's castle' of parUamentary privilege so that her story could be printed and her husband could have publicity without a writ for defamation being issued. Without a doubt, if that story had been related outside this Parliament, a writ would have been issued. On Tuesday night they used the coward's castle once again to blacken the name of Australia's most distinguished architect. I quote the Sun which states: Mr Seidler is Australia's best-known contemporary architect and has won dozens of awards for his designs both at home and abroad. Without a doubt, he is Australia's most famous, best known and most respected contemporary architect. I will state a few facts concerning this incorrect allegation against Mr Harry Seidler. The brief for a building in Paris for our Embassy was prepared by an interdepartmental committee in 1969 on the direction of the Gorton Government-not , as suggested by Mr Birney, by the Whitlam Government. Approval to purchase the land was given by the MCMahon Government in 1972. It cost $ 18m. Of that $ 18m the cost of the land was $7.4m. It was a good buy, by the way, because at the present rate of inflation in France, which is less than it has been for some years, the land would now be worth at least $14m. The architect was commissioned by the Whitlam Government. As I said, he is Australia's most distinguished architect. The article in Sun states: He designed the Australia Square tower and the complex in Martin Place.",33
93,Mr UREN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,And the Trade Group Buildings here in Canberra.,34
94,Mr ARMITAGE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"That is correct. He is of the fees. presently lecturing at Harvard University in America where he is serving a 4-month appointIs ment as visiting Professor of Architecture. should also be remembered that Paris is among the top five of our diplomatic posts, and, in contains 3 Missions in one. For example, building will house the Australian Embassy France, which is a permanent member of the curity Council and a major world power. It also house the Australian Mission to the Organisnight ation for Economic Co-Operation and Developarchitect ment and the Australian Mission to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, a most prestigious branch of the Umted Nations. As I said, it will be 3 Missions one. Mr Charles Jones-It will also house the gations ECMT-the European Conference of Ministers side of Transport.",34
95,Mr ARMITAGE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I stand corrected by the honourable member for Newcastle. Further, the Phillip building replaces rented accommodation for offices and residential accommodation which of costs approximately $ 1 m per annum. These costs are rising steadily and, therefore, it is deal for Australia. Mr Birney said that over $2.Sm would go 'straight into Seidler's pocket'.

98,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Lucock)Order! I point out to the honourable member for Chifley that he should not refer to the honourhe able member for Phillip by name.,34
99,Mr ARMITAGE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Than k you, Mr Deputy Speaker. If the honourable member had done homework better he would have discovered that the fee of 11 per cent, which he has libellously declared goes into Mr Seidler's pocket is, in the for the payment of fees of a host of consultant firms involved in the construction of the building. MLC These firms are mechanical engineers, structural engineers, electrical engineers, insurance assessors, etc. In fact, Mr Seidler's own firm received only 3 per cent of the fee of 11 per cent. Consultants of French origin received 6 per cent it any wonder that people are saying today It that not only does the honourable member for Phillip not know the difference between a subfact, marine and a whale but also that he does not the even know which government made decisionsto whether it was the Gorton Government, the SeMCMahon Government or the Whitlam Governwill ment. He thought that his attack on Tuesday was upon Australia's most distinguished and upon the Whidam Government, but he also attacked the Gorton Government and the MCMahon Government. In view of this, is it any wonder that people are now saying: 'It is inJoe Riordan to win in 1978'? I want to make a challenge in addition to challenging the honourable member for Phillip to make these alleagainst Australia s greatest architect outthis House and to take his chance of copping a writ for defamation. I also call upon the Sydney Sun newspaper, the honourable member for and his wife to ensure that this reply given today to these libellous accusations against one Australia's greatest people are printed fully in the Sydney Sun. not a bad Mr THOMSON (Leichhardt) (12.11)on the of the fiasco of the interrupted debate White Paper on defence last Thursday, I in this grievance debate. homethis matter and I shall make only atovery only opportunity speak on short speech. I am appalled at the very low priority given to the vital subject of the security of the nation. I strongly support the White Paper on defence and congratulate the Minister for Defence to(Mr Kilien) on it. It provides a valuable guide to discussion and debate and it deserved a much better fate in this chamber. It is the most compredocument on defence presented to this Parliament.",34
100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Lucock)Order! I suggest to the honourable member that might be able to say exactly the same thing without referring to the White Paper. This would make the task of the Chair a Uttle easier. his Mr THOMSOM-I accept your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. Inevitably, some questions on defence are left unanswered. After over 30 years fact,of wide and varied experience in the defence forces, I am very well aware of the immense complexity of the issues and of how Uttle any one man can know and understand unless he is engaged full dme in this field. I wish to confine myself to 2 major issues: Firsdy, national aims and objectives and, secondly, the provision of effective deterrent to armed attack on the nation. Because of the vital importance of the security the nation and the immense cost of effective fence, it is of the first importance national aims and objectives should be clearly and simply stated. All those concerned with defence of the nation are facing a fundamentally new, challenging and exciting task. Now for the first time we as a nation have a firmly stated accepted responsibUity for the defence of our whole continent. It takes time to change national attitudes. Perhaps it is too soon to have achieved a complete reassessment of our aims and objecunique tives based on our new responsibUity to defend ourselves. Major questions of approach and phUosophy have to be decided. Until these are decided cannot get the right answers on the shape size of our defence forces or on the most effective level of technology and the related problems logistics and local defence production. Our national strategic objectives should be a nation of military, poltiical and economic tors, preferably compatible but often conflicting. For example, in 1965 and 1966 Australian vicemen werefightingIndonesians in East Malaysia during confrontation. At the same time we maintained diplomatic relations with contingency Indonesia and continued to give aid. As one volved in that smaU operation, I believe that a realistic and practical decision. We must now take a hard and realistic look our present situation. We cannot always in the future depend upon the protection of a great power. In differing sets of circumstances we find that the interests of our major alUes and interests are not the same. The key to our poUcy remains the strength of our alUance with the United States and the ANZUS treaty. Yet this alliance, however strong it may be, must luU us into a false sense of security. We cannot rely upon treaties alone to protect us. John Hobbs, the 18th century philosopher, said: 'Covenants without swords are but Australia has far too few swords to back its covenants. Our swords are blunt. We do not have sufficient capacity to sharpen our own swords to make new ones. It is imperative that we should have an independent defence against potential threats which might arise in our area or neighbourhood. These threats may not necessarily be identified as potential threats to the United States. Most of our neighbours are not potential enemies of the United States but in some circumstances we could be in conflict with them. If we accept that an in some circumstances the United States may not always be willing or able to support us, we must of be capable of conducting an independent miUdetary defence and of possessing a credible, that the independent military deterrent. Ourfirstpriority is to provide forces for the the most effective independent defence of Australia, its islands and its seas, within our capacity to do so. Our second priority is for a defence readiness and in situations where we would have the support of a great power. The defence of Australia requires very different forces from those required for our old posture of forward defence. Our position is and requires unique solutions. These new priorities must make us question the whole structure of our forces and their support from within our own resources. The very high cost of modern we defence equipment makes a clear definition of and national strategic aims and objectives very important indeed. Without clearly stated aims of there will always be the temptation to purchase better and more expensive equipment to replace combidated and aging equipment. This tendency is facknown as the 'replacement syndrome'. It may well be vaUd that we do need more of the same serequipment but this is not necessarily so. We Uve in a very uncertain and rapidly changing part of the world. This caUs for very sound planning by the Services. The shape, insize and the equipment of the defence forces was must be able to cope with quite unexpected contingencies at short notice. These may start as at smaU-scale operations which could escalate rapidly. I have considerable respect for the procedures within the Department of Defence may which evaluate policies and requirements and our which advise the Government. I wish to make defence one point about defence planning. In the organisation chart of the policy divisions of Defence Central I note there are very few senior not military planners and large numbers of senior civilians. There seems to be an imbalance, which is reflected in parts of recent statements. This could lead to inadequate military input into dewords'. fence poUcies and planning. Unless national aims and objectives are clearly stated by the Government these defence planor ners will operate without adequate guidance. There is perhaps a temptation to give undue weight to the 'replacement syndrome' and to the desire to maintain the state of the art in a wide range of capabiUties which may not be relevant to the national aims. It may be that all the decisions made are the best possible in the circumstances. However, there will always be a difiicult argument in favour of a few technologically advanced and very expensive pieces of equipment against the counter argument that our independent defence capacity would be best served by having a large number of cheaper, less sophisticated pieces of equipment. I hope my few points on the need for clear national aims and objectives will help to kindle debate and interest in this major issue, both inside and outside this chamber. I wish now to deal with my second major point; our ability to deter any threat. We have a unique situation. It is fashionable to compare Australia with Sweden and Switzerland. This comparison is not relevant. Our strategic circumstances could not be more different. We are a great island continent and an enemy can reach our shores only by air or over or under the sea. Therefore, our most important national strategic objective should be the capacity to deter or to defer the mounting of major operations against Australia. The priority should be against the higher levels of threat. The best way to achieve this rnilitary objective would be to cause a would be aggressor to face the problem of mounting a large-scale tri-Service operation by air and by sea. Provided Australia has adequate air and sea surveillance capacity such an invasion force would be very vulnerable to attack far from our shores. This situation empha- agencies, sises the importance of the Navy and the Air Force. But it does not mean for a moment that the importance of the Army as part of the deterrent force should be under-rated. The capacity and structure of the Army will determine the quality and quantity of men and material an aggressor would have to deUver and sustain in Australia in a conventional rnilitary operation. We can and must acquire the capacity to cause a potential aggressor to mount a disproportionate response in terms of money, time and material. If we possess a credible deterrent there are few powers which have the capacity to threaten us. It must be made just too difficult. This strengthens our position in foreign negotiations, and makes it much less Ukely that we will be forced into poltiical and diplomatic actions which are not in the national interest. I have not mentioned the most important part of our defence forces-the men and women of the Services. I conclude with this quotation: Nothing has' ever been made until the soldier has made safe thefieldwhere the building shall be built: And the soldier is the scaffolding until it has been built, and the soldier gets no reward but honour.",34
101,Dr JENKINS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I am very conscious of the effects on the electorate that I represent of the economic mismanagement of this Government. My electorate, while it contains substantial industrial and commercial areas, is predominantly a working class dormitory area. Mr Keith Johnson-And well represented, too.",36
102,Dr JENKINS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I thank the honourable member for suggesting it is well represented. What is causing me increasing alarm, as the electorate is such a working class area and as there is such a high number of young people about to leave school, are the reports that are reaching me and shocking me from voluntary organisations in the area and from the individuals who caU at my office in the electorate stressing the hopelessness of school leavers in obtaining employment. The editorial in this morning's Melbourne Age which, as I intended to raise this matter today, I noted, is significant for it sheets home a lot of the blame where it Ues. It reads: The Federal Government has scarcely begun to recognise the extent of youth unemployment now, let alone take measures to cope with the long-term structural problems. There is still a feeding within the Government that as only 22 per cent of the total unemployed are family breadwinners, unemployment is not so serious as it seems; besides, it is a useful discipline to enforce wage restraint in the-fight against inflation. Other Western countries, by contrast, have pursued much more active policies to reduce unemployment by job creation schemes, emergency employment by public subsidies to employers to take on jobless young people, and large-scale manpower training schemes. AU we get from this Government are programs such as the community youth support scheme which will give young people a bit of pocket money for fares if they go and do community service work. The editorial reminded me of an article which appeared in Newsweek, the overseas magazine, about 6 weeks ago which emphasised the point that Malcolm Fraser, the Prime Minister, at the last election made dole bludgers a key issue. That article stated that at that time: . . . many of Australia's newspapers ran sensational stories about young and healthy 'dole dollies' who collect numerous welfare cheques under a variety of assumed names and pool the proceeds to live in splendour along Australia's gold coast or used their dole money to maintain comfortable existences as surf bums. The article continued: Under close examination, some of the sensational newspaper stories have turned out to be more than a little exaggerated. I suggest that the records of detection of such illegal obtaining of benefits confirms this attigiven. tude. The allegation was a poltiical catcher/ by desperate men who claimed to be economic young managers but who could prove not much of what be apprenticed, they said. In fact, they could not manage a pubUc Victorian toUet properly. The article goes on: There are some politicians, even in Fraser's coalition, fear that the fusillade against electoral backlash against the Government-and will hurt people who really have been victimised by Australia's economic problems. Many young Australians, for instance, find few jobs open to them upon graduation from school. Let me foUow up that point by reading a letter written by a father who called to see me the other day. The letter outlines one of the many human problems that is occurring because of this Government's mismanagement. The letter conscious reads: I wish to bring to your notice an anomaly which exists concerning my son Peter . . . and which doubt will concern many other school leavers of 1976. Peter is 17 years old and has been attending Preston nical College doing Sth form, the three terms were, Plumbing 1st term, Electrical 2nd term, and Carpentry and Joinery 3rd term. He has had his heart set on doing Carpentry and for some years and it is his wish to be apprenticed trade. He is not returning to college next year 1977, finished his classes on the Sth November returning on the 10th to do his Science exam. My wife and myself, since time have been to many builders, joinery works and trying to have him apprenticed, but with no luck. He has applied to the Railways Department, Australia, MMBW and the Victorian Construction pany, but up to date no progress. Peter is registered apprenticeship commission. Last Friday 19th November he registered with the for work if possible as apprentice carpentry and joinery. Monday 22nd hefilledin a green form for Social Service, he was told to brine it back to CES at 8.4S a.m. Friday, November, which he did, then he was told that he a clearance letter from Preston Tech that he hadfinishedall of his exams, and that he was not going back to College next year (1977), the Vice Principal told Peter that he could not give him any such letter him to go back to the CES. We are now dumfounded as to what to do now, Peter cannot get any Social Services until somebody stops the duckshoving. Where the blame lies I do not know, but would ful if you couldfindout some facts for me. That one case iUustrates so much of the present problem and indicates the hopelessness of so many young people who are looking for apprenation ticeships in the community. Neither this Governbeen ment nor its State counterpart has been able to satisfy the demand. For every apprenticeship vacancy in Victoria there are goodness knows how many applicants. The letter also shows the hopelessness of these young school leavers looking for jobs and the lack of assistance that is With regard to unemployment benefits for a man who is willing to work and wUling to my inquiries indicate that the Department of Education has instructed the principals of its schools that they who cannot issue certificates, stating that a youngster the dole bludgers will spark an also will not resume school, until the beginning of the next school year. This means that there is collusion to disguise the extent of the problem, to deny young people benefits and to deny them any encouragement. I believe this factor will become much worse in the next few months. On behalf of so many young people affected in my area and in many other areas, I ask that at least some effort be made on this matter instead of this constant mouthing of poltiical slogans by I believe people who claim to be great economic manno agers but who have shown themselves completely incompetent by worsening a situation Techmany times in the short space of 11 months. in 1976.

104,Mr HODGES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I want to concentrate my remarks on what I beheve will be thankbe one of the gravest problems facing the housing of our people during the next 2 decades. The problem I identify is the lack of rental accommodation avaUable, and the seriousness of the situshould not be underestimated. There has an alarming fall-off in the numbers of units being constructed for rent in recenttimesand the reasons for this trend I intend to outline in more detail. Before doing so, though, I want to make it clear to the House that I am of the firm belief that in home ownership should be the prime objective. This Government stands for home ownership and has demonstrated its willingness to fulfil objective by the reintroduction of the home ings grant scheme as a positive form of encourof agement to first time home seekers. The seldom equalled stability of this nation is due in no small way to the large percentage of families who acquired their own homes. Home ownership has often been referred the 'great Australian dream'. It is a goal that been achieved by a high percentage of our familprivate ies and is a clear indication that Australians a deal of emphasis on home ownership. The flats. dream of home ownership has become a reality for countless thousands of Australian families. These people have reaUy staked their claim and having done so have developed a greater sense of pride in their person, families, cities and towns, and nation. We as a Government will continue to engender this feeUng in bur people by providing incentive and encouragement lesser towards home ownership. Our chUdren and our chUdren's chUdren will be infinitely better citiremain zens if they are cared for and brought up in atmosphere of a home that is the property of the family. Although our objectives remain firm, must not adopt an ostrich approach of burying our heads in the sand for at the present time there are clear indications that it is the desire more and more single people, young marrieds and elderly and retired peopleto Uve in rented premises. \^ Recendy a comprehensive study in south-east Queensland titled Moreton Region Growth Strategy Investigations predicted that by year 2000 the Moreton region would have a population of 1 800 000-a n increase of At 750 000-and that flat dweUers would rise from in the present 12 per cent to an estimated 25 cent. Last December a report tided Housing for, Australia by a task force of the Australian Instiposits tute of Urban Studies found that faUure of the rental market was one of the most urgent probbe lems facing Australian housing. Whether we Uke it or not there is a tendency toward greater mobUity of our population and this may be the reason for the drift to voluntary renting. Young people especially have developed a lust for travel both within Australia and overseas and this may well be sapping the capital that was previously being directed mencementsIn towards home ownership. Involuntary renters are being created by rapmenced. idly escalating building costs and high interest rates and the fact that local authority land development and building standard in that year. requirements are becoming more stringent. that These factors are pushing costs higher and savhigher and putting home ownership out of reach more people. The indications clearly show that whether they be voluntary or involuntary, renters are on the increase. Shelter must be prohave vided and the rental accommodation component must be avaUable to meet the demand. Rental accommodation falls into 2 basic categories, to as namely, public housing which is built and has administered by State housing authorities and housing. Both of these categories can be place divided into rental homes and rental units or In the case of pubUc housing there is an on going need for State authorities to ensure that the maximum benefit is obtained from the capital outlay. There are many instances of fanulies of two and three people occupying 3-bedroom homes long after they could have moved into accommodation, thereby freeing the larger premises for a bigger family. Rents frequently at too low a level and act as a disincentive the for people whose financial position may have altered to such an extent as to warrant their vawe cating to make way for a more needy family. In these circumstances if disturbance appears warranted and is contemplated, I recognise the need of to view each case on its merits. There will be instances where health, age or other factors may indicate that a particular family should remain x undisturbed. It is in the area of private housing for rental that my main concern lies. The increased dethe mand will be met only if entrepreneurs can obtain a reasonable return on capital invested. the present time, investors can expect a return the vicinity of 8 per cent to 9 per cent which is per inadequate when compared with returns from rented shops, building societies, bank fixed deand so on. The mvestor may be prepared to accept the lower return if he knows there will a substantial capital gain. If a large portion of the capital has to be borrowed at current high interest rates then servicing the loan will result in a much reduced capital gain. It is not surprising then to find that private other dwelUngs, which are principally flats and units for rental, showed a faU in the number of commencements during 1974-75. In 1972-73 private other dwelling com1973-74 , in the private sector totalled 38 629. this rose to 41 709 dwelUngs. We saw a faU in 1974-75 to 40 731 dwellings comWhat is even more distressing is the fact that we had a dramatic fall in commencements in 1975-76. Only 26 012 commencements occurred Now that the problem has been indentified, how best can the difficulties be overcome? Firstly, I beheve the Government should set the Indicative Planning Council the task of a in-depth study of the problem. A maximum of up-to-date data should be available in order that the problem can be accurately assessed and a plan evolved to ensure that private sector fidence returns to this part of the housing indusregulate try. The Australian Institute of Urban Studies to be commended for its work in this area. It plores the problem in some depth and detail its December 1975 report on housing for that Australia is a document worthy of consideration by the Minister fbr Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) and his Department. One recommendation of this report deals with specific pro-investment poUcies and suggests that private investment in rental housing should be encouraged by providing an for investment allowance or depreciation allowance for income tax purposes. Until the yield on this sort of investment is improved, entrepreneurs wiU be lacking. The position is becoming quite critical and some action must be instigated to alleviate it otherwise thousands of Australians will be withservices out decent shelter. It is well recognised that supply is low and demand increasing, the conof sumer pays more. As rental accommodation beworkers comes scarcer, rents will rise and only those who are better placedfinanciallywUl be able to afford to rent. What then happens to the low income earners-the pensioners and disadvantaged expected groups? It is obvious they will have nowhere go. It should be remembered and emphasised that the decUne in avaUabUity of rental accomexpected modation occurred under the Whidam Labor action Adrninistration. From thefiguresthat I have quoted, it is quite obvious that this decline occurred a Uttle longer than 2 years ago. I trust that that Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development and his Department most will have a serious look at this matter of the of rental accommodation.",37
105,Mr INNES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Iriseto draw again to the attention of the House the question of migrant resource centres. Though the Government is showing some reticence about fact, as I understand it on 4 November Cabinet made a number of decisions. Firstly, it approved the establishment of 2 experimental migrant into resource centres-on e in Melbourne to be people operated under contract by the Australian Greek Welfare Society, and one in Sydney at a total cost not exceeding $70,000 in the current financial year. Secondly, it agreed that the centres would operate initiaUy for 2 years. Thirdly, it agreed that the Departments of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Social Security should draw up a formore mal agreement between the Commonwealth and the Australian Greek Welfare Society setting out the basis of the provision of services by the Sothen ciety for and on behalf of the Commonwealth. conA similar agreement is to be drawn up to the operation of the Sydney centre. The is whole caboodle has to be cleared by the Departexments of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the and Treasury and the Attorney-General. I suppose this could be referred to as a form of legal overkUl. For those reasons I would Uke to direct the attention of the House to what is clearly, in my view, a case of shameless tokenism. The Government is preparing to indulge in a massive propaganda exercise aimed at but not the ethnic people in this country. In the light of recent developments I feel confirmed in this opinion. The Government's public relations exercise becomes very plain if we look at the functions which the migrant resources centres will be expected to provide. They will be expected to provide a multi-lingual reference and information point for migrants, particularly in respect of provided by Commonwealth, State and when local government intrumentaUties, and a range resources which would be accessible to social and welfare officers working with migrants, to ethnic community leaders, welfare administrators, teachers and students interested in migrant problems, and so on. They wiU be to provide fatilities for use by migrant to organisations such as for meetings and duplication of information material. They will be to encourage and co-ordinate voluntary by groups and individuals to assist in the successful integration of migrants and to help overcome the problems of individuals. They will provide a range of reference and information material in English and in the foreign languages used locally. They will be expected to draw lack attention to the particular problems of ethnic communities and individual migrants requiring Government action. This is a pretty formidable table of functions. The people who staff these centres will need to be the sociologists, archivists, ombudsmen, social workers, psychologists, librarians, lobbyists, receptionists and super-administrators, all rolled one, and multi-lingual into the bargain. Such do not grow on trees. They would need to be paid handsomely and ideally, if the centres are to carry out these functions with any effectiveness at all, a number of people, each with some of the various skills, should be taken on. Yet what is the Government providing for this great venture? It is providing $70,000, a paltry sum indeed. That will barely cover the cost of accommodation and the salary of one or perhaps two, at a pinch, full-time officers in each centre. There will be nothing left for incidental office expenditure or for the day to day expenses which a centre with such grandiose aims as I have just listed will inevitably incur. Another point which ought to be made is this: What about other ethnic communities? The cynical electorally oriented tokenism which this represents is to be deplored. The Government has come up with a good idea, but why will it not act on it now? Why will it not provide the wherewithal necessary to enable the centres to carry out the laudable functions allotted to them? I knowtimesare bad and that the Government has a particular economic strategy which it pigheadedly sticks to despite the evidence that it is totally inappropriate. But this is no excuse for tokenism. If the Government is not fair dinkum it should say so. It will not fool the ethnic people with its empty gesture in any case, no matter how loudly it beats its chest when the announcement is eventually made in the sweet bye and bye. Only when the Government decides to estabhsh migrant resource centres that will cover the whole range of issues to which I have referred and which will cope with the problems of ethnic communities generally in this country and put the centres on a proper footing will it have any claim on the goodwill of the migrant people. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA",39
106,Mr WENTWORTH,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I ask leave to make a personal explanation.,40
107,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Mr Drummond)Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,40
108,Mr WENTWORTH,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Yes. My attention was drawn a few moments ago to an article which appeared this morning in the Melbourne Sun. I will read the offending passage. It refers to a meeting of the Government Parties and States: Only the rebel N.S.W. Liberal M.P., Mr Wentworth, openly opposed the devaluation decision at the joint meeting. This is completely untrue. I have not opposed the devaluation decision, either there or elsewhere. In point of fact I not only supported it but also for some months I have been suggesting it. Apparently the confusion arises because I did oppose certain of the decisions which were taken following the devaluation decision. I still am opposed to some of those decisions. I am glad to say that some of them already have been ameliorated and for that, at least, I can take, I hope, some credit. NA NA Interim Report",40
109,Mr BEAZLEY,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,I present the interim report from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on its inquiry into the Lebanon crisis. Ordered that the report be printed.,40
110,Mr BEAZLEY,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,I seek leave to make a brief statement in relation to the report?,40
111,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"Mr Drummond)Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",40
112,Mr BEAZLEY,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"In May this year the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence decided to investigate the significance of the Lebanon crisis. The Lebanon crisis- a civil warhas an international outreach because the Middle East is a region of ideological, religious and strategic concern to great powers, to the Jewish communities throughout the world and to Arab peoples and governments. There is a natural concern among Australia's Lebanese community. The Committee has taken voluminous evidence and held informal discussions with people who have first hand knowledge of the Lebanon crisis. A comprehensive report to the Parliament will be presented during the Autumn session covering all aspects of our terms of reference. In the meantime the Committee has found it necessary to make an interim report on what are mainly the humanitarian aspects of the crisis. Lebanon needs help. This interim report comes at a time when the possibilities for helping victims of the civil conflict in Lebanon are better than they have been over the last 18 months because the latest ceasefireseems to be holding well, notwithstanding that frequent failures of previous efforts at armistice have dashed hopes for peace and sanity. The traditional 'national pact' between fairly equally balanced communities of Christians, party Muslims and Druzes has disintegrated. Under the impact of 18 months of violence, vendetta and retribution, Lebanon's consensus has broken down. Factionalism, fears of genocide, and economic and social status disparities will make the reconciliation process very difficult. It is probable that disinterested care for the people of Lebanon by powers like Australia could heal a situation aggravated by powers whichfishin troubled waters with the ultimate aim of territhe torial expansion or ideological influence. The human tragedy and devastation resulting from the Lebanon crisis is so immense that create claims of great moral weight on other nations to take action to alleviate suffering. number of dead may be as high as 60 000 withphere further 200 000 wounded. These are casualties a population of 3 million. Compare these figuresstates with the 46 000 United States servicemen killed in Vietnam over 12 years and the disastrous impact of the war on a small state Uke Lebanonrefugees can be realised. Possibly a third of Lebanon's 3 mUlion have fled the country and there are many more homeless, wounded, sick and Lebanon. The Lebanese people are critically in need of assistance but aid programs have faced deUberate obstruction, corruption and immense physical difficulties including the chronic state insecurity due to indiscriminate kUling, and complete breakdown of Lebanon's economy, communications, and service infrastructures. A necessary condition for the healing process in Lebanon is the cessation of all outside ference in a country which for many years has managed to Uve a much more prosperous exist-the ence than the non-oU producing Arab states. Thismay outside intervention is initially and tragicaUy tributable to the Palestinians. They came Lebanon as refugees but have since adopted disruptive role in Lebanon's internal affairs. Their interference in Lebanese politics, possibly at foreign behest and certainly with foreign port, constitutes abuse of Lebanese hospitality. Syria, Iraq, Libya and several other countries have intervened. Syria's intervention has been overt. Iraq's and Libya's intervention has mainly through influence on the Palestinians, propaganda of intransigence, as well as money and 'volunteers'. Lebanon's Government benefit from Syrian intervention, whatever Syria's motives. Iraq and Libya have tended to frustrate a solution to the Lebanon crisis. The existence of a recognised government authority in Lebanon, however disintegrated and impotent that Government's administrative structure may be, has contributed to a great reluctance by Australia as well as many other nations, to raise this issue of the tragedy of Lebanon, including foreign intervention in Lebanon, in international forums, such as the United Nations. This is despite the fact that has been a clear breach of the United Nation's Charter, and despite a manifest threat to peace Middle East. This is not simply due to the apparent futiUty of taking such matters to the Umted Nations, but also in deference to the fact that world discussion and United Nations action theywould not be welcomed by some Arab states. Aid for the Lebanese people has been totally inThe adequate. This is in part because of an atmosa of deceit surrounding the crisis. Leaders of in the various participants, including those Arab actively involved, want the United Nations to keep out. Therefore appeals for aid are minimal and people in flight have not been declared by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The United Nations definition of what constitutes a refugee clearly people appUes to many uprooted from Lebanon and destitute within within Lebanon. The Committee does not believe that Australia has so far been particularly generous in the unhappy predicament of the Lebanese people. In of the 9 months ending 30 September 1976 only the 1835 Lebanese arrived in Australia. They were mostly close relatives of Australian resident Lebanese. We have sent no medical teams there, despite the fact that the International Red Cross has had only 16 doctors and nurses in Lebanon. interThe lack of adequate reaction by the International Committee of the Red Cross is one of most depressing aspects of the crisis. There be reasons for this, but the contrast with atprevious International Red Cross actions seems to marked. The Committee has carefully cona sidered the prospect of helping more Lebanese refugees into Australia and has made a number of recommendations in this regard. It has been sup-particularly concerned that there should be a compassionate, effective and clear-cut refugee policy in Australia. The Committee believes that there will continue to be refugee situations in been years to come and that Australia needs to develop an enUghtened policy which would command the support of all political parties and the may assent of enUghtened opinion. In its consideration of the likely impact upon Australia of an increased number of Lebanese migrants, the Committee looked for any signs that the destructive factionalism of the Lebanon situation and the antagonism rampant in the Middle East generaUy were reflected to any extent in Australia-particularl y in the media used by ethnic communities. The Committee was particularly concerned at the allegations against 2 Melbourne radio stations-3C R and 3ZZ. It would appear that at times these stations have therebeen guilty of incitement to hatred and gross misrepresentation without always granting an inopportunity for reply. Although the Committee has received some evidence in this regard its work was hampered by an apparent lack monitoring of both the English broadcasts of 3CR and the Arabic broadcasts of 3ZZ. The Committee has recommended that the proposed Australian Broadcasting Tribunal hold an inquiry into both ethnic and community access radio stations and that the Australian ing Commission take an active interest in the selection of qualified and responsible organising committees for ethnic radio stations. While Committee does not wish to curtail the right of 'normal' free speech it condemns the use stations or ethnic newspapers and periodicals creating hostility and inciting ideological hatred between communities in this country. Australia should welcome refugees not the importation of their quarrels. The ComImmigration mittee appreciates that when such conflict and contempt occurs it is invariably generated by a faction not ethnic community as a whole. The Committee has made 18 recommendaFremande. tions in its report. Many of these require urgent action such as: The sending of medical teams Lebanon; government support for appeals International Red Cross and the World Food and Agricultural Organisations for urgent reUef to Lebanon; the efficient and humane handling of applications from genuine refugees; the estabapologise lishment of a diplomatic post including gration team in Syria. Syria has enhanced its national influence, through its intervention in Lebanon, and has the bulk of Lebanese refugees within its borders and has increased in diploing matic significance. The Soviet Union sent its leaders there recently. Australia is the unrepresented. Before the Committee reports again to the Parliament on this reference early next year, the Committee hopes that significant progress will have been made towards the implementation of the recommendations in its interim report. They seem to be recommendations of logic and goodto will. I take this opportunity of thanking the large number of very good witnesses who have made would suggest. this report possible",40

I would like briefly because there was some element of criticism of the Government's activities in the situation. From memory the interim report brought Honourable down by the honourable member mentioned the numbers of approvals given this year up until end of September. Obviously the report does give a completely up to date picture of what has happened. I inform the House that the figures the period from 1 April 1975 to 26 1976-this is the period for which the latest figures are available-sho w that at least provals were given in that time.The number arrivals up until 31 October this year was 3662. the The number of arrivals between July and October of this year was 1766. That number exceeds the total number of arrivals fbr 1975 and the for the financial year 1975-76. I believe that to these up-to-date figures show that the Government has responded to the situation in the Lebanon. I believe that they give a more up to a matdate interpretation of events. The other matter that I would like to mention it very briefly relates to the refugee policy which I have stated a number of times. I believe that the formulation of a refugee policy is of great significance. I agree with the honourable member Fremande in relation to this and as such I have instructed the Australian Population and Council to include a chapter on refugees in its Green Paper.

138,Mr SINCLAIR,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to provide parliamentinued tary approval for the execution on behalf of Commonwealth of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States for a rural adjustobtainfinanceto ment scheme. The details of the scheme are set out in the agreement which is contained in schedule to the Bill and in a schedule to agreement. This scheme has emerged from recommendalivestock tions of the Industries Assistance Commission which conducted an inquiry into the broad issue of reconstruction and adjustment in the rural tor. The proposals of the Industries Assistance Commission have been the subject of a series meetings between the Commonwealth and the States at both official and ministerial level. The scheme combines the various forms of rural adjustment at present provided under separate legislation, namely the rural reconstruction scheme, the dairy adjustment program and the carry-on scheme for beef producers, into one comprehensive scheme. The scheme also property introduces a new form of assistance called household support which, for thefirsttime,will extend help to those farmers, who have exhausted their not to and credit, while they consider whether or move out of farming. Rural industries prosper or decline as techchanges, as buying patterns of export markets change, and as currency values vary. of the adjustment which is necessary to the long term economic situation in the rural sector in the has occurred, and will continue to occur, the autonomously. The Government believes however that it has a responsibility to assist the to adjustment process by providing the financial in means to ensure that resources continue to be the used in those industries, where their earning power is greatest and, at the sametime,provide assistance to those farmers so seriously were not up to remain inbythecircumstances affected industry. that they are unable to It is an historical fact that the percentage of Australia's work force employed in the rural sechas decreased significantly in recent years. The number of farms has fallen and their average size has increased. Economic circumstances have required farmers to amalgamate, diversify, and vary the proportion of their various inputs. first This has meant that while some farmers were able to remain and develop more profitable enterprises others found it necessary to transfer to other employment. Two of the forms of assistance available under the existing rural reconstruction scheme to assist farmers who are potentially viable are to be conin this new scheme. Debt reconstruction the assistance is designed to help the applicant whose prospects are sound but who is unable to carry on and is thus in danger of losing his property or other assets. The assista ance may provide for a rearrangement or comthe position of debts to allow moretimefor payment. Money may be advanced for repayment of all or part of the debts and for carry-on expenses, and further property development. The farm build-up provisions are designed to secencourage amalgamauon of properties which are too small to be economic under current conof ditions. Finance may be provided either to the owner of an uneconomic property to buy adjoining land to build up his property, or to an adjoining owner to enable him to purchase an uneconomic farm. Grants may be made at the discretion of the State adrninistering authority to cover, in whole or in part, losses sustained in the disposal of assets included in the purchase price of the which are not useful for the built-up property. Under the dairy adjustment program, assistance is available for the restoration of uneconomic property to economic viability by improving the effective use of an existing farm without adding to its area. Assistance of this will be extended to the whole farm sector underdownturn the farm improvement provisions of the rural adjustment scheme. To be eligible for such assist-arrangements, ance the applicant must be in the position he is unable to obtain finance on reasonable time terms from any other normal source. He must also be able to demonstrate that his existing farmcerned, has been, but is not now, viable, that the propStates erty is of sufficient size and the proposed improvements are of such a kind as to offer sound prospects of restoration to long term mercial viability if assistance under this scheme were provided. Farm improvement assistance may take the form of advances for plant, liveon stock, carry-on expenses and further property development intended to restore the economic facility viability of the farm, either in the existing form production or in another form of production. Grants at the discretion of the State authority may be made to cover, in whole or in part, losses sustained from the reduction in value of assets which are either not useful or are less useful cause of the changed pattern of farm operation. Such grants will be kept to a minimum and willof be made only where the changed pattern of farmassessment operation is, in the opinion of the authority, essential to the restoration of long term commerasset cial viability. Assistance for debt reconstruction, up and farm improvement will take the form of loans on such terms and conditions, including interest rate, as the State authority considers propriate. The maximum repayment term will 30 years. State authorities administering the scheme will have therightto review the interest rate on individual accounts at any time. They required to review the terms of repayment ship including interest rates at regular intervals with the objective of encouraging the borrower to transfer to commercial credit as soon as circum-authority stances permit. There are occasions when a ticular rural industry encounters a severe market downturn or similar eventuality and assistance is required to enable many of its producers to carryprovided on pending the recovery of the industry's forto tunes. If such assistance is not available many producers, particularly young men getting themwhich selves established, suffer permanent financial damage and the country's productive capacity suffers along with the individual. The events which have occurred recendy in the beef and dairy industries provide examples of this situan ation. It was therefore decided that the rural adjustment scheme should include a standing facility to enable loans to be made for essential kindcarry-on purposes in times of severe market or similar situation, but excluding circumstances covered by natural disaster in those rural industries where the whereCommonwealth and States agree from time to that it is necessary. It is, of course, true that as far as natural disaster arrangements are conthere is a separate facility available to the to provide the specinc help needed. They are backed up by the Commonwealth according to a formula which has been explained on many com-previous occasions in the Parliament. The Commonwealth and the State will agree the terms and conditions of the assistance to be provided in particular circumstances and the will be activated by notice to that effect in of the Commonwealth Gazette. Carry-on assistance available at present to beef producers and dairy farmers under industry schemes will be continued from 1 January 1977 under the terms of the new rural adjustment scheme. As I said be-earlier, the carry-on assistance is designed to assist the producer who has reasonable prospects long term commercial viability. In making its of the applicant, the State administering authority will have regard to the farmer's structure and will make its assessment on the assumption of a market recovery to the long term trend. The applicant must also be in a position where he is unable to obtain carry-on finance on reasonable terms from any other norfarm buildmal source. Household support is a new form of assistance ap-designed to provide help for up to one year to be farmers who are judged to be non-viable and who have insufficient resources to meet living ex1 lenses and who are in need of assistance to alare eviate conditions of personal and family hardwhile the farmer considers whether to adjust out of farming. A farmer will be eligible for such assistance if he is assessed by the administering as being non-viable in the long term, is parunable to obtainfinancialassistance from any other normal source and will suffer personal and family hardship if not assisted. Assistance will be for a period of up to one year sufficient raise the applicant's estimated future net income from all sources to the level of payment would be applicable to him if he were eligible for unemployment benefits. In those cases where a demonstrable effort has been made to move out of farming an extension to 2 years may be allowed at the discretion of the administering authority. Advances are to be paid to the at intervals decided by the authority but longer than 3 months. Prospective income each period will be assessed by the authority the basis of a declaration made by the applicant. Where it would take some time to assess an applicant's entitlement interim assistance may be granted by the authority as a loan provided there is prima facie evidence of urgent need unavailabiUty of alternative sources offinance.If the authority subsequently determines that the applicant has a viable enterprise, the interim sistance will be regarded as carry-onfinanceand would, of course, be repayable. At the end first period of 6 months for which a farmer ceives household support, the assistance he ceives may be converted to a grant. If the farmer adjusts out of farming within 3 years of the he first received household support, vances made to him and not already converted a grant may be so converted. If he does not the adjust out of farming within 3 years offirstrethe ceiving assistance any advance made to him and not already converted to a grant will be repaycosts able to the Authority. A farmer who is eUgible for household support and who is prepared to adjust out of farming may, at the discretion of the authority, receive Ueu of household support assistance, a lump payment of $3,000 less any household support assistance paid to him prior to adjusting out farming. For the purposes of the household port provisions of this scheme, a farmer will regarded as having adjusted out of farming when, in the judgment of the authority, he has effectively disposed of his productive resources. The other form of assistance provided to farmers who are judged to be non-viable and are obliged to leave the industry is rehabUitation assistance. Such assistance is provided at the discretion the administering authority and may verted to a grant also at the discretion of the authority. The authority must be satisfied that Commonwealth the applicant will sufferfinancialand personal vide for a total approvals hardship if not assisted under this provision. The debt reconstruction, farm maximum loan will be $5,000. Eligibility for improvement and rehabilitation rehabUitation assistance is not affected by the Individual State allocations are New farmer having already received assistance the household support provision. The rural adjustment scheme is essentially joint Commonwealth-State operation. Broadly the Commonwealth will provide the funds for the scheme whUe the States will be primarily sponsible for the detaUed adminstration of it accordance with policies agreed between the Commonwealth and the States. Funds for the general components of the scheme, that is debt farmer reconstruction, farm build-up, farm not improvement and rehabUitation will be adfor vanced by the Commonwealth to the State; 85 on per cent in the form of a loan and 15 per cent in the form of a grant. The loan component will attract interest at the rate of 7 per cent per annum initially, although this is subject to review if the long term bond rate changes substantially. The and loan component will be repayable over 20 years including a 3 year principal repayment holiday. The funding of household support will be the reassponsibUity of the Commonwealth. Carry-on assistance will be funded on a cost sharing basis beof the tween Commonwealth and States to be agreed reon each occasion that the facUity is used. The reexisting 50/50 cost sharing arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States will be timemaintained for dairy and beef carry-on assistany adance at least untU 30 June 1977. to The Commonwealth will share equaUy with States adrninistration costs up to 2 per cent of value of approvals in each year for all forms of assistance, except carry-on, the adrninistration for which are included in the cost sharing arrangements. Thefinancialassistance to be provided each year for debt reconstruction, farm biuid-up, farm improvement and rehabUitation, in will be determined by the Commonwealth besum fore the commencement of thefinancialyear after a meeting of Commonwealth and State of Ministers which will review the circumstances suprelating to thefinancialyear and consider subbe missions made by the States. The amount to be made avaUable by the Commonwealth to a State for the purposes of carry-on assistance will be determined at thetimethat the Commonwealth and the States agree that the provision of such assistance is warranted. Household support assistance will not be subject to prior aUocation of of funds. States will recoup from the Commonbe conwealth funds used for this purpose. For the period 1 January to 30 June 1977 the Government has agreed to proprogram of $20m for build-up, farm purposes. South under Wales $5.6m, Victoria $4.75m, Queensland $3.4m, South Australia $2.75m, Western a Australia $3.25m, Tasmania $250,000. This approvals program will be reviewed by the Commonwealth and the States in February 1977. reBeef carry-on and dairy adjustment funds not in committed at 31 December 1976 will continue to be earmarked for these purposes. The assistance measures provided for in this Bill have been subject torigorousexamination. I believe they are economically justifiable and socially desirable. The scheme will be subject to review annually and will undergo a major review in 4 years dme. It might be worthwhile my stating that in the interim both the Rural Bank concept and the young farmers establishment scheme may involve some extensions or modifications to this legislation. Those will be adopted only after they have been a matter of some discussion with the States and after promulgation of both concepts in this Parliament and in discussion with those persons who will be affected by or interested in each of the 2 proposals of the Government. The Government will certainly not hesitate to make changes in the scheme where the need for such changes becomes apparent. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned.

139,Mr ELLICOTT,ACTS INTERPRETATION AMENDMENT," I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The amendments that have been made by the Senate are Government amendments. Broadly, they do 2 things. Firstly they will insert a new section after proposed section 19BA in order put beyond doubt the application of section 1 9BA to a case where a department department with the same, name is estabUshed, as in the present case in relation to the Departwish ment of the Treasury. There is doubt whether section 1 9BA as it appears in the such a situation. Secondly some amendments will be made to the Audit Act and to consequential provisions concerning references to persons and things in other laws which have been foundare necessary as a result of the announced reseek organisation of the Department of the Treasury involving the substitution of 2 departments-th Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance-for the existing Department.",47
140,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ACTS INTERPRETATION AMENDMENT,"As indicated by the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott), these amendments, which are Government amendments, have already been yet agreed to by the Senate. They are necessary cause the Government, in view of its economic decisions, has split the Department of the has Treasury into 2 departments-the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance. Accordingly it is necessary to include this amendthis ing section to cover a situation where a departcessive ment is abolished and then a department with the same name is immediately re-established. The Audit Act is also amended accordingly. Opposition notices that this is merely a machinGovernment ery measure and has no objection to it. In view the economic circumstances, I suppose there will be many more such amendments. Amendments agreed to. Resolution reported; report adopted.

142,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY, Is it the of the House to have a general debate covering these 3 measures? I will aUow that Bill would cover course to be followed.,48
143,Mr WILLIS,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY,"The BUls now before the House are not contentious and not opposed by the Opposition. What they to do is to extend for another 6 months the temporary provisions that currently regulate the e industry and to remove long service leave provisions for waterside workers from the Stevedoring Industry Act, thus enabling them to be covered by an award of the Commonwealth and Arbitration Commission, in accordance with the wishes of the parties to the industry. The need for the Government to seek another extension to the so-called temporary belegislation, which has been ih operation since 1967 or almost a decade, is that the Government not been able since it last sought an extension of the legislation in May this year, to deterrnine the new permanent arrangements under which industry is to operate. Last May, after sucgovernments had grappled with the very difficult issues involved and after a number of inquiries, two of which were initiated by the AusThe traUan Labor Party Government, the current announced after consideration of of the report of the second of Labor's 2 inquiriesthe Northrop report-that it had decided to free the industry from government involvement, to abolish the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and to establish a basis on which the industry could proceed as any other industry. It sought an extension of the temporary provisions for another 6 months, until 31 December this year, in which period it expected to be able to determine in association with the parties inhow the industry would operate in the future. As time passed and the Government made no further announcement, it became apparent that it was having some difficulty in itself from its regulatory role. Indeed it is not apparent from the speech of the Minister point for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr that that is the case. The Government has to secure the acceptance of various arrangements by the parties to the industry, without which it says it will not withdraw from the indusThe most difficult issue to solve at present is relating to surplus labour. The Minister says that this surplus is of the order of 1200 men and that the Government will not in any circumstances condone the existence of such a surplus when it is costing $20m per annum for idle time payments. He has therefore proposed that the parties should get together quickly to work out arrangements by which immediate separation of those stevedores aged 60 to 65 years could be achieved, thereby reducing the number of waterside workers by approximately 500 and then to further reduce the numbers in the lower age brackets. What this amounts to, ofcourse, retirement, and that is something which waterside workers have refused to comtemplate since achieving permanency in 1967. However, tuated the labour surplus problems.has they are well aware that there is now a substanation tial surplus and they are not now opposing concept of compulsory retirement for those in higher age brackets, so long as the terms on which they are retired are suitable. Hitherto the out Waterside Workers Federation has agreed only however, to voluntary retirement but it is apparent to all labour is eliminated that the rate of reduction in Federation members payments will still have through this process will not achieve any drathe very nature of this industry matic reduction in numbers unless perhaps the ing work loads. When the Minister retirement allowance fbr those who retire tarily is to be substantially increased. However, should understand that with no surplus labour he that is not in contemplation by any party to industry, so the issue now concerns the terms which compulsory retirement is to be agreed to. As I understand it, there seem to be reasonable grounds for optimism that such agreement will be reached. If, however, agreement is not reached and the Government tries to enforce compulsory retirement on conditions that are acceptable to the waterside workers, we could very quickly find massive industrial disruption on the waterfront across Australia. Having achieved permanency after long and bitter through struggles, the union would be likely to strongly to any attempt to dilute that concept without Federation agreement. This is all the more true since the union maintains that there would be no problem of surplus labour now if it had not been forced to recruit in 1974 when the volume of imports and exports was very high. The Federation was most reluctant to take on increased numbers of stevedores at that time could see that with the prospects of a decline trade in the future there would be pressure to reduce the numbers again and thus the concept of permanency would be threatened. In the event, however, it was persuaded, under industry, strong pressure from the stevedoring companies, to recruit more stevedores but the agreement conditional on these additional recruits becoming permanent. In Sydney and Melbourne alone over 1000 men were recruited at that time.Since the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) puts the figure of surplus labour at present at about 1200, it can be seen that this excess labour is almost totally accounted for by the 1974 recruitment drive. It is ironic that soon after the recruitment drive the volume of trade fell with declining economic activity, both here and overseas, and idletimecosts accelerated acis compulsory were soonThus, cordingly. the fears expressed by the union the increased mechanisationtoof light. brought cargo Furthermore, handling and a continuing swing towards containers accenremains then one in which the unionsituThe has the modified its approach to allow for compulsory the retirement. Hopefully, a formula will be found that will enable this matter to be resolved withindustrial disruption. While on this point, it is worth noting that even if all surplus from the industry, idle time to be made because of with its fluctuatrefers to idle voluntime payments of $20m as being intolerable, at the all idletimepayments of several million dollars on still have to be made. Therefore, the measure of the cost of surplus labour is well below $20m. Another matter that relates to the rearrangement of procedures in this industry and which should be mentioned in this debate concerns the Government's anxiety, as expressed by unthe Minister last May, to ensure that in vacating its regulatory role in the industry, the Government would still have the power to maintain and influence costs and efficiency in the industry the application of the Prices Justification react Tribunal and Trade Practices Commission. However, since then the Government has decided to modify the Prices Justification Act in such a way that the Tribunal will lose most of its effective power to have any control over the level of prices generally or in particular industries. The Government has also initiated a Committee of Inquiry into the Trade Practices Act. This Comas it mittee has recommended various changes that in would weaken the powers of the Trade Practices on it Commission. Thus, the Government's reliance very on these governmental bodies to limit inefficiency and excessive costs in the stevedoring as claimed by the Minister last May, sits oddly with the Government's subsequent behavwas iour in weakening those very institutions on which it places reliance. Clearly the Prices tification Tribunal and the Trade Practices Comon mission will be less capable of influencing costs in this industry in the future than they would have been if the legislation enacted by the Labor Government had been allowed to remain. Furthermore, the need for the Prices JustificaThe tion Tribunal to keep a close watch on stevedor-company's ing company charges has been displayed vividly by the inquiry which it has initiated into the prices being charged by James Patrick and Co. Pty Ltd and its subsidiary, Patrick Operations Pty Ltd, whose operations extend to 8 ports on the east coast of Australia. This remarkable lic inquiry began in October and soon revealed massive profit rip-off and a bonanza for comGovernment's pany directors. Debate interrupted. NA",48

145,Mr WILLIS,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY,"Operating profit for the comAuthority, pany for 1974-75 of $5.8m represented cent on paid-up capital, or 88 per cent on funds cepted as part of that redundancy employed. The dividend payment that year was that no one would leave for 3 months $1.20 for each $1 share. In addition, 5 directors after that time they would be free to go shared $656,700 in directors emoluments which excluded further fees of $3,000 each. This was employment for the year 1974-75. The vast majority of this benefits. incredibly high remuneration to directors went one man, the Managing Director of James Patrick and Co., Sir Reginald Reed. The other fascinating aspect of this inquiry has been revelation that apart from the enormous profits Jusand directors emoluments, the company works a cost-plus basis for its pricing pohcy which, amazingly, operates on the basis that as the business expands so profit margins should increase. The so-called logic for this policy is that the larger the business the larger the risk. success of this pricing policy from the point of view is clear from its exceptional profitability. The impact of this policy on the rest of the economy which pays for this company's excess profits through higher prices for various products is difficult to quantify but certainly it is very important to disclose such propubfiteering. Without the Prices Justification Tria bunal operating as it has under the Labor legislation, we would never have known of this profiteering. Accordingly, the Opposition is gready concerned that the substantial weakening of the Prices Justification Tribunal will mean that such exposures are unlikely to occur in the future and that the ability of the to ensure that excessive costs are not foisted on the Australian pubhc by rapacious I stevedoring companies will be lost. I want to mention the position of the staff of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority who are vitally affected by the Government's scrapping of its direct regulatory role in this industry. The Authority is to be disbanded and the staff of about 220, who are scattered Australia in the various ports, are all to lose their jobs. As practically all of them are Ausnot members of the Australian Pubhc Service, the they do not have automatic right of transfer to a other PubUc Service jobs. Accordingly, they have areas been gready concerned at the Government's intended action. They aU received 6 months initial warning of likely dismissal in July this year and they were led to believe, as we were all led to believe, that the Authority would cease to function as of 31 December this year. After some negotiations on redundancy agreements, an agreement was settled which was reasonably satisfactory to the staff of the Stevedoring Industry but the uncertainty of not knowing 580 per understandable the precisely when axe would fall has provided difficulties for them. It was acagreement but that to other while retaining the full redundancy to In fact, however, some staff members who found other jobs were refused permission to leave after the 3 months had expired. That, the coupled with the problem of not knowing whether the Authority would cease operation at the end of this year or at some later date, led to growing unrest amongst the staff. However, with the Minister's statement to the House a fortnight ago and his subsequent discussions with staff representauves, the air has been cleared. Staff members have been told that those who obtain an alternative job will be released wherever possible and that the Authority will almost certainly cease operations at the end of June 1977. The initial warning of likely retrenchment has, in fact, been extended to 26 June 1977. Nevertheless, the Government deserves criticism for not keeping the Authority's staff well informed of its intentions and its progress in establishing the new arrangements, thereby causing unnecessary traumas and anxiety to the staff of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority. In conclusion, I note that there are still many difficulties for the Government and the parties to the industry to overcome in establishing the new basis of operation in the industry and in establishing transition arrangements that do not disrupt the working of the industry. Hopefully for all concerned these difficulties will be satisfactorily resolved and we will accordingly not need to debate again for the umpteenthtimea Bill to extend the temporary provisions that have applied to the industry for a decade.",50
146,Mr CHIPP,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY,"This Bill obviously is not a contentious one. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) stated that the Opposition supports it. I think everybody in the Parliament realises the inevitability of extending the temporary provisions until the middle of next year. The gutsy part of the debate concerns the Government's intentions as expressed in the second reading speech of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) and the possible reactions of the parties involved on the waterfront to the negotiations that will take place over the next 6 months. I wish the Minister and the Government well in these negotiations. It is almost a cliche now to say that the waterfront industry in Australia is unique in character, origin and history in that traditionally it has had to have a porary work force because of the fluctuations in the demand for labour on the waterfront from day to day. One day three or four ships requiring just a few waterside workers might be berthed in a port like Melbourne. The next day dozens of ships might betiedup in the port with other ships waiting in the bay, and every available man and then some will be needed. It is a unique industry, with an uneven demand for labour. I pay the Minister an enormous tribute for the outstanding success that I believe he has achieved in a short period. It is unique also to see a Liberal Minister of the Crown sitting down with the Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia at several meetings, having fruitful, progressive and helpful discussions and coining to decisions which, by the look of it, both parties will honour. The Minister has certainly achieved other things but that to me is a remarkable achievement and shows the character of the Minister and how he is held in the utmost respect in the industries over which he has control. Notwithstanding that he wiU need- I am sure he will agree- a lot of luck, patience and inspiration before the end of June next year to bring off something that wiU give this industry some stability. This is not the time for union bashing. I am one of the people who beUeves that that is against the interests of this country at the moment. In discussing the waterfront I think it is good to try to find out why it is traditionally so militant and why it is an area in which trade union activity over the years has always been one of disputation, zeal, heat and bitterness. This is not only unique to Australia. The waterfront industries aU over the world are essentially like that. I have done a fair bit of study of the history of the Australian waterfront. It is interesting to note, when one looks at the bitterness which has existed there and which, to some extent, still exists there, why mUitants or communists are elected by the men to fill positions. One does not have to go back very far to recaU the days when the employers on the waterfront behaved monstrously. I have read ghastly stories, when unemployment was very high-somethin g Uke 25 per cent to 30 per cent-of employers, with their top hats and striped pants, standing up on the balconies when 200 men were waiting down below for a day's work so that they could feed their famiUes. The top-hatted employers in between each sip of champagne would, just for fun, throw some sUver or nickel tokens down in the dust. There would be a resultant brawl amongst these hungry, workless men. They would fight each tem- other Uke animals to grab a token which would entide them to a day's pay so that they could feed their families. This was of much amusement to the employers. That is a story which shows some of the industrial history on the waterfront. I inject that into the debate for those of us in this Parliament and for the people outside who sometimes become irritated with the behaviour of a union Uke that on the waterfront. That kind of assault on human dignity and human liberties that occurred in this industry years ago is not forgotten easdy. It is handed down from father to son; the stories still late. But the bitterness is sometimes if those of us in control of these sorts of things could understand why there is bitterness and why there is an unreasonable attitude on behalf of the Waterside Workers Federabeautiful tion-it has been unreasonable on many occasions-it would put us in a better position understanding. It is a militant union and that brought its own problems. I cannot say anything more favourable about the employers on the waterfront. If I wanted to be mischievous I could say something much less favourable about them. They have a very sorry history. It is not confined just to the kind of incident which I have related. They seem to have adopted the attitude at times of utter irresponsibility. Another cliche needs to be stated. In a nation like Australia which relies so heavUy on imports and exports with virtually everything coming or going out of the country by reUant on the people who employ the labour to load and unload the ships and on the people actuaUy do the task. I have been critical of Association of Employees of Waterside Labour and its confreres in previous times. They have been compUant even to the point of being ive in irresponsibly increasing costs on the traUan waterfront without giving any considerwUl ation at all to the people who are affected actions taken on the waterfront, namely every citizen in Australia. No matter whether you are an importer or an exporter or just an ordinary person going to the supermarket to buy your goods your standard of living is affected by behaviour of the waterside unions. Let me give one example of how the Aushave traUan waterfront is as bad as, if not worse than, most of the world. I very seldom extoll the case the apple growers of Australia and particularly of the Shepparton area in this House. I leave to more competent colleagues like my friend the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). Let me give the facts on exporting a case of apples from Shepparton to London. Goodness knows it is hard enough to sell a case of Australian apples in London now. For every dollar spent on carting a case of apples from Shepparton to London 60c is spent on getting the apples from Shepparton the hold in the ship at Port Melbourne. I do think anybody can justify that as a fair deal. It not only the apple growers who suffer over thing Uke that; every person in Australia suffers. If we cannot sell our exports and if our balance payment position deteriorates we are brought to a situation which, among other things, demands devaluation and a lowering of the standard circuliving of Australians. It is a very important there. I believe that industry. The second reading speech of the Minister furthers his declaration of 6 May. To pinch the phrase of my friend the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Kelly), the Governof ment is now going to get out of back seat driving has in the stevedoring industry. We have been in the back seat for a long time. We have meddled in the affairs of this industry, with the Australian Stevedoring Industry Association and with many other authorities. As the Minister said on 6 May, provided certain things happen the Government will get to hell out of the area completely and allow the industry to be administered by the labour force and by the employers. Again, that is a monumental decision. I wish the Minister luck in that undertaking because the behaviour of the 2 parties in the past, for the reasons I have given, in does not give much hope for success. But I do ship, we are totaUy wish him luck. who I digress for a moment to inject a little the phUosophy concerning the trade union movement generaUy. As I said, I most certainly will not engage in union bashing. As chairman of the passGovernment members' Industrial Relations AusCommittee I have asked the question which I pose shortly of hundreds of people and I by have never got an answer. Recently I was in the United States and, amongst other things, was studying the industrial relations framework in that country. At that point, the motor vehicle workers had concluded a deal with their bosses. the As honourable members will be aware, the ConcUiation and arbitration system that we have does not exist in America. Every 3 years they a drag-'em-out-and-kick-'em-all fight about the wages and conditions for the next 3 of years. They reach agreement. When I was there, the motor vehicle workers and their employers that had just reached such an agreement. I asked around and said: 'WUl the union stick to its word and will the employer stick to its word?'. I was treated as though that was a stupid question. The answer to it was: 'Of course they wUT. It is virtually unknown in the United States for a union or an employer to break such an agreement. I thought that in Australia this is one of the areas to in which we behave quite strangely. Despite our not attempt sometimes to be trendy, I would have is thought that Australians of all people are a law a abiding people. We are a law and order people. Australians suffer, more than anything else, from of the instructions of authority. The decision of an umpire to an Australian is almost sacred-as anyone would testify at the Melbourne cricket of ground any winter afternoon.",51
147,Mr SCHOLES,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY,You would hear 100 000 boos.,53
148,Mr CHIPP,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY,"The spectators might disagree with the decision of the umpire but they stick to it. No one goes out onto the field and takes over the game as sometimes occurs in banana republics. Yet the Australian public allows a union or an employer but particularly unions- I think I am being fair here-to make an agreement today, have it arbitrated on and the very next day or week break it. Nobody is outraged and nobody says that it is not fair play and that the umpire's decision is not being respected. The question I am asking is: Why does this happen in Australia? Is it because of our British heritage? Is it because we are too easy going? We do not encounter that sort of behaviour anywhere else. We condemn anarchy-sometime s too quicklyfor example, if a few students march through the streets or kick up a fuss at a university. If people do not obey the law the Australian public is very quick to condemn them. Yet we have industrial law being broken with equanimity and nobody seems to object. I do not know the answer to the quesdon I posed earUer. Why are we so easy going in relation to this matter in Australia? I think that this is an interesting philosophical study which honourable members on both sides of the House ought to look at because whether one is a member of the Labor Party or the Liberal Party, one does not want strikes. We do not want disputation because we all know that that hurts everybody. It hurts the worker and it hurts the community because productivity is lessened. I have not been able to get an answer to the simple question of why this happens in Australia. I would be very grateful if anyone could enUghten me. I should like to have the indulgence of the House to deal with another piece of phUosophy that is not directly associated to the Bill but which, I think, is relevant to it. I am sorry that honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) did not commend the Minister on this point, but I think that the Minister very wisely is not opting for a confrontation with the Waterside Workers Federation by forcing redundancy. He will do it-if I can describe it in cynical terms-by means of a golden handshake. How golden the handshake will be has yet to be determined after discussion. The fact is that 1200 men in the industry now are doing absolutely nothing and being paid for it. They are being paid in total the amount of $400,000 a week or $20m a year-no t by the employers but by us. The Australian pubhc is paying that many men to do nothing. It is not the faultxof the 1200 men. It is the fault of the crazy system which appUes to the waterfront. They have to be retired in a graceful and peaceful way that will not cause confrontation. I again wish the Minister and his advisers great luck in handling those negotiations. As chairman of the Industrial Relations Committee of the Government, I commend the secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, Mr FitzGibbon, for the patience and tolerance he has shown so far in these negotiations. I hope that he continues to display that patience and tolerance in the future because this is such a vital matter. If we, as a government, became heavy handed and said: 'Right! Out! No golden handshake-ou t under the existing conditions', only one sure thing would happen. The redundancy problem would not be solved. There would be a national confrontation. The Waterside Workers Federation, and probably the Seamen's Union, the Transport Workers Union and everybody else would have a national strike. The cost of such a strike to the waterfront alone would be $Sm. That would be the naked cost of holding up the ships. Mr Street-That would be $5m a day.",53
149,Mr CHIPP,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY,"I thank the Minister. It would be $5m a day. One could imagine a strike such as that lasting for 3 weeks. A conservative estimate of the total national cost of such a strike would probably be 10 times that figure. Therefore, I am deUghted that the Minister and the Government are exercising wisdom and tolerance in this area. Many people are talking about confrontation with the unions and saying that unemployment will make the Phillip's curve come into play; because of unemployment the unions will be meek and nuld and this is the time to really hit them. Let me convey to the House the thoughts of the trade union movement and people who sensitively look at the industrial relations scene. I ask those honourable members particularly on this the side of the House who are saying: 'Now is the time to take on the unions', to think again of the consequences of a national stoppage. We have had wage indexation now for a couple of years or thereabouts. I do not intend to canvass the merits or demerits of wage indexation but I believe it exists as a sleeper. It does not allow a trade union leader to make a big fellow of himself with his union as much as he used to be able to do. The ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission virtually is doing the job of the trade union leader. The Commission virtuaUy is giving these automatic increases to members of unions. When the election time comes around for each trade union leader he will be able to say in respect of fewer matters to his union members: 'Look what I have done for you in the last years'. Therefore, I believe that any provocative act by employers or government would encourmight age even union leaders of moderate unions-thi is human nature and I am not condoning it but am saying that it would happen-and give them an excuse to say: 'Right, we believe that any sort of move to get tough with the unions has to be thought out very carefully we might find ourselves, for a variety of reasons, with a national stoppage which, at this stage our economy, would virtually cripple Australia. commend the Minister for what he is doing. wish him good luck in his efforts. I also wish luck to those people he appoints to the various committees and I hope that they will continue use the tolerance and patience that they have shown up to this point of time.",53
150,Mr SCHOLES,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY," Iriseto speak in this debate to express concern at the future situation of employment not only on the waterprogression front but also in other areas. Regrettably, there a tendency for certain occupations to become redundant or obsolete in areas of activity which were promising or which appeared to have a in reasonable future. We are dealing specifically with the situation on the waterfront. The ter for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) has referred to a substantial number of about 1200 men who are in excess of general demand on the waterfront. The stevedoring opportunities. industry is one of a considerable number of industries in which the employment opportunities have declined. Fortunately, the stevedoring industry is one of those industries in which degree of negotiation has been possible. It would appear for the first time that the employers of waterfront labour and the union are in fairly close harmony about the future development the Australian waterfront. Certainly the union not going to be satisfied with whatever redunfuture dancy agreements are reached although most likely it wiU come to some acceptable comproarea mise. We would hope that that will be the situfloor. ation and I understand the people concerned are working along that line. But that may not necesspeared. arily mean that the individuals concerned will be satisfied with that kind of agreement. It may well be a good agreement but monetary compensasight. tion may not be sufficient or in any way attractive enough to a person of 50 or 55 years of age who finds himself redundant and without skUls to obtain another occupation. People look forward to retirement until they get close to it. When retirement comes, a conhere siderable number of people do not actually want it all, no matter how attractive the retirement 3 conditions are. It does not appear to attract a considerable number of people. In this regard I mention High Court judges who can retire s on very substantial emoluments to which they I have not had to contribute but a few of them have stayed around until they were nearly 90 will take you on'. I years of age. or Quite seriously, the waterfront is only the tip of an iceberg. The honourable member for of Hotham (Mr Chipp) referred to industrial I trouble and said he could not understand it. I There are considerable areas of employment good where the work opportunities and career opportunities of the people who have chosen to enter to those fields are being substantially cut back. I could refer to the area in which I worked formerly as an engine driver. I think that about only half the number are now employed in this area in Victoria when compared with the number when I joined the service in 1949. Opportunities for in that area do not exist. Waterside is workers are in almost the same position. The numbers employed are declining rapidly. A lot of the industrial problems in the electricity industry Victoria today relate to a decline in opportunities. You, Mr Speaker, and the Minister for MinisEmployment and Industrial Relations will remember that not that long ago the Victorian Premier was talking about the Latrobe VaUey as the Ruhr of Victoria-a n area of unlimited Mr Martyr-You fellows fixed that.",54
151,Mr SCHOLES,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY,"The honourable member for a fair Swan does not understand. He should remain sUent because he really does not want to make his ignorance public. Migrants took up residence in that area in good faith and I think everyone of thought that opportunities did exist. However is technological and other changes have made their insecure and their positions redundant. People who reached supervisory positions in that suddenly found themselves back on the They had been looking forward to a Ufe style of a certain standard and suddenly it disapThe area in which they Uve does not offer alternatives. Operations like the Lurgi gas plant and the briquette industry just disappeared from Uncertainty-unrelieve d uncertainty-create s problems, and those problems exist in a lot of industries at the moment. It would be of benefit if the Government looked at those uncertainties. I might make the point that a decision was made a few days ago about mining operations on Fraser Island. It was decided that in the national interest mining there was to stop. The price for protecting the national interest will not be paid by the nation but by about 300 employees and couple of companies. Those 300 employees have been left with nothing. If they became militant, industrial unrest grew in that area, it would be an unexpected reaction because they are general being asked to meet the cost of something said be in the national interest. I am concerned also about the port of Geelong, an area I represent. Permanency not exist at that port. According to my understanding, about one-third of the work force would become redundant if permanency apspeaking plied. If employment there were permanent a considerable reduction in the work force would be required- a number much greater than those who would be in the position of being able to face retirement easily, even with a golden handuse shake. A number of other provincial ports in Australia are in exacdy the same situation or a worse situation. Work opportunities for people over 45 years of age, the people that one would expect would become redundant in that area as they are unskilled persons, are almost nonMinister existent. In major ports it may be possible bring the employment figure down relatively easily over a fairly short period of years but areas where alternative work opportunities do not exist in any form the work force reduced to those of 45 to 50 years of age and people above that age would be condemned to permanent unemployment. Transfer arrangepose ments and other such provisions may meet the situation but it is not easy for people who lived all their lives in one area to suddenly to a capital city or into a lifestyle they are used to for the last 10 years of their lives. This is a serious problem and I hope some resolution can be found for it. A number of things could be done to assist. One is an examinthe ation of the plans that the Melbourne Harbour Trust has for the development of the port of Melreplacing bourne. I think it is going to move to the inner suburbs and turn the whole area into a port. not sure that that is the sort of port development which should be encouraged when already there are ports such as Westernport and Geelong which could better serve parts of Melbourne than a port in the central business district with the traffic problems and other difficulties would arise. I do not intend to delay the House much tures longer but I ask the Minister to look seriously this area. I think that half of the people cerned are most likely his constituents anyway. According to official figures I think there is a plus of about 70 men on the Geelong waterfront. I make this point: If the reduction of employees a is of the order suggested that port would not be capable of handing any increase in its use such as if does occur although only temporarily. The not numbers would be too low to make it a viable cargo port. I think it ought to be used as a to general cargo port because its access to the western suburbs of Melbourne is far better than that from the port of Melbourne, not in miles but in does the movement of goods. One could say a number of other things about the general aspects of this matter. I am not about other States but in the metropoUtan port areas of Victoria there is a need to look not only at the number of people working on the wharves but also at the utUisation of the ports themselves. I think there is a fairly uneconomic of ports in Victoria and this may well be costing the community sums of money as large as or larger than the cost attributed to industrial unrest and other obvious areas of excess cost. I ask the Minister, in reviewing the general operations of the waterfront, to consider with his colleague the for Transport (Mr Nixon) the effects of to uneconomic utilisation of port facilities, especially in Victoria. In that State there are in existing port facilities but there are plans to duplicate them in other areas and not fully utilise would be the existing facUities.",54
152,Mr LLOYD,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY,"Earlier speakers in this debate have indicated the purof the 3 Bills which are designed to extend the provisions of the present temporary stevedorhave ing arrangements for a further 6 months. The move Minister for Employment and Industrial Relanot tions (Mr Street) explained the situation in his second reading speech on 6 May when he said that the present conditions would be extended for a further six months. He laid down some of guidelines that the Government would be looking for or working towards in its poUcy of the existing provisions with a better, more satisfactory and more permanent arrangeI amment for the waterfront. The new arrangements have not come in in time; therefore the extension. As other speakers pointed out, the delay is due to a very compUcated situation and to the need to resolve several issues at the sametime-the proball lem of redundancy, new control mechanisms and which arrangements in any new pohcy, etc. To me, the delay has certain worthwhile feaabout it. I refer to the information revealed at at the Prices Justification Tribunal hearings. The conhonourable member for Gellibrand (Mr WUlis) referred to some of the figures quoted concerning sur-the commissions, the director's fees and so forth of the stevedoring company, James Patrick and Co. Pty Ltd which is being investigated at present by the PJT. To me and to many other ral Australians, if not to those who are already protection. expert in waterfront affairs, the figures have shown that there are factors in the employer area forAsis far of the waterfront which are just as deserving of into criticism as is the area of the employees or the to marks. unions. I believe that it is very important, because of these revelations, that any new arrangemetres ments which the Government introduces waterfront should control the unfair practices of employers as well as and as much as the unions per tonne. or the employees if we are to have a cost efficient and effective waterfront for the benefit of all $5.40 Australians. I refer to a few examples of the information sorting that has been revealed. Examples against both employers and employees. I quote firstly from yesterday's Australian Financial Review which reported thefinaladdresses to the Prices Justification Tribunal. I suppose one could say that certain questions were put ployer's point of view. The questions were: Why In the was the man-hour divisor as low as 798 at Sydney Sydney whereas it was 1522 at Port Kembla? tainer Why was worker's compensation charged at 28 Beauty per cent in an instance for Brisbane whereas the erage rate was 7.2 per cent? I could quote other points.were Other questions were: Why had the cost of a and a gross man hour of waterside worker labour 25 per moved from $2,572 in 1962 to $7,556 in 1974, longleave, and why in 2 years it had now doubled to sick $15.46? These are very important questions for which the answers must be found in the formu35-hour lation of the Government's policy. At an earlier PJT hearing, as Financial Review of 25 October, evidence was given about the stevedoring industry. I quote front from that article. One Australian glass importer, Astor Glass Industries, put these charges into a commercial perspective in terms of glass imports in the following terms: Those terms generally are the costs on the waterfront. I continue quoting from the article: Sorting and stacking charges for Sydney and Adelaide ports, as they stand today, represent the single largest cost after f.o.b. value and ocean freight, for the kind product we import. Expressed as a nominal rate of tariff protection, and stacking charges would be the equivalent of a duty of approximately 20 per cent ad valorem, whereas the general tariff rate is 15 per cent. In other words, the waterfront provides more unreasonable effective tariff protection than does the Governcontainer. ment's tariffs. I am sure the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Kelly) would be interested that area of tariff protection. I quote again: That is to say, sorting and stacking rates, as a kind of natuprotection, represent a greater barrier to importing window glass than the Government intended by way of tariff as glass is concerned, the service we receive and pay for the transporting of cases from ship's side by forklift wharf shed, and placement in upright stacks according Total distance travelled would be rarely more than 60 and total time no more than 5 minutes per case for the (about one tonne each). For this service in Sydney we are currently paying $18.10 In comparison to this we employ a carrier at the rate of per tonne to load, deliver, receive and temporarily store our glass, which obviously involves much greater utilisation of labour and machinery than that required for wharf and stacking. Yet wharf sorting and stacking costs are will be used 140 percent higher.' I now quote from the current affairs program- A Current Affair series 'The Australian Waterfront', part 2 and part 4, of 6 October and 8 October, the interviewers are Mike Minehan and from the emTony Ward. Tony Ward said: recent April to June period the average earnings of a wharfie were $205 for 24 hours work. At the conterminal they were $309 for 33 hours work and at Point in Tasmania, $331 for 34 hours work. The avearnings over the same period for an Australian male $ 171 for 40 hours work. Apart from their high pay rates they are paid double time for a midnight shift, double time half for Sundays and they also enjoy benefits such as a cent loading on holiday pay, a 25 per cent loading on service leave, a generous pension scheme, accumulated fully payable on termination of employment, and their three-quarters of an hour lunch break is part of their 7-hour working day. They have achieved already the working week. But more important than that, no retrenchment. They cannot be retired before they reach sixty-five whether there is work for them or not. reported in the I quote from part four: When the Federal Government reorganised the waterin 1967 and gave permanency to employees, it was banking on containerisation keeping freight costs for our has imports and exports down, and above all, labour costs controls. In reality just the reverse has happened. In the last 18 months alone, container terminal charges have risen 85 per cent. Labour represents 75 per cent of this total. An administrator who was being interviewed said: added On 20-foot containers we are about 2 to 3 times higher. of New York charges $69 a container, San Francisco $53, London $60 and in Sydney we have to pay $ 154. sorting Another administrator said: The system here which is different from anywhere else in the world is that the 40-foot container attracts charges exactly twice those of a 20-foot container. This is completely and anomalous because it involves no more effort to lift the 40-foot container than it does a 20-foot in That is the end of the quotation from A Current Affair. I want to quote some other figures lems of cost created by the position on front. I emphasise that I am not apportioning blame between the employees and the ployers. I would think blame rests somewhere, not equally, between the two. I dealfirstlywith wool. In May 1975 the Australian Wool CorporWhen ation revealed that taking wool from a bourne wool store to a ship's hold cost 7.22c kilo. For the ship to take the wool to Europe have it deUvered to a mill door cost 8.49c a kUo. The apple grower gets approximately $2 a carton for all of his labour. The cost of a carton of apples becomes $4.50 by the time the apples are picked, packed and deUvered alongside a ship. then costs $1.17 a carton just to load those applesdone into the ship. It now costs about $24 to shift tonne of bagged rice from the raU truck beside the ship in Sydney into the hold of the ship. comparison the rice mill has to receive, store, transport, mill, quaUty control-in fact, do everything-for $23 a tonne compared with a tonne to move the stuff from the raU truck into the ship. With the history of the waterfront and its to every person in this country, as shown so clearly by thesefiguresand by other today, it is tremendously important that the correct decision is made about control mechanisms and arrangements for the future on the waterin front. I believe the Minister indicated that it the Government's intention to move out of its regulatory role, through the Australian Stevedorable ing Industry Authority, rather than to move the other way-that is, virtually to acquire or nationalise the industry. When referring to of the important areas of concern in making deensure cisions as to how this will be accompUshed, Minister, in his 18 November speech, referred to 3 special areas. They were: Measures aimed at securing cost restraint. Measures to protect the interests of tralian Stevedonng Industry Authority. Measures to overcome the problems of the industry as had been identified in the report presented to me by Mr Justice Northrop. I emphasise as strongly as I can that if we are ing this role for the future- I am in no way disagreeing with it-it is tremendously important that the Government estabUsh, through a market force system or some other system, a mechanism which will prevent an unholy alliance between the employer and the employee on the watercern. front which will be to the detriment of aU Ausoccasion traUans, particularly those who Uve by exports imports. on the prob Mr STREET (Corangamite-Minister for the waterEmployment and Industrial Relations) (3.35)-This has been, I think, a useful and eminteresting debate. I wish to make a few if references to issues that were raised by all honourable members who have contributed to it. leading for the Opposition, the honourMelable member for GeUibrand (Mr Willis) made a some criticism of the Government for not being and abie to determine final arrangements for the industry by the end of this year. I can remember speaking in this House and indicating some concern at the continual extensions to the temporary provisions legislation. But I do say that since this It Government has been in office more has been in this year to work out some better future a arrangements in the industry not only than occurred in the 3 years when the Labor GovernBy ment was in office but also than occurred for a great many years. The discussions which have taken place so far have been complex. The nego$24 tiations have involved a great number of different organisations and different individuals, aU with different objectives. We have come some way towards charting the future for the industry. cost I am glad to hear from the honourable member that he too feels that there are chances of reachspeakers ing reasonable agreement. The honourable member referred to changes the Prices Justification Tribunal legislation. I is must say that it is nonsense to suggest that the Prices Justification Tribunal in future will not be to expose costs in the industry as it has in fact done on this occasion. In my statement on 6 May I said that it was proper that costs in this some industry should come under surveillance to that prices set are fair both to the suppUer the and to the consumer. Under the changes to the Prices Justification Tribunal legislation, the Tribunal can still initiate its own inquiries. Indeed, the Government can take the initiative as well.",55
153,Mr YOUNG,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY,This industry is highly competithe staff of the Austive; it wiU be exempted.,57
154,Mr STREET,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY,"There will be no question of exemption in this respect. It is just not true to say that the changes in the legislation will make it impossible for the PJT to do in the future what it takis doing now. That is the point I am making. The honourable member for Gellibrand rightly drew attention to the problem of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority staff. This has been an issue that has caused me great conI have referred to it on more than one in this House. I think the honourable or member was a little unfair when he criticised me for not keeping the staff of the ASIA informed as to what was going on. I kept the staff informed to the maximum extent possible. But I would not think that the honourable member or any other member of this House would consider it proper to inform the staff of the Authority ahead of mforming the Parliament. That was myfirstresponsibility. As soon as that was done, I informed the staff of the Authority of what I had in mind. As the honourable member has said, negodadons and discussions have proceeded with the staff. I appreciate the concern of the members, but it just was not possible to take the acdon recommended by the honourable member prior to informing the Parliament itself. The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) made a most interesting and useful contribution to this debate. I thank him for his personal comments. The Government certainly does need goodwill, support and perhaps a Uttle bit of luck as well in arriving at a fair and reasonable arrangement for the future of this industry. The honourable member rightly drew attention to the of the turbulent industrial relations history of the industhat they try and the legacy of bitterness practices have left behind them. He referred also industry to doisjust to the great problems caused by employers not that these discussions always resisting pressure from wage claims made That appUes particularly on them. As herightlypointed out, conceding in of the Australian Stevedoring this area affects all Australian citizens because of ority. They, too, want to know with the increased cost of goods coming into and soon as is possible what will be happening going out of the country. The honourable memthem. ber referred also to the question of contracts of employment in the United States of America and the possible application of this principle in contributed Australia. What he said is true: Industrial law in those members this country isfloutedin a way happen in other areas of law. Nobody benefits tremendous amount of workwho from that state of affairs. We certainly find a solution to the huge economic and social way. This has required patience, are problems that that situation causes. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) referred more particularly to the probthemselves, lems of redundancy not only in the stevedoring industry but also in other industries. He drew attention to the specific difficulties of the smaller non-permanent ports such as Geelong. Government is well aware of this aspect. We have already said that we will need to be satisfied that the smaller ports will not be disadvantaged. The honourable member to the fact that the possible future reduction of the port quota in Geelong would mean that the port could not handle any peaks in cargo which might come into the port. I say merely at this forthwith. stage that in the context of the negotiations on redundancy which are going on now we are ing at the major ports. I remind the honourable time. member for Corio that reference to my statement of a week or so ago will show that the transferabiUty of labour is an essential part of any new arrangements. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) raised several important issues flowing from the Prices Justification Tribunal inquiry, particularly the high costs of handling cargo in Australia. I referred to that aspect a moment ago. staff He drew attention to the very favourable terms and conditions of employment in the waterfront industry. That of course is one of the main concerns of the Government. The inquiry by the PJT has brought all these costs out into the open for thefirsttime at an official level. We will certainly need to be satisfied, as I said on 6 May and reiterated the other day, that adequate price surveUlance mechanisms will be avaUable to help keep the costs of the industry under review. The discussions and negotiations on the future industry are now under way. I am hopeful will be pursued with vigour and speed. that previous I think there a wUlingness on both sides of the that. It is in nobody's interests should drag out too long. to the future of the staff Industry Authcertainty as to I thank the honourable members who have to this debate. I also pay tribute to of the industry and to members which does not of my own Department have done a in laying the ground do need to rules for the negotiations which now under tolerance, and goodwUl on all sides. I am hopeful that, if those quaUdes can be brought to the negotiations we may be at last on the way to a better, more workable structure for the Australian waterfront.

156,Mr YOUNG,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,"Before commencing to comment on this Bill let me just say that the Opposition is becoming perturbed the manner in which the administration of legislation is being handled in this House. For the third time in as many weeks the Opposition been asked to break the normal procedures in dealing with legislation in that it has had to with amendments that have come into this House late, well after legislation has been prewould sented. It ought to be understood that there been some sort of convention about allowing an Opposition at least one week to look at the way in which governments will deal with legislation. In the case of the conciliation and arbitration legislation, the Aboriginal land legislation and now the legislation to amend the Pnces JustificaJustification tion Tribunal Act we have been forced to constaff, sider amendments that have reached us very late in the legislative process. The Opposition regisenormously. ters its protest at this method of appUcation cause, as in the case of the 2 other pieces of lation that I have mentioned in respect of which amendments were given to us late, the proposed amendments to the Bill before us are quite siderable in the intent of the way in which propose to amend the Act. I think that the Government should be able tidy up its method of dealing with these BUls that die Opposition should be given the legisprice. lation in to to. If the legislation is not prepared properly and is not ready to be given to the position it should be delayed until suchtimeas is complete. If this practice is adopted our mittees will be able to deal with all the matters that will come up for debate. The Opposition was given the proposed amendments to the Prices Justification Amendment Bill yesterday. Opposhould sition members who wiU foUow me in this debate will deal with the ramification ments. I will be dealing mainly with the effect of the social contract that may have been in existence in Australia prior to this legislation being colleague introduced into the House. This Bill is opposed by the Opposition. The Government seems intent on hoisting on absolute Australia some massive dose of economic madand ness. WhUst in the process of hurling abuse at Commonwealth ConcUiation and Arbitration taken. Comrnission the Government brings into this that House legislation which in essence draws the BILL 1976 teeth of the Prices Justification Tribunal. Second Reading Devaluation will bring greater pressures on the wage and salary earners to attempt to keep up with massive price increases which will follow as a result of the increased price of imported goods. I ask the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) and the Government to explain how any social contract will continue in this at country under such conditions? I want to pay some attention to the devaluahas tion that has taken place subsequent to the introduction of this Bill. It is a pity that the deal honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Kelly) has left the chamber because I am sure that he be taking an interest in the impact of the has ll A per cent devaluation upon the social conl tract, the inflation rate in Australia and the role of tribunals like the Prices Justification Tribunal in the present circumstances. I do not think that the impact of devaluation can be ignored in this debate. Instead of Umiting the role of the Prices Tribunal, whether it be in terms of administration, pubUc inquiries or whatever, the legislation should be extending the role We all should have learned the lesbeson of the tariff cuts that took place under the legisprevious Government. At the time those cuts were made it was felt that considerable benefit would flow through to consumers in Australia. conBut we found that perhaps the importers were they much smarter than the then Government in terms of marking up goods that were imported at the lower dutiable rate. Now we have the situto ation where, in Australia, we should have conandsiderable stock which has been bought at the old But there will be an overlapping of the prices which should be paid now and the prices Opwhich should be paid on new goods which will it have the 17.5 per cent added to the price, comperhaps together with the freight rates which may be paid in some foreign currency, particularly Umted States dollars. As the Prices Justification Tribunal warned during the week, it be given an increased role, a poUceman's role, of seeing what will happen to consumers in of those amendthis turnabout. A prediction was made a few weeks ago by a of mine. He has received great blame for devaluing the dollar. All honourable members on this side of the House consider that to be nonsense. He said that blind Freddie his dog could see that the Australian dollar the was overvalued and that action would have to be If I can use the same phrase, I point out bUnd Freddie and his dog can see that tariffs will have to be reduced. It is absolutely incredible that the Government has made the announcement on devaluation without accommodating action being taken on tariffs. While industries around Australia are perhaps welcoming this addidonal protection which has been given to them, they know as well as anybody else inside or outside this Parliament that they could not possibly go to the Industries Assistance Commission and seek that type of addidonal protection under normal circumstances. It is absolutely astounding why the Government has to make these decisions apart from each other-wh y this cannot be done in a package. The spin-off in not reducing the tariffs is, as we have seen demonstrated in the House this week, the belief that the Government by some magic wand wiU be able to convince the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the Australian Council of Trade Unions that everybody should ignore the increased inflation rate which will occur in Australia because of devaluation and with no action being taken or tariffs. There are people with better knowledge than I in relation to the economic system which will apply in Australia over the next 12 months who say that under present circumstances devaluation could possibly add 4 per cent to 5 per cent to the expected inflation rate in this country. Are we to believe that the Government will convince the Arbitrauon Commission that the increased cost of living which has been bestowed on wage and salary earners in Australia through the increased cost of goods will be ignored, that the wage and salary earners have to take this drop in the living standards to overcome the problems? The answer is: Obviously not. If action is not taken on tariffs, if the Arbitration Commission is interfered with-perhap s in some subtle way this is inferred by Government spokesmen, particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Lynch)-w e will have either an enormous inflation rate in Australia or a great industrial confrontation in 1977. The Government must know this. When the right honourable member for Lowe (Mr WUliam MCMahon) led the attack in the Government party room yesterday, honourable members should have Ustened. What he was saying is correct. I draw attention to what the Government is expecting. This is why I draw this matter into the discussion on the Prices Justification Tribunal. As far as we can see this is relevant. The reason for setting up the Tribunal was to try to buUd some sort of social contract in Australia. If the wage and salary earners are to go before the Arbitration Commission to justify their prices increases, why should not the employers or the manufacturers go before the Prices Justification Tribunal to justify their price increases? It seems to me that Government supporters want the best of both worlds. They not only want the Arbitration Commission to ignore the justice in the claims for keeping up with the consumer price index but also want to take away from the Prices Justification Tribunal its overseer role in looking at pricerisesin Australia. The action of the Government last week has only to be seen in the annual report of the Department of Overseas Trade for honourable members to understand what sort of effect it will have in Australia. The economist for the Adelaide Advertiser, Edward Nash, considers that imports could cost Australian purchasers or consumers an additional 22 per cent. If we look at thefiguresfor the Department of Overseas Trade we find that in relation to the $8000m worth of goods which we import-if we add one-fifth to that amount we take it up to almost $ 10,000m-w e are asking consumers to bear the brunt of the additional cost of the present tariff level. At the same time we are saying that these people cannot be compensated through the Arbitration Commission. We are insisting that wage and salary earners go before the Arbitration Commission and we ignore the other end of the spectrum, namely, the justification of price increases. Many matters are involved in the amendments which the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) brings before us today. One should trace the history of the Prices Justification Tribunal. My colleague the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), when he was Treasurer of this country in 1973, introduced a measure to establish the Prices Justification Tribunal and he made it quite clear then, as has been estabUshed subsequently in both speeches in this House and in the annual reports of the Prices Justification Tribunal, that the Tribunal was not established as a prices control body. Some people in Australia thought that it should have been. They thought that as far as possible we should have had a prices control body. But that is not why the Prices Justification Tribunal was estabUshed. It was established as a justification tribunal, pretty well along the same lines as the Wage and Salary Justification Commission. Now we see that amendments are brought into try, in some way, to have the representatives of the trade unions and the white collar organisations believe that the Government has not gone back on its word, following the election, not to abolish the Prices Justification Tribunal. That was the promise given to supporters of the Libliving eral and National Country Parties during the election campaign. It was promised that the Prices Justification Tribunal would be abolished. Immediately after the election the Prime Miniscess ter found it convenient to bargain and barter with the Australian Council of Trade Unions on the basis that wage indexation would survive and that the Prices Justification Tribunal would vive. We see these amendments being brought which will virtually destroy the role of the Prices Justification Tribunal. We have also seen word of the Prime Minister on wage indexation destroyed because the Government has continuwUl ously been before the Commission arguing against the continuation of wage indexation. wage and salary earners-the vast majority of the people and their dependants in this countryfrom must understand that what they are being asked to do in the latter half of this year and in whole of 1977 is to take a massive drop in their living standards to prepare the way for this Government to be returned in 1978. One predicts with a certain amount ness that this just will not work. It is absolutely impossible to do any arithmetic which will lead one to believe that the people of Australia will take a drop of 6 per cent or 7 per cent in their Uving standard during 1977. But that is what the context Government is asking, if it is asking that the Budget. This supervisory role of the Prices Justification Tristep along theBUI bunal be taken away in looking at prices, in Party pohcy of aboUtion exposing price abuse, in holding public inquiries Budget and in doing aU those things which perhaps have had an impact on the ways in which these major monitoring companies carry on their business. The Tribunal Administrative has had a great effect upon those companies and 32 per cent in real upon the way in which they manage ness. It has meant that in many ways they have inquiries undertaken byfurther changed their procedures within the company in order to meet the demands of the Prices Justification Tribunal. Just as the investment aUowance was a flop, in terms of talking about an economicbusiness recovery this matter will also be a flop. In the week in particular this Government has gone mad. As I said earUer, we can expect another major decision on tariffs, otherwise the inflation rate and the cost of Uving in this country will soar. I shall cite, on some commodities, a few figures which were exposed in the newspapersThey during the week. Perhaps people do not underwhat stand what this Government is asking consumers to do. Twenty per cent of the motor vehicles sold in Australia are fully imported-that is, about 140 000 motor vehicles from overseas are sold in this country. Let me point out the way in which the cost of in this country will be affected. Not only will the price of imported motor vehicles jump by about 20 per cent but without the Prices Justification Tribunal it will be a fairly simple profor local manufacturers to lift their prices to near the mark of the imported product. That will be the spin off from taking away the role of the Prices Justification Tribunal. Let us have a look surat some of these prices. The Chrysler Lancer, an inimported car, which now sells for $4,386 will be $5,307 under the new valuation rates. The Datthe sun 260Z costs $8,909 at the moment and will cost $10,769. The Fiat 128 which is now $4,657 be $5,634. The Peugeot 504 costs $9,189 at present and will cost $11,130. The Saab 99, So which is a popular imported car, costs $10,401 and will cost $12,585. People can get some idea those motor vehicle prices of what will hapen with all the other commodities. As I said, the 8,000m worth of goods are corning into this country from overseas and, when the old stock runs out, they will be 20 per cent more expensive. That will mean a great hike in the infiation rate in this country. Obviously some action has to be of assuredtaken in regard to tariffs. The Prices Justification Amendment Bill cannot be seen in isolation. It must be seen in the ment in of the decisions taken by the Governrelation to the PJT in the 1976-77 must also be seen as the second road to the announced Liberal of the PJT. The Lynch sealed the fate of the PJT, the only price body in Australia. Salary appropriations were slashed by 10 per cent in real terms. cost appropriations were cut by terms. A deUberate poUcy was their busiintroduced to reduce the the number of Tribunal. This Bill confirms the real desire of the big supporters of the Liberal and Country lastParties. They were the people who required the Prime Mmister to pledge the aboUtion of the PJT in return for theirfinancialsupport for the coaUtion in last year's election campaign. Now they have realised the effect that carrying out this pledge would have in industrial relations terms. realise that it would demonstrate to aU that business wants in this country is to freeze wages and free prices and profits. The Tribunal itself in its recent annual report recognised these motivating forces. Acknowledging that it has been a natural target for criticism, it said on page 121: Some of the criticisms did not go to the nature bunal's operation, but appeared to be mainly motivated by sectional considerations. These sectional interests, supported by the Government, have thus devised the indirect approach-slo w suffocation rather than the immediacy of the guillotine. But the fact remains that the real intention of these amendments is confirm the uneven 'social contract' which Government is imposing on wage and salary earners. Side by side with the National ployers Policy Committee, the Australian Government breasts the bar of the Arbitration Commission to argue for a reduction in real incomes for wage and salary earners, while in privacy of the boardrooms and in thinly veiled legislation such as this, business is advised with profits and prices they can' let it rip'. This Bill is further evidence of the Fraser Government's willingness to bow to narrow tional interests. It has done it for the graziers with the superphosphate bounty and for the doctors with Medibank, and now it is doing it for the wealthiest companies in Australia. On the quesbeen tion of devaluation, time and again we have told that the mining interests and the exporting primary producing sections were carrying an even share of the burden in our economy. There are more people unemployed in Australia today than work in the mining industry. What about their share of the burden? What is happening about putting them back to work and doing forced something for them rather than worrying about the mining interests or some sections of the rural industries which we are told are carrying unfair share of the burden? There can be no doubt that the Tribunal has been successful in limiting price increases and there can be no doubt that this is the real reason inquiries; for this legislation. The Federal Law Review in 1975-76. June 1975 declared that the PJT occupied a unique place in the development of Australia's period legal and economic systems. The PJT itself following estimated that it saved the Australian consumer companies $235m in its first year of operation. This is the amended answer to the spurious claim of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs that his amendQuite ments will allow the PJT to concentrate more on eliminating price abuse. The PJT has already dealt effectively with price abuse. There is way known that it can be 'more effective' reduced staff, reduced funds and restricted termsrequirements of reference. The proposed changes may satisfy the whims of 1 per cent of the biggest companiesits in Australia, but they will not deal with price rises by the thousands of small businesses whichfrom of the Tri- Uve by purchasing goods and materials from large companies. The Minister is dishonest in speaking of'pubUc submission' on the future of the Tribunal. The Government took submissions from the pubUc when reviewing the PJT legislation but it has never made those submissions pubUc. There is no to evidence to support the Minister's assertion that the most of the submissions sought changes in the Tribunal. There is no evidence of any dupUcadon Emof functions between the PJT, the Industries Assistance Commission and the Trade Practices Commission. The IAC looks at the problems of industries as a whole; the PJT looks at particular the companies. The Minister also refers to consultations which have taken place with the trade that union movement, but in the same breath he makes it clear in his second reading speech that the changes contained in the Bill reflect the decisions taken by the Government. Token consulsectation was aU that was involved. It is naive for the Minister to claim that because 90 per cent of notified price increases have approved there is a 'high level of price rebeensponsibility' among Australian business. The impact of the PJT extends far beyond the 10 per uncent of price increases which are disaUowed. Business generally has been restrained from raising prices unnecessarily through the mere existence of the PJT. The fact that companies have had to go before it and justify their proposals has them to look more critically at their operations and their responsibUities to the public. The annual report of the PJT for 1975-76 underlines an this point. At page 11 the report states: Since the beginning of its operations on 1 August 1973 the Tribunal has processed 19 100 notices of higher prices; 3859 in 1973-74,7502 in 1974-75 and 7739 during 1975-76. Over the same period, the Tribunal has held 53 public 15 in 1973-74, 33 in 1974-75 and 5 during 2757 notices of proposed higher prices received over the were either withdrawn by companies or were varied to provide for lower prices than those originally proposed, inquiries by the Tribunal and discussions with the concerned. The numbers of notices withdrawn or 1975-76. was 457 in 1973-74, 1181 in 1974-75 and 1119 in clearly, many millions of doUars of'excessive' price rises have been involved in these appUcations. Recognition of this factor has forced no companies to modify their price demands. The with a Government is proposing that these be eased. Its attitude on modification of price demands is markedly different from attitude on modification of wage demands. The Government proposes that the PJT exempt price justification those industries in which there is 'significant and effective competition'. This proposal begs the question of how the deand, gree of competition is to be assessed. Would it on an industry-by-industry basis after suitable public inquiries? This implies a very long selecance tion process. It also implies consequent injustice to those arbitrarily placed at the end of queue. Would the Trade Practices Commission be required to provide its assessment of the gree of competition in each industry by way of analysis of cleared or authorised restrictive tices, and the apparent level of unauthorised illegal practices, in that industry? Or would very large cross section of industry be arbitrarily selected on the basis of concepts such as the number of competingfirmsin the industry, the level of imports or the recent history of price increases of the overall level of profits to be as criteria. Concepts of competition are difficult to define. It is well recognised that under normal business conditions a fairly nig' degree ship prevails in Australia and it is very unusual fbr afirmwith substantial capital assets to cut The prices so as to increase significantly its share of larly the market, thereby obtaining increased production and economies of scale rationalised range of products. Competition tends to be soft competition and price cuts are ation usually muted by descriptions such as 'specials' for a limited period with a subsequent return the recommended retail price. Like the Budget strategy, the real aims of this will simply legislation remain unstated. Any examination of force the Government's words and actions in recent Business months leads to the inevitable and now wideterms spread conclusion that the Government's desire the changes to increase the profits of its business supporters is to be achieved at the expense of wage and salary reduction earners. Certainly, the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has with made no attempt to hide the fact that he expectsbeingathat wage earners to carry the major burden for the fight against inflation through deliberately increased unemployment and cuts in real wages, on the one hand, and devaluation, on the other hand. The winding back of consumer incomes is certainly not likely to generate a consumer recovery. Consumers cannot spend more when their wages have been slashed through the imposition of the Medibank levy and higher taxes or when their jobs are threatened by comindex. pany crashes and closedowns and when prices ment are increased by the effects of devaluation. matter how high profits are allowed to go, ness will not invest unless consumers have the ability and the desire to buy the new products produced. Capital investment is now declining rapidly in real terms, is already less than the quarbe terly levels existing at the end of 1972. The windfall double depreciation and investment allowpackage in thefirsthalf of this year did not achieve the take-off of investment demand, the the increased employment and the boost to consumer spending predicted of it by the Governdement. Part of the reason for the failure of that an package was, of course, the fact that this Governpracment had deliberately set out to reduce spending andpower for wage and salary earners. The Governa ment has stated that the key to its desired economic recovery is a return to pre-1972 levels of the relative share of gross non-farm domestic product going to capital and labour. There is no particular reason advanced for this thesis. The used Government may say that the tribunal will have greater capacity to use its resources to investigate those areas where there is evidence of price abuse, but the facts belie the statement. At page 7 of its report, the Tribunal alludes to this contraof price leaderdiction when it says: refilling of any staff vacancies has also been particudifficult due to the uncertainty about the tribunal's future operations. with a Later the report states: Such a climate was hardly conducive to the efficient operof the Tribunal and was particularly unsettling from the point of view of policy development. to It is clear that the Tribunal is destined to be reduced to a pale shadow of its former self and monitor price increases, rather than companies to justify them. The Minister for and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) says as much in his statement. In congratulatory he records that the 'cumulative purpose of is to bring about a very significant in the number of companies which must notify the Tribunal of their price increases' view to the Tribunal's principal function approval'. of'price surveillance rather than price Already companies are refusing to co-operate with the Tribunal by refusing or delaying the supply of requested statistical information. The led effects of the Government's proposed changes will be to enable price increases for goods and services toflowback and forth between industries until they appear in the consumer price At that time, as we all know, the Goverawill attempt to stop the key supplier of serNo vices-the labour force-obtainin g its price busiincrease. Thus, the Government's policy is clearly one in which productivity gains are to be considered from now on as the exclusive reward of the business sector. There are many other areas which the Opposition will discuss during the Committee stage. My colleagues who speak after me will expose what the Government is doing at this end of the spectrum on the question of price increases by manufacturers and businesses in Australia.",60
157,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) made an absolutely incredible speech. The speech was obviously written by someone who was not aware that the Government, after the election in December, decided to retain the Prices Justification Tribunal. The first half of speech presumed that the Tribunal was to abolished. The second half of the speech coneffective tained a great and growing misunderstanding of what the Tribunal was about. It is said that every member of this place in him to make at least one good speech in the same way as every block of granite has it in it make at least one good statue. I have seen many a good statue but I am still waidng for a speech from the honourable member. come from him this afternoon. In the first place, he has a quaint misunderstanding that the activirefer ties of the motor car industry will not be monithe tored by the Prices Justification Tribunal. That just not correct. It was never intended and even the simplest person in this chamber did not understand it in that way. Nevertheless, we heard that proposition from the honourable member. The second proposition that he ward ought to be remembered. He wants the Prices Justification Tribunal in today's circumstances to maintain- I use his own words because I think they should be repeated over and over again- a policeman's role. His understanding of the policeman's role is of somebody who would pry, pimp, cajole and bully. He sees for the Triof bunal the role which was understood to apply it prior to December 1974. In his own words he wants it to return to that role. In his third proposition he shows his complete misunderstanding. He does not realise that the first of the 2 principal amendments to the Prices Justification Tribunal Act-ther e are a number minor amendments-merel y raises the size of turnover by a corporation which has to abide the notification procedures from $20m to That has been a perfectly reasonable, fair and sensible proposition. He does not realise that other substantial amendment applies in respect of the subsidiaries of companies which are subthat ject to the notification procedure. They are not point. subject to it again. The honourable member who comes from a State which has a large white goods and motor car manufacturing industry, fails to understand that thousands of subsidiary organisations will now be released from the procedures. By not understanding it, he does not realise that that is a boon and that the Tribunal is certainly not acting in the role of a bullying policeman. The honourable member for Adelaide, a front bench member of the Opposition, does not even understand these points. One other proposition which runs through his speech ought to be exposed. It has been put forward in this chamber since 1973 when the Labor Government was looking for excuses for the rate the of inflation. Over and over again it said that be inflation can be brought down by use of the price control powers of the Prices Justification Tribunal. That attitude was abandoned subsequent to 1973 but it was the philosophy has it that motivated the speech of the honourable member this afternoon. That proposition will not to work. It was never likely to work and I am sorry to see him returning to that theory of 3 years ago. good Common sense would indicate that he should It did not not return to it. I turn now to recent price rises in Australia. I to the last consumer price index to illustrate point because it needs to be made. The Prices is Justification Tribunal of its nature cannot be an aggregate brake on inflation in Australia. It can misdeal with certain companies which in fact propose to charge prices that are not justified, but there is no way in which it can brake the aggreput forgate role of inflation in Australia. One only has to look at the consumer price index over a period to see the multitude of price rises which are not subject to and which do not come even within the ambit of control or interest of the Prices Justification Tribunal. Almost none the prices that have risen very quickly since to 1968 comes within the ambit of control of the Tribunal. Some examples are rents, rates, service charges, motoring service charges by pubUc authorities, all charges by public authorities and statutory corporations and postal and telephone services. If one is looking for a brake on inflation by merely consulting the changes in the conof sumer price index over a period to see where the pressures have been on the baskets of goods for by which people have to spend their household dol$30m. lars, the Prices Justification Tribunal philosophically, economicaUy and in every other the way cannot and is not equipped to do the job. I ask honourable members to look at the mentaUty was put forward here this afternoon on that I was fascinated with the proposition put by the honourable member for Port Adelaide this afternoon. It was like going back to the first daysinflation of the Tribunal when front bench members of the Opposition who were then in government conjured up the events subsequent to the Vietexcellent nam war as accounting for the rate of inflation which they generated in Australia. This was donePrices by members of the Opposition. They said that international transmission of money as a result that war accounted for the rate of inflation Australia. There were the old propositions imported infiation. They have not been proposed in this chamber for sometimebut they mate the mind of the honourable member who lead for the Opposition in this debate. I am under afraid that he has not gone ahead with the times.Adelaide There is one area in which this body, I believe,argument can do a very great and salutary piece of work under today's circumstances. Today's circumbe stances have been dominated by the \7Vi per cent effective devaluation of the Australian lar. In going for that proposition the Government has quite clearly said that it wants to promote that means increased economic activity in Australia. We know that it has acknowledged that that is going to cause",65
158,Mr YOUNG,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,Why does it not work?,66
159,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,The honourable memcomes ber's Party has tried it in the past. understand it. When his Party tried it in 1974 he did not understand it. It can be tried under tain circumstances of control and with the sense that our people have. The honourable member has never understood what he is talking about invariation this respect. He manifested that this afternoon for 30 minutes. I would like to test him on some of the clauses in the Bill. I would like to discussguarantee some of these clauses when we come to the Com-the mittee stage. The honourable member has yet prove himself. Mr Antony Whitlam- I hope you do.,66
160,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,"Le t the honourable and member for Port Adelaide defend himself. The honourable member for Grayndler can look bers after himself. He is big enough serious proposition. When there change of currency throughout the world in the past it has generated a sticky situation. A change then in the balance of payments of the country which devalued its currency existed for quite sometime.There was also the situation in whichproposal the effect of imported goods on the degree inflation in that country was muted for some reading time. It did not occur immediately. But with a quicker reaction on the part of entrepreneurs, buyers and sellers as a result of communication Tribunal with changes in the price of goods, the effect onor will be rather quicker on this occasion than it has been in the past. Dr Perkins of the University of Melbourne pointed that out in an article in the Australian Financial Review earUer this year. This means that the Justification Tribunal will have the very ansalutary and important task to separate out the of cost-pric e changes to goods presently landed in in Australia from the cost-price changes to those about which are bought by the new devalued Australian doUar. It has a very important role. It cerstill ani-tainly is not a poUceman's role. Let me take care of one other proposition which the honourable member for Port still labours. He has obviously used his at many meetings. He said it is important that the Prices Justification Tribunal should strong. He said that because a union has to go to an arbitration commission to obtain a pay rise dolit is equally important that a company, corporation or somebody charging a price for a good in bythefieldshould go to the Tribunal in order to have that price accepted. The 2 situations are altogether different. When an arbitration commission-eve n the one in the honourable member's own State of which I hope he would have some knowledge-determine s a wageriseit bemandatory and an absolute right. He does not Mr YOUNG - And a minimum. cer Mr KEVIN CAIRNS-That isright.It becomes an absolute guarantee. But when a company goes to the Tribunal and obtains a price there is no guarantee as to the viability of that company in the future. There is no guarantee as to its profitabUity. There is no as to its abiUty to employ people. So 2 situations are altogether different. The tohonourable member for Port Adelaide ought to appreciate that they are quite different. After all the people who showed in Australia how to cause both inflation and unemployment at the one time who introduced the new word of negflation into the Australian vocabulary were the memof the Opposition. It is due to serious misunto do it. This isderstanding a such as I have mentioned that they has been a were able to do so. I would like to draw the Minister's attention to one part of the Bill about which I have some doubts. It is an alteration to the functions of the Tribunal. I do not doubt for one moment that the has been brought in with the greatest of goodwill and sincerity. That is obvious from this part of the Bill. But I doubt that it in fact can work. I refer to clause IS which states: (2) In exercising its functions under sub-section (1), the shall have due regard to the need for the company companies concerned to achieve a level of profitability that is sufficient to enable the company or companies to maintain an adequate level of investment and employment. That clause is very similar to one that was another introduced as an amendment to the ConcUiation one and Arbitration Act earUer this year. The former amendment was designed to see that when the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission made a determination the effect on inflation and ployment would be taken into account. In this case the level of profitabUity as it affects investcan ment and employment can be overridden comcase. pletely by the state of the economy at a particular time. In the former case the effect of a wage panies deterrnination can be overridden in its effect on inflation and employment completely by the isfaction state of the economy at that time. I merely suggest to the Minister that he consider having a simUar amendment made the clause so that the state of the economy is sidered at the time. There could be 2 equal situnot ations in which a price rise might be awarded. One might be awarded when the demand misunderstandings through the front door and on the factory floor too low. A similar price rise might be given when the demand through the front door and on the factory floor is much higher. In the second case the abUity to be able to maintain an adequate level of profitabUity for investment and employYoung). ment purposes would be much greater than it would be in the former case. So the Prices Justhe tification Tribunal must and ought to take these matters into consideration. The intention of this Bill is quite clear. pose is to keep a promise that was made by Government. The Government made a promise measure. that it would keep the Tribunal substantially in the form in which it was towards the end of last year. To that end, it has introduced 2 principal amendments and a number of smaller amendelection ments. It is absolutely absurd to say or to contend or even to misunderstand that the Tribunal effecequally tively has been done away with. Many members of the Opposition say that the Prices Justification Tribunal was effectively emasculated towards the end of 1974 when there was the famous letterdeUberately. to the Tribunal by the former Prime Minister. was not but the Opposition misunderstood position in that way and it is misunderstanding in The a simUar way what has been proposed now. I befact that Ueve that the Prices Justification Tribunal ought control, to be understood for what it can do, not for what tains it cannot do. It is not a prices control body. not a policing body. It is not a bullying body. It will substantially become a prices surveiUance body. It is able to work in conjunction with the Trade Practices Commission and the Act. It be able to work also with the Industries Assistance Commission. They will have complementary roles and not roles that substitute for one and not roles that negative the effects of another. I believe that the Bill deserves an opportunity to work and ought to be looked at in that way by emthe Opposition. It ought not to be seen as the principal means whereby inflation in Australia be brought under control. That was never the We have never said that that would be the case. It will have a limited role in relation to comof various sizes and it will maintain its surveillance role. It will be able to do that to the satof the Australian people only in so far as there is total equilibrium within the Australian community and total equilibrium within the might economic community. In the absence of aggreto gate equUibrium of the main ingredients of con-national production any tribunal such as this will be able to intercept price rises that will just have to occur. That is where the most serious occur. We cannot pull off isexcess weight merely by pulUng a belt in and we cannot puff down pricerisesmerely by giving to the Prices Justification Tribunal the kind of policing role that was proposed for it by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr That will not work. It has been tried in the past and I hope that we would not revert to role for the Tribunal that was reserved for it by members of the Opposition during 1973 and early 1974. Its pur Mr CREAN (Melbourne Ports) (4.38)-I the should like to say a few words about this If I may say so, I think I was one of the architects of the Prices Justification Tribunal. I do not think we ever had any extravagant ideas that it would stop inflation. It was part of our program in 1972 that just as wages have to be justified in the arbitration mechanism, there should be some justification on the part of those whofixedthe prices of the goods and services that the wage earner was supposed to buy. The term 'justification' was used The criteria of the Tribunal is, I It think, well set out in its annual report for the 1975-76 in which it was stated: Tribunal's attitude to criteria is conditioned by the it is concerned with prices justification, not price and by the fact that the Prices Justification Act conno guidelines, criteria or tests to be observed by it. It is If I may say so, we made the Act deUberately skeletal. In fact, I often said that it seemed to me that everybody seemed to know what the PJT ought to do, except the members of the Tribunal will itself. This was the reason that we did not establish criteria. The annual report of the Tribunal continues: In particular, the Tribunal believes that the legislation under which it is established panies unduly in using pricing methods which they found most suitable for their circumstances provided not appear contrary to the public interests. After all, one should be concerned occasionally about public interest. The report states further: Thus, while the Tribunal must and does have general criteria by which it evaluates whether prices are justified, it does not believe that at this time they can usefully be reduced to arigidcode. The Tribunal's general approach was briefly summarised in a passage in the report concerning General MotorsHolden's Pty Ltd and General Motors-Holden's Sales Pty Ltd . . . which was cited at page 20 of the first annual report of the Tribunal and which is still largely appropriate. I think it is sensible, therefore, to refer to what is said at page 20 of the first report of the Prices Justification Tribunal which states: In considering this case things to the following matters as being relevant, namely whether: (a) the cost increases were known to have rather than merely expected; (b) such increases were unavoidable; (c) such increases could be offset by greater efficiency; (d) sufficient accounting allowance was made effects of improved productivity on costs in general the benefits being sufficienty passed on to the consumer; (e) the price increase is profitability of the Company including the investment. I simply cite that paragraph in particular. What At the endrecorded is now being written into the Act has been folenterprises lowed already by the Tribunal. I would have prepanies ferred that it had been left that way. The first Associated report of the PJT states further We point out that such considerations nature and should not be applied in arigidor mechanical way. I also was rather interested to read a document prepared by a gendeman who I understand, one of his roles, is an economic adviser to Government. The gentleman to whom I am referring is Dr Neville Norman, senior lecturer, Department of Economics, University of Melfirms bourne. In the document entided The Prices Jusand tification Tribunal Stage Two, the learned doctor refers to the rather confusing situation that exists in Australia at the moment-that the Prices Jusof tification Tribunal, after all, is not the in Australia concerned with prices charged. There are two other bodies, the Industries Assistconsumer ance Commission and the Trade Practices Comtalking mission. Dr Norman states: The IAC believes that prices of most industrial goods in Australia are set with reference to the duty-inclusive price of imported goodsThat is rather interesting in the face of the recent is not intended to restrict comhave devaluation and the great potential there is now they do for the setting of new prices by Australian firms if, as he says, thefirmshave acted on the assumption they can set prices nearly as high as the tariff would otherwise permit. Dr Norman continues: . . . the premise behind PJT operations is that market power and cost increases are used in a fairly simple fashion to enforce higher prices . . . than would otherwise be the case. The third body, he states: . . . the TPC acts to investigate various arrangements or practices that may be seen as preludes to the exercise of market power. The implied view of the price mechanism differs widely between the PJT and the LAC especially in reference to the relevance of cost movements. Here the theories used by the IAC dispute that movements in domestic costs in individual industries are reflected in prices; the PJT has built its operation largely on the premise that they would be. we have had regard amongst other I think that the time has come in Australia when we have to reconcile the operation of a occurred number of economic control bodies. On one hand we have the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which is resigned to regulate or justify the payment of wages. Wages are still the major source of income in Australia and wage for the earners are still the major source of consumer and whether expenditure in Australia. On the other hand of improved productivity were there.is the Prices Justification Tribunal. Its justified having regard to the annual report contains some rather interesting return on figures on the number of firms which come within its ambit, and it states: of June 1976, the Tribunal had 480 prescribed in its register. The term 'enterprise' is here used to include single companies and 'groups' of comas described in section 5 of the Prices Justification Act. with these enterprises were 4427 related companies. A breakdown of the enterprises by recent annual turnovers, according to information available to the Triare of a general bunal, is set out below. There were 34firmswhich had a turnover of between $20m and $25m, 48firmswith turnovers in between $25m and $30m, 52firmswith turnthis overs between $30m and $35m, 44firmswith turnovers between $35m and $40m, 25 firms with turnovers between $40m and $45m, 16 with turnovers between $45m and $50m, 261 firms, close to two-thirds of the total, with turnovers of $50m or more. One can make the rough economic calculation that two-thirds the total activity is within the ambit of those only body261 companies and their aUiances. On the other hand, if one is talking about the price index, for the most part we are about retaU prices. Many of the prices that the Prices Justification Tribunal is concerned with are not so much retail as wholesale prices. In fact, had I had my way in regard to the bunal I would not have put retaU pricing within its ambit. I believe retail pricing is better trolled in the hands of the States. shows the difficulties we have in a federal It is all right for the Government to take great unction to itself about new federalism and saying that it is neady encompassed in giving back litde of the income tax to the States. The variety of economic activity in Australia is diversified. There are 2 important places still as far as prices are concerned and they are the cities of Sydney and Melbourne. I have long beUeved that State governments have been very recalcitrant in doing anything in the great arena of retaU pricfuture. ing. After all, what can be done in Canberra about the prices in the supermarkets of Melduce bourne or Sydney? Perhaps Mr Wran will be able to set a leading example in this direction the State of Victoria. I believe that the time has come when there has to be some co-operation and cohesion bebe tween the various mechanisms operating in Australia. After aU, we set up the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission because of the beto Uef that the community, while applauding the virtues of the market system, knows that in practhe tice it does not operate. The big operators are very big and the small operator has chance in the face of the existence of the erators. One of the means of slighdy mitigating things in favour of the small operator is to restrictive practices legislation. I regard as sheer nonsense the views uttered at the level of government ment at the moment about inflation causing unover employment, as though the whole of the unemessentially ployment in Australia would go away tomorrow if by some miraculous means we were able eliminate inflation. The structural problems inherent in Australian industry are not being looked at at the moment. It may be a sort of ism that people are not going to invest more in particular aspect of industry because they cannot get a high enough price for what they sell to recoup their costs, including their capital costs. For afirmto come along and merely say that if the Government lets it have the price it will guarantee to re-invest, in my view is not a sufficient sort of test. I must say, from reading in detaU over a period some of the cases of the Prices Justification bunal, that that Tribunal, in granting companies a profit kind of assumption, at least wanted to assured that the investment was going to take place. On the other hand I think we have come a stage in Australia now where occasionally have to say that maybe it is time we stopped Triexpanding investment in certain industries and encouraged it in others. These seem to me to be conthe kind of things we have to begin to work out This simply between the 3 bodies. system. We have the Industries Assistance Commission to encourage and assist Australian industry. Now we have the greatriddlepresented by a the Jackson Committee which tells us that if manufacturing industry is to have much of a future it has to have it in export industry rather than in local industry. Until the recent devaluation, at least, it was pretty hard to come up with likely successful candidates to expand exports of not manufactures in Australia in the foreseeable I am not too sure that altering the currency ratio by the stroke of a pen is going to prothe miracle either as far as manufacturing is concerned. It may be that in Australia we will to have to reconcUe ourselves to manufacturing being a smaUer total provider of total employment in the future than in the past. We ought to planning where the jobs are to be found for those who want to seek them. I have long said that in this country we have been training people do jobs that will not be avaUable and nave not been training them for jobs that are necessary for future. I suppose that involves getting down to a study of the education system in relation to very little industry and its needs. big opThe Government has gone through traumatic experiences. It has been very nice for it in the last have 12 months to blame everything that has gone wrong on the fact that we had a different governfor the last 3 years. I have said over and again that the problems in Australia are not different from the problems in the United States of America, in West Germany and to in the United Kingdom, to take only a few examples. The problem is that increasingly the pattern of industry in the manufacturing arena is trularge scale with a tendency to have more in the a service and tertiaryfields.I have had it thrown back at me for saying, as I did on one occasion, that one man's increase in wages may be another man's job. Nevertheless increases in wages are going on in some areas. The fact that the wage is as it is, at the margin, and may preclude an additional one or two people being taken on is not the answer to the 400 000-odd people in Australia who are out of work. TriI think we delude ourselves by using easy sorts of slogans, just as I think the views of honourable be members on this side are rather exaggerated at the moment in thinking that there will be some to immediate impact on prices in Australia because we of the devaluation. If one looks at what is imported into Australia one finds that producers' materials are 40 per cent of total imports and that capital equipment is 29 per cent of total imports. About II lOths of what is imported into Australia is the potential for new investment in industry in Australia. That is where the hurt will be as a result of devaluation. After all, the Government was claiming that it wanted to stimulate investment. Insofar as investment means new capital equipment, a fair part of which unfortunately still has to be imported, it certainly will be dearer in future by something like Wh per cent to 20 per cent, and therefore not so likely to be attractive. This is independent of any action of any body such as the Industries Assistance Commission, the Trade Practices Commission or the Prices Justification Tribunal. I think it istimethat the economy of Australia was looked at as a whole. I suppose the majority of people, fortunate or doomed, in the next 30 years will be employees in either the private or the pubhc spheres. They will be wage earners. On the other hand I still believe that the greatest stimulus to expanding economic activity in Australia is a rise in real consumer income. The Government is caught between those two. Wages are a cost but there is also the customer be considered. A government has to tread the Unions very narrow path that leads between right wrong or between bad and good economic comPort mon sense.",66
161,Mr HOWARD,PRICES JUSTIFICATION AMENDMENT,"in reply- I thank those honourable members who contributed to the debate. I remind the honourwith able member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) and the House that the purpose of not to destroy the Prices Justification Tribunal. Certainly the purpose of the legislation is to alter the role of the PJT and, in the view of the repeat Government, to improve its role. The Governrole ment, quite understandably, has a different conits ception from the Opposition of the role of a body such as this. We believe that there is considerable merit in having a body which can respond to the areas in which there is evidence of price abuse. The effect of the amendments to the PJT legisapproval lation will enable a greater share of the resources of the Tribunal to concentrate on those areas price abuse. So I think it ought to be made quite clear that this is no furtive attempt to destroy PJT. It is an open system of amendments to the legislation which will certainly bring about changed role. The Government believes that role of the Tribunal should change. It hopes that the amendments will give effect to the view held by the Government. The honourable member for Port Adelaide talked a great deal about the social contract, as he caUed it. I believe that the remarks of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) were quite relevant to the parallel that the honourable member for Port Adelaide drew between the procedures of the Prices Justification Tribunal and the procedures of the Australian ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission. Nevertheless, the Government has acknowledged, and acknowledges again, that in reviewing the pre-election undertaking it made about the Prices Justification Tribunal it had very much in mind the industrial relations context. In the Ught of that, for the honourable member for Port Adelaide to say that we are being provocative in regard to industrial relations by changing the role of the PJT, when we had committed ourselves prior to the election to its abolition and then in the Ught of industrial relations considerations we reviewed that undertaking, is, I think, being totally unreasonable. We consulted the trade union movement. It was consulted extensively about the future operations of the Prices Justification Tribunal. Those consultations occurred both at a Minister to to President of the Australian Council of Trade level and at a research officer-officials of and the ACTU level. The honourable member for Adelaide upbraids the Government because the legislation represents the decision of the Government. Surely the honourable member is suggesting other than that governments are elected to make decisions. Having discharged any commitments made regarding consultation relevant sectors of the community, a government ought to be quite free to make its this legislation is decisions. In commending the legislation to the House, I that its object is to alter significantly the of the Prices Justification Tribunal, to reduce price-approving role and to enhance its pricesurveUlance role. I think the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) acknowledged enormous difficulties of a federal tribunal of this nature undertaking a comprehensive pricerole. This is one of the considerations that the Government had in mind. It is one of the of reasons why it is the Government's wish- a wish expressed through this legislation-that the the Prices Justification Tribunal concentrate more of its resources and its activities on investigating a areas in which there is evidence of price abuse the rather than on encumbering an increasingly large number of Australian enterprises with the admittedly cosdy procedure of complying with the detailed notification procedures. There is a cost in that. It has been passed on to the consumer. It is a cost which business has to bear. WeEllicott, beheve that the combined effect of these alterFife, W.C ations will be to produce a more satisfactory Fisher, P.

Throughout the remarks of the honourable Howard. member for Port Adelaide there is still the preHyde, J.M. sumption that the greater the size of an organisJulLD.F. ation the greater is the malice of its operations. The assumption is simply made that there are areas of price abuse only where there are large Armitage, J.L. NOES companies and that it is the large companies of Beazley, K.E.

There are Innes, U.E just as many price abuses at the lower end of the Johnson, scale as there are at the higher end of the scale so far as business operations are concerned.

162,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"The Op66 position wishes to raise some questions about not 26 only the clauses which the Government will seek to amend but also other provisions in the Bill. Be40 fore dealing with those matters, I turn to clause 5 which provides for the escalation of the ceiling from $20m to $30m. The Opposition has no Kelly, CR. King,R.S. objection to this proposal. We see this as aLloyd, B. Lusher, S. A.",71
163,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"Order ! I ask the honourable member to resume his seat for a moment. It is difiicult to MCLeay, J . E MCMahon, William hear what the honourable member is saying. There is too much audible conversation in the chamber.",71
164,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS,He cannot hold his audience.,71
165,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"Someon e made the accusation Newman, K. E. O'Keefe, FL . that I could not hold my audience. I notice how the Liberal Party is holding its audience in recent times. If that incident had occurred with the tralian Labor Party, it would have been headquestion lines in every newspaper in Australia. The erals are so fortunate. The Opposition has no objection to the lifting of the ceiling from $20m to $30m, as clause 5 provides. This provision will cater for many the companies which were mentioned by my friend the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns). The honourable member seemed to think that it was unique or ironic that a mem-sting ber from an Adelaide electorate should question the role of the motor car industry in Australia. Later in his speech, he seemed to take some exception to a provision inserted ment that the Tribunal should take into account A the profitabUity of the motor car industry and its a prescribed abUity to employ people. Let me say this for the benefit of the honouror able member for LUley: Most of the people whom I represent are consumers. That is the posIt ition not only with me but also with every otherabout honourable member who comes from South Australia. Those people need to be protected. Again, for his benefit, I make the point that I have already made, that lifting the prices of imported vehicles-this will occur as a result the devaluation this week-wil l give the tralian motor vehicle industry a greater opporsidiaries tunity to Uft the prices of its vehicles to that range. He may say that will not occur because Prices Justification Tribunal will rope it in as it over the $30m mark. But the honourable memcompanies ber would then agree that perhaps the motor cartion industry can exempt itself because it is so highly competitive. I would have thought that one of the first bodies to greet the Tribunal after the passing this Bill would be the vehicle manufacturing industry which would be able to say: 'Look, we are in a highly competitive industry'. In fact could prove that it is in the most competitive automobile industry anywhere in the world. Noing where in the world do so many motor vehicle manufacturers and potential motor vehicle manufacturers have so few consumers. Nowhere in the world would the automobile industry considiaries; sider having 5 manufacturers for 600 000 units. So I suspect that under the Government's proIndustries, visions the motor car industry will be exempt from the surveUlance, as we now caU it, of the Prices Justification Tribunal. That being the my charge still stands: The way is made easier for such companies to lift the prices of their uct to the prices of the imported product. AusIt seems to me rather ludicrous to raise the that if one comes from a certain State Libone should not say anything about an industry operating in that State. I do not know whether the honourable member for LUley has much interest in sand mining on Fraser Island, in bananas, in pineapples or in coal or whether he is of to remain dumb on any questions concerning Queensland. Obviously we should be speaking out. The Opposition has no objection to the Ufting of the amount from $20m to $30m. But the of clause 5 is in the taU. I ask the Minister to explain to the Committee how we are to avoid the breakup of major companies into subsidiaries. Proposed new sub-section (lA) of secby the Governtion S states: company that is a subsidiary of another company is not company for the purposes of this Act if the sum of the amounts received by the first-mentionedcompany during the period of 12 months that ended on the immediately preceding 30 June as payments for the supply of goods, the supply of services, or both, did not exceed $5,000,000. seems to me that the Government is not sincere what it is proposing. We on this side of the chamber do not believe that what the Government says and the way in which it expresses its intentions will really bring about the fact as far as the Prices Justification Tribunal is concerned. I of would like to read to the Minister a sample of Auscompanies, together with the number of subof those companies, taken from the Key Business Directory. I want the Minister to tell the theCommittee what action the Government or the isPrices Justification Tribunal can take to see that such as the ones I am about to mendo not break up into penny packet organisations so as to completely avoid the criteria set down for the operations of the Prices Justification Tribunal. Let me just list some of the companies and the number of their subsidiaries. of Without checking, I believe that each of these companies together with its respective subsidiaries would have an annual turnover of more it than $2Sm or $30m. Let me give a breakdown of the companies. Allied Manufacturing and TradIndustries, 67 subsidiaries; Associated Pulp and Paper Mills, 23 subsidiaries; Australian ConsoUdated Industries, 35 subsidiaries; Boral, 80 subsidiaries; Brambles Industries, 65 subBurns Philp, 76 subsidiaries; Carlton United Breweries, 84 subsidiaries; Concrete 52 subsidiaries; ConsoUdated Foods, 44 subsidiaries; ConsoUdated Press, 20 subsidiaries; John Fairfax, 29 subsidiaries; Hoffring, case, 62 subsidiaries; Metal Manufacturers, 46 subsidiaries; Pioneer Concrete, no less than 165 subprod-sidiaries; Ready Mixed Concrete, 35 subsidiaries; Repco, 70 subsidiaries; and George Weston Foods, 64 subsidiaries. It seems to Opposition that if a subsidiary is operating totally unrelated area-and I ask the Minister listen to this",71
166,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS,I am listening.,73
167,Mr YOUNC,PAIRS,"I know that the Minister is interested in what the honourable member for Lilley has to say. But I ask him to listen to what am saying and to tell us how he will avoid the proposition I am putting to him. If the subsidiary is operating in a completely parent company, is the subsidiary roped allowed out of the net, or is it the intention Government to exempt only those subsidiary companies operating on a turnover of less than $5m in a totally unrelated area to the parent company? If the Government is to say that any subsidiary with a turnover of less than $5m is exempt we would like to know how the Governthat ment will stop the breakup of some of these major companies to avoid the criteria of the Prices Justification Tribunal and thus to frustrate its operations?",73
168,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS," I would be very happy to answer that query. This clause which deals with subsidiaries was put in quite deliberately to cover the situation where the parent company of a group of companies is obliged by reason of its turnover to notify price increases. It is reasonable that small subsidiaries in that group be relieved of the like obligation. the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr pose Young) reads the earlier parts of the legislation, not the amending Bill but the principal Act, will find denned what constitutes a subsidiary company. A subsidiary company for the purcosts poses of this operation is a related company to parent company as denned in the a prescribed company because the parent company is a prescribed company, being over the (5.25)-Tha turnover bench mark. Obviously the effect of this amendment will to exclude the subsidiary companies of which honourable member has spoken. There is no proside viso about these companies operating in a separnation ate area. The test of relationship is the test already embodied in the Act. No further destates: finition of relationship is introduced so far as the Clause amending Bill is concerned. If one goes to clause increases 4 of the amending Bill one finds for the purpose of the legislation what constitutes a holding pany and a subsidiary company and the circumYoung) stances in which a company is to be regarded as subsidiary company. It is quite clear from what the answer to the honourable gentleman's the question is. If one goes to the final part of in a clause 5, which deals with the $5m proviso, one to can see the scheme of the legislation.",73
169,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,The point we are raising is in respect of further fragmentation.,73
170,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS,"I will come to that if the honourable gendeman will be patient for a moI ment. My information is that the effect of this amendment will be to take out of the notification procedures of the Act about 1000 subsidiary related area to the companies. in or is it Mr YOUNG - At the moment. of the Mr HOWARD-Yes, at the moment. The honourable member for Port Adelaide says that large companies will further subdivide themselves into subsidiaries to take advantage of the fact that the subsidiaries will not be required to comply with the notification procedures. It is true this could occur in some cases. It is equally true, though, that it is not a completely costless exercise to embark upon a corporate restructure. If one has a holding company that has large capital assets and it transfers those capital assets to companies it pays almost confiscatory rates of stamp duty and so forth. It is just not always an attractive economic exercise to do this. Whilst I can see that in some cases companies will take advantage of this procedure, I just do not accept that the great majority of the large enterprises will go to the bother and expense and be subject to all the managerial problems inIf volved in corporate restructuring just for the purof avoiding the notification procedures. I do not deny that it could occur in some cases. That is he acknowledged. We go into that with our eyes open. I just do not believe, having in mind the and so forth which will be involved in that a sort of corporate restructuring, that it will occur Act. It becomes in very many cases.",73
171,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,PAIRS,"Grayndler) t is a most unsatisfactory explanation. The Minister for Business and Consumer be Affairs (Mr Howard) for more than half his time the set up a proposition with which no one on this was disagreeing. We all accept the explaof the provision which is found in the explanatory notes which were circulated. That 5 . . . Releases from the obligation to notify price those subsidiaries of prescribed companies which have annual turnovers not exceeding $5m. comThe honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr put to the Minister and to the Committee athat this will lead to the fragmentation of existing that groups of companies in order to avoid the notification procedures. If the Minister is not aware of ways in which companies can avoid (b) paying duty on the disposition of assets, I will be pleased to tell bim. But I suspect that he is aware and that the honourable members behind him (c) lowing are aware. There will be a considerable opportunity for existing groups of companies to set up new subsidiaries, to incorporate existing divisions and this kind of thing. In relation to the point that there is a carrying ganising different groups of companies, the Minister will remember back to the days when companies used to organise so many different subsidiaries so that they were below the threshold for payroll tax. That is a very common thing for business to do in this country. If the Government sets up a procedure, mark my words business will use the device the Government is laying open to (D(c)it. The Minister has not given any explanation as to why the subsidiaries are to be exempt from the notification procedures of this legislation. Clauses agreed to. Clause 7.

173,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS," I direct wonder whether the Opposition will allow the of the TriMinister to move 4 amendments together.

There being no a memobjection, I will allow that course to be followed. and, in that case, unless the Act to a mem Mr HOWARD (Bennelong-Minister for the exerBusiness and Consumer Affairs) (5.27)- I move: that Before proposed sub-section (8C), insert the following including a reference to sub-sections: "" *(8BA) For the purposes of this section(a) 'market'meansamarketinAustraka;and (b) 'market', in relation to any goods or services, includes a market for other goods or services that are substitutable for, or otherwise competitive with, the first-mentioned goods or services.

The purpose of the amendments dealing with the definition of'market' are to give greater clarity to the word 'market' as used in the clause. I think those 2 amendments are self-explanatory. The other amendments relate to the question of exemptions. The Government has decided to provide in the legislation that a company having obtained an exemption from the notification procedures of the Act is not required to comply with conditions attaching to that exemption. The legislation is being amended to expressly provide that when an exemption is granted by the Tribunal, if the exemption was in force immediately before the commencement of sub-clause (2) (c), and was subject to a condition, that condition will be of no effect. I stress that the question of whether an exemption is to be granted is a matter for the Tribunal to decide in the Ught of a number of considerations. Some of those considerations have been spelled out in the legislation but others have deliberately not been speUed out in the legislation. I think aU honourable gentlemen will realise that when we get into areas such as trying to define what is competition, what is extensive competition and what is a monopoly position, that while the legislature can give some guidance it is extremely difficult to put in a complete shopping Ust which defines aU the circumstances which will point one in a particular direction. What the Government is trying to do with new clause 16 in the Bill is to indicate some of the areas to which it beUeves the Tribunal firstly, direct its mind and, secondly, having decided that a certain situation exists as a result of that decision, to treat those areas as being important relevant matters. As I said in my second reading second, speech and I think, as I said in the statement ing which I attempted to make to the House some 2 months ago, the Government believes that where an exemption is granted the company categories which obtained the exemption should be entitled to the benefits of that exemption. The Governdard ment does not believe that exemptions which granted and which have attached to them very considerable reporting conditions quite meet objective of the exemption procedure. exemption procedure is designed to ensure that if, for a combination of reasons, the Tribunal Ueves that a company should be exempt from the notification procedures-in other words, excused from complying with the notification dition. procedures-the n the company should be enwhen titled to the full benefit of that decision of the bunal and not be in a situation where, on the one hand, a decision is made that circumstances tify the exemption being granted and the other hand,findthat some of the conditions attaching to the exemption go considerably along the way to restoring what might be the position if the exemption had not been granted in thefirstplace. That is the rationale behind the amendment. We believe that the amendments give effect to that point of view. They are consistent with what has been said publicly over the past 2 or 3 months about our proposal regarding the Prices Justification Tribunal. They are consistent with a situation where, more and more, the Tribunal will be in a situation to concentrate on investigating areas of price abuse. I think the amendments will clarify both in the minds of the Tribunal and of companies which must deal with the Tribunal what view the Government takes as to the nature of exemptions and what should be the consequences of those exemptions being granted.",74
174,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,PAIRS,"Clause 16 is a most outrageous provision introduced by the Government. This provision will, in effect, destroy the Tribunal. Honourable members ought to be in no doubt about the central importance of the exemption powers in the workings of the Tribunal. Section 18 of the Act, which deals with notification of proposed price increases, is the central provision of the Prices Justification Act. The exemption power is absolutely vital to the administration of that provision. I read very briefly what the Tribunal had to say about this power in its annual report for the year should, ending 30 June this year. It stated: . . . the exemption power contained in the Prices Justification Act complements the notification power in 2 very ways;firstby providing an optional power and by providing the Tribunal with the means of exercisa discretion based on the circumstances and nature of individual cases. The Tribunal has used that power to develop 12 of cases in which it grants exemption. The conditions of the exemption are largely stanin those categories. The Tribunal comments are that the development of those categories has been of enormous practical value both from the the Tribunal's and the companies' points of view. The What the Government is proposing now, especially in the amendment just moved by the beMinister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard), is that the grant of an exemption by the Tribunal cannot be made subject to any conI want to show how important it is that granting an exemption the Tribunal ought Trito be able to impose conditions. The bonafidesot the Minister, quite frankly, in this exercise is jusopen to grave doubt. When he introduced the then, on Bill on 11 November he stated: The Government expects that in most cases exemptions will not be subject to reporting conditions. He concluded: The thrust of these changes is to ensure that exemptions are of real benefit to companies and that they do not have associated with them the onerous reporting conditions attaching to the notification procedures. Since 11 November he has talked to someone else and someone else has convinced him that no conditions ought to attach to exemptions at all. He gave us no good reason why. He mentioned earUer by way of interjection that he was not in favour of the retaU industry being subject even to the notification provisions of section 18. If one looks at that very difficult question of the retaU industry one will see that it is precisely in that business that the Tribunal has developed exemption procedures that seem to work quite well. At page 43 of its annual report the Tribunal says: . . . the new exemptionsThat is, in relation to the retaU industryprovide a better surveillance there is little requirement piled by the companies in the course of their business operations. Just how is it proposed that the Tribunal or in fact the Government is going to have any knowledge of what is going on in these industries unless the people who get the exemptions are subject to conditions on the way in which they conduct their businesses and unless they have to provide the Tribunal with a continuing body of information so that it remains expert in price surveillance? The Tribunal pointed up at page 45 of its report how very important is the information that comes to it as a result of the conditions imposed under exemption authorisations. Talking about inquiries pursuant to section 16 of the Act it said: The initiative for these investigations came through advices received from the major retailers as a condition of retail exemption orders, from information about higher costs supplied by prescribed companies in support of notices of higher prices, and from information provided by members of the public. Of the 3 ways in which the Tribunal gathers information which leads to a section 16 inquiry situation, the most important is the continuing reporting of conditions imposed under the exemption authorisations. Yet the Minister proposes to do away with those conditions. Not only does he propose to do away with those conditions prospectively but he proposes also to do away with them in relation to exemptions already granted. Of course, that is completely outrageous, because the kinds of matters in this new legislation to which the Tribunal is to direct its attention in granting authorisations were not statutory requirements at the time those previous exemptions were granted. It means in effect that where the Tribunal has granted exemption on one set of circumstances, and the Tribunal has said it will grant the exemption subject to certain conditions, the Minister is now saying that the exemption will stay in place; the conditions will not apply. Of course I can anticipate what the Minister will say, and that is that it is perfectly possible for the Tribunal at any time to revoke its authorisation of the exemption. He ought to be aware that to do that in every one of these cases where there is an existing exemption which imposes conditions would throw the whole system into chaos. The orderly development of price surveUlance, if that is what the Government wants, depends upon reliable information being provided to the Tribunal on a continuing basis. The way in which that is done under exemption, where an exempof the retailer's operations yet tion is granted, is to impose conditions. The for informadon not normally comalternative is to revoke those exemptions and to insist in every case that there be a notification of the proposed price increase. How otherwise can the Tribunal develop any information? If one looks at the new provisions which the Government has inserted in relation to the exemption power one wiU see that in the proposed new subsection 8A which the Minister talks about as producing the integration of the provisions of the Prices Justification Act with those of the Trade Practices Act. He says in his second reading speech: In respect of the first of these elements the Bill in effect copies the monopoly provision of the trade practices legislation. This will promote a greater consistency of approach between the deliberations of the Tribunal and the Trade Practices Commission regarding the nature and structure of markets. What absolute rubbish. Anybody famUiar with the provisions of the Trade Practices Act would know that whether one is a monopolist or not is only one of the considerations that affect the many provisions of that Act which relate to competitive behaviour. The key question at which the Government ought to be looking is whether in fact there is price competition. That would be a relevant consideration for the granting of an exemption. But the fact that a company is or is not a monopolist is a complete red herring. The provisions of the Trade Practices Act relating to restraint of trade which govern price fixing, to exclusive dealing, to resale price maintenance and all these objectionable practices affecting competition and which affect cartels are directed to competition. It is not central to the question whether the company or groups of companies involved are monopolies. So it is a complete red herring, and to suggest in any event that this will lead to a greater integration of the work of the Tribunal and the Trade Practices Commission is nonsense. The Tribunal is under staffed at the moment, as the Minister ought to know. The Tribunal has no expertise of the kind that the Trade Practices Commission has in relation to markets and the competitive effects of different companies' activities in those markets. This provision is designed to give a wink and a nod to the Tribunal that if it can determine that a company is not a monopolist then it ought to be given the benefit of the doubt and it ought to be granted an exemption. That is clearly just not good enough. The exemption power contained in the provisions dealing with the notification of proposed price increases is absolutely central. By weakening it in this fashion the Government is ensuring that the Tribunal will not have access to the continuing knowledge and information which it needs about markets, about price movements in particular industries and in particular companies. One only has to look at the kind of information in the annual report for last year to see that it will not be available another time. I want to say one other thing in relation to this legislation. The Minister talks about monitoring activity. How on earth is he to monitor activity when the Tribunal does not have this information? In his statement tabled on 16 September the Minister talked about a greater use of section 16. The Government has been in power for about a year and yet we have seen no use of section 16 and I do not expect that we ever shall. In any event how will the Government ever know what the activity is in any particular industry area unless it gets the information, which will be denied to it as a result of the provisions which it is introducing into this chamber tonight?",75
175,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS," I would like to reply to a couple of the more extravagant remarks made by the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) in his usual robust style. On the question of section 16 applications the honourable member for Grayndler upbraids the Government for not having utilised section 16 at all in thetimeit has been in office. It so happens that a proposed exercise of the section 16 power of the initiative of the Government occurred contemporaneously with a decision of the Tribunal at its own initiative to carry out an inquiry under section 16. The whole point of these amendments is to free the resources of the Tribunal which are now devoted to the notification procedures. As a consequence it will be possible for the Tribunal to play a much greater role in the area of section 16 inquiries, particularly inquiries which are in response to complaints expressed by consumers about price abuse. The honourable member for Grayndler should realise that there exists in Australia now a considerable number of bodies which receive complaints and information from consumers about pricing practices. As a result of contact which is operating very well between the Trade Practices Commission, my own Department and the various consumer affairs bureaux of the States we are steadily getting into a better position to have an Australia-wide appreciation of the incidence of consumer complaints regarding pricing behaviour. As a consequence of this it will be possible for the Government to identify areas where there is pubhc concern about the level of prices which are charged. I call to mind the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean). Even if one has the same philosophical view about pricing as was expressed by the Opposition during this debate, having a federal body such as the Prices Justification Tribunal endeavouring to sift through large numbers of price notifications is a considerable difficulty and it will continue to be a growing difficulty. What the Government is really saying is this: Free the Prices Justification Tribunal from many of the responsibUities and constraints involved in the notification procedure, give it the opportunity to be more active in responding to areas where there is consumer concern about price abuse. The Government beUeves it can play a far more useful role. The Opposition has commented during this debate about staffing levels in the Prices Justification Tribunal and about the salary situation there. I assure the House again that the Tribunal has been treated no differently by the Government, with respect to the Government's expenditure restraints and staff ceding restraints, than any other body. There has been no attempt by the Government to single out the Tribunal for discriminatory treatment. Of course the future of the Tribunal was in doubt for a period of time. We make no secret of that. It was in doubt because the Government was in the process of consulting interested parties, including the trade union movement and sections of the business community, regarding the future of the Tribunal. It was only natural that there would be doubt during that period of time. The Government understood fully the difficulties under which the Tribunal laboured during that period. Let us not beat about the bush. The Government gave a pre-election undertaking that the Tribunal would be abolished. Then, for the reasons I have explained, that undertaking was revised and the Government undertook to look at the body again. It was only natural that there would be a the period of doubt, a period during which the future usually of the Tribunal would be in the grey area, but that doubt has now been removed. The role of the Tribunal will be significantly changed by this legislation. The honourable member for Grayndler complains about our approfit proach to the exemption procedures. The fact of out the matter is that, as a result of fluctuations company's profitability, it can go quite trarily in and out of the notification procedures. Under the proposed amendment if a company well. has a turnover of $31 m and thisfigurethen falls to afigurebelow $30m, it goes out of the ment's notification procedures. The information that Tribunal gathers, as a consequence of that, also lost to the Tribunal. What the Government is putting is that if the Tribunal, while exercising its judgment and discretion, believes for a bination of reasons, including, not only that monopoly position exists, but aS sorts of other factors, that a be exempted from the notification procedures, that company ought to be entitled to the same benefits of that exemption as is a company which may be below the turnover limit. I put it to the Opposition that the approach of the honourable ticularly member for Grayndler is that we should have an exemption situation which says, on 'Yes, you have satisfied certain criteria. For a (a) lowing combination of reasons you should not be required to notify. On the other hand, we are going to attach reporting requirements as a condition of your receiving that exemption'. In many cases these requirements could be almost as onerous as the notification procedures themselves. The fact of the matter is that, in substantial areas where exemptions have been granted, the notification procedures have been quite onerous.I The purpose of this further amendment is to make it perfecdy clear that in the view of the Government if a company is entitled, according to the assessment of the Tribunal, to the benefit Tribunal of an exemption, this should be a real benefit and inquiries into a benefit which the company is entitled to enjoy private. This is to the fullest.",77
176,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,PAIRS," I want very briefly to call in aid of another person to the effect that the exempthe tions, with conditions, are an important part of the operations of the Prices Justification Tribunal consideroccur in Australia. In today's edition of the Australian Financial Review, Mr Russell Scott writes: It has developed a system of granting conditional tions, particularly for retailers. This frees a retailer from the impossible task of notifying PJT of every price variation of every product on sale, but involves the duty to lodge regular accounts and financial information showing profit figures. In other words, although the retailer is able to increase rices without telling the PJT, the PJT receives regular (e.g. alf-yearly)I think it is more often quarterlyand trading information which would allow it to carry an inquiry if it wished, or to revoke the exemption. in a Mr Scott singles out retaUers. The Minister for arbiBusiness and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) will know that this appUes to other industries as I think that when Mr Scott wrote that article he took the optimistic view about the Governalterations to the legislation. He had in the mind only the legislation introduced on 11 is November. If he had been aware of proposed new sub-section 18 (8BB) or of the effect ofparagraph 2 (c) of clause 16 of this measure, he comwould have thought that the effect would be to a destroy effectively prices justification in also that there are Australia. company should Amendments agreed to.

177,Mr ARMITAGE,PAIRS,"I am parconcerned about clause 17 which the one hand: amends the Principal Act: by omitting sub-section (1) and substituting the folsub-sections:""(1) Subject to sub-section (1A), an inquiry conducted by the Tribunal shall be held in pubhc. ""(IA) If every party to an inquiry to be conducted by the Tribunal (other than a person or body of persons that became a party to the inquiry by virtue of section 20) gives notice in writing to the Tnbunal, before the commencement of the inquiry, stating that that party does not wish the inquiry to be held in public, the Tribunal may, if it thinks fit, hold the inquiry in private. think this sets a very dangerous precedent because it means that there will be a very distinct tendency-it was not there before-for more and more companies and people who go before the to endeavour to ensure that the their pricing practices are held in one of the fundamental issues arising from this Bill. Mr Antony Whitlam-This is a new notion. the views Mr ARMITAGE-That isright.I agree with honourable member. For example, let us as devaluation and therip-offsthat will a result of that decision.",78

179,Mr ARMITAGE,PAIRS,The honourable member is apparently not concerned about the fact that members of the pubhc can be taken down. not concerned in any respect whatsoever tect the general public.

180,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order ! The honourable member might dodge the dogfight if he addresses the Chair.,79
181,Mr ARMITAGE,PAIRS,"Yes, but some honourable members opposite are so provocative one just has to reply. As I was pointing out, there will considerable rip-offs following devaluation. This means that there is an even greater need than ever for pricefixingmachinery. The Minister, in his second reading speech, admits quite deright finitely that this amending legislation means price surveillance instead of price approval. not necessary to have huge machinery for price surveillance. It is comparatively simple to underreceived take surveillance of price movements. Surveilunion lance means the monitoring of movements in prices. It is different altogether from price proval. Of course, anybody can go in for price surveillance. I submit veryfirmlythat the teeth have been taken out of this whole Act. Mr Antony Whitlam-Tal k about the fees of the directors of Patricks, the stevedores.",79
182,Mr ARMITAGE,PAIRS,"That was a public inquiry. The facts behind the case which the honourable member for Grayndler mentions would never have been known to the public if it had not been for the public inquiry provisions of the Act has so far stood. The facts are that parties not subject to an inquiry should be able to ensure that they canfindout what practices are being used. One must ask the Government and the tion, Minister the reason for suddenly agreeing to secrecy. I think the Minister should explain why such secrecy suddenly has been introduced. I wish also to make the point that the legislation has acted as a deterrent to price increases because of the fear of unfair and nefarious ing practices being revealed in a public inquiry. That has been one of the most effective activities of the Tribunal in the past. It has meant that improper acts would be revealed to the pubhc large and that in due course the public would take it out on the company concerned. That has been most useful. It is to be regretted very greatly that the Government is now bowing to pressure from those organisations which perpetrated nefarious pricing practices to now vary the Act to it easier for those organisations to obtain a secret inquiry. Mr Antony Whitlam-He did not mention it in He is second reading speech either. the to pro Mr ARMITAGE-No , the Minister did not. a matter of fact I went right through the secthose ond reading speech to try tofindsome reference to it. The honourable member for Grayndler is have sat here this afternoon going right through the second reading speech to try to find a reference to this part of the Act. It is not there. We can go on through these points, but I still make the point which I made in the first place. The Government gave certain undertakbe ings to the trade union movement. I know that before the election it gave an undertaking that it would abolish the Tribunal. The Government is virtually abolishing it now. It is taking the teeth out of it. Subsequent to giving that undertaking there were understandings with the trade It is union movement. Honourable members opposite should not kid themselves. They have fairly good co-operation from the trade movement up to date. They are now deliberately confronting the trade union moveapment. Up to this point of time they have received good co-operation. One reason for that cooperation was the understanding that the Tribunal would be retained. They are now going through the back door and virtually abokshing it. They are destroying its effectiveness. They are taking the teeth out of the whole organisation.",79
183,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS,"Le t me just tell the honourable member for Chifley (Mr as it Armitage) 2 things on the question of public inquiries. Firsdy, it is purely at the discretion of the Prices Justification Tribunal whether an inquiry shall be held in public. There is no questhe discretion is in the hands of the Trithe bunal. It can only consider not holding an inquiry in public if all the parties involved make such a request. It is still ultimatelyMr Armitage-Why have you introduced it? pric Mr HOWARD-Because at some inquiries the parties, even though they have opposing interests, may wish to have the inquiry held in private. It is very unlikely that many inquiries at would fall into that category.

187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LONG SERVICE LEAVE,"Is it intended the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the 3 BUls? There being no objection, will aUow that course to be followed. to be Mr WILLIS (Gellibrand) (8.1)-Two of the BUls now before the House provide improvements to long service leave benefits, or furlough as it is otherwise known, for Australian Governy ment employees. The other Bill relates to the quite different matter of establishing a separate Third Reading PubUc Service for the Northern Territory. The Opposition does not oppose any of these BUls. Firsdy, I should Uke to refer to the long service leave BUls. The Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Bill 1976 provides for a number of improvements in long service leave benefits all of which were proposed in a Bill last year by the Labor Government. That Bill was mtroduced into the House in May last year. It MP was not proceeded with before Labor's untimely I removal from office. There is, however, one difference between Labor's Bill and Bill now before the House which I will explain later. It is appropriate at thistimeto note the need to improve the long service leave entitlement of Australian Government employees in recent years has been a matter of agreement on both sides of the House to some extent, although not in every respect. Before Labor came into office in 1972, the MCMahon Government proposed a number of improvements to the furlough provisions, although thetimingof it made it suspiciously look like an election gimmick. On 26 October 1976. 1972-onl y a week before the issuing of the writs for the Federal election that year, the then Prime Minister, Mr MCMahon, issued a Press release 1976 which, in part, read: Second Reading The PubUc Service Board has reviewed (long service provisions for Commonwealth officers and employees, having regard to various representations, including those from staff associations. The Government has approved the Board's recommendations for a number of legislative amendments. These include: Reduction of the basic quatifyperiod from IS to 10 years; provision for furlough to be a right; payment to the estate of a deceased officer or where there are no dependants; extension of furto part-time employees; recognition for furlough purof prior services to local governing bodies. Of course, no legislation to implement these conditions was passed in the following week before issuing of the writs so, it then rested with the Labor Government to implement such each improvements. Labor's policy called for improvements in long service leave for Austhe tralian Government employees. In pursuance of this that policy the then Prime Minister, Mr Whidam, announced in April 1973 that the Government to legislate for a considerable number of improvements which included all those I proposed by Mr MCMahon but added a number of others. The new items which were included in Mr Whidam's Press release of 3 April 1973 were: Removal of all provisions which provide a furlough alty to an officer or employee because of conduct record dismissal . . . and new accrual rate of 3 months first 10 years and one-half month per year thereafter. Removal of the provision for payment in lieu of on resignation due to domestic or other pressing necessity. Payment in lieu offuriough based on completed respect of a partly completed year of service. Removal of the 12 months limitation on the period lough which may be granted at any one time . . . Recognition of leave without employees under Section 71 (1) (a) of the Public to accept employment as staff association officers ing service for furlough purposes with the Commonwealth being liable only for Commonwealth service proper. In his Press release, he also stated: All improvements to be available to officers and employees who were in Commonwealth employment on after 1 January 1973. This was a much more comprehensive list of protion; posals than that which had been announced by Mr MCMahon. Following this statement of intent, legislation eventually was introduced the end of 1973 to implement some of these pro-Industrial visions. The benefits were passed by Parliament-withou t debate, I might add-at that time.They were,firsdy,a reduction of the quaUfying period from 15 years to 10 years; ondly, removal of long service leave penalties associated with unsatisfactory service or misconfurlough duct; thirdly, elimination of provision for ment in lieu of furlough on resignation due domestic or other pressing necessity. In December 1974 Cabinet approved legisQueensland. lation to introduce the various other amendHansard ments foreshadowed in the April 1973 statement of intent but with a few revisions. The original proposal to allow payment in Ueu of furlough after 5 years service on cessation was discarded and a few new provisions were added. These were the revision of the definition of 'authority of State' to reduce the need specify bodies in regulations which NA AUSTRALIAN AND STATE PUBLIC SERVICES-PERMANEN Years of A.P.S. service Current 5 6 7 -8 . .-. . . 9 10 , . 3.0 11 3.3 12 3.6 13 3.9 machinery matter; provision that no leave without pay breaks continuity of service and the penemploying authority, or the Board, may deteror mine whether leave counts as service; no form of for the full time post-defence forces service vocational training scheme breaks continuity of service; abfurlough sence due to Ul health from any relevant service for furlough purposes does not break continuity; months in and exclusion from the legislation of locally engaged staff overseas, other than those of furemployed before the amending legislation. pay granted to oflicers or It was also stated again that these Service Act improvements would apply from 1 January as qualify1973. In May 1975 a Bill to implement these substantial proposals was introduced into the House. As I have already indicated, the Bill had not been passed before the Opposition blocked supply and eventually seized office. The long service or leave Bill now before the House incorporates all of the provisions of the 1975 Bill with one excepthat is the increase in the accrual rate for long service leave entitlement after 10 years service from one-third of a month to one-half a at month a year. The Minister for Employment and Relations (Mr Street) says that such the an improvement would have set an unduly generous standard which could lead to pressure on other employers to match it. In fact, however, sec-the standard for Commonwealth Government employees at present is one of the lower levels of entitlement for Government employees payin this country. Three States provide a higher to rate of accumulation of long service leave entitlement than the Commonwealth.

Turning to the PubUc Service Amendment Bill 2), as I mentioned earlier this Bill is part of the process of estabUsbing a separate Public Service in the Northern Territory. The Bill provides for the transfer of Australian pubUc servants to the new Northern Territory PubUc Service which comwUl be estabUshed by the Northern Territory already Service Ordinance. That ordinance is before the Northern Territory Legislatbut it Opposition does not oppose does have a couple of reserreservations principaUy who will be transferred out of the Commonwealth Public Service the Northern Territory PubUc Service. I understand it is proposed initiaUy to transfer 260 officers out of the Australian PubUc Service the Northern Territory service with effect from January 1977. Eventually more than 6000 wealth officers will be transferred. In transferring to Northern Territory PubUc Service these pubUc servants will be entering a very different service from the Australian PubUc Service. The Territory service being much smaller obviously it will offer anything Uke the diversity of job opportunibasis ties that are avaUable to members of the Ausgoing traUan PubUc Service. This could pose real prob-make lems for recruitment in the future able people who may have been prepared to serve in the Department of the Northern Territhe tory for some years but did not wish to spend their whole careers there could now be reluctant to join such a Umited service. On the other handPubUc others who see rapid promotional opportunities in the new pubUc service may be very enthusibeing astic about the new arrangements but they are likely to be the more senior officers. The possito biUty of recruitment problems in the future, ticularly of the most capable people, is one which the Minister for the Northern Territory (Mr Adermann) may wish to give some new consideration. The major problem, as we see it, is the haste with which the Government is rushing into this action of establishing the Northern Territory PubUc Service. Here we are at the beginning December with less than a month to go before the new service comes into operation and still, I am informed, no notices of transfer have issued by the Minister. Admittedly, until this is passed, he does not have power to transfer officers to the new service but in practice that does not stop him issuing notices pending passing of this Bill by the Parliament. Staff who receive notice soon, and surely it must be within the next week or so, wiU be faced with having decide in just 3 weeks approximately whether they wish to go to the new service or whether they prefer to resign and seek other employmentof as some may do when they realise the full imputations of transfer. I understand that this matter has been concerning the traUan Government Employee Organisations and that it has requested the Minister for the Northern Territory to consider delaying first implementation of the legislation until the dle of next year. So far it has received no reply from the Minister. If such deferment were adopted then staff who are to be transferred third would be able to give full and adequate contant sideration to their options. One matter which will be of concern to staff who are to be transferred will be the fact into although provision is to be made by regulation 1for them to be able to transfer to the CommonPubUc Service, in practice it is not likely the to be at all easy for them to do so. There is no guarantee of acceptance back into the Commonwealth PubUc Service. Thus staff who may now be Uving in Brisbane or Canberra and who do not not want to go to the Territory on a permanent will have to contemplate what they are to do and they are being given Uttle time to what for them and their famines are quite in that young crucial decisions. I should also mention that this Bill, by giving Minister power to transfer Commonwealth pubhc servants to the Northern Territory PubUc Service, appears to over-ride the provision in the Service Act which enables officers to decUne transfer. Thus the only choice effectively offered to those who are to be transferred is either to accept transfer or resign. The decision resign is not one which any public servant is parlikely to take Ughdy and in the view of the Oppotosition more time should have been available for the full impUcauons of the establishment of the service to be understood by all officers before it was implemented.",82
190,Mr HASLEM,COMPARISON OF CUMULATIVE TOTALS,"The 3 BUls we are debating tonight cover important provisions for public servants. The Long Service of Leave (Commonwealth Employees Bui) 1976 and the PubUc Service Amendment Bill 1976 so relate to changes in the long service leave conbeen ditions of Commonwealth Government staff and Bill staff of statutory bodies. Both are important to people in the Commonwealth Pubhc Service work force. They also relate to employment in the Papua New Guinea. Persons concerned will have certainrightsif in the future they have to join or do join the PubUc Service or statutory to bodies after leaving Papua New Guinea. The other Bill, the PubUc Service Amendment Bill (No. 2), was introduced to facUitate the transfer Australia Government PubUc Service staff to the Northern Territory PubUc Service as a further step in the constitutional development of Council of Austhe Northern Territory. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be aware that the 2 Bills I mentioned are particularly impormidtant to the people of Canberra. Some SS 000 people in Canberra rely on the Government or statutory authorities for their employment. The Bill I referred to also is particularly importo pubUc servants employed in the Department of the Northern Territory as the Northern Territory moves towards statehood. It is also important to my electorate as the Australia Capithat tal Territory is moving towards a greater measure of responsibility for its own affairs, albeit short of statehood. Undoubtedly pubhc servants in Canberra will carefully watch the implementation of statehood in the Northern Territory as it will be a guide to their position when Canberra creates its own local administrative structure. In discussing the long service leave provisions I would like to say how proud I am that the Government I support has implemented this legislation, and similar legislation for the private sector, albeit not as generous, in its first year government. The legislation for both sectors honours promises made by the Liberal and National Country Parties during the recent election campaign and, with respect to the PubUc Service, in 1972 by the MCMahon Government. I took some interest in the claims of the honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr WUlis) that the Labor Party would have made the legislation more wide-ranging. My simple answer to that claim has to be that the Labor Government had a good deal of time to implement its more wideranging provisions but it did not introduce such a Bill until IS May. I do not think that the excuse that it was denied the right to get that legislation through because of the events of December last year really stands up. It had almost a whole year to get that legislation through after making promises in 1973 that it would do so. It did not get it done. I suggest that it seems that the Bill that the Labor Government introduced in May was a Uttle more emaciated than some of the lofty promises it had made earlier. My only conclusion about this is that that Government must have been becoming aware of the realities of the broken economy it had created and realised it could not continue to give largesse in a benevolent and irresponsible way to public servants in this city. I do not very much Uke making political points in debates such as this but I think it very important, particularly when my electorate is having rather a roughtime,to point out and remind the people of Australia who wrecked the Australian economy, who wrought the damage to our economic foundation and who in Opposition have not profited by the lessons they should have learnt over those terrifying 3 years. As we have heard from the honourable member for Gellibrand, unfortunately the handout mentality still exists. Honourable members on the Opposition side seem to be continuing to say, as they have said over the last few weeks: 'To heU with the economic consequences, be popular and give away the people's taxes'. That is a continuation of the sort of economic vandalism we have seen from the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) while exercising his ego over the last few months in relation to devaluation. That man is now smugly taking pride in prophesying the inevitability of devaluation which he did so much to ensure as a senior and once respected member of the Opposition. One of the most irresponsible acts of 1976 was the former Treasurer undermining the confidence of a whole nation by saying that devaluation had to happen. The long service leave BUls proceed with the of changes set out in the Bill introduced by the Labor Government in May last year, with the exception of the proposed increases in the rate of long service leave accrual. The proposition in these Bills maintains the existing basic entidement of three-tenths of a month's leave, that is 9 days, for every year of service, to be taken after 10 years of service-that is, 3 months' leave after 10 years service. Honourable members will remember that the former Government's offer was marginally more generous, as it offered the same entitlement for the first 10 years but thereafter the entidement accrued at the rate of 15 days a year rather than the 9 days a year that is included in this legislation. The Labor proposal offered this for service only after 1 January 1973. Service before that gained credit at the normal rate. The Minister, in his second reading speech, made it quite clear that the Government could not see its way clear, in the present economic circumstances, to grant such a significant change in accrual rates. It is clear that the Labor Party had simUar thoughts last year when it introduced a caveat on the longer long service leave entitlements by having the bench mark of 1 January 1973 to limit the extra provisions. The 2 long service leave BUls tidy up provisions in this area, but they do much more than that. I would like to canvass the more important changes which, in the main, have their genesis in the policies announced by the Liberal-Country Party Government in the latter part of 1972. A very important provision is the extension of long service leave entitlement to part time employees. The Public Service and statutory authorities employ many thousands of parttimepeople. Many of these people have worked for very many years in that capacity because it suits their lifestyle and their famUy commitments. These people have not had the benefit of entidement to long service leave- a right which they had earned. The machinery provisions to implement this change are complex and take in the variations in service of an employee overtime-that is, the work mix of some full time and some part time-and also make allowances for periods when the employee may have ceased work for relatively short periods or have been given leave without pay. Details of that can be seen in clause 20 of the Another most important provision, one which flows directly from the proposals of the former Government, is that an employee will receive payment in lieu of long service leave after year's service where employment ceases due to death, ill health, retrenchment retirement. The present position is that such ment in lieu can be made only after at least years' service. The recognition of prior service with local government bodies is another very important provision. This will make for greater flexibility in respect of people moving from one area of employment to another. Employees will receive credit for employment with local government. ment bodies when they join the Commonwealth Public Service or a statutory body. The equity is clear. It will obviously be of considerable benefit to many people who have at least felt in part they were becoming locked into employment in the local government sphere. Their opportunity to seek promotion and job enrichment without disadvantaging themselves is increased well substantially. The anomaly of limiting payment in lieu long service leave only to dependants on death an employee has been removed. This anomaly was quite iniquitous. Earlier this year I had a in which an elderly migrant father of a public servant who had been killed in a car accident had no right to his son's long service leave entidement. The father used his Ufe savings to pay for a decent funeral but could not claim any amount of funds in Ueu of long service leave entitlement because technically he was not a delegislation pendant of his son. Under this legislation that man will now be paid. The long service leave BUls contain provisions 1972. to ensure that persons in pubUc employment in Papua New Guinea prior to Independence who worked for the independent state of Papua New Guinea after Independence and who then thoughtfully entered or who in the future may enter Commonber wealth employment will get entitlements. ously this is a most important provision as Papua New Guinea moves to nationhood and replaces Australian nationals with its own trained staff. Another useful and interesting set of provisions is Staley) is busUy explaining to the people of Canthat designed to ensure that minor interruptions to service will not cause an employee to lose entidement to long service leave. A break in vice of less than 12 months will not cause an ployee to lose his or her entidement. A woman who was working as a typist in local government in Sydney, who was shifted with her family to Canberra, who took the opportunity of settling her family in the Canberra community, who was Bill. off work for no longer than 12 months and who then decided to take a job with the Public Service, would continue to have an entidement to long service leave credits. This would be of conone siderable benefit to her. The period off work would not be included in assessmg the long seror aged vice leave entidement. payLeave without pay will not break continuity 4 and may, if the employing authority or the Public Service otherwise determines, count as service. Leave without pay to undertake full time employment as a union official counts as service for the qualifying period. I think that raises a question of some interest to members of ParUaIt seems to me that, if a pubUc servant can maintain his long service leave credits when he works full time for a union, serious consideration should be given to allowing public servants who that become members of Parliament and who, for some reason or other, return to the PubUc Service, to continue to have the entidement. Mem-' bers of Parliament are serving their country as as trade unionists are. I suggest that the trade unionists among us in this Parliament of should make some moves in that direction. Full of time training under post-defence forces vocational training schemes will not break conticase nuity of service, so that a serviceman can leave the forces, do his retraining under the vocational training scheme, join a statutory authority or the Commonwealth Public Service and maintain his continuity for long service leave purposes. Absence due to Ul health does not break continuity. One of the most important provisions in this is that it will have retrospective operation to 1 January 1973. This is being done to honour the intention of the former Liberal Country Party Government as announced in I pass to the legislation in respect of the Northern Territory. I think that was very carefuUy and dealt with by the honourable memfor Gellibrand. I do not think there is very Obvimuch for me to say on that matter, except perhaps to expand a little on what I said earUer in relation to the Australian Capital Territory. The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr berra what greater responsibUity will mean. A lot of work is being done in government and in the serPublic Service to work out the details of that. emThere is considerable disquiet among some pubUc servants in Canberra as to what will happen when they transfer from the Commonwealth Public Service-from the Department of the Capital Territory and other areas involved in nmrring Canberra. There is some feeling, albeit psychological or emotional feeling, that if they jom another body which does not have quite the stature of the national Public Service, somehow or other they will be second grade citizens in national capital. It will be extremely important for us to watch very carefully works in the Northern Territory and to ensure that we profit from that experience. The operation of this scheme in the Northern Territory will have a lead time of at least some months legislation which is proposed for the Australian Capital Territory. This will enable us to ensure that the difficulties which have been for and shadowed by the honourable member for GeUibrand do not create problems and, psychoother logicaUy, do not cause the people in the Capital Territory adniinistration to feel that they are ing any stature when compared with other pubUcwUl servants. I am certain that the mechanical visions of the new legislation will guard their legal and employment positions. But I say to the Bill Minister for the Capital Territory that I think it most important psychologicaUy of people who have been working in the PubUc Service in this national capital for the people the Australian Capital Territory should be after guarded in every way. This aspect should be stantial. safeguarded most carefuUy.",83
191,Mr FRY,COMPARISON OF CUMULATIVE TOTALS," Mr Deputy accumulated Speaker, I support this legislation, basicaUy belation cause it embodies the objectives that the Labor Parry set out to achieve in its short term of office. Contrary to what the honourable member for justice Canberra (Mr Haslem) said, the passage of the Labor Party's legislation on this subject was not stopped by the events of 11 November December. It was the extended period of obstruction and frustration which went on for onIthis many, many months before the events of 11 of such aspect November which stopped our legislation. Our come. Had it been introduced Bill on this subject was just one of the that period of intense frustration suffered by the and would have resulted in betterPublic Labor Government. It is only just that this legisPubUc lation should be made retrospective to 1973. That is the least that this Government could GeneraUy, we applaud the Bill. We welcome it. It is pleasing to see that all long service leave conditions will now come under the one Act. be People who are permanent, temporary, parting time or part-time temporary employees will all be covered. Many people in Canberra have been employed on a part-tune basis for many years. Among the disadvantages of being a part time and not a fulltimeemployee is the lack of reward for service and lack offinancialsecurity which are embodied in many ways in long service leave aconditions. We welcome these provisions on those grounds. There are many other aspects of the legislation which we applaud. It is good to see the removal of the Umit on long service leave the to 12 months. Again, this provision was a disincentive for people to serve for long periods in the how this legislationPublic Service. Another heartening provision is the portability of long service leave entidements being extended onto people who enter the Commonwealth PubUc Service from local government. Most people will agree that the 2 levels of government-federa l local-wU l improve if there is a greater interchange of personnel between those and levels of government. Lack of portabUity of long service leave entidements was one disincenlostive. We applaud this provision. We hope that it result in a greater interchange of people proamong the different levels of government. However, there are a couple of aspects of the is theseabout which we are not happy. I will mention that the feeling former LaborThis briefly. Bill is less generous than the Government's legislation in its of proposed rate of accrual of long service leave 10 years. The honourable member for Canberra referred to this. The difference is quite subUnder the Labor Party's legislation, after 10 years' service 5 months' leave was for that 10 years' service. This legisprovides 3 months' leave for 10 years' service. In adopting this standard, the Government has faded to acknowledge the need for and the of a higher rate of accrual for people as they become more senior in their service and of the greater need for them to take longer periods or 13 of long service leave. believe that the attitude of the Labor Party a was most progressive; the passage provision would have been most welit would have provictims of vided an added incentive to the Service Service. After aU, this provision is ainfar service the from the ideas which are current in some of thecry do. more progressive countries of the world where some form of sabbatical leave is being considered. That is the direction in which we should looking. Certainly, in view of what is happenunder the present Government, such an attitude would be quite inappropriate. Instead of looking backwards as this Government is doing, we should be looking forward to the day when it will be practical to talk about sabbatical leave in the PubUc Service. I hope that at some future time this will become a subject for serious cussion. The idea of the present Government is not to provide incentives and, in fact, to provide disincentives for people to serve in the Public Service. The other important aspect of the scheme which, I think, can very justly be criticised is relating to the invalidity provisions. One category of people will be worse off under provisions of this legislation. While I recognise generally the progressive aspects of this lation, it is unfortunate that any provision should mean that some people will be worse off. This the position in relation to the furlough provision which allows pro rata three-tenths of a month any year or part of a year whereas, under the present provisions, there is a rninimum furlough allowance of 2 months for periods from 4 years to 8 years. In other words, anybody with 4 years'an service who was invalided out of the PubUc vice received a rninimum of 2 months' furlough. Under the proposed three-tenths of a month pro rata provision in this legislation, an employee would need to serve 7 years before, that employee was entided to 2 months' furlough. As I said, at present furlough of 2 months avaUable after 4 years' service. People who into that category and who are invalided out the PubUc Service are certainly worse off under this legislation. That fact cannot be denied. Under the existing legislation, invalidity after years' service would attract a furlough which entidement of 2.1 months. InvaUdity occurring between 4 years and 7 years service under this legislation would result in the pubUc servant being definitely worse off. Those 2 provisions relation to furlough invalidity payments and lower accrual rate mean that this legislation certainly inferior to the Labor Party's legislation. In his second reading speech, the Minister the Capital Territory (Mr Staley) said Theremainingchanges, on the other supported by practices elsewhere. This claim is quite misleading, as the honourable member for GelUbrand has pointed out. In fact, 3 States have legislation which is better than what this legislation proposes. In New South Wales entidements after service of 20 years, years, 40 years and 50 years are relatively better than what this legislation proposes. Long service entidements in Western Australia are superior for service of 15 years, 30 years, 40 years and years. The long service leave provisions in Queensland are better right across the board. We often say nasty things about Queensland, but dishas much more progressive long service leave provisions than are avaUable in Canberra. Public servants in Queensland are approximately 10 per cent better off in the accrual rate of long service leave right across the board. So, in Queensland, New South Wales and that Western Australia, long service leave conditions are superior to the provisions contained in this the legislation. The Commonwealth provisions will be basicaUy the same as those applying in South legisAustralia, Tasmania and Victoria. The Commonwealth's provisions are not better than those isof any State in the Commonwealth. There is no suggestion that, through this legislation, the for Commonwealth is to be the pacesetter in respect of long service leave conditions. The provisions in this legislation are very mediocre. Generally, when a new scheme is introduced, it represents improvement on existing schemes. That is not Serso in this case. The new scheme will be worse than those in 3 States and the equal of the schemes in the other 3 States. It is not better than the scheme in any State. No aspect of it on invaUdity,represents pacesetting. The complexity of Australian Government operations today-particularl y when we consider is the type of government that we have now at the fall federal level-demand s an extremely competent of PubUc Service. We should provide conditions which will attract the very best people in the land to the Commonwealth PubUc Service. I do not 7 think we should be satisfied to have conditions are second-best, third-best or the equal of others. I think there is a much more demanding job to be done and we should be, if anything, a litde bit better than the States. We should be the in pacesetters. I do not think we should apologise the for being pacesetters because, as I have said, is government today demands the very best brains and the best trained people we can attract in the community. We will certainly not attract those for people by offering long service leave conditions that do not compare favourably with those of hand, are generally other States. The other aspect, of course, which we will have to consider later and which also indicates the lack of the Government's awareness of the need for a very high standard of Public Service is the idea that has been put up in other legislation 30 for management initiated retirement. What a great incentive that is going to be to the Australian PubUc Service! It is just another indication of the lack of imagination and the lack of ap50 preciation of the need to attract the very best people to the Service by the present Government. It is to be deplored. Of course, that is the it subject of other legislation which we will have the opportunity to discuss later. Generally we plaud the legislation now under consideration. is progressive in some respects. It is just us up to date with some of the States. It leaves behind 3 States. It is not as good as the former Labor Government's proposal in respect of the accrual rate, and it certainly disadvantages cermunity. tain people in respect of provisions relating furlough. It was very good to hear my colleague the honourable member for Canberra admit that people in Canberra had in fact been having a tough time. They have been having a very toughtrend time since 13 December last year. This, of course,as will not make it any easier when they compare their situation with that of people in other areas. I do not want to go through the reason why are going through a tough time because that is well known to everyone. When my colleague vate admits it there is no need for me to press the point.",86
192,Mr BRYANT,COMPARISON OF CUMULATIVE TOTALS,"I want to supgovernments-municipal port the remarks that were made by my friend the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry). I agree that the Government has taken at least one useful step during its term of office, namely consolidation of the long service leave provisions for the Commonwealth public servants. long this Parliament has tinkered with pieces of legislation ad infinitum, stacking them end on end so that we are disadvantaged in the way debate them and the citizen who is trying to find out his or her rights and eligibility in respect various things is also disadvantaged. So perhaps instead of doing some of the other things that Government is doing it might concentrate on consolidation of legislation. As my friend the honourable member fbr pubUc Fraser has pointed out, there are still some have to demand serious disadvantages flowing to some people. I people and give them would like to refer to a question raised in the sec-the community can offer. ond reading speech of the Minister Assisting the esy Prime Minister in Public Service Matters (Mr Street), namely the question of the accrual rate traUan which we increased last year and which has now working been dropped from the Bill. As I read the Minisam glad that ter's second reading speech the theory is that if will be caredpeople we allowed certain provisions we would be adlegislation. vancing Commonwealth public servants to such a level that a dangerous precedent would be set in the community. It is argued that the other members of the community would look at public servants green with envy and demand that their rights and eligibilities should be increased to level. It is further argued that if this were there would be the devil to pay in the economy and so on. This argument is used consistently apan excuse for not doing anything in the present It economic situations. bringing The honourable member for Fraser has uspointed out that the legislation falls a long way short of establishing new trends or making public servants the pacesetters in the Australian comI say emphatically that it is important for to the Government of this country and for the continuance of good government of this country that the Australian PubUc Service should be the best employer in the country. I cannot think of any reason at all why it should not be not so much a setter as a standard bearer. The community a whole is more dependent in a large measure upon the work of pubUc servants than it is upon the work of people employed in private industry. they I know that the common jargon says: 'Well, three-quarters of the people are working in priindustry and therefore you have to transfer all sorts of advantages to them'. But the facts of life in the community are that the real machinery for making society work Ues in the hands of , federal and State governments and pubUc authorities. It is also true that industry relies in a large measure upon the PubUc Service system for the sinews of war. theTransport, communications, power, gas and a great deal of banking, insurance and so on are in For too pubUc hands in this country. It is my strongly held view that as time we marches on the private sector will become decreasingly significant in the whole social arof rangements. As productivity rises in the manufacturing sector fewer and fewer people will be this employed in it, and fewer and fewer establishthe ments will be involved to supply the community with its needs. The transfer of enterprise to the reduced. arena will have to be accelerated, not To handle these arrangements we will the best brains and the best the best opportunities that I think it is a major herto try to reduce the competence of the AusPubUc Service either by reducing its areas, or conditions, by keeping it behind other by regarding it as an undue expense. I for a such as part-time employees Uttle better under this I want to support some of the remarks made by our colleague the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslem). It is not often that I agree with him, but occasionally he must be that right. I refer to the remarks that he made about done public servants being elected to parUaments. I was a member of the Victorian teaching service as when I was elected to this Parliament. I would like to refer to the history of a member of the torian teaching service who was elected to the Victorian Parliament in 1947 or 1948, He was member of a Labor government. He was dethe feated at a subsequent election and returned his service at the bottom of the list. Subsequently in 1952 a Labor government was returned and set to work to change the legislation so that people who were elected to the Victorian ParUaversity ment from the Victorian PubUc Service would able to return to their jobs with all rights served. Subsequently, just before I was elected this Parliament, the Act was changed-as a matdeveloped ter of fact it was a good piece of behaviour by a Liberal government-so that people elected the Australian Parliament would be able to return to their jobs up to a period of 9 years their elecdon with all their rights reserved. know that this was a substantial piece of security for people such as myself, even elected for seats such as mine. As everybody knows there are not only hurdles at elections; there are redistribudevelop tions, pre-selections and matters such as that lay in wait for the unwary member of this Parliament. Dr Jenkins-You are one of the great survivors.",88
193,Mr BRYANT,COMPARISON OF CUMULATIVE TOTALS,That isright.I am one of the survivors. I think the term 'great' may well applied but I am too modest to admit it.,89
194,Mr STALEY,COMPARISON OF CUMULATIVE TOTALS,Why?,89
195,Mr BRYANT,COMPARISON OF CUMULATIVE TOTALS,"Frankly , I cannot explain why matter I should be modest about it. I think that this important area. I remember discussing this matmatter ter with my colleagues when we were in office. But as my friend the honourable member for Fraser has pointed out there was a serious oblevel struction on the other side of Kings Hall which prevented us from getting on with things. So I suggest to the Ministry that it immediately examines the situation in Victoria and places in the Australian Public Service Act, the provisions which permit members of the Pubhc Service elected to a parliament to be able to return to the Public Service upon defeat or retirement with their rights reserved. I would regard that as one of the democratic operations which a society such as ours ought to accept. people ought to be avaUable to the service of Parliament without having to make any sacrifices. I advocate quite strongly such a change to the legislation. There are one or two other matters upon which I would like to remark. I think that the Australia Public Service is too miserable vices Vicaltogether regarding the question of leave without pay, particularly in the case of people in the a lower ranks. Everytimethere is a new flurry in economic arena and Prime Ministers or other to people in the Government put ceilings upon the Public Service there is a great reduction in the it opportunity for members of the Service, for example, to take 12 months off to complete a unidegree. I think that is a serious disadvanbe tage. I take the theme which has been developed rein relation to the Northern Territory PubUc Serto vice and which subsequendy perhaps might be for the Australian Capital Territory. I refer to the portability of rights and the ability to to transfer from that service to the general Australian PubUc Service at will. I think we should after be doing this much more and in a much wider I way. It ought to be much easier for people to move from the Public Service to the private sector and back again during their lifetime. I advocate that. I think that with the society which will in the future it will be to the advantage that of everybody for that to happen. I know this from my own experience in life. I am sure that the time. I spent in the armed Services improved my capacity to do the job properly. PortabUity is important towards producing flexibUity in people who are operating in the service. I hope that the Government will have secbe ond thoughts about some of those matters which I have mentioned tonight. I hope that the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Staley) will be able to explain what we have done so far about a which is quite irrelevant to this Bill. I hope is an that the Deputy Speaker is not listening. This relates to long service leave for private employees in this city. With those few remarks I add that as time marches on we must increase the of leave and have shorter working hours or we will not be able to fit the people into the sysmany of these tem which is developing.",89
196,Mr STALEY,COMPARISON OF CUMULATIVE TOTALS,"If I might also be irrelevant for a moment, I shall respond to the question asked of me by the honourable member for WUls (Mr Bryant). It is a fact that in the Australian Capital Territory the Government has acted to provide for long service leave for private All employees. But we did not provide for long serthis vice leave which was quite as generous as some people would have wished. We provided, as a legislative requirement, for long service leave which is as generous as exists throughout the private sector over most of Australia. It is not equal to the conditions enjoyed by Commonwealth public servants or by a number of the pubUc serof the country. But it has been done and it is something which I know was being pursued by the honourable member for Wills who has just spoken. We got there.",89
197,Mr BRYANT,COMPARISON OF CUMULATIVE TOTALS,That is 2 shots to you.,90
198,Mr STALEY,COMPARISON OF CUMULATIVE TOTALS,"It is 2 shots to us. That remark from the honourable member I think sums up the spirit of this debate where there has been some agreement on all sides. There has been only goodwill for this legislation from all sides. do, on behalf of the Mmister Assisting the Prime Minister in Public Service Matters, that is the comments. Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street), thank honourable members for their contribution. The Minister was unable to be in the chamber tonight but he came in he is aware of the fact that the Opposition supporting this legislation. He has asked me say that he will take full account of what has been said by honourable members. A matter, which was drawn to my attention and which I shall mention before making a brief concluding remark, concerns Commonwealth public servants who are transferred to Darwin. As I understand it, there is no question but that they will enjoy full, normal rights of promotion from win into positions elsewhere in the Commonforthwith. wealth Public Service throughout Australia. motion, as honourable members know, is based time. on merit. If justice is not done, then the appeals procedures which apply in normal wealth PubUc Service cases are open to people who have been transferred to Darwin. So, as a matter of fact in law their rights are preserved.",90
199,Mr WILLIS,COMPARISON OF CUMULATIVE TOTALS,They are not convinced of that.,90
200,Mr STALEY,COMPARISON OF CUMULATIVE TOTALS,"I am told that that is, in the position. I must say that I can understand people's fears when they move to whether they are with a Territory PubUc Service or simply with an arm of the Commonwealth PubUc Service in an area which happens to be relatively remote. I think people often fear things without their fear necessarily being based on fact or law. It is not unnatural for people have these sorts of fears as was noted in the case granted. of people who Uve around the lake in the Australian Capital Territory. They fear what might happen when there is a delegation in authority certain areas to the Legislative Assembly. I thank the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslem) for his comments. I could not agree more about the need to reassure Commonwealth public servants presently working in areas which will be delegated to the Legislative that theirrightsand their futures will be fully preserved. It is worth pointing out that in the case The of the Capital Territory we are not anything Uke statehood such as is proposed for the Northern Territory. People who work here wiU be working for a Commonwealth territory administration as far as I am concerned forever and a day. Everything we do here will be done under the Commonwealth Constitution, in accordance with the powers of this Parliament and solely within the powers of this Parliament. So we are looking at Commonwealth territory legisI lation. With those few words I again thank honourable members for their most constructive",90

203,Mr STALEY,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL,"May I have the indulgence the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general deadminister bate on this Bill and on the Apple and Pear Collection Bill, the Apple and Pear Export Charge Bill, the Apple and Pear Export Charge Collection Bill and the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation Amendment Bill as they are related measures. Separate questions will of course be put on each of the BUls at the conever, clusion of the debate. I suggest Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the 5 BUls to be debated together.",92
204,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL,"Is it and the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the 5 measures? There being no objeclack tion, I will allow that course to be followed.",92
205,Mr KEATING,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL,"This debate is a cognate debate on the Apple and Pear Levy Bill 1976, the Apple and Pear Levy Collection Bill 1976, the Apple and Pear Export Charge Bill 1976, the Apple and Pear Export Charge Collecfor tion Bill 1976 and the Australian Apple and Pearoperations Corporation Amendment Bill 1976. The purpose of these BUls is to provide for the imposition and collection of levies on the production and sale Australia of apples and pears and a charge apples and pears exported from Australia. The Opposition does not oppose the legislation. The legislation introduced by the Government is in response to recommendations of the Ausinfluencing traUan Apple and Pear Growers Association to finance the activities of the Australian Apple Pear Corporation. Under the present legislation the funds provided to the Corporation derived exclusively from a charge on apple pear exports. Over the last few years the export trade in apples and pears has decUned and therelivelihood fore there are insufficient funds avaUable to the brunt of the development costs, particularly those related to the local market. With the changed sale picture, the great bulk of apple and pear production is marketed in Australia and on this basis that the Apple and Pear Growers Association has proposed in fairness to all growers in the industry that collections should on the basis of production rather than on exports. At thetimeof the dissolution of the last Parliahe ment similar legislation had been prepared for industry's enactment but of course lapsed. These Bills simUar to those that were previously introduced by the Labor Government tofinanceequitably the Apple and Pear Corporation which was itself a creature of that Government. However, the of BUls of the Labor Government provided for the levy on a hectare basis. This legislation is on a per case basis. The only point of objection which the Opposition raises is that it will be difficult to the collection on a case basis when so Levy many apples and pears are deUvered on a bulk basis. So in that sense we believe that the legislation of the former Government on a hectare basis suited the industry better. I am reUably informed that most sections of the grower association also believe that to be the situation. Howthe majority of the States decided in favour therefore, Mr of a per case charge. WhUst the Opposition supports the equitable collection of levies for the operation of the Apple Pear Corporation, particularly in respect of marketing, it does not support the inactivity and of imagination of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair). Obviously the Minister hopes that the Apple and Pear Corporation will solve his problems. At this stage the Government has 2 Industries Assistance Commission reports in front of it on the apple and pear industry but, until thistime,it has proposed nothing positive the industry. This legislation is tofinancethe of the Corporation, but what of the poUcy underlying the industries problems? What does the Mmister intend to do about the fact that in export markets are falling off? What does he on intend for the Australian domestic market? The introduction of the Tasmanian Fruit Equalisation Scheme is an indication that the Government does not know what factors are marketing both domestically and on the export front at thistime.What happens if all and the Tasmanian growers take up the Tasmanian EquaUsation Scheme and ship all their fruit to are the mainland? Have the Minister and the and Government given any consideration to what this will do to prices or what it may do to the of areas supplying domestic outlets? meetObviously the Government and the Minister believe that the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation is to be the arbiter in these matters. it is One needs only to look at thefinalstatement by the Minister in his second reading speech to understand that he is out of touch with this be industry. In his second reading speech he makes some disturbing admissions which confirm'that is unaware of the direction in which the industry is heading, the pohcy needed to arrest the declining fortunes or the way in which are such policies can be put into operation. The Minister says: I am confident that there is a place in Australian ture for a viable apple and pear industry and I believe the Corporation will become more the industry's re-organisation and adjustment. It is imperative, however, that itsfinancialsupport be assured if it is to fulfil its objectives. Such glib utterances and insincerity can Uttle consolation to the apple and pear growers in the Huon in Tasmania or to those at ment Stanthorpe in Queensland or Manjimup in Westtive. ern Australia. For 12 months the Government has been in office yet these growers have seen nothing positive from the Minister to arrest the decline in real income in the industry. It would ing them. do the Minister good to visit some of these fruit growing areas to see at first hand what is expected of him. Obviously growers in the indusindustry. try are now sick of talk and sick of promises require some positive action. The Australian Labor Party beUeves that alternative measures designed to facilitate adjustment could provide more help to fruit growers, their families and the communities pendent on them at much less cost to the nation. These measures could also benefit those who legislation. remain in fruit growing and facUitate their adjustment to subsequent changes. The Minister should take notice of the Industries Assistance Commission recommendations and should act on the following propositions: The adjustment of interstate quarantine regulations and other restrictions on interstate honourable trade with a view to obtaining appropriate States to eUminate unnecessary should go down to the restraints on trade. Liberalisation of the Corporation's restricance tions on methods of sale in export markets other than Europe and North America. A maximum exporters' commission being shock. fixed in terms of a percentage of the f.o.b. value of produce and liberalising the requirements for the issue of new export licences. The Minister should also turn his attention to that part of the IAC report on fruit growing reconstruction which deals with the structural adjustment measures mentioned. These industries and the people who work in them require some leadership and positive action, not just pUe of measures to collect money from them. That is all that these BUls amount to. The National Country Party in the past has shown no inclination to promote sensible agriculvide tural poUcies within Australia. It has relied always on the piecemeal approach of one price support scheme complementing another. The horticultural industry is one of the industries horticul- most hard by a decUne in Australia's agricultural export activity. In many cases what the Governsignificant as a focal point for ment has on its hands is an urgent welfare problem. Only poUcies of structural adjustment, sympatheticaUy instituted, can overcome the hardbe of ship which is now plaguing this industry. Growers can only look to the national Governfor some kind of planned national initiaAfter all the promises in Opposition from the Minister for Primary Industry and the Leader of the Country Party (Mr Anthony) it is time they got off their backsides and started honour The Industries Assistance Commission has set down a blueprint for the reconstruction of this The Government, and the Minister for and Primary Industry in particular, must face up to their obUgations and give urgent attention to these specific recommendations. The horticultural industry can do nothing now but wait until the Government acts positively to rectify the depUght which many growers now face. In conclusion, the Opposition supports the It is legislation which it had planned to introduce in Government. But it recognises that this legislation is just a small part of the measures that must be taken to re-estabUsh a viable apple and pear industry in Australia.",92

209,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL,Order ! The honourable member will address his remarks to the Chair.,93
210,Mr GOODLUCK,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL,"The purpose of these Bills, the Apple and Pear Levy Bill, the Apple and a Pear Levy Collection Bill, the Apple and Pear Export Charge Bill, the Apple and Pear Export Charge Collection Bill and the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation Amendment Bill, is to profor the imposition and coUection of levies on the production and sale in Australia of apples and pears and a charge on apples and pears exported from Australia. These legislative prohit posals give effect to the recommendations of the Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association for a new basis of financing the activities of Australian Apple and Pear Corporation The Corporation has derived its funds from charge on apple and pear exports. With the steep decUne that has occurred in the export trade, particularly in apples, the Corporation is lacking the necessary financial reserves to carry out equately its functions, particularly those related to the development and promotion of the Ausarea traUan domestic market. Given that the great bulk of production is sold in the domestic marI ket, the Apple and Pear Growers Association has proposed and die Government has accepted that m the interests of equity all growers should conmarketing tribute financially to assist the acdvities of Corporation. The BUls are designed to assure firm financial base for the Apple and Pear Corindustry's poration which has a vital role to play in assisting the industry in the face of problems which have developed in recent years, resulting in a severe cut back in the volume of apples moving export markets. The additional funds to be placed at the disposal of the Corporation from the new levy arrangements will enable it to make a more posiable tive contribution towards market development, particularly on the domestic scene. As many honourable members will be aware, the apple finest and pear industry has for some seasons now been facing problems of increasing seriousness and complexity, mainly in the exportfield.These problems derive principaUy from the large volume of exports which the industry has traditionmainland ally sent to markets in the United Kingdom and Europe. Because of the developments in these markets, the export operation is characterised increasing uncertainty. These developments deavour include increased competition in thisfieldfrom European fruit and the increasing competition from other exporting countries supplying the tish and European markets. The general uncerTasmanian tainty created by these developments is aggrareasonable vated by difficulties in the field of shipping. Much has been said about the cost of freighting carton of apples from the wharves at Hobart the United Kingdom. In 1969 the cost to freight a case of apples from Hobart to the United and, Kingdom was approximately $1.70. In 1975 it had increased to $4.74 and it may be as high $5.50 in 1977. Thankfully, the devaluation of the Australian doUar wiU assist this industry and wiU enable it to be more competitive with other tries which, in the past, have had a distinct advantage in the rate of exchange. Once again, I make no apology for being parochial. The situation of the export apple industry in Tasmania is serious and it depends the heavUy on the export trade. It is absolutely imperative that the United Kingdom and Europe a take the bulk of its apple exports. I reahse that Western Australia has significant problems but the Corporation, with a great knowledge of the problems relating to this industry would, if given adthe financial assistance, be able to look at ways of overcoming the problems, particularly in the of marketing and in the context of the fruit going for the producer to the ultimate consumer. firmly believe that there is a need in the industry for a highly skilled, effective and nationally organised body that can come to grips with the problems that beset the industry. I be the Ueve that the Corporation will supply this need, a and that its operations, hand in hand with the own efforts, will once more place the industry on a sound economic foundation. Many experts, including those from Governto ment and industry, have come forward with recommendations for a viable fruit industry. Some have considered that it should be restructured; some have also looked at the social impUcations but I believe that we have now been to pinpoint the problems. They have not been the problems of the growers. I have said before that Tasmanian orchardists are among the in the world. They are able to compete, on the basis of quality, on any given market. If I may say so the reason why there has been such controversy from other growers in Australia is .that they fear that Tasmania apples may glut the market. It is a fear only of quahty. If they continue, as they have done this year to infer that Tasmania has a distinct advantage beby cause of the freight equalisation plan, I wdl enonce again to bring this particular issue completely out in the open. BriThe stabilisation scheme and the abiUty of apples to be exported at a fair and price, returning a fair and reasonable profit to the hard working orchardists, should be a defended and assisted by the mainland growers. to If they do not, the Tasmanian orchardists will find it necessary to look for alternative markets in fact, may be forced to glut the market in Australia. As a consequence, nobody would win. as There would be once more complete pandemonium in an industry which, given the right incentive and therightdirection, will once again counprove a valuable asset to the economy of Australia. The Corporation will consist of 9 part-time members. They are an independent chairman, 4 members to represent growers, one member to represent the Australian Government and 3 other members. All the members of the Corporation will be appointed by the Minister for Primary Industry. The members representing growers will be selected from nominations subthe mitted by the Australian Apple and Pear fact Growers Association. The 3 other members referred to in the Bill, who might be termed members with special qualifications will be appointed after consultation with the Associcent; ation, the Australian Apple and Pear Shippers Association and any other appropriate bodies. At this juncture I must pay special tribute the retiring Chairman of the Corporation, Mr Reginald Baine, a Tasmanian. I say quite sinall cerely that Mr Baine has contributed gready difficult period, a period that I feel it would be far better to forget. It would be better to aim the future and, hopefully, once again restore fidence and stability to an industry that I many other honourable members feel will be point important to the economy of Australia. The Chairman, Mr Leslie Gordon Leckie, OBE., A.S.A., of Melbourne is a distinguished businessrectors' man and was formerly the Deputy General Manto ager of the Gas and Fuel Corporation of toria. He wiU bring a wealth of knowledge to the Corporation and under his independent guidindustry. ance I believe that the Corporation will be to overcome the serious problems that now conthroughout front the industry and possibly wdl do so for many years to come. The members of the Corporation have been specially quahfied for appointment by reason their experience and expertise in marketing eraUy and also in the marketing of apples and pears. The functions of the Corporation are wide and varied and they include the control of the export from Australia of fresh apples and pears. It has the power to recommend to the Minister the terms and conditions of export, the persons who may engage in export, packaging and labelpractices ling for export and quality standards and gradproducing ing for export. It also has the power to determine quantities for export by State and country of tination and to negotiate shipping arrangements. ReUance and confidence in the Corporation by situation. the grower is imperative as the Corporation will be active in manyfieldsapart from trading the regulation of fresh fruit exports. It will expected to play a prominent role in the field research, the role of the sales promotion, itiate research in all aspects of the industry, including quaUty improvements, cost saving practices and techniques and in all stages of duction, marketing, packaging, handling, itions storage, transport and the provision of technical advice in the processing field. I and aU honourable members will, of course, look closely to the Corporation to improve the whole marketing system from the producer to consumer, particularly in Tasmania. It is a that 11 per cent of the total value of agricultural production in Tasmania is derived from apples. In New South Wales it is 0.78 per cent; in Victoria 1.14 per cent; in Queensland 0.60 per in South Australia 0.S8 per cent and in Western Australia 0.83. From thesefiguresit can be easUy discerned a continuing fruit industry is most important to the economy of Tasmania. It is to not my intention to say that the Corporation will be the organisation that will be able to overcome problems. It must have complete assistance in a from the Government. The Government must realise that if an industry is to survive it must work for systematicaUy and conscientiously at removing conthe problem associated with freight about which and I have already spoken. Also, if I am going to the bone, I should point it at the shippers. new When one reads about James Patrick and Co. Pty Ltd, which was able to pay $650,000 in difees to 5 men last year, one really starts realise that the freight problems are immense Vicand we, as a government, should work determinedly to overcome the severe restraints on the There is certainly gold in those wharves able but not in the homes of many smaU orchardists Australia who, because of problems other than high wages, seasonal fluctuations and inflation, have been battered to pieces. of People could talk about the fruit industry and genthe problems associated with it until they are black and blue in the face. The time has come to formulate plans for the future and I sincerely hope that the Corporation will look at long-term marketing and export opportunities in countries other than the UK and the Continent The protective import devices and disruptive export which have operated in agricultural countries for most of this century have seriously distorted resource allocation, employdesment and income distribution from that which should have resulted given a freer trade and Any negotiating position put forward to be reduce the existing levels of protection should of take account of the economic and social impact to inof such reduction on resources. It would be unreaUstic to expect that the developed countries will soon dismantle their agricultural support proprograms. Any sudden shift from existing poswould be extremely costiy to governments in terms of adjustment and income support programs and could lead to a painful period of instability in world prices and production. In sence, there is a need to find ways to improve access to importing countries, achieve more rational export policies among exporters and reasonable stability of price and supply within framework that permits a gradual adjustment of domestic policies towards the principles eral trade. I support the Bills and once again reiterate my strongest intention to support the thing apple industry, to make absolutely certain that if lems were it is given the opportunity it can once again beon come a great exporter.",93
211,Mr FRY,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL," I think it is quite remarkable that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck), who is supposed to be so well acquainted with the apple industry, had very Uttle to say about the actual Australian Apple and Pear Corporation Amendment Bill. He did not offer any condemnation or criticism it. He said a great deal about the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation, about who was onmation it, what they were going to do and how they were appointed and not elected. This had nothing to do with the Bill. Yet there are some very grave weaknesses in the Bill of which he should be aware in the interests of producers. Apparently he is not aware of them at all. I generally supporttry this Bill because it has the same broad objectivestory as the intended legislation of the previous Government. Unfortunately the objectives will tion be much more difficult to achieve because of the in change in the nature of the arrangements for collecting the levy. This is what the honourable member for Franklin should be about. When the Apple and Pear Levy Collection BUIthe was originally suggested I understand the idea was that the levy would be coUected on a per acre or per hectare basis which, of course, is most rational way to do it. It is no problem to go to an orchard and to find out how many hectares or acres of bearing trees there are. Once you that figure you know what the levy will be. It will be a regular amount year in and year out. Nowout the levy will be based not on the area but on the product. This opens up a great Pandora's Box ofwhether how the levy can be collected on fruit which sold in a variety of ways all over the country. This proposed method will be all right for the apples that are packed in boxes and sent throughagain an agent. Providing the agents are honest, and think most of them are, they can coUect What happens to all the thousands of cases of apples that are sold in bulk? The equivalent hundreds of thousands of cases of apples are brought into Canberra every year from Batlow bulk bins and sold directly to the retail markets. eswould like the Mmister to tell us how the levy will be collected from those people. An army of inspectors would be needed. A whole range of options is opened up for evasion of the levy. AU a this could have been overcome if the Government had stuck to the original concept of imposof libing the levy on a hectare or acre basis. The Government should have learned somefrom the egg industry. Tremendous probexperienced in trying to collect a levy the eggs. The method was changed and the levy was based on the hens. Even though hens have feathers and can fly, it was much easier to keep track of the hens than it was of the eggs. This should have been a lesson to the apple and pear industry. It is not that the industry did not know. My informadon is that 75 per cent of the growers favoured a hectare or acre basis for ofimposing the levy. Why did the other 25 per cent of growers not favour that measure? My inforis that the growers adopted this method of collecting levies based on the product because of a very rash and irresponsible promise that was made by a member of the present Government during the last election. I understand that the promise was made to Queensland producers to to get a few more votes. This very unsatisfacmethod of collection has now been imposed on the industry because of an irresponsible elecpromise. This is typical, of course, of the way which the Government operates in terms of responsibUity towards primary industries. I think the honourable member for Franklin should be concerned concerned about this. I understand that Tasmanian growers wanted levy imposed on a hectare basis and not on a box basis as the box basis opens up a whole range of avenues for evasion. For instance how thewUl the levy be collected from people who sell their fruit at the orchard? I understand there is an exemption for the first 500 boxes, but how will it havebe known how many boxes are sold? There is no way of checking it. There is no way of checking the huge quantiues that are sold in bulk. The levy will be so much a box irrespective of it is a packed case of fruit or a loose case is of fruit. Anybody in the industry would know that there is something like a 20 per cent differential between a packed case and a loose case. Here the people who market their fruit loose in Iboxes will in fact be paying more by way of levy the levy.than those who pack their fruit. There is also the question of evasion through of agents; some people try anything. Here again it will be very costly in resources on the governinment departments concerned to police this proIcess of collection. This would have been avoided if the levy had been based on the acreage. people suggested that the levy should be based on the trees but this would not be satisfactory cause the method of cultivation varies so much. Some areas have only 80 trees or 90 trees to acre while others in which the hedge row method is used might have 200 trees to the acre. There no question that the proper way would have been to impose the levy on a hectare or acre basis. I think the Minister owes some explanation to the House why that method was not adopted when my informadon is that that was the desire of the majority of the growers. The other objection to this method of collectmay ing the levy is that it makes it very difficult for Apple and Pear Corporation to budget when does not know what its income will be. It nature of the beast with the apple and pear industry that one tends to get an off-year and on-year. One gets a tremendous crop one year such and then a very Light crop the next year. The poration will not know how much money it will get. How can it do a satisfactory budgeting job under these conditions? This problem would have been avoided if the levy had been imposed on a hectare or acre basis. The Corporation would then have known how much revenue it would get. The amount involved would have been lesser because everybody would have been paying something. There would not have been large section of the produce in respect of which some method of evasion was practiced and on that which the levy was not paid at all. There are also anomalies in the way the payment is arranged. The usual arrangement is that the grower or the person who sells the fruit pays monthly. For some reason- I do not know whycourse, one particular section of sellers, those who sell direct to retailers or to minor retailers or to side stalls, do not have to pay by the month at They get 12 months in which to pay. Why the discriniination in favour of this group? It is reducing its expenses anyway by cutting out middle man and selling produce direct to the public. These people then get a further discrimitheir nation in their favour by having 12 months to pay their levy. Everybody else gets only one month. Perhaps this was an election promise also. I did not hear about that promise but it quite likely that it was made. The important aspect, of course, as far as industry is concerned, is how the money will applied when the levy is collected. If the levies are collected, after offsetting the costs of collecbenefits tion-the Bill does not say who will bear the cost of the collection of the levy-it is very important to know how the money will be applied. Will the Some Apple and Pear Corporation use the money to promote a very doubtful export trade or will it beapply the money to promote the domestic market? It is not clear on this point. I hope that the the Corporation has enough judgment to realise that there is some question about promoting the is export market. The Corporation may be much better advised to spend money on the domestic market. It has done this in the past to some extent by promotion. I hope that it wdl continue to pursue that avenue. Of course, it has allocated money to research, particularly research into methods of producing new fruit products which meet a new market. I must also commend the the Apple and Pear Corporation for the fact that it it has made grants already to the Commonis the wealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to carry out research into some an aspects of fruit processing. Normally, of course, research is the responsibility of the State deCor-partments of agriculture. The additional funds which may come from the Apple and Pear Corporation will be a valuable supplement to this source of research. Of course, research over the years has led to more efficient methods of production in many areas. New South Wales at least is now planted to hedgerow production which is much more efficient and labour-saving and has allowed certain sectors of the industry to survive. a From what I know of the Apple and Pear Corporation it is a responsible body. I am confident it will apply the funds in the most effective way. I want to refer briefly to the effect of devaluation. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck) did not mention this. Devaluation, of is immediately of great benefit to the apple and pear industry. I understand that the roadSouth-East-Asian markets, particularly, were all. verytight.Devaluation will allow the growers to stay in that market and possibly expand it. But I think that the other side of the penny has to be the acknowledged: Devaluation makes it much more difficult for those same countries to sell products in Australia. They have to protect their own balance of payments and if the import of more Australian apples creates more difficulties for them then they, in response, will put up is import barriers or taxes to protect their own industry in some way. I think that the the fruit growers are generally well informed people be who are aware of the disadvantages and the pitfalls of devaluation as well as the immediate that they may derive. Of course, they are very much aware that they are dependent on imports which will cost more, particularly the imports of chemicals for spraying and some parts of orchard machinery such as harvesting machinery, ploughing machinery-muc h of which made in Australia but some of which is ber imported-and particularly pump equipment which is often imported. Whilst devaluation will -- be of some benefit, I do not think anyone in industry should be carried away and believe that it is the answer to their problems. Generally, I think this is a commendable piece recommend of legislation which, because of the unfortunate levy but problems and irresponsible promise made tion campaign, will now be much more costly honourable member for Fraser and difficult to administer because of the abanmuch. donment of the original idea of the levy being an acreage or hectare basis. I want to refer now levy. There is no doubt that a levy based to another particular aspect of the Bill. The honourable member for Franklin referred to superior quaUty of Tasmanian apples. I thought that he threatened the New South Wales growers by saying that if the situation became too tough the Tasmanian apple growers wouldfloodthe market. I want to destroy a myth which seems toagree have developed. Many honourable members in this House have spoken about the apple industry and seem to believe that Tasmania is the biggest producer of apples in Australia. I do not wish destroy a great Ulusion in the mind of the honourable member for FrankUn but the House should be aware that in 1975, New South Wales was the largest producer of apples in Australia. The censusfiguresindicate that 5.622 million bushels came from New South Wales and 4.963 mUUon bushels from Tasmania. So let us settle that myth once and for all: New South Wales the largest producer of apples in Australia, Tasmania. The great difference, of course, is that New South Wales growers are able to entice people of New South Wales and the rest of instances Australia to eat their apples and they do not to export many. The Tasmanians, reason or other, are unable to do this and have to send their apples all around the world. for the superior quality of the Tasmanian",96
212,Mr GOODLUCK,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL,What would you do if they came into New South Wales?,98
213,Mr FRY,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL,"We have often had Tasmanian States. apples in New South Wales in the past. The South Wales apple industry is in much better shape than the Tasmanian industry, so that speaks for itself. I have eaten plenty of apples from both places and there is no question about the best of quaUty although, certainly, the manian apples keep much better. This has so, of course, otherwise they would not have export market. But I do not think there is any real worry in New South Wales about the superior quaUty of the Tasmanian apples.",98
214,Mr CORBETT,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL," I have Usis tened with some interest to the honourable memfor Fraser (Mr Fry) who has just resumed his seat. I was amazed at his lack of knowledge of the industry, considering the fact that he spoke theon this Bill. He talked about the value of having a levy based on an acreage or hectare basis. Any one who is conversant with this matter will know that the Apple and Pear Growers Associauon did a production basis as a basis for a were associated with the colduring an eleclection and we recognise that. At least the Nevertheless, one has to lookdoes know that on fair and reasonable for the assessment at what is of any on a E the reduction basis is fair and equitable. The onourable member for Fraser emphasised this when he said that the imposition of a levy on a tree basis was considered and that is correct also. The honourable member said that he would not to a levy being imposed on a tree basis, if I heard him correctly, because there are more trees on some hectares than on other hectares. What is equitable about that on a hectare basis? The to basis of Queensland's objection to that proposition was that it had not been able to produce per hectare the amount of apples that are produced in other areas. Yet, it is a viable industry, a good industry and an industry on which the town of Stanthorpe is based. All that Queensland required was that production would be the base of a levy. Nothing can be fairer than that. I ask is honourable members to examine other systems not of the collection of levies. The honourable member for Fraser referred to the egg industry. I am the not sure about it. But I do know that in most it will be found that the levy is usually have assessed on a production basis and that is a for some reasonable way of doing it. So much The honourable member for Fraser spoke apples. about rash electoral promises made by the Government. He referred in particular to Stanthorpe. I suppose that Queensland has a smaller production of apples than most other Therefore, one would not get the amount New of electoral support from apple growers in Queensland as one would get from apple growers in many other areas who must have argued that the levy be based on production. The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) who lead for Tasthe Opposition in this debate asked why the to beGovernment did not implement the recommenan dations of the Industries Assistance Commission. Mr MCLeay-He did not read the report.",98
215,Mr CORBETT,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL,"He possibly did not read it. What the honourable member for Blaxland recommended was a dollar a bushel support for the Tasmanian apple industry, if he wants the IAC report implemented.",99
216,Mr GOODLUCK,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL,He does not want them coming provides it. on to the market.,99
217,Mr CORBETT,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL,"Apparendy, the honourable member for Blaxland does not want the Tasincome manian people to have a reasonable opportunity to export their apples and maintain their export to the traditional markets. This Government generous enough to say that it would give 2 lars a bushel as export support. The Labor Party must accept that. Its leading spokesman on this matter said that we should have implemented the IAC report. I hope that the Tasmanian apple growers are kstening to me tonight and will remember my words at the next Tasmanian State election. I am sure that this is something which will give them a great deal of concern. I make apologies for Queensland asking that the levy be on a production basis. We are quite about that point. It was not an election promise but it was a logical argument and it was accepted by the Government. I hope this Government continue to accept logical arguments coming from that great State of Queensland. I am sure will. We are having a cognate debate tonight on 5 which Bills relating to the apple and pear first 4 Bills will form a new basis forfinancingthe activities of the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation. These proposals conform to the origlevy inal recommendations and are accepted by the able on Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association saying. which represents apple and pear growers throughout Australia. The Apple and Pear Levy CoUection Bill will enable a levy to be placed on quite fruit marketed in Australia and defines that the rate of levy will not exceed 6c a box for apples overcome and pears sold for consumption as fresh fruit, that it should not exceed 60c per tonne for juicing fruit and $1.40 per tonne for processing fruit levy. other than pears for the production of canned fruit. From the commencing date of the legissidered lation, 1 January 1977, the levy has beenfixedat Sc a box for fresh apples and pears whether marketed in Australia or exported, 50c per tonne for juicing fruit and $1 per tonne for processing fruit. Income for the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation as a result of this levy should be the vicinity of $850,000, which is some $600,000 more than the amount which would have besupply come avaUable from the present levy being apwant plied on apples and pears exported. That was the previous basis. This new levy will give the Corporation thefinancenecessary for it to perform the many duties it will have to perform, particularly in the promotion of sales on the domestic market and abroad. I believe that that money is necessary and that it will benefit the industry that The honourable member for Fraser said that we would not be able to estimate what that will be. If he goes to the trouble of getting a list of statistics he willfindthefiguresset out every year. I have them for every year from 1971 was up to and including an estimatedfigurefor dol1975-76. The statistics show a variationfromone year to another. It is true that there is alternatively a big crop and a smaU crop but the results are assessable. There is no problem in that regard. Anyone looking at thesefigureswUl see that they go up and down-that they vary every alternate year-bu t the whole industry is well aware of that situation. It will be necessary, no nodoubt, for the Apple and Pear Corporation to regulate its budgets because those variations cerunequivocal tainly are likely to happen. The relevant Act will be amended so that the annual reports andfinancialstatements of the will Corporation will be based on a calendar year instead of afinancialyear. That is a good idea. It it is more appropriate to have this done on the basis of a calendar year because of the time at fundsflowto the Corporation under this levy scheme. It is very important that we note industry. The that when a proposal of this kind went before the previous Government the idea was for the Corporation to befinancedfrom the proceeds of a an acreage or hectare basis. The honourmember for Fraser confirmed what I am As I have mentioned before, and I want to emphasise it again, that was a very distinct disadvantage to those areas which, while being capable of having a viable industry, had to the problem of not being able to produce the same amount per hectare. We believe the present proposal is an equitable basis for the One very important factor which must be conand which will be beneficial, despite what has been said to the contrary, to returns for fruit exported from Australia is the recent devaluation of the Australian currency. Obviously the devaluation decision will substantiaUy benefit people exporting fruit. If we are to mainin tain a stable apple industry in this country we must continue to enable our fruit exporters to the traditional export markets. We also to try to budd new markets and I hope the Apple and Pear Corporation will be successful in doing so. There is no doubt that the devaluation of the Australian dollar will greatly assist those people, particularly traditional exporters of fruit. This applies particularly to Tasmania. I hope that the Tasmanian growers are listening to I have to say and I hope they will remember this during the current election campaign in State. The apple and pear industry is very important to a number of electorates throughout Australia. If it were not for the fact that we are hoping able to get through the legislative program Thursday of next week more honourable memmy bers would have put their names on the list of speakers for this debate. I made a note of a members of my own Party who would have spoken. They are the honourable member for Calare (Mr MACKenzie), the honourable memproximately ber for Hume (Mr Lusher), the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and the honourlike able member for Riverina (Mr SuUivan). All those honourable members from my Party alone would have liked to have spoken in this debate. We thought we would be only allowed one speaker and what I am saying reflects their views to a large extent. They are concerned about welfare of the industry. I have no doubt that applies also to my colleagues from Tasmania. They would have been anxious to support these BUls, as they were supported so splendidly by honourable member for Franklin (Mr consider. Good luck). While honourable members from Tasmania were not allowed the number of the speakers that they would have liked in this bate they can take some consolation from the splendid effort of the honourable member for FrankUn. I commend him on his address. Although I may not always agree with the ideas of honourable members from other States when we are trying to solve a problem of this kind, the real way to tackle a national problem to look at it from the points of view necessary arrive at a program or a pohcy which will give the greatest national advantage. We must always remember that in this national Parliament. I It recognise the importance of the apple industry Tasmania and the effect that it has on the omy of that State in comparison with other States. I must take up one point with the honourdrink, able member for Fraser. He said that New South Wales apples could be sold in New South Wales but Tasmanians could not seU their apples as well to the Tasmanian people. I suggest that he overlooked the populations of the 2 States. He did not take that factor into consideration. should be fair. He did not consider the number people to whom the apples could be sold. can sell only a certain number of apples to a certain number of people, no matter how much they might Uke to eat them. If we had the relevant figures we mightfindthat Tasmanians eat as what many or more apples than the people of New South Wales on a per capita basis. My honourthat able friends from Tasmania would agree. A great deal of work has to be done by the Apple and Pear Corporation. AddedfinancewUl be avaUable to it for research and other purposes to be which were mentioned by my colleague the by honourable member for Franklin. However in opinion its important role, its prime objective, should be sales promotion. Let us consider few the situation in roundfigures.If the Australian demand approximates IS million bushels or thereabouts-o n the average we export ap4.S million to S million bushels-and we increase domestic consumption by something 10 per cent and another l.S million apples are absorbed by the domestic market, we will substantially reduce the percentage of apples that have to be exported. This would give people dependent on exports a better opportunity to choose better markets and they would not have the to contend with so many apples. More apples that could be absorbed on our mainland markets. There are many aspects of this industry that the the Apple and Pear Corporation will have to Another aspect worthy of mention in connection with the apple and pear industry is processing and selling of apple juice. In my deown area the people of Stanthorpe have endeavoured, to their credit, to provide a juice production plant. One of the reasons is the haUstorms which hit the area. They spoU the fruit to the extent that it cannot be put on the fresh fruit market, but it is excellent fruit. It could be processed into juice. It would be a very healthgiving food. Scientists from the Commonwealth is Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to have developed a formula which they hope will make apple juice more popular as a fresh fruit juice. This is something at which we should look. is one way by which the products of this industo try could be diversified. Fruit which otherwise econmight not be made avaUable to the community or utilised economically could by utilised. The which could be appearing this winter, has a specialflavour.It will not have a sweet flavour, which is common to many apple juice drinks and of which people are not so fond. At least they will have the option of having either kind of drink. That would be a very good aid to sales for those We people who are producing apple juice. The forof mula was developed by Sydney based scientists You of the Food Research Division of CSIRO. It shows what can be done. I beheve that this something which we should follow up and which the Government should encourage to the maxiand pear BUls. mum extent. I am the only speaker from this little corner. is not always talked about in a complimentary fashion, but it is an effective corner. It has grand job for the national Parliament and Australia generally. If I take than I usually do, I feel justified because performance of members from this corner. I lect know that my colleagues are in accord with me on many of the things that I am saying. We want to promote the sales of fresh fruit and of apple juice in Australia. We want to look at our export markets and to do everything we can to assist industry, which is a valuable one and which, it must be borne in mind, provides a very healthy food for this nation and for those people to whom we export. The old saying 'an apple a day keeps the doctor away' has a very sound basis truth because an apple is such a health-giving food. We need to remember that. I hope the traUan people will take this opportunity to the fruit on our domestic market. I regret that sometimes the cost of fruit in areas is higher than I think it ought to be. Howous ever, transport costs are heavy. I think we look at a means of providing this health-giving food, fruit-apple s and pears in particular-t the consumers in this nadon at a cheaper rate that the families, the chUdren in particular, can enjoy and benefit from the fruit avaUable to them. I commend the Government and the Apple and Pear Growers Association, which has advised the Government in relation to many of these areas, on the results they have achieved. believe that the approach now being made could bring worthwhile results to the apple and pear industry of Australia. Along with representatives of other apple growing areas throughout Australia, I wish the Corporation every success its endeavours to increase the sale of and to improve the distribution of the Australian apple and pear crop, not only for the benefit of those people who are producing the apples and pears but also for the benefit of consumers in this country. Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) very surprised to hear the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) refer to some uncompUmentary remarks that are made about debated the corner from which he is speaking. I assure him that there are very Uttle grounds for his doing. It is not the Opposition that leaves him on is his own. Members of his Party have left him there tonight on his own to defend these apple Mr Armitage-Not one of them is there. It Mr FITZPATRICK - Not one of them is there. I was very surprised to hear him criticise the ideas done a of the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fife) for on the method that should be used to collect a little more time these levies. of the Mr Corbett-You would not know how to colthem, either.",99
218,Mr FITZPATRICK,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL,"I have had more experience collecting levies than probably anyone in this House. As Secretary of the Barrier Industrial this Council I have collected thousands and thousands of doUars in levies. I assure the honourable member that everyone paid. In Broken Hill people are not very concerned about the method of collecting the levy, but they are concerned inabout the purpose of the levy and the way the money is spent once it is coUected. I believe this Ausevening the House should be more concerned buy about that than about the method of coUecting the levy. some It has already been pointed out that the variBUls are legislative proposals to give effect to should the recommendations of the Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association for a renewed o basis of financing activities of the Australian so Apple and Pear Corporation, that it is intended to do so by the imposition and collection of levies on the production and sale of apples and pears in Australia and by a charge on apples and pears exported from Australia. When the Corporation took over from its predecessor, the Australian Apple and Pear Board- a Bill was presented to this House in November 1973 for the establishI ment of the Apple and Pear Corporation-it was made clear that financing through the export charge would be only an interim measure. I recall that at thattimeit was considered that poncing the coUection of a levy on all apples and in pears produced and sold would present great difficulties because of the high percentage of fruit disposed of through undocumented or cash sales in some of the major producing States and that these sales lend themselves to an easy evasion of the levy and require a disproportionate effort to poUce. The honourable member for Fraser has already pointed out some of the problems con(9.55)- I was nected with that. When the Bill to set up the Corporation was it was pointed out that some of the fruit growers were unable to put their fruit on the so export market because they knew that if they did their fruit would be sold at a loss, and they could not afford to pay for the picking and the freightCommunity, costs to send the fruit away. Therefore, as the honourable member for Fraser said, a good dealby of fruit was sold at the orchard. Some of it, were told, was sold already on the trees. Buyerseconomic would buy the full crop and would pick the fruitpled themselves. I am not too sure that some of these problems will not be still with us once these are passed. However, it was pleasing to hear Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair), his second reading speech, say that there place in Australian horticulture for a viable apple and pear industry and that these BUls wereBut designed to ensure afirmfinancialbase for the Apple and Pear Corporation. No doubt adjob? ditional funds placed at the disposal of the Corfacing poration, as provided by these new levy arrange-has ments, will enable it to make a more positive contribution to market development. However, it must be obvious to all who studied these Bills and who have given consideration to the apple and pear industry that In thisfinancewUl have to be provided by near summary bankrupt producers. They are the ones who wUlimbalance have to provide these additional funds that be placed at the disposal of the Corporation. Therefore it is hoped that the Corporation wiU year have some success in its marketing development. resulted However, from reading the various reports, it issales. However, clear that many of the producers do not expect toparticularly remain in the industry to enjoy the increased a distinct marketing opportunities, if they are obtained by the the Corporation, unless they are given some increased other form of assistance. From and reading of various reports dealing with the whole industry, including the report of the Ausmission, tralian Apple and Pear Corporation, I believe tions that very Uttle can be achieved to bring about a general viable apple and pear industry merely by chang-try; ing the basis of collecting the levy on apples andation, pears from a system of deriving funds from a Association, charge on apple and pear exports to a system based on a levy on the quantity of fruit marketed The in Australia and overseas. When the Bill to estabUsh the Apple and PearcUne will further Corporation was introduced in 1973, it was Goulburn pointed out thatfinancingthrough export charges was an interim measure only which was to be replaced by a broaderfinancialbase for Corporation through a levy on all apples and pears. However, it was pointed out further that apple and pear producers would not their presentfinancialpredicament merely by forming the Apple and Pear Corporation. At time, apple and pear producers were facing grave economic problems brought about by Britain's entry into the European Economic put and rising costs, especiaUy freight costs. A proper solution could be achieved only tadoring the quaUty and quantity of the fruit we to the market outlets and by introducing the most techniques and practices. It was couwith these proposals only that a highly skUled, effective and nationally organised body Billscould come to grips with the marketing problem. the We all hope that the extrafinanceprovided by in the growers through these levies will allow the is a Apple and Pear Corporation to play a more meaningful role in obtaining marketing outlets. we should be asking ourselves: Are we giving the Apple and Pear Corporation an impossible In 1973, the apple and pear industry was a very bleak future. What kind of a future the industry today? We need only to turn to page 3 of the report for 1975-76 of the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation to decide that point. have Under the heading 'Assessment of Overall some Industry Position', the report states: its First Report (1974-75), the Corporation provided a of the industry's basic problems, emphasising the between current levels of production and the opportunities for economic disposal through export outlets, are todomestic fresh consumption and processing. The 1976 apple season has been characterised by 'off production, particularly in Victoria and NSW. This has in an overall improvement in prices for fresh local despite substantially lower export quantities, to UK/Europe, returns from major overseas markets have been most disappointing and in fact represent deterioration compared with last year's results. In processing field, there has been little improvement in demand for solid pack apples althought the prospects for consumption of juices (single strength) and cider my observations appear brighter. The recommendations of the Industries Assistance Comwhich amount to a virtual phasing out of large secof apple growers, added a further dimension to the pessimism and uncertainty prevailing in the indushowever, there have been widespread and strongly based objections to the Commission'sfindings.The Corportogether with the Australian Apple and Pear Growers has made detailed submissions to the Government regarding the industry's future. fresh pear industry, which in recent years has enjoyed reasonable returns from export markets, suffered a setback in 1976, particularly in North America and Britain. This deaggravate the position of growers in the Valley, already suffering the effects of problems in the canned fruits industry. From reading that report one can conclude that the the future of the apple and pear industry does not look very bright. We might well wonder: Is it a fact that we are giving the Apple and Pear Corget out of poration an impossible job? The recommendation of the Industries Assistthatance Commission on the phasing out of many apple growers has only convinced the producer that this Government wiU not do much except those in the industry on the skids and get rid of them. I remember when Mr Duthie, the prewhere vious member of Wilmot, used to speak on this legislation in this House. Members of the Liberal and National Country Parties often used to tell us what they would do when they were again Government. I say tonight that there is certainly a big gap between their promises and their formance. Even now, Government members instead of searching for an answer to many of problems of our primary industry are trying escape all blame by claiming that the present situation was caused by the previous Labor Government. It seems strange to me that should do this. We all know that the Labor Party had to fight 3 elections in 3 years and that progressive legislation of the Labor Government was held up in the Senate. The producer is entitled to know how long Government will hide behind the old dodge that the present situation was caused by the Labor Government. Surely 12 months in office is long enough to produce something positive instead continuing to knock more and more industries out of acuon. Surely 12 months in office is long enough for the Government to produce someI thing more than a reduction in everyone's ings by 17'/2 per cent and an increase in the rate to provide for a national health scheme. Surely 12 months in office is long enough to duce something other than a record number of persons unemployed. There certainly is a big gap between the promises and performance of the Liberal-National Country Party. It is not always the fault the day that some sections of our economy are facing a crisis. I believe that it is the duty of us to try to come together and tofinda way out of these problems. It is not much good if Government continues to blame previous governments for what is taking place. What we should be looking at is a way tofindbetter marindustry kets, to achieve better overseas prices and to really help the industry. What this country needs is a government that has the courage to take positive role, not a government that takes the negative stance that present problems were ation. caused by some previous government. I am prepared to admit that adjustments are necessary. What we must guard against is the destruction of sections of the industry which have a long-term future beyond the existing adjustbe ment period. I point out that it takes time and perience to grow apples and pears and to get the expertise to prepare and to market them. Tree pulls should be carried out in selected areas there is no possibility of a return to viability in the long term. In the meantime, the Opposition supports the Bills presently before the House as there is no doubt that spreading the in levy over the whole production and sale of apples-sale s in Australia and export sales-is the permost equitable method of collecting the levy.",101
219,Mr GILES,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL," I hope that it is the not the kiss of death to the honourable member to for Darling (Mr FitzPatrick) or to the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) when I say sincerely that we on this side of the House are they appreciative of the amount of work and constructive effort that they put into their all thespeeches on industries such as horticulture. Sometimes a good thing goes a little bit too long when there are one or two other speakers each waiting to speak for 5 minutes. I know that the the honourable member for Darling would never have transgressed on that if he had realised the position. I am not going to refer tonight to his devastating attack on the Government because of there would be little point in it. The apple growers know the answers better than the honourable member for Darling in this instance. say that in the nicest possible way. I have sat savand listened to the honourable member for tax Fraser (Mr Fry) on 3 occasions this session. He has really studied his work and has tried to proproduce a constructive and logical argument. I for one, regardless of others, appreciate it because he works on his contributions and I acknowledge it. I will refer later to a minor disagreement which I have with the honourable member, but as far as I am concerned that will be nothing but of the Government of constructive. all of What I wish to say tonight will be brief and disjointed because I want to try to leave some the time for my colleague the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Drummond) to speak tonight. Firstly, I want to congratulate the apple and pear on attempting to put its own house in order. This is an industry that can probably less afford to do so than any other primary industry a of which I can think. Yet it is determined to do this and to pay levies to support its own corporI think that this is thefirstthing that the House wants to note in relation to this Bill. If I might get parochial, I have 2 things to say in a few sentences. First of all, I thought the House would Uke to know that out of the 9 members appointed to the Corporation there is yet to one appointed from South Australia. South exAustralians have been appointed to the position of president of the Apple and Pear Association. They have been men of great stature. I believe only that in the future a South Australian deserves some consideration in the making of appointto ments to the Apple and Pear Corporation. South Australia is only a small State in terms of apple growing. We have much competence in the field.which I want to draw attention to the fact that we not have representation on the Corporation. would be sUly if I did not say that of course parochialism has no part in the composition of corporations. If the Government has the comterribly mon sense that it deserves it should look across the Australian scene and obtain the best people that the industry can muster. I have suffered here in sUence for 2 months. have heard Tasmanians say that they have the best quaUty apples in Australia. I have heard same story from members from New South isolated Wales. I have even heard mutters from memberswhat from Victoria. Of course, if honourable members Uke to look at the facts they will see that South Australian apples have always had a premium on the United Kingdom market, way above that of the apples from the other States. The we have had the sense to withdraw from that export trade is another matter again. But I think the principle still appUes. Those are my 2 before parochial comments in relation to the industry.",103
220,Mr YATES,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL,They are good ones.,104
221,Mr GILES,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL,"I think they contain a certain amount of truth to back up my contention. The other thing I would Uke to say is that I think totaUy unfair for the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating)- I think occasion on which he has done for the Opposition in a debate on a rural ter-to attack the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair). He did it again tonight by saying that the Minister had never been to an apple impose growing area. This is patendy absurd. If one appens to produce pUed the argument to the honourable member way, to be high quaUty for Blaxland it might have some merit. But I hapfore be on the side of efficiency. pen to know that the Mmister was in the apple of the situation was that Queensland growing area of New South Wales last weekend. He has been with me into apple growing areas of won the argument? That is the next point.it It South Australia. He has probably been in many other apple growing areas as well. There are basis times, as the honourable member for Darling said, when members of Parliament have to get together for the sake of an industry and for the sake of rational thinking. On such occasions they need to chuck away stupid remarks that cannot be sustantiated by fact. The honourable member for Blaxland, of has course, took the side of the Industries Assistance Commission. He did not stop to recognise the fact that the Government did not accept the advice of the IAC, and that is terribly important Tasmania. In fact, it refused the advice in relation to government subvention on risk fruit. This appUes not to fruit exported to the Asian market, is dealt with on a contract basis, but to risk do shipments to European ports. The Government I today introduced the total readjustment plan State which wdl not be lost on those smaller fruit growers who are feeling the pinch. If I might be poUte, they are feeling the pinch because of undue cost in-puts visited on them by the previous Government. I do not think that is a poltiical point and I do not wish it to be. But if one looks at thefiguresand the graphs I do not think I that one can run away from that proposition. Therefore, the second thing that this Govern the ment has done, in addition to introducing the tree puU scheme, the dairy scheme and have you, is to introduce a total readjustment program that will aUow such new matters as household support to apply. One can rant and rave-this is largely the job of an Oppositionmat the Government is doing nothing. But the fact that facts rather beUe that contention. I think that in the few minutes that I have left I allow my colleague to have his fair share of thetimethat is avaUable I should comment on what was said by the honourable member for Fraser. He made a point that the area method of assessing the levies was the proper method. Contrary to what was said by the honourable memit is ber for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) I accept in principle exacdy what the honourable member for this is the third Fraser stated. so when leading Mr Fry-Hear , hear! mat Mr GILES-Exacdy. To do anything else does not encourage efficiency. After aU if we were to same the levy on a low production area on the basis as we impose it on an area that hapmore apples that tend, by the apples, we would thereThe big tragedy in this case is said to have won the argument. Should have assessed that if the levy is imposed on an areais in 1976 it will cost $200,000 to coUect $ 1 m. I might quickly say that a rough estimate of coUecting it on a production basis through very few sources is 5 per cent of $lm and not 20 per cent, which unfortunately would be the case if one stuck to the principle of levying on an area basis. If one collects the levy on an area basis one problems with the definition of the leviable land. It is all very well saying that one can sit up in a chopper and work it out on a map. But how does one teU what crop is bearing? How does one teU what crop has a disease and will not bear? How does one tell from the air what crop is a levy suffering from drought? How does one tell what and crop, due to a good season, is yielding higher than another one? There is also the problem of the exact to measurement of the viable land. culate the deductions. There are deductions to hardship that would make it difficult to levy a productive basis. There may also be claims for remission of levies as a result of crop fadure, general hardship, low returns and other matters that I have already mentioned. The big problem of levying on a per acreage basis is this: have 7000 apple growers to levy, all of which have to be contacted individually. One does have anything like that same picture when one looks at the other method that the Government has adopted. I repeat the fact that about 5 per cent of the $lm levy will be spent to collect levy under the method the Government has now adopted. There are various aspects about which one could talk in relation to the method of raising levy. I do not accept what the honourable memfinance ber for Maranoa has said. From memory I think he said that to impose the levy per production unit is the correct and the most efficient method. It is the most economic but it does not encourage efficiency of production. To that extent I am the side of the honourable member for Fraser. am just sorry that the method which the industry wishes to use to collect the levy is such a totally uneconomic one. I would have liked to have mentioned many other things. However, will not allow me to do so. I support the Bill and I hope that the couple of isolated remarks that have put forward will be helpful to the debate.",104
222,Mr DRUMMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL,"The that purpose of these Bills is tofinancethe Apple Pear Corporation. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) in his second reading speech said: These legislative proposals tions of the Australian Apple and Pear Growers' Association for a new basis of financing the activities of the Apple and Pear Corporation. Much has been said about the method of collecexporting tion of fees. I know that I have only a few ments in which to speak. I will slide over many things which I would have liked to have said night. Much has been said about deficiencies the method of collecting this levy. It must be called that again in the Minister's second reading speech he stated: Honourable members may recall that proposals were fore the Parliament, at thetimeofthe year, for the Corporation to be financed from the proceeds on bearing areas of apple and pear trees. The apple pear growing industry, having reconsidered this proposalThis is the industry itselfhas confirmed its original view that it would prefer the levy be based on the quantity of fruit marketed, both in One has to calAustralia and overseas. due I agree with the honourable member for Angas on (Mr Giles). I recognise that there wdl be difficulties in the method of collection. But I believe that this is the most equitable method by which the levy can be collected. Nothing need last forever. If this system proves to be inefficient maybe the One may Government, which has been guided by the industry in the decisions which it has taken not regarding the raising of this levy, can have another look at the matter. There is no reason why it cannot, although I appreciate that there will be difficulties. But once again I point out that the the Government had been guided by the industry in this matter. Much has been said about the new Corporation, the members on it, and their expertise. One must remember that this is a new the corporation. I think the proposals before us to the Corporation are more equitable and that they will lead to a sufficiency of money for that Corporation. This should lead to a noticeable marketing benefit. The extra funds will allow the Corporation to put the necessary effort on into seeking and developmg new markets overI seas. Areas such as South East Asia undoubtedly hold the key to the industry's future and to its future viability in the export field. The extra funds wdl allow it seriously to budd up the protime fitable home market for thefirsttime. We all wish the apple industry of Australia a I prosperous future. But we all must recognise the difficulties which confront it. I also say tonight many growers in Western Australia feel that and while the Government has been guided by the Australian Apple and Pear Growers' Association, they feel isolated from the Corporation. They believe that they should be under great give effect to the recommendascrutiny in the next year or so to see that they are carrying out a worthwhUe endeavour. The levy Australian which has been imposed may not seem Uke a lot of money but it must be remembered that the States of Western Australia and Tasmomania basicaUy carried the old Australian Apple and Pear Board in years gone by. Tbis is a more toequitable system but they are the States which in wdl keep the apple industry- I speak mainly of reapples because that is my concern-o n a proper footing. If the apple export industry of Australia fads the rest of the apple industry in Australia must faU. Some concern has also been expressed bein my State of Western Australia. I have brought double dissolution last of this to the attention of the Government before and I do so now. Tbis concern comes from the Chamber of Fruit and Vegetable Industries of Western Australia. In a part of its letter it states: While the proposed collection process will not involve the grower or the Corporation in munity borne initially by agents and merchants indeed and entirely out of proportion to the revenue raised. Collection of the levy on each counting for it and the remittance of the funds must, of necessity, be cosdy. I realise that my time has come to an end. I flag those 2 warriings to the Government. I have done so on other occasions. I take this opportunity to say again that we must keep the new structure under closer scrutiny. We must be prepared to look at the method of collection of levies tp see that it is equitable, that it does work and that it is practical. Question resolved in the affirmative.

223,Mr STEWART,ADJOURNMENT,"On 18 November, 30 November and 1 December I presented to the House of Representatives petitions Third Reading which read: That, pending the increase or redistribution of funds in a more equitable manner as per section 3.6 of the Report of the Australian Schools Commission 1977-79, emergency interim Australian Government financial assistance be offered to those NSW Catholic schools, with large numbers of students of migrant background, that had anticipated assistance for 1977 as per precedents established in previous years. The signatures had been organised by the Parents and Friends Association and the Mothers Auxiliary of St John's College, Lakemba, which is in my electorate of Lang, at the request of Rev. Brother Luke, the headmaster of that college. Brother Luke had become alarmed at a reduction in funds from the Catholic Education Office in Sydney, which meant a reduction in English as second-language teachers at St John's from three to two. As well as organising the petitions which I presented-the y contained thousands of signatures-Brothe r Luke wrote to me on 23 November detailing the problems being faced at St John's. I intend to give some details of the information which Brother Luke forwarded to me in his letter. I have discussed the matter with the Minister representing the Minister for Education in this House. I have given a copy of the letter to the Mmister for Education (Senator Carriek) and a copy to the Minister representing him. I seek leave to have the letter incorporated in Hansard. Permission for the incorporation was given by the Minister representing the Minister for Education.",106
224,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. The letter read asfollowsThe Hon. F. E. Stewart, M.P., Shop 2, The Boulevarde, LAKEMBA. Dear Mr Stewart, On the 1st October, 1976,1 was advised by Miss Catherine Duncan, Co-ordinator, Catholic Child Migrant Education, Catholic Education Office, Sydney, that for 1977 our ""English as a Second Language"" (E.S.L.) teachers were to be reduced in number from three to two. This reduction was caused by a shortage in Government Funding. A copy of Miss Duncan's letter is attached. This advice caused me grave concern and I made immediate representations to the Catholic Education Office for a reconsideration of the decision. My request was rejected. A copy of the reply is enclosed. You will note from the letter that Catholic Schools in N.S.W. are funded for 174 E.S.L. of 66 students per teacher. It could not be held that this is a satisfactory position. So great became my concern that, in co-operaton with our Parents and Friends' Association and Mothers' Auxiliary, I organised the circulation of a Petition calling on the Federal Government to offer immediate interim financial assistance to Catholic Schools in N.S.W. Some of these completed petitions have been forwarded to you and I trust you will take the necessaiy action to present them to the House of Representatives. Whilst I appreciate thatfinancialresources of the Commonwealth do not come from a ""bottomless pit"", I firmly believe that value for money can be better achieved by a more careful ordering of priorities for the allocation of funds. Teacher Inservice, innovations, experimentations etc. are far less important than the essential staffing of schools. The provision of funds to pay the salaries of essential teaching staff should take priority over all educational funding. Despite Government funding, and fbr this all at St John's are extremely grateful, our annual deficits for the last three years are as follows:1973-S33.863 1974-564,346 1975-552,416 I shudder to think of our impending deficit for 1976. St John's College is understaffed and ill-equipped in comparison with the average Government School. We function without an Administration Block, operating from two inconveniently placed offices in separate buildings. The Schools Commission is well aware of our problems. There are in the school 622 pupils. On a count taken last week, these included 405 students representing 34 different national cultures, 65 per cent of the total school population. They are listed as follows:Secondary Primary Total Lebanon . . . 95 59 154 Mauritius . . 13 16 29 Italy . . . . 71 36 107 Malta . . . . 9 7 16 Egypt . . . . 3 2 5 Poland . . . 5 2 7 Holland . . . 1 1 ST.

I enclose two tables indicating the comparison of reading ages of our pupils compared with their chronological ages. Tne testing was carried out in mid-year 1975. With reference to the table, one-third of the pupils in the school had reading ages more than two (2) years below their chronological ages. The lower years in the school have a higher percentage of migrants and are in greater need of the help available from ESL teachers handling smaller groups. Unfortunately, I have nofiguresavailable on years 5 and 6, 1975. My concern is increased by the knowledge that thousands of migrant families live in this area. Our feeder schools, extending from Campsie to Punchbowl, are in areas of high migrant settlement. Indications are that the migrant population in these areas will increase in the year ahead. At the present time, I am receiving one application per week for enrolment at St John's for migrant chddren in Australia. Our external examination results over the years year's gradings on the State-wide Reference Tests better than average, due in no small measure to the our dedicated staff, to our ESL program and reading schemes, to our organised seminars, the school, its good morale etc A wonderful community spirit exists in the school. There is not the slightest hint of racial problems and all proud of what is being achieved. I am attaching several reports summarising the this year, by our ESL teachers. It is a great pity that a school like ours cannot Industrial Arts Block where slow pupils could get sonal satisfaction and be given a better preparation They cannot enjoy satisfying manual skills such as metalwork, woodwork etc We have not the money to provide these types of rooms and this type of equipment. I am enclosing a School Information Booklet and year's Annual Report for your information. As you well know, Frank, St John's, despite its advantages is highly regarded in the community. Our are often commended on theirfinebehaviour and manner dress. We concentrate on the teaching of the three 'R's'-a we must, given the heterogeneous nature of our school population-bu t we also insist that our pupils learn finer things of life. We try to inculcate into every manners, respectfulness and a regard for discipline. them opportunities to engage in healthy outdoor exercise and excursions, and encourage them to participate in many cultural, social, academic and sporting activities. Our aim at St John's is to allow every boy to utmost use of his intellectual and physical attributes. However, our efforts must continue to be hindered we can employ qualified teachers in essential areas teachers are by far the most important, at this stage, boy at St John's is to be given anywhere near equality cational opportunity. Without ESL groups, our English classes average out at thirty-five (35) throughout the school. The provision of three (3) ESL Primary Total teachers reduces the average number in English classes from year 5 to year 8 to twenty (20) pupils per class. 1 3 You can see that I am alarmed at the loss of one ESL 1 teacher from St John's for 1977 and earnestly request you to 2 bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Education, Senator the Hon. J. L. Carriek. My concern is 13 32 increased by the fear that 1977 will bring a further reduction in ESL staffing. Do you think it would be possible for the Deputy Principal and myself to meet with the Minister or one of his senior officers to discuss(1) the provision of ESL teachers, (2) the granting of special assistance for the provision of an Industnal Arts Block, (3) the introduction of the teaching of the Arabic language as an elective subject, and (4) our need for special assistance as a disadvantaged school. I shall be pleased to hear from you on this matter. Yours sincerely, Brother G.LUKE, FSC, ARMIT, MACE, Headmaster",107
225,Mr STEWART,ADJOURNMENT,"S t John's College at Lakemba has 623 students in years 5 to 10 or, in arriving old fashioned language, from fourth class to fourth form. Of those boys 405 come from 34 and this different countries, 373 of those boys come from have been 29 non-English speaking countries and 32 come work of from 5 English speaking countries. Without the ESL teachers-Englis h as a second language to the spirit of study in teachers-the average numbers in English classes in years 5 to 8 increases from 20 pupils to 35 are very pupils. Brother Luke advises me that he is now receiving one application a week for the enrolwork done ment of migrant children, mainly in the lower classes and mainly involving newly arrived provide an migrants. This is before the enrolments for 1977 some perhave really opened. So Brother Luke can look for life. forward to having a large increase in the number of migrant children attending St John's College at Lakemba.

227,Mr MARTYR,ADJOURNMENT,"That is the voice of experience. No one in this chamber would be surprised to hear the nonsense which the honourable member for Chifley speaks, but I will not say much about that tonight. I regret that the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) is not here because limited-o n his own admission last Tuesday night-and good-natured as I know he is, he could not grasp the central thesis of the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) last Tuesday night. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro presented a proper concern about the deterioration of Uteracy and numeracy in Australian schools. He cited the report of the Australian Council for Educational Research which showed that such deterioration was factual. On the other hand, the honourable member for Burke obviously considers that teaching the art of street demonstrations is much superior to teaching the basic skills of counting and sentence-construction.",109
228,Mr SCHOLES,ADJOURNMENT,"You are misrepresenting him, are you not?",109
229,Mr MARTYR,ADJOURNMENT,"That is what he said last Tuesday night. I want to support the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and relate some American experiences which seem to me to be directly related to the Australian situation. ActuaUy there is not a great deal of difference. Nearly half of the entering class at the University of California at Berkeley, a fairly selective school which takes only the top eighth of California high school graduates, faded placement exams and had to be enroUed in remedial composition courses. AppUcants to journalism programs at Wisconsin, Minnesota, Texas and North Carolina flunked basic spelling, punctuation and usage tests at rates that varied between 30 per cent and SO per cent. A survey by the Associauon of American Publishers showed that first year university students really do read on what used to be considered just a high school level. American students are not learning to write because nobody is bothering to teach them how. Like many other bureaucracies the United States universities have become in large measure ingrown, so self-contained that most of their faculties believe, without even pausing to think about it, that what is good for them is good for the culture at large. In English departments, where one would expect a concern for Uteracy to be located, the attitude of self-interest appears be aU but universal. Far from resisting the general dissolution, English professors as a group pay almost no attention at aU to such mundane topics as Uterate writing. This will not reaUy concern the honourable member for Chifley, so he can go back to sleep. The business of the American English department is not the teaching of Uteracy; it is the worship of literature. An American professor, Gene Lyons, said that after 8 years' experience as a student and seven more as a faculty member at five State universities, every day he was more astonished by the increasing distance between most English departments and the everyday concerns of the society that pays their bills. So accustomed have they become to thinking of themselves as the very vanguard, if not the salvation, of Western culture, that the average member of 'The Profession', as it likes to caU itself, believes that society exists to serve Uterary scholarship rather than the other way round. What he was saying appUed in varying degrees to almost every academic discipUne that he knew anything about, particularly those in the humanities, arts and social sciences. As things stand now, it is rare to find more than half a dozen college students in the United States out of a class of twenty-five who say that they were given regular instruction in writing in secondary school. The more perceptive students see teachers like this less as dedicated practitioners of their disciplines than as persons whose good fortune it has been to convince the government or the trustees of schools to underwrite their hobbies. What students are learning from such teachers is that learning to write is simply not very important. That is the sort of thing that we as taxpayers have had to put up with in this country for many years, particularly during the last 3 years, when every crackpot who wanted to announce himself as a sociologist was able to give advice to students, to go into the streets and demonstrate and not worry about the basic skills which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro spoke about last Tuesday.",109

231,Mr LES JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Hughes) (10.39)Yesterday the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was good enough to reply to a question which I had placed on the parliamentary notice paper and which was headed 'Australian National Gallery: Loan of Paintings to Governor General'. In his reply the Prime Minister provided information about the paintings to and other works of art which have been made avaUable to the present Governor General in the short period in which he has been in office. It very plain from the answer that was given that the Governor General is monopolising works art from the Australian National Gallery which should be available for the enjoyment of the Australian community. Since Sir John took office the number of paintings loaned to Yarralumla has more than doubled. Information provided by the Prime Minister in yesterday's Hansard shows that some of Australia's most valuable art treasures are included in the 69 paintings and Aboriginal paintings now on loan to Governpeople ment House. The works include paintings by Arthur Boyd entitled 'The Rabbiter', ""The Valthings in Ufe. ley', 'Unicorn and Figure in a Tree', and 'Rosebud Landscape'. They include the famous work of art by William Dobell, 'Regent's Park Lonevening don', and the Russell Drysdale paintings 'Halfagainst caste Woman' and 'Country Boy' and others. Also contained in the collection is Sidney Nolan's 'Death of Sergeant Kennedy at Strintremist gy bark Creek'. It is a marvellous list. I do not blame the Governor General for wanting to have these paintings displayed in his residence. But there are 69 treasures of Australia's art collection there. In addition, the Government House collecexists. tion includes at least 11 ceramics, 4 pieces of sculpture and 2 tapestries, all acquired during His Excellency's period of office. Moderate utilisfence ation would be accepted as reasonable but I discrimination. regard this over-indulgence as reprehensible. It would be more in keeping with the role of the point National Gallery to put this unique collection on What of circuit as was done with 'Blue Poles'. The tion should be put into the universities of Australia, into the colleges of advanced education, into the art galleries in the great the country towns and the provincial cities and in civic centres and art galleries all around Australia to let the people who paid for them draw some inspiration from them. I do not want to quesdon the need for works art to be displayed at Government House. I Palmer, reaUse that His ExceUency's wife has a great preciation of art and is very actively involved this area. But one can engage in excesses. I do know the value of these works of art because the Prime Minister declined to answer that part my question. It could well be that works of art worth milkons of dollars have accumulated at Government House. I regard that as unreasontinguished able. The entire community would benefit if the collection was exhibited on a circulating basis to the places that I have mentioned. I have no doubt that the Prime Minister's refusal to provide information about the value is this Yarralumla coUection is an indication of his embarrassment. Even to cite original acquisition of costs, as could easUy have been done, would have shown that the Governor General is wallowing in a luxurious art arsenalrivalledonly by a handful of eccentric millionaire art coUectors of international notoriety. I put it to the Prime Minister that the Government has a responsibility to take action and to Umit the degree of luxury enjoyed by the Governor General in this regard. 3 These works or art should be placed among the of Australia, among the young students who also have an appreciation of the aesthetic",109

She undertook various interviews, auditions and tests associated of with this appUcation and, according to the officers involved, she passed these tests with flying colours. In fact, she looked set for a dismusical career in the Army. Then, 2 days before her final medical test the Adelaide recruiting office was advised by the authorities in Canberra that they were not taking women into the band corps and her appUcation was therefore of refused. However, subsequent advertisements showed that the band corps was still recruiting men to this sphere of activity. The Mmister advised me in July that a review of the employment of women in the armed forces was being undertaken with the aim of evolving common corps for each Service with like concause ditions and responsibility for male and female members. The aim was to redress areas identified as discriminatory to women. The Minister that he was awaiting advice on the implementation of an effective program to bring about aim. Of course, it was necessary to phase this gram in because of practical problems, such accommodation, changes to Service regulations, training requirementss and the primary and ondary combatant roles of various employment categories. The Minister's answer to a question from the honourable member for Bungey) a fortnight ago indicates that this review is still going on some 6 months after raised the matter with him. It would seem that the Department is a little tardy in completing its review and coming forwere ward with appropriate advice on which the Minthe ister could act in this matter. Women are already employed in the Army in at least 14 areas-i survey trades, signal trades, as linguists, in transport trades, in the nursing corps, in the deninterested tal area, in the ordinance trades, in catering, military police, psychologists, publication illussaid trators, physical training instructors, as quarterexpected masters and air traffic controllers. There would therefore seem to be no justifiable reason for cluding women from the army band corps. Paratives graph 15 of chapter 5 of the Defence White Paper recently tabled in this House states that the Government intends that women in the Seristers vices should now have greater job opportunities and closer equality with men in training ditions of service. It was also accepted that women would be permitted to serve in areas where hostilities were in progress but that they would not be employed as combatants or at sea. With regard to the last point it could well said that the distinction between combatant non-combatant roles is blurred technology in modern warfare. Certainly, the Army band corps must be accepted as a nonwant combatant role and should therefore be open to women. Opportunities for women in the Australian Army are severely restricted by comparison with the United States Army where, of course, President Ford in October signed authorising women to attend Service academies, and that was a major step forward. Women hold senior positionsrightthrough the Armed forces in that country. I therefore urge the Minister have this review of women's role in the Army completed as quickly as possible and to implement policies which will broaden opportunities for women in the armed forces. Particularly as a Liberal I would urge him to do so beI believe that we, as a Liberal Government, should support therightsof individuals to have their opportunities expanded to undertake said a career of their choice.",110
236,Mr KEATING,ADJOURNMENT," I am this amused to hear the honourable member for proKingston (Mr Chapman) say that as a Liberal he as is interested in women'srights,particularly as just 2 nights ago the Liberal Party had a woman secjumping out of a cake in Parliament House, demeaning not only the status of women in this country but also the status of the Ministers and Canning (Mr members who were there. I first Mr CHAPMAN - Are you suggesting that I was involved in the party?",111

Let usfindout from Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Liberal Party which Ministers and members n the were at the party so that we can know which the Ministers and members of the Liberal Party are in the rights,dignity and status of Ausas traUan women. Sometimeago it may have been that this kind of activity could have been of the Labor Party, the working class, but not of proper people, nor of the correct expeople in the community, not of the representaof the establishment, to run what would otherwise be visible only in a peep show.

Secondly, I suggest to him that a be blanket accusation on a matter such as this is and perhaps not the fairest way to speak in this by the degree of House tonight.",111

241,Mr KEATING,ADJOURNMENT,"A question was asked on this matter today and the Speaker, in my view, a very flippant reply to a very senous subject, and that is the behaviour of Ministers and memQueensland. bers of this Parliament in the precincts of this House. We would like to know whether most members of the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister share the Speaker's view. Perhaps the Australian women's movement and women Australia generally would Uke to know which Liberal Ministers and members approve of the concept of naked women jumping out of for their pleasure.

I suggest that from thistimeon remarks regardis quite capable of spending halfand ing the dignity of this House every honourable member.,112
244,Mr KEATING,ADJOURNMENT,"A question of moraUty is involved. It is the same as the question which arose last year when the people of this Party, the people who represent the establishHunter ment of this country, for their own selfish reasons ripped up the Australian Constitution. honourable members did the immoral things that they are now ashamed of. It just never learn. We nowfindthat, with the appointmade ment of a Minister specially involved with women's rights and with the Prime Minister's gUb talk about his interest in the dignity of women, senior Ministers are party to this kind charade in Parliament House. It is up to the Speaker to do something positive about it and bilities. not excuse people in his Party by way of his glib references to the matter this morning. It is up the Prime Minister to identify those people volved and to state his attitude about the matter.

I am glad to know that the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) is here.

There is no question about the integrity or honesty of ex-Commissioner Whitrod. I believe that by omission the honourof able member was actually describing mcorning Commissioner Lewis as a man of inferior capaThis I dispute. I think this aUegation must be corrected for the whole police force. It has to been mentioned by both Senator Colston and the inhonourable member for Hunter that there are grave consequences in this action; that it was a being tragedy for the poUce and the people of Queensland because of the evilness which is present. I dispute all of these things. ing Commissioner has the support not only of police, the rank and file, but also I believe people of Queensland themselves. Commissioner Lewis, as he now is, is a who has had quick promotion. He is 48 years 49 years of age and people have held this against him. But people have held the Prime MinisMarch. tership of this nation at a younger age. I do believe that the Commissioner's age has thing to do with the capabUities that he will express. I think it is important that people Uc debate should take cognisance of the fact if their statements are Ul made they can underployment mine the integrity of the poUce force as it exists the moment. It can create suspicions and foster further divisions. The poUce force of any nation or State works under very grave and situations. They are called upon to implement laws irrespective of whether the laws are good bad. If we start pointing the finger of scorn conceived statements we can only further underthe mine the integrity of the poUce and the thoughts of the pubUc on the poUce. I am not saying the police of any State are not without their blemishes, but I think that poUticians ought look to themselvesfirstbefore casting aspersions in any other direction.",112
250,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker. I claim to have been misrepresented. With respect to the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) I never, by inference or otherwise, denounced Mr Lewis, the newly appointed PoUce Commission in Queensland. I do not fact know Mr Lewis. I spoke with first ledge of the integrity of Mr Whitrod, the former - Commissioner, and I adhere to every word I said p.m. about him. I only wish that members of this adjourned chamber were as honourable as former Commissioner Whitrod of the Queensland police. The incom Mr LES MCMAHON (Sydney) (10.59)-The the Fraser Liberal-National Country Party coaUtion of the Government has completed 12 months in control of the Treasury and we now find that it has now man made a mess of the country and the Treasury. or About 300 000 people are unemployed. The figure will rise to 600 000 unemployed by next I am not crowing; I am just making not remarks. I ask honourable members to cast their anyrninds back 12 months.

We at heard the debate this week on devaluation. The Government has stated that there will.be more employment. We hope it is right, but miracles are difficult hard to come by nowadays. If we had an election on 13 November how or many new faces would be in the Parliament? The in illoncers in this 30th Parliament would be back in work force. They could be on the dole and then they might query their own Government's that pohcy. Unemployment is moraUy wrong. No one in Australia should be unemployed. We agree to that if a person isfitshe or he should have employment and should be producing and doing something worthwhde for personal satisfaction and for the country's survival. This Government is only talking; but the ship is sinking and the country and the people are being sacrificed. From experience the Fraser Government and Government supporters should wake up to the that the private sector of the economy is not hand knowconcerned with creating jobs.",113

Whitlam asked the Minister for follows: Environment, Housing and Community (b) Development, upon notice: (1) Which projects had been announced under the program of Capital Assistance for Leisure Facilities prior to December 197S (Hansard, 6 October 1976, page 1611). (2) What sum has been paid or project. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable were member's question is too long to be Hansard, but copies are available from the Table engines Office, House of Representatives. Licences for Citizens Band Radio Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice: Will he have undertaken an advertising campaign to warn Purchase price the pubhc of the requirement for a licence to operate a transSpare ceiver in the citizens band. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourGround equipment able member's question is as follows: Advertisements are placed regularly by my Department in Identified 1962 total cost both daily newspapers and periodicals to acquaint members Interest of the public of the need to hold licences to operate Modification cost radiocommunication equipment. Such licensing requirements are, of course, also given extensive coverage in various Government publications. Citizens Band Radio Receivers Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice: Are there any restrictions in force in relation to the tation and sale of transceivers in the citizens band. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is no. Lockheed Electra Ahcraft Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, ing upon notice: (1) Did he state in answer to Question No. 1077 that the figures quoted by his predecessor in March 1962 regarding the costs of the Lockheed Electra LI 88 aircraft purchased by TAA also included the costs of aircraft spares and ground equipment whereas the figures supplied by him on 17 March 1976 did not include these costs. (2) If so, what were the costs of the (a) spares and, (b) ground equipment for the Electra aircraft. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: NA upon noticewere circulated: (1) Yes: However, the amounts quoted for costs of Lockheed Electra aircraft purchased by TAA and tendered (Question No. 1258) by me on 17 March, require adjustment and should read as (a) 24 June 1959-SA2.178m. 19Julyl959-$A2.185m. (c) 19 August 1960-$A2.289m. The discrepancies arose because the original information 17 tendered by the airline was believed to be in US. dollars, which is normal for monetary quotes relating to aircraft purchases. However, the airline on rechecking the previous is due to be paid for each information tendered, and in compiling a detailed list of costs involved, now informs me that the amounts quoted in Australian dollars not US. dollars and no conversion included in in monetary terms should apply. (2) The estimated project cost for each aircraft for spare and propellors was SA3S4.4S9, initial spares $A387,658 and ground equipment $A142,26S. So as the honourable member will be clear on the total cost of the Electra aircraft to TAA, I outline the estimated project cost (Question No. 1297) setting out all costs associated with the purchase of one Electra aircraft. $Am 2.178 engines and propellors .354 Initial spares .388 .142 Training and delivery .110 3.172 .314 .032 3.518 Annandale Nursing Home (Question No. 1298) (Question No. 1327) Mr Neil asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) With reference to the fees charged by nursing homes, imporcan he say why the fees for the Annandale Nursing Home have risen from $80.89 to $ 165 in the space of a few months. (2) Is another rise expected next week.",113
252,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (Question No. 1299) (1) and (2) The current fee applying in Annandale NursHome is $125.72 a week. This fee became effective from 15 November 1976. The only increase in the home's fee in the previous 4 months was on 15 October 1976 when the fee rose by $3.15 a week to $ 123.20 a week. Fees charged in a nursing home are increased after the proprietor has applied to my Department and demonstrated that the cost of operating the nursing home has risen. Any increase in fees is based on the increase in cost. This procedure was followed in the case of Annandale Nursing Home. Because of its concern about the widening gap between nursing home fees and benefits the Government proposes to increase the rates of nursing home benefits by $14 a week from 15 December 1976 as an interim measure while the Committee on Care of the Aged and the Infirm completes its deliberations. Qantas Boeing 747 Aircraft Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice: (1) What length of service between overhauls was planned for enginesfittedto the Qantas Boeing 747 aircraft when the decision was made for their purchase. (2) Has that period been altered; if so why. (3) What is the length of flying time involved in a cycle a 747 engine. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable per member's question is as follows: (1) There was no fixed overhaul period planned. The inipopulation tial maintenance program of the Qantas Boeing 747 and its information engines followed closely the program approved by the Fedcases eral Aviation Administration of the USA under the Maintenance Review Board system. This program regular internal inspection of the engine by horoscope, the retirement of critical engine parts at fixed life limits, the disassembly inspection of engine modules on a sampling basis and condition monitoring of all components. (2) No, the same system still exists but some retirement lives of critical engine parts have been extended by fitting modified parts. (3) The average flying time per heat cycle for Qantas Boeing 747 engines in 197S was 3.6 hours. Qantas Boeing 747 Aircraft Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, The upon notice: (1) Is the performance of the Pratt and Whitney engines ate fitted to the Qantas Boeing 747 aircraft causing cern to Qantas. (2) Is there any plan in hand Royce engines. (3) If so, what would be whole Qantas fleet Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable Capital member's question is as follows: (1) Qantas is not concerned about the performance of the Pratt and Whitney enginesfittedto its Boeing 747 aircraft from the safety point of view but it has some concern of operating costs. (2) No. (3) Seepart(2). Mr Fry asked the Minister for Health, upon gram. notice: (1) How many people were suffering from diabetes in each State and Territory during each of the years 1970 to 1976 inclusive. (2) What percentage of the population do these figures represent (3) What facilities has his Department made available for the treatment of diabetes in Australia. (4) Is diabetes on the increase in Australia. (5) What overseas research into diabetes, both government and private, is being monitored in Australia. (Question No. 1373) Mr HUNT - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The precise number of people suffering from Diabetes mellitus in each State and Territory during the years 1970. to 1976 inclusive, is not available; there is no regular collection of such data in Australia since Diabetes mellitus is not a notifiable disease. The Australian Bureau of Statistics conducted a household sample survey in 1974 from which estimates of persons suffering from chronic illfor nesses, injuries and impairments have been derived. The number of persons reported suffering from Diabetes mellitus per 1000 of estimated population was 6.2 representing 0.6 cent of the Australian population. These estimates are subject to variability due to a sample rather than the whole having been enumerated and the fact that the provided by informants may not have been based on diagnosis by medical practitioners and excludes where the respondent was not aware of the condition included the or chose not to disclose it. (3) Although there are special diabetic clinics in some hospitals and similar institutions, generally speaking persons suffering from this condition are treated by their own doctor. Cost for treatment and pathological tests can be claimed under Medibank arrangements. Insulin and other drugs used in treatment are available under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, free of charge to eligible pensioners and to others on payment of a $2 patient contribution. A range of diagnostic reagents necessary for patients in the management of the disease is also available under the same conditions as above. The Government has provided funds under the Com(Question No. 1374) munity Health Program for a Regional Diabetic Service operating from the Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney. aim of this Service is to identify management problems in diabetic patients referred from their doctors and to motivand educate the patients and their families to adhere to some contheir prescribed management regimen. Funds provided by the Government for this purpose are as to replace them with Rolls follows: 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 the cost of the changeover for the $ $ $ 14,000 3,225 2,100 Operating 18,000 57,834 58,500 Total . . . . 32,000 61,059 60,600 in terms In 1973-74 Commonwealth funds under the Community Health Program were provided on the basis of 100 per cent funding. In subsequent years, funds have been provided on the basis of 75 per cent of capital costs and 90 per cent of operating costs, the remainder being provided by the State Diabetes Statistics Government (Question No. 1382) In 1976-77 a block grant of $29.4m was allocated to New South Wales for projects under the Community Health ProThe Regional Diabetic Service will receive funds under this block grant to the State. (4) Data based on the prescription of anti-diabetic drugs and entitlement appUcations from ex-service personnel from both world wars would seem to indicate that there has been an increase in prevalence over the past 15-30 years. However, this cannot be confirmed by the data available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, whose data are limited to records of death certification and estimates derived from the household sample surveys. (5) Overseas research into Diabetes mellitus is constantly being monitored by Australian diabetologists and others. Diabetic research has been, and is still being undertaken in Australia. Many such research projects are supported by the Government through grants from the National Health and Medical Research Council. Transport to and from Tasmania Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice: (1) When was the Australian National when did it commence, to carry out the study, recommended by the Nimmo Commission of Inquiry into Transport to and from Tasmania in its Report presented on S March 1976, of the comparative cost of moving general cargo (a) on its own wheels between Westeraport Bay and Devonport and (b) in boxes and flats between Webb Dock and Devonport (Hansard, 20 October 1976, page 2017). (2) When is it expected the study will be completed. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Priority has been accorded the recommendations of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Transport to and from Tasmania directly relating to the transport assistance schemes. Consideration is currently being given to the most appropriate method of undertaking the various investigaland tions suggested by Mr Nimmo into passenger and freight ser-of vices between Westernport and Tasmania. ANL mil not his necessarily be required to carry out all or part of this study. (2) Atimeframe for the study has not been determined. Following full implementation of the transport scheme priority will be given proposal. Australian Broadcasting Commission: Special Mr Garrick asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice: (1) What is the attitude onstrations in Sydney over the demotion of ABC producer Jennifer Hillier. (2) Can he say whether the demotion is seen by some people as another attack on the ABC's special projects branch. (3) Can he also say whether there was a large number of signatures from the general public placed on the petitions circulated on this issue. (4) Is there any plan to destroy the ABC radio special projects department in accord with the recommendations of the Green Inquiry. (5) Does the Government regard the Green Inquiry as free of policitical bias. (6) Does the Government consider that the ABC, especially the special projects tant role in providing for a wide spectrum of political and social opinion. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's queston is as follows: (1) to (3) The attitude of nel matters within the ABC are the concern of the Commission. (4) to (6) The Government does consider that the ABC is fulfilling an important role in providing for a wide spectrum of poliucal and social opinion. The special projects branch no doubt makes a contribution to the ABC's effort. As the honourable member has now had the opportunity to read the Green Report he will agree that it is free of pohtical bias and does not recommend any action in regard to the special projects branch. (Question No. 1391) Restrictive Land Covenants Question No. 1439) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Business and Line asked and Consumer Affairs, upon notice: (1) Have discussions been held with the States concerning the recommendations of the Trade Practices Review Committee that restrictive covenants over land should be regulated. (2) Will the proposed legislation to regulate restrictive covenants affect in any way State or local government regulation of town planning and building requirements.",114
253,Mr HOWARD,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) The recommendations of the Trade Practices Act Review Committee in relation to restrictive covenants over expressly recognised that it would be outside the scope the Trade Practices Act if a restriction upon a person using land to trade in a particular way was imposed by a public authority operating pursuant to law (such as town planning rules). Any action proposed by the Government on this matter will be anounced when it has fully considered the Comassistance mittee 's recommendations. to analysis of the Westernport Tasmanian Southbound Freight (Question No. 1444) Projects Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Transport, (Question No. 1404) upon notice: (1) Will apples be included in the Tasmanian southbound freight equalisation arrangement as they have been in the northbound arrangement. of the Government to recent dem(2) If so, will the subsidy be at the same rate. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's queston is as follows: (1) The Southbound Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme will apply to producers' goods and materials. Accordingly, apples shipped from the Mainland and used as a raw material input to Tasmania industry could be eligible for subsidy. (2) Southbound subsidy rates have not yet been determined. However, the principle adopted in determining Northbound subsidy rates will be followed. Northbound rates are based on the assessed difference in levels of transport charges, for door-to-door movements between Tasmania and the Mainland, and the comparable movement of similar goods on the Mainland. branch, is fulfilling an imporSale of Lamb to United States of America (Question No. 1452) Mr O'Keefe asked the Minister for Overseas the Government is that personTrade, upon notice: (1) Does a market exist in the United States of America for the sale of Australian lamb.

Also there is a strong preference on the part of consumers for their own domestic lamb over the imported exporters do not face any quantitative entering the United States and I am hopeful that Australian exports will grow. Canberra Airport: Passenger Statistics Mr Haslem asked the Minister for Transport, Wollongong upon notice: (1) How many passengers, both inward and outward, used the Canberra Airport during each of the 1972-73,1973-74,1974-75 and 1975-76.

255,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable years 1971-72, member's question is as follows: (1) The longer-established Health Maintenance Organisations in the United States of America, such as the Kaiser of Foundation based on the West Coast, generally provide care to subscribers in their own hospitals. These hospitals are also usually available for the care of non-subscribers on a fee-forbasis, and accept emergency cases. Many HMO's, however, do use community hospitals. (2) No. In order to qualify under the health insurance arand rangements as an 'approved' organisation and thus to remove the requirement of subscribers to pay the Medibank levy, a health maintenance organisation will have to provide PASSENGERS all services currently available to persons covered by Medibank. Where the health maintenance organisation does Total not possess its own facilities (such as hospitals) it must either contract out for their provision or make equivalent alterna275 337 653 670 928 tive arrangements.

256,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Since 1 October 1976 all medical benefits funds have been required to provide basic medical benefits (i.e in general covering 85 per cent of Schedule fees) on the same basis as Standard Medibank. Before 1 October these benefits were provided to all persons by Medibank. For hospital benefits funds, since 1 October, increased benefits have been provided because of increases in hospital charges. Because of the increased benefits has been given to funds to increase contribution rates from 1 October. Transport: Studies and Inquiries Mr E. G.

(2) Are women thefirstfiredand last hired intimesof and Bus Services economic recession. (3) Is the percentage of unemployed women in excess of 40 per cent while the proportion of women in the work force is only 35 per cent. (4) Does the Government have any plan to combat the problems which women have with regard to unemployment in times of economic slump. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable were member's question is as follows: (1) In August 1976 the International Labour Office in womenofwith Geneva issued a Press Statement based on data collected by order the ILO Bureau of Statistics from 18 Western European countries, the United States, Canada, Japan, New Zealand. The Australian statistics used by the ILO Bureau of Statistics were supplied by the Australian Statistician. According to this Press Statement, which was duly retoward ported in the Australian Press, the data, while not necessarily the comparable from one country to another, showed that in the ance countries covered, unemployed women workers represented grams more than 40 per cent of total made up only 35 per cent of their labour force. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated that in August 1976, there were 118000 females unemployed in Australia, representing 44.7 unemployed at that date. The Bureau's classification of unemployed persons, which conforms closely force classification recommended by the Eighth International Conference of Labour Statisticians, 1954, those looking for part-time full-time work The August 1976 estimate of 118 000 females unemployed in Australia comprised 84 900 females looking for full-time work, and 33 100 females looking for part-time work. In August 1976, the Australian Bureau of Statistics also estimated that there were 2 098 200 females in the work Joint force, representing 34.9 per cent of the estimated total work ing force. The latest available statistics on Australia are those of persons the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES). These statistics show that at the end of October 1976 there were 86 064 females registered with the of the total number of persons registered as unemployed with the CES. However, the number unemployed with the CES does not include those seeking part-time employment. (2) While there are no data available to provide a definipearing tive answer, it is reasonable to assume that in the engagelonel ment and dismissal of staff, a major ployers would be the requirements of each job and the qualifications and ability of persons to fulfil such requirements. Further, in general, unions prefer to have the 'last on,firstofi"" principle ment is necessary. (3) See answer to (1). (4) The Government has recently introduced programs combat problems associated with unemployment among the Kadhafi groups which are most affected. These are junior females and junior males, who are experiencing particular difficulty in finding employment. Accordingly, the Special Youth Program which Mr Howard announced on 22 September 1976, as extended along the lines I announced on 21 November 1976, and the Community Youth Support Scheme which I announced on 21 October 1976, have been initiated with the objectives of increasing employment and training opportunities for young people. The first of these programs direcdy assists young people aged 15-19 years who have been away from full-time education for at least 6 months in the last 12 months, who are registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service and who have been registered with the CES for at least 6 of the previous 12 months. During thefirstsix weeks of operation some 2300 young people have been placed under the program and it is estimated that almost 50 per cent of these females. The program is administered within the overall NEAT context which itself is already assisting many training. At the end of October 1976 in the 5000 women, including those placed under the Special Youth Employment Training Program, were receivAustralia and ing assistance under NEAT. The Community Youth Support Scheme, operative from 1 November 1976, aims to encourage community action the provision of supportive programs and services to young unemployed, both girls and boys.
