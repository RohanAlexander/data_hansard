1,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat-Prime Min. ister) [2.31]--Hi s Excellency the Governor General having commissioned me to form a Ministry, I communicated, with the honourable gentlemen whose names I shall mention, and they accepted the offices attached to their names :The Honourable JOSEPH COOK.'-Min ister of State for Defence; The Right Honourable Sir JOHN FORREST, P.C, G.C.M.G - Trea - . surer; Senator the Honourable Sir ROBERT WALLACE BEST, KCMG Minister of State for Trade and Customs; The Honourable LITTLETON ERNEST GROOM - Minister of State for External Affairs; The Honourable PATRICK MCMAHON GLYNN - Attorney-Genera l ; The Honourable Sir JOHN QUICK Postmaster-General; The Honourable GEORGE WARBURTON FULLER - Minister of State for Home Affairs; Senator the Honourable EDWARD DAVIS MILLEN - Vice-Presiden t of the Executive Council; Colonel the Honourable JUSTIN Fox GREENLAW FOXTON, C.M.G Honorary Minister. ""I shall hold the position of Prime Minister, without portfolio. IMPORTATIO N OF DRESS GOODS.",14
2,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I wish to., ask the Minister representing the Minister of Trade and Customs if he will consider the advisability of placing on the table of the Library, for the information of honourable members, the papers relating to the .importation of dress goods. I understand that his predecessor would have done so had not a change of Government occurred. MT. DEAKIN - I shall ask my honourable colleague if that can be done. POLICY OF T HE GOVERNMENT.",15
3,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I wish to ask the new Prime Minister, without portfolio, a question. There have been many rumours, and many contradictions",15
4,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,Is this a quesproper tion ?,15
5,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Yes , and the to honourable member will not prevent' me from asking it. I .wish to know what is the arrangement to which the Prinie MinisHouse ter has pledged the Protectionists who low him. I ask the question, not only in the interests",15
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable mempresent ber may not make a speech.,15
7,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I shall not do so.,15
8,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,Why does he not ask his - question ?,15
9,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I shall not be dictated to by the honourable member. I shall ask my question in my own way, which is the proper way. I ask the Prime Minister whether he intends to make a statement, so that the country may what has been done, and to. what his foi-. lowers are pledged. If be does not intend to make such a statement, will he give honourable members, if not at once, as possible, a copy of the written agreement beFween the parties forming the coalihas tion which he now leads, supposing such an agreement to have been made?",15
10,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"When the Government again meets the House, I shall make a statement covering the business to be put before Parliament, and any other matters appearing to call for reference. There will be no difiSculty in supplying the honasked orable member with the information which he desires. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. NEW ADMINISTRATION.",15
11,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [2.36] - I move That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Wednesday, 23rd instant, at three o'clock p.m.",15
12,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Mak e the date of re-assembling the 16th June.,15
13,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"This morning I suggested to my colleagues that, as when the previous Administration which I led was formed, a fortnight had been taken for the preparation of measures, a similar adjournment should be moved for on this occasion ; but it was recalled to my memory that our Administration met Parliament in consequence, under circumstances of great difficulty.",15
14,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The difficulties will be even greater this time.,15
15,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That may be so. We found the period allowed too short for the consideration of the matters requiring to be dealt with to enable Parliament be put into full possession of its business. Actual experience having thus proved a fortnight insufficient, I think that the will not consider three week's too follong an adjournment, seeing that the whole of the business of the session, so far as that is possible, has to be taken in hand by the new Ministers, to enable them to their programme in a prompt and efficient fashion.",15
16,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Minister s had all last week to prepare a programme. What about the petition which the honourable member sent to the Fisher Administration, praying for the earlier calling together of Parliament?",15
17,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ha d our request beencomplied - with, the preliminary matters with which we are now dealing might have know been disposed of by this time.",15
18,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Then the early calling together of Parliament was desired soto that the honourable member might obtainas soon office a few weeks sooner?,15
19,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,The honourable member made a very unfortunate admission.,15
20,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Honourable membersonly partly appreciate my meaning, which refers to ordinary preliminary business; they fail to remember that I am speakingafter another event, with their recognition of what has happened. The honourable member for Wide Bay knows why he was: to call Parliament together earlier.",15
21,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"He was asked to agree to an earlier re-assembling of Parliament ""at a time when the honourable member was supposed to be a loyal supporter.",15
22,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It is a very simple matter of business- a question as between a fortnight and three weeks. A fortnight proved insufficient last time. We suggest that three weeks is not tooÂ»long this time.,16
23,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Wide Bay) [2.40] - I desire to intimate that I have the honour to occupy the position of leader of the Opposition. May I offer my congratulations to the members of the Government?,16
24,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Especiall y the honourable member for Darling Downs.,16
25,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I should say if I were offering individual congratulations that they should be offered particularly to the honourable member for Parramatta, because I see that he has captured the Government by a majority and otherwise. I have already indicated to the Prime Minister that I think an adjournment of three weeks is too long, and I find that my colleagues are in accord with that view. I desire to af- gard in forming this Government. ford the Prime Minister and his colleagues every possible opportunity to prepare to meet the House, but it is within the recollection of honourable members that the Prime Minister and those previously associated with him incessantly stated that the fault of the previous Government was in not calling the House together earlier than it did. Certain correspondence passed between him andi myself on that matter, which with his consent I shall be delighted to allow the public to see as early as pqssible. I took then the step that I thought was necessary and proper, and I did so because I was committed by a promise to individuals who were not then in Australiaa promise which I made before the House rose in December'last. There could, therefore, be no doubt as to what was in my mind regarding the time when Parliament should again be called together. Prime Minister communicated with me later on and suggested that Parliament should be convened earlier, because of the urgency of the Dreadnought proposal and other matters. I did not think that proposal was necessary at that time, nor do I think so now. I was not in doubt at any time regarding it, but that will clo for another occasion. If any Ministry could proceed with business at once, this one should. The principle of the fusion which has taken place has been continuously discussed by the honourable member for Parramatta and *he Prime Minister since early in this year. There is no more experienced parliamentarian than the Prime Minister, and he has associated with him the right honourable member for Swan, who is also one of our oldest parliamentarians; the honourable member for Parramatta, who had Ministerial experience many years ago; and the honourable member for Angas, who has also had great experience; while the Honorary Minister, the honourable member for Brisbane, has also had experience of Ministerial office. What is .perhaps even more important in this matter is that the Ministry are te'n in number-the largest that has ever been suggested. I should like to hear the Prime Minister on that aspect of the question. If that sort of thing were to continue it would be possible to suborn Parliament. If an indefinite number of Honorary Ministers are to be appointed to suit a peculiar situation, then this Parliament should seriously take the matter into consideration. I cannot congratulate the Prime Minister on his attitude in that reMoreover, of these ten capable and experienced men, no fewer than seven are lawyers. The Prime Minister himself, the honourable member for Darling Downs, the honourable member for Illawarra, the honourable member for Bendigo, the honourable member for Angas, Senator Best, ancl the honourable member for Brisbane are all lawyers. The only three who are not lawyers are the honourable member for Parramatta, the right honourable member for Swan, and Senator Millen. That is the kind of Government who are asking for a long adjournment, and they are led by the very honourable member who said, regarding the Governor General's Speech, that everything was ready to go straight on, an|d that the majority of those who were then on this side desired to proceed immediately with the business of the country. He has now had The his opportunity, yet he asks for three weeks' adjournment. May I remind him that he said that the reason for the sudden death motion which put the late Government out was a desire to get on with business at once? The Prime Minister shakes his head. I cannot say whether that is a literal interpretation of his words or not.",16
26,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,The honourable member should not forget that we saved three weeks' debate on the Address-in-Reply.,16
27,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"May I remind the honourable member that the debate on the A d -. dress-in-Reply has still to come? A debate may take place on the statement of the policy of the new Government, and, in addition to that, I would remind the honourable member that the debate on the Address-inReply was simply adjourned, and must also be called on. Consequently, the Government are looking forward, not only to an adjournment of three weeks, during which they will be under no parliamentary control, and will bring nothing before Parliament, but also to a further three weeks of debate on the Address-in-Reply, according to the honourable member for Lang, thus giving them six weeks before any Bills will be brought forward.",16
28,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Does the leader of the Opposition intend to stonewall the Addressin-Reply ?,17
29,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It may the the desire of the Government to attempt to stifle discussion altogether. They may wish to pursue the same kind of tactics as they pursued earlier this session. In view of the action which they took then, it will be quite fitting if they do so. The new Minister of Defence referred to his present leader's party, when speaking at Ipswich not long ago, in terms the effect of which was that ""The Deakin Party were like a lot of fowls out in the rain, poor """,17
30,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"He also said in the same speech that the honourable member for Ballarat was "" despised and rejected of men.""",17
31,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I was going to quote the phrase, but it is an offensive one, and perhaps I had better not. Shortly, the honourable member said that the Deakin Party were a bedraggled lot. He has them within his coop, and, with a majority of five, he can do as he pleases Ministry. So far as I am concerned, no time of the House will be wasted; I shall do my utmost to discuss any matters brought forward in the interests of the the people. But, as I said before, I think adjournment asked for is excessive. Lean remember the right honourable member for Swan, when the honourable member for of mv colleagues have had hard words to South Sydney asked for an adjournment for three weeks, at a time when trie Ministhem ters were all practically new to the businever ness, attacking the Government at once, and desiring not to give them even a day.",17
32,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The honourable member for South Sydney had not a above, majority.",17
33,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I can also remember the taunt being thrown at the honourable member for South Sydney about "" another ing over it. clay's pay."" At any rate, we are now asked to adjourn. for three weeks by this Ministry of all the talents. I beg to.move as an amendment That "" 23rd "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof "" 16th."" In my opinion ?m adjournment for a fortnight is fair and reasonable, and, in no hostile spirit, I ask the Prime Minister to assent to it. The honourable gentleman knows that I have expressed this view before, and, failing his consent, I shall press the motion to a division.",17
34,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,West Sydney) [2.52] I cannot say that I am astonished at the request of the Ministry for an adjournment of three weeks.,17
35,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I wonder they do not ask for three months !,17
36,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am a little amazed at their moderation. But their demand has, at least, deprived the Prime Minister of the only excuse he could put forward on Thursday and Friday last for declining to consider the policy of the late Government. The Prime Minister, when leader of the Opposition, pointed out that all he desired to do was to conserve the time of the country, and to get to public business, and this is how he proceeds to de> it. I feel sure, however, that nothing any one can say on this side would be of the slightest effect, in view of the solid phalanx on the other side, who, for the best of all reasons in the world, have decided to do what they have done, and are compelled now to remain, while they are permitted to remain, for as long as possible.",17
37,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Cannot "" the honorwith the able member find a new gag?",17
38,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I cannot blame them, and I shall not now reproach them. The leader of the Opposition has pointed out fact that there are ten Ministers in this ' the new Ministry, and that seven of them are lawyers. I have always had the greatest respect for my profession; and when some 1 say about the law, I have always reminded of the ""profits."" But there surely has been a more signal and convincing proof of the value of that profession than_ the instance now before us, although I still see, unhappily, on the benches some representatives of my profession who have been unable to find a resting place.",17
39,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,They are not growl,17
40,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"That may be; and I was going to say that that is probably because the billets were so few, or the lawyers were so many. It may be that we have not seen the end of this canvas, and that there are still more films to be unrolled-that more golden opportunities are yet to be displayed, because on the majority of the faces, I see some small remnants of that expectant smile that marked them a little while ago. But I understand that this is a method invariably resorted to from the beginning of coalition governments-in order to placate gentlemen whose intentions, as well as their political views, are somewhat uncertain-and that the Prime Minister has done his best with the means at his disposal. I understand, however, that there is another billet, at any rate, clearly in view, seeing that some honourable member has to go to England with the Minister of Defence. That disposes of eleven; and there is yet another billet, which will dispose of twelve.",18
41,Dr WILSON,Unknown,What is the other billet?,18
42,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I can understand the chagrin of the honourable member.,18
43,Dr WILSON,Unknown,"Not chagrin, but expectancy !",18
44,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The honourable member has been unfortunate in his choice of a profession which does hot find such favour in the arena of polities as that of the law.,18
45,Dr WILSON,Unknown,There are three of us on this side !,18
46,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Quite so. However, I shall not further indicate the billet to the honourable member ; I feel sure it will occur to him if he throws his mind back a little, ancl also to certain other honourable members. I see that the Prime Minister, in the course of a debate last week, said I am inviting honourable members to exercise self-restraint in order that the business of this Parliament may be advanced at once to some important stage. It was this stage which the honourable gentleman had in his mind, and it is a stage broad, and capable of holding many performers for what they fervently hope will be a very long while. It is a play we are to be treated to with an interminable number of acts, in which the various characters will play many parts, a role for which, I venture to say, the leader is admirably fitted. However, I should like to ask some honourable gentleman- I do not know whom - whethe r all the ten members of the Ministry have been sworn in?",18
47,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"All excepting the Honorary Minister-wh o could not be found after two hours' searching, in order to tell him of the time.",18
48,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Who is that one?,18
49,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,He is one of the best of them.,18
50,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Do I understand ""that the Honorary Minister has not been sworn in yet?",18
51,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,The Honorary Minister was swearing at a dentist just about that time.,18
52,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I can see that it is quite immaterial what one says or what one does. Both the statement of the leader of the Government and the circumstances uncler which it is made fittingly follow his actions of last week, and supply all that is required to prove to the people what has been done, and why it has been clone. There are some honourable members on the Treasury bench whom I can heartily congratulate, for, as far as I am aware, they have made no sacrifice. They take office uncler circumstances in which' their reputation and their honour are unsmirched. I notice, however, that some honourable members have been included in the Ministry who were not particularly desirous of entering it, and that manv have been excluded who, from what one' could see, were very anxious to be selected. We shall awaif with what patience we mav the submission of the Ministerial programme, but I venture to sav that the Government know very well that no programme of the slightest service to this country that they will bring forward has the remotest prospect of beinoplaced on the statute-book this session. Ao one knows that better than does the Prime Minister himself. No one knows better than he how urgent it is that the defence of the Commonwealth should be put on a proper footing; vet no one has done more than he has clone to nrevent it being so placed. I shall be readv to grant the Ministry a fortnight's adjournment. I do not think that they ought to ask for more. Indeed, they do not require more time. Their programme, we were given distinctly to understand, has already been completed, so that preparation under the circumstances becomes unnecessary. The business of the country demands immediate attention, ancl. in"" the words of the Prime Minister himself. I now invite honourable members "" to exercise self-restraint, in order that the business of the Parliament may be advanced at once? to some important stage."" I shall vote against the proposed adjournment for three weeks.",18
53,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Gwydir) [3.4] - I feel constrained to avail myself of the present opportunity to offer my congratulations to the honourable gentlemen who have been so recently elevated to the Treasury bench. I offer my special congratulations to the Prime Minister on the team he has selected to work with him during the present session. I do not agree with the view expressed by an honourable member who has preceded me, that it is unnecessary at the present stage to have in the Cabinet so many members of the legal profession. It seems to me absolutely clear that such ateam, constituted as it is, and representing what it does, needs all the legal advice possible to clear its path of the intricacies that will ultimately beset it. Some people may be disposed to say that as there are seven lawyers in the Cabinet it is the "" Devil's Brigade."" I shall not apply that epithet to it. I think, however, that the public will consider it, to say the least, remarkable that in such a Parliament as this a Cabinet cannot be formed without the selection of seven lawyers. I do not object to them personally, but I do object to so ""many legal men being at the helm of any Government, whether it be that of the Commonwealth or of a State. I have a decided repugnance to the presence of so many lawyers in a Ministry, for authorities have declared it to be dangerous to have too many members of the legal profession manning the ship of State.",19
54,Dr WILSON,Unknown,Are we to understand,19
55,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The honourable member has my sympathy in that he has not been made a - member of the Cabinet ; but I feel confident that he and the other members of his profession in the House will have plenty to do in connection with the Ministry before the session is over. The honourable member and his brother medicos In the House need have no fear of being unemployed; they will have plenty of work in soothing the nerves of those who now occupy the Treasury bench. congratulate the Prime Minister upon having included in his Cabinet an honourable gentleman-no t yet sworn in-wh o was in iimes gone by a champion of black labour in another State. To the credit of the Prime Minister be it said, that up to the present time he has fought courageously and patriotically for a White Australia. What, then, will the people say when they find in his Cabinet honourable' members whom he himself described not long ago as "" the wreckage' of the black labour party."" For my own part I ask for nothing better than the Ministry now facing us; we could not wish to see the Government differently constituted. We are told that those whom the gods seek to destroy they first make mad, and I think that will be applicable to the Government when they go before the people in the days to come. I wish them well, and shall endeavour to observe the forms of the House, although I shall feel it my duty to oppose a Ministry constituted and supported as is this new Government. Sir WILLIAM LYNE) [3.8] I do not wish to speak at length, because, whether we adjourn for a fortnight or for three weeks, we shall soon have an opportunity to fully discuss the proposals and the constitution of this hybrid Ministry. I take this opportunity of congratulating the Prime Minister on his new phase of topsyturvydom, and the shandy-gaff conditions under which he now holds office.",19
56,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"It is a case of half-andhalf, for some are "" black "" and some are "" white.""",19
57,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I shall refer presently to that phase of the question. I am sure that I shall not be misunderstood when I say that I am deeply grieved to find the Prime Minister, who was once my chief, and with whom, and for whom, I once worked so ardently, mixed up with such a motley crew.",19
58,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,Is that remark in order ?,19
59,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Yes ; the honourable member is one of the motley crew. I am greatly grieved to find the Prime Minister associated with honourable members, sharing with him the highest positions in the service of the Commonwealth, who are mixed in policy, and also mixed in honour. I am not complaining of those who have swallowed the late Protectionist party. They have alI ways been opposed to us and to our Tariff, though some of them have not carried out the pledges which they gave at the last election, and by means of which they were returned. I congratulate and compliment the Prime Minister on the alteration of his feelings towards these honourable members since he made the remarkable speech, describing them as the rag-tag and bob-tail of the House, which has been quoted on several occasions. I think there never was an instancs in the history of the world, I might almost say, which parallels ihe present case. There never was a time when, if I may make the remarks without - applying them personally, so much was - done for the degradation of a Constitution and a policy, and to foster everything that is worse in the politics of a country. If I may assume the role of prophet, I say that the present state of affairs will not 'be tolerated by the honourable and honest citizens of Australia. Dishonesty in politics is a serious offence, for which every man who sells his principles should be branded tis traitor on the back, the shoulders, and in fact all over. It is better for an honourable politician to stand alone, or to retire with honour and his good name from public life than, through greed of power or lucre, to accept unholy office, selling principles which have been fought for, not by him alone, but by others for so many years past. There is in some of the Constitutions of the States-and the practice is observed under the British Constitutionwhat I am beginning to regard as a wise provision, namely, that upon a man taking office, he shall present himself before his constituents for re-election. I, at one time, considered that form superfluous, but occasions such 'as this emphasize the fact that it is not. I undertake to say that the constituents of the honourable member for Darling Downs would not condone his action had they an opportunity to express their opinions, and I question whether those of the Prime Minister would not revolt at the accursed action which has taken place.",19
60,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,They are revolting.,20
61,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I think that they will do so. I mention these facts to show that there was good reason for asking that the constituencies should be appealed to. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth Constitution does not require new Ministers to present themselves for re-election, and, without impeaching anything that the Governor General may have done, I say that this affords a good justification for an appeal to the country at the present juncture, before _,an attempt is made to proceed with business. What is the position? An adjournment of three weeks is asked for, which I think is longer than has been proposed on former occasions.",20
62,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Yes ; longer than has been proposed on any other occasion.,20
63,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,The Watson Administration obtained an adjournment of f u l ly three weeks-fro m the 18th Apri l to about the middle of May.,20
64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The Prime Minister stated, as his reason for the action which he took against the Fisher Administration, that he wished to save time, so that there might be no delay in getting on with business; but it seems to me retrograde progression to now suggest an adjournment of three weeks. No Address has yet been voted by the House in reply to His Excellency the Governor General's opening speech, an unheard of state of affairs. The constitutional course would have been to deal at once with the Address-in-Ueply, amending it so as to meet the wishes of the majority. The House is placed in a most extraordinary position by reason of that not having been done. When the Ministry brings down its forlorn policy, which has been pecked at by every hen in the Cabinet, we shall be asked to resume the consideration of the proposed Address. I wish to direct the attention of the country to the position regarding the combination of parties opposite. Honourable* members do not know on what basis the coalition is formed. I read one statement of the agreement in the Argus, and another in the Age of the same day, while I also read an account of an interview in Sydney with a former leader of the Opposition, the right honourable member for East Sydney, in which he deliberately stated that the protectionist policy is not safeguarded, and that the majority of the Ministerial party can at any moment refuse to allow any proposed alteration of the Tariff for the correction of an anomaly, and vote against any proposed increase in duties; that the free-traders in the party have a free hand to do as they please in regard to the Tariff.",20
65,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,I intend to vote as I like.,20
66,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I do not blame the honourable member. The free traders have scored a great victory. Are the protectionists and manufacturers of this community, and, 'indeed, the people at large, to sit quietly twiddling their thumbs while nothing is done to give our industries the protection they need, or to provide encouragement for industries which might spring into existence ? What has the leader of the Government' to say about the position of the oil industry in New South Wales?",20
67,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,He sold it.,21
68,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It appears to the me that that industry will be crushed out so long. of existence by the arrangement which has been made. What has he to say about the iron industry? An alteration of the Tariff is necessary to foster it. Are these and other necessary alterations to remain in abeyance, not merelv for this, but for next Parliament, a period of five years? The base hearts should be dragged out of those who are responsible for this state of affairs, which may be productive of revolution. Revolutions have been started by much smaller causes. The hearts should be dragged out of the traitors who would tie the hands of the protectionists for years.",21
69,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Protectio n is up a tree.,21
70,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I hope my re, marks will dwell in the minds, and sink turers. deeply into the hearts, of those who have acted as traitors. But for the assistance of a large section of the Labour Party, and the assishundreds tance at times of those who are not altotence, anyway. ' gether protectionists, I should not have"" had ii ghost of a chance, in view of the attitude of the traitors then in the Opposition corner, of passing the present Tariff, low as it Yet, according to what I have seen and heard, it is proposed that that Tariff shall remain in abeyance for some years. No, sir, that will not do for me. I think shall get enough electors outside, if I do not get enough members inside the House, stop this wholesale ignoring of the people, who expected to be better protected. I not blame the right honourable member for Swan, although he sold his present leader when he was in the Government before. The latter became ill , and the first thing right honourable member for Swan did was to resign, and leave him in an awkward position. Now he is his .bosom friend",21
71,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We never quarrelled about it.,21
72,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"There are ceris tain ways of doing things without absothe lutely quarrelling. I have, perhaps, an fortunate faculty and habit of using my speech to say what I think, but some people have the faculty of using their speech to hide their thoughts. It might be better individuals like myself if we did hide our thoughts sometimes. I could not conceive that a man like the honourable member for Darling Downs would behave in the manner he has. I believe that his constituents are honourable men, and I am sure that they will never re-elect a man who has so dishonoured principles about which he has prated for There are others to whom I could refer. It is an audacious thing in the present condition of affairs to ask for three weeks' adjournment. I know enough of the work of Governments to be pretty well sure that the programme of the new Government could' the be brought down tomorrow. It is simply upsetting everything that has been donebefore, and allowing time for the storm' to blow over. I wish again to say that .the Tariff stands today as a monument to a large number of the members of the Labour Party, and it would never have got to itspresent position without a personal promisefive - I do not know whether others made it, but it was made by myself, who had charge of the Tariff-that it should never be made law without protection being afforded to the employees as well as to the manufac of votes from me under that pre",21
73,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It was no pretence on my part. It was under that promise that I got a large number of votes,, is. which appear now to have been obtained byfraud, not on my part, but on the part of others, unless that promise is carried out to the fullest extent. I do not know how I many members of the Employers' Federation there are in the new Ministry, but there to sit behind them the whole rank and file of that body, while in New South Wales, the do new organization which I understand has been proposed, supported and organized by the Prime Minister, has absolutely as its. keynote the policy of the Employers' Fedethe ration. I always understood that that body was no friend of the labouring class. Yet those honourable members pose as the friends: again. of the labouring class, ancl as the friends of Liberals, andi call themselves Liberals. The brand of Conservatismindelibly stamped all over every one of Ministers who have gone ipto the preunsent Government. To use the word ""Liber a l "" in describing them is to utter a diabolical untruth. There is no Liberalism amongst those who are sitting on that side. for I see the President of the Victorian Employers' Federation sitting on the Government bench. The time will come when, piece by piece, the whole of what has takenplace, and the whole of the political life of those who have formed this extraordinary amalgamation and upset everything in this country-a n amalgamation which they have not the slightest hope of making permanent and effectual-the time, I say, will come very shortly, and it should come as quickly as possible, when the covering will be torn off all these proceedings, when they will be exposed to the people of this country in the fullest blaze and glare of publicity. It will be of no use for the Prime Minister to try, with his honeyed words, any longer to hoodwink the people.

If ""they do, they ought to be sold again, just as he will slide out from amongst honourable members opposite one of these days, when it suits him. I was shown a paragraph the other day from a leading morning paper, in which an attempt was made to frighten me from making any further attacks on the party opposite, and to insinuate that if I persisted there would be an exposure of certain things regarding my political life and public policy, which had taken place in Cabinet or elsewhere. I say to them, "" Bring forward everything !"" I challenge any paper and any Minister to point tome as-a man who deserted or misled in a cowardly way any of his colleagues, or to point tb any unworthy action of mine during the whole of the time that I have been in public life, riot only in this Parliament, but in the Parliament of New South Wales, where.I gained my political education under one of the most honourable and imright men tfTat ever held office-the late Sir George Dibbs. He always stuck to his colleagues, and to those who would support his policy. I tell any one who attempts to prevent me from using every weapon in my power in the peculiarly disgraceful circumstances of the present moment that, if I am goaded, I will go very much further than they think, no matter where the threat comes from; because if there is one thing which I can say regarding my public life, it is that I can dare any person in the community to trv tp find a stain on my record as a man, or in any other way. I shall proceed on my ""own course to attack, for instance, the honourable member for Parramatta as I have attacked him in the past. I challenge him to produce anything against mv public character. When charges have been hurled against me previously, I have not sat down quietly and let the thing blow over; but I have challenged my accusers at once with the demand of a Commission, and rammed down the throats of my detractors the detractions which they have uttered.

There is, however, one point on which I think the Prime Minister might enlighten the House,. and thus afford information to which I consider we are entitled. It is generally accepted that a delegation will go from Australia to the Imperial Naval Conference, and I have no doubt that the present Government will carry out the intentions of their predecessors, and send representatives. Under the circumstances, I think that, if we consent to an adjournment for three weeks, and that, as any delegation is likely to be on the road to England before the expiry of that time, the Prime Minister ought to indicate to the House and the country the attitude which will be taken up by the delegation when speaking in the name of Australia.

The honourable gentleman communicated with me by telelast graph, and I naturally concluded that he was very anxious that the business of country should be proceeded with without delay, and believed that the recess by the Government of the day was longer than it ought to be. I replied that I prepared to agree to any arrangement that might be made between the honourable Minister. gentleman and the then Prime Minister, even if , as a result of it, Parliament called together on the following day. What has since happened to render the transaction of the work of this Parliawhy ment no longer .urgent? Is it not urgently necessary to proceed with the ness of the country? We find, however, that the first action taken by the honourable member for Ballarat on the meeting of Parliament gave rise to loss of time in that it led to the displacement of a Government that was prepared to go on at once with business of which I believed, and still lieve, he approved. He now asks for an adjournment for three weeks. With what object? It cannot be said that it is to able the new Government to frame a policy, for its policy has already been drawn As a member of the Liberal Party led by fence. the honourable member for Ballarat, I was told that a policy had been drawn agreed to by the very honourable members who constitute the new Administration. That being so, why should there be any delay?

Is that the way they are I going to do the business of the country? The Prime Minister appears, as I have already said, to be subject to the dictates of those around him, and must do what he is told. If it was wrong last week for the late Government to take the course they propose, then it is wrong for this Government to take a similar course this week until they know that theyÂ»are secure in their positions. The Prime Minister appears to be under the impression that the first duty of the House, when it meets again, will be to consider his policy; but let me remind him that the policy of 'the late Government has yet to be discussed, and will be discussed to the .fullest possible extent as soon as the House meets, unless the Prime Minister is prepared to apply the closure to the debate on the Address-in-Reply. It is idle for the honourable member to say that he desires to save time. Why, if that is so, does he ask for an adjournment of three weeks now ? He himself has no particular anxiety, as he has no portfolio to administer, ' and has nothing to do but sign a few papers that may come before him from time to time, and to lead the House when he is present. His attention to the business of the House previously was the poorest that I have ever seen given by a Prime Minister or by the Premier of any of the States. During my career I have never seen a leader of a House pay less attention to his parliamentary duties than did the present Prime Minister when previously in office. He was hardly ever in the chamber, and the honourable member for Parramatta, who is now a Minister of the Crown, repeatedly complained-as did a number of other honourable members who were then sitting on this side-that they could hardly get a Minister present, with the exception of the honourable member for Hume, who during one long period spent a considerable amount of time in the Chamber. I hope the Prime Minister, now that he is relieved of anxiety with regard to the administration of a Department, will try to lead the House, and not allow' it to run itself as it had to during his previous term of office. It will be in the best interests of this Parliament that Until the the honourable member should attend the House a little more frequently than he has done in the past.

156,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have received the following telegram from the Acting Premier of South AustraliaI have the honour to acknowledge recefpt of your telegram conveying the resolution of the House of Representatives expressing its profound regret at the untimely decease of our Premier,  and the people of South Australia. I have communicated the contents of the message to Mrs. Price, who desires me to thank the House of Representatives for its sympathetic message of condolence. I also desire to thank the House on. behalf of the people of South Australia. ADJOURNMENT. FEDERAL CAPITAL SITE-GOVERNMEN T MAJORITY. AYES. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",30
157,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Coolgardie) [4.26]- I should like to bring before the House a matter which, in my opinion, - requires attention at the earliest possible moment. I have in my hand a newspaper, published in Sydney, which reports a lengthy statement by the Premier of that State in reference to the Federal Capital site. In the course of that statement, the Premier makes an attack on an officer selected by the Government of the Commonwealth to report NOES. on various matters connected with the site. He does this well knowing that the officer concerned is debarred from uttering a word' in his own defence. The point I should like to emphasize is that Mr Scrivener is an officer of the New South Wales Government, and has been selected to fumish a report to the Commonwealth. It seems to me that in the future the Commonwealth will be seriously hampered if an Watkins, D . officer selected from a State to act for the PAIRS. Federal Government is to be attacked by a member of the Government which he serves.",30
158,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Is Mr Scrivener a State or a Federal officer?,30
159,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"A State officer; and a most excellent one. If this attack is to pass, then State officers will hesitate to They cannot be expected to furnish impartial reports if by doing so they are likely to incur cenfrom their official superiors. Without going into full details, for this statement fills over a column in the newspaper, its general tenor will be gathered from editorial comments thareon :Mr Scrivener was only one of a Committee of New South Wales Government officials detailed to deal with the question of the best place for a city within the prescribed area, and his duties were those of a licensed surveyor. It was no part of those duties to provide any report on his own initiativeMr Scrivener provided nothing on his own initiative; he dealt with the matter acording to precise instructionsnor to meddle in questions calling for expert knowledge outside the range of that expected in a surveyor. All one can say in reply to that is that Scrivener had been employed by a previous Government to report on other sites, and that his work earned the highest commenobtain dation of everybody concerned. The leading article goes on to sayBut Mr Scrivener both supplied a statement of his individual views and discussed problems quite outside the limits of his field. My reply to these charges is that Mr. Scrivener's report is well within the authowind rity he received. The leading article ceedsHe did it too, with a precipitateness which to say the least remarkable in a State servant. Taking his report as it stands, it is therefore that which occurs in Hobson's Bay. easy to understand that it is neither a satisfacthe tory nor a convincing document. Its unsatisfacthink tormess lies in the political bias which it exhibits. ""Predilection for his old love-Dalgety might well be the motive, as Mr Wade suggests. Taking this article as a reflex ancl amplifilike cation of Mr .Wade's statements, I can only describe it as a gross perversion of facts and an impertinent attempt to browbeat officer of the highest standing.",30
160,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Does the honourable memdwindled ber suggest that Mr Scrivener will suffer for his independent report ?,31
161,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I do not say so; but it must be remembered that he is under the State Government.,31
162,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,What remedy does the. honourable member suggest?,31
163,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The remedy is not for me. All I can do now is to express I feel and'know, leaving the House and the Government' to take such action as may be necessary to vindicate Mr Scrivener from a wanton and mendacious attack. Sir WILLIAM LYNE) [4.32]. - I should like to call attention to that of the report in which Mr Scrivener deals with Jervis Bay. If all that officer's statements are as correct as those ference to Jervis Bay, not much reliance is to be placed on them. I suggest that Prinie Minister should obtain from the naval or other authorities who have knowreport ledge on the question, some information as to the depths and the safety of Jervis as a harbour. I have been in jervis hundreds of times on fairlv large vessels; and in this connection I know that Mr. Scrivener's report is absolutely unreliable. I do not refer to the other parts of Mr. Scrivener's report.",31
164,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,We have not had Mr Scrivener's report yet.,31
165,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It was pubMr lished in the Sydney newspapers the other day. I think that the naval authorities would, perhaps, be the best from whom to the information I suggest, though I believe that the Works Department or the Navigation Department of New South Wales have full particulars as to the depth, and so forth. Amongst other things, Mr. Scrivener said that Jervis Bay is not a safe harbour, or rather would be rough if the were blowing from the west or northprowest. Now, anv child would, know better, because that end of the harbour is the most is protected, and there is not a sufficiently long reach of water to .make a sea anything like In interests of whatever site is chosen. I we ought to have full particulars, to"" gether with a chart, as to Jervis Bay.  to call attention to the dwindling majority of the Government in the first contest. We were told that the Prime Minister an had a majority of nine, or a supposed majority of twelve; but we find that this has down to six, so that if the Prime Minister has many more victories like that, he will meet his Waterloo.",31
166,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The Senate counted entirely . out a similar motion.  was not aware until the present moment, I am only anxious that the Prime Minister should not too soon find himself back on what the Opposition benches again.",31
167,Mr DEAKI N,Unknown,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [4.35J - An official summons caused me to leave the chamber during the reading of what. I imagine was the cardinal part of the newspaper article to which the honorpart able member for Coolgardie referred; otherwise, I should not have left. A note, however, of the honourable member's statements in re has been taken by my honourable colleague who, from tomorrow, will take the charge of the Department. I have asked him to look into the who'e nature of the and the circumstances, feeling sure that the House will be desirous of affording Bay every proper protection to an officer who Bay acts for the Commonwealth. I am loth, however, to believe, unless the evidence is absolutely clear, that the Premier of New South Wales would reflect on one of his own officers acting in the discharge of his duty.",31
168,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Hi s words appear in the newspaper.,32
169,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I have not seen them. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.37 p.m.,32
