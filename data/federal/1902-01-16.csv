Mr A MCLEAN presented two petitions from members of the Church of England at Stratford and at Fernbank, praying that the House would reject a Bill for the regulation of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes.",14
1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Thes e petitions appear to relate to a measure which is not before this House, and as we have no knowledge of the business which may be before the other branch of the Legislature, I am un.able to say without reading them whether their presentation would be in order or not. I therefore ask the honourable member to withdraw them until tomorrow. SURGEON-COLONEL WILLIAMS , C.B.",14
2,Mr BARTON,Unknown," I wish to inform House that His Excellency the Governortemporarily General received a telegram Kitchener on the 31st December last, stating that, when we send our contingent, he would be . glad if Surgeon-Colonel Williams, C. B., Principal Medical Officer of Arising New South Wales, could accompany it . Referring to this request, His Excellency, at my desire, .sent on the 2nd January cable message to the Secretary of State, asking whether a field hospital equipment, with men of the Army Medical Corps, was required in addition to the medical provision mentioned in the original telegram, namely, one medical officer to each battalion.. I have pleasure in saying that yesterday His Excellency received a telegram from the Secretary of State, dated 11th January-the delay being due probably to transmission through the Cape - so that I am inclined to think- .that Lord Kitchener has been consulted. That telegram intimated, that our telegram on 2nd January was not fully understood, so that it is ppssible that some error crept into it in transmission; but the Secretary of State intimated that, if it was correctly read as conveying an offer of a field hospital equipment and personnel complete, His Majesty's Government would readily accept it, and that if it is considered more convenient, the medical and surgical equipment-whic h I take to mean such things as drugs, bandages, and dressingscan be provided in South Africa on its arrival. I need scarcely add that this Government intend to despatch with Colonel Williams a field hospital equipment and personnel accordingly. It will be fresh in the recollection of honourable members that the field hospital equipment which, under Colonel Williams, accompanied the first contingent from New South Wales received the highest encomiums from military authorities in South Africa, both by reason of the completeness of .the equipment and the activity and ability of its commander and personnel. MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS.",14
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"In reference to the statement just made by the Prime Minister, I take the opportunity of informing honourable members how I propose to rule in connection with the making of statements by Ministers when no question is before the the House. Rule 257 of the Standing Orders adopted by the House in June from Lord last reads as followsA membei' may speak to any question before the House, or up^n a motion or amendment to be proposed by himself, or upon a question or orderout of the debate, or upon a question of privilege, but not otherwise. The term "" member "" includes Ministers. A a remark was made on Tuesday afternoon as to the advisability of following the practice of the British Parliament in regard to matters which are not provided for in our standing orders, and onr first standing order provides thatIn all cases not provided for hereinafter, sessional or other orders, resort shall be had to the rules, forms, and practice of the Commons House of the Imperial Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland in force at the time of the adoption of those orders, which shall be followed as far OK they can be applied to the proceedings of the House of Representatives. It will be seen therefore that the practice of the British Parliament is to be followed o n l y in cases not provided for by our own rules, and as the occasions when members, including Ministers, may speak are provided for, we are not in this instance thrown back upon that practice. The ruling which I give will not prevent the Prime Minister or any other member from making statements to the House. Such statements can always be made by leave of the House without .the necessity for any course being taken which will enable other honourable members to discuss them; or, if leave be refused, they can be mode upon laying a paper upon the table, upon moving the adjournment of the House, or upon the adoption of any other proper course which v^Ul permit .other honourable members to discuss them immediately afterwards. While the practice which I propose to follow will not limit the opportunities of Ministers to make statements, it will conserve the right of the leader of the Opposition and of othermembers of the House to debate them should they think fit. If the House unanimously gives leave for "" the making of a statement, no debate can follow; but if any member objects to leave being, given, the statement can be made in the manner I have indicated, the right of discussion being then reserved to honourable members. NA RESTRICTIO N.",14
4,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,ALIEN IMMIGRATION,"I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs the following letter which I have received from the secretary to the Coastal Trades and Labour Council of Western AustraliaI am directed by the above council to resistfully draw your attention to the increasing influx of Italians and other aliens into this State, and to request, that you will use your influence with the Comptroller of Customs in the direction of getting the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act enforced us early as possible in this State.",15
5,Mr BARTON,ALIEN IMMIGRATION,"The question properly comes within my department. The honoror by able member asks it at short notice, but I do not think it is difficult to answer. It was the complete understanding of the House during the debates upon the Immigration Restriction Bill, that immigrants of European race should be admitted without restriction, unless they wore specifically found to be undesirable. Where people of European race, whether Italians or of other nationalities, show that they are undesirable, or are discovered to be so, upon grounds independent of colour, there will be no hesitation in applying the educational test; but I do not think it was intended by Parliament, or desired by the country, that persons of European race should be' subjected to the test, unless there be some specific reason for their exclusion. FLOTATI ON OF LOAN .",15
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALIEN IMMIGRATION,I desire to ask the Treasurer when be contemplates raising a loan ? As things are at present the business of some of the departments is in a complete state of paralysis from the want of money.,15
7,Sir GEORGE TURNER,ALIEN IMMIGRATION,I propose to deal with the Estimates and the question of constructing loan works immediately after we have dealt with the Tariff. We cannot break into the consideration of the Tariff and start the financial discussion which musb necessarily take place on the loan proposals. In the meantime I am financing any very urgent works out of the Treasurer's advance vote. Of course we have no right to proceed with any of these works unless we are quite satisfied that they are very urgently needed. PUBLIC ACCOUNTS SYSTEM.,15
8,Mr FOWLER,ALIEN IMMIGRATION,"for Mr Mahon) asked the Minister representing the Postmaster General, upon notice:1. Whether the attention of the latter has been drawn to a complaint that the existing system of keeping the accounts of his department in Western Australia produces great inconvenience to the public, and involves an avoidable waste of time by the administrative stafl? 2. Whether, in viow of the interval which must elapse before the powers conferred by the Public Service Bill can be exercised, the ""Postmaster-General will direct that an immediate investigation be made into the method of keeping the departmental accounts in Western Australia ?",15
9,Sir PHILIP FYSH,ALIEN IMMIGRATION,"The answers to the .honourable member's questions are as follow:1. No such complaint has come under the Postmaster-General's notice - i8 2. The system of accounts in all the States, including Western Australia, is receiving attention, and will be dealt with in due course. TELEGRAMS FROM SYDNEY .",16

14,Mr MCCOLL,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"In asking the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon noticeIf he will make arrangements, when machinery - or goods are sent from one State to another for tihe purpose of repair and return only, that, when the repairs are effected, such machinery or goods - shall be permitted to be returned to the sender without duty being charged, whether such 25 o machinery or goods have been imported into the Commonwealth or made in any State I wish to explain that before the Commonwealth was established goods and machinerycould cross the border and be repaired without any duty being charged. But I understand that under section 92 of the Constitution Act a charge is being made. While the section no doubt may cover the charge, still I am sure that ifcs framers never intended it to apply to such cases-that while enforcing it in the way they are doing the officers may be keeping the letter of the Constitution, they are certainly breaking its spirit.",16
15,Mr SPEAKER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,The honourable member must not argue the question.,16
16,Mr MCCOLL,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,I trust that the Minister will be able to devise some means by which the former practice can be carried on.,16
17,Mr KINGSTON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"The honourable member's explanation of his question shows that he recognises the difficulty in which we are placed. The formal answer to the question Section 92 of the Constitution Act does not appear to contemplate the arrangement suggested. I may add that we hope that at some very early date an opportunity may be taken for more fully securing Inter-State free-trade. subordi- At present we think, as guardians of the Constitution, that the course suggested can hardly be taken. It would have the effect of allowing goods from New South Wales to be sent into Victoria for repair for the benefit of the Victorian tradesman, whilst goods from Sydney could not .be sent into Victoria for sale to compete against the Victorian trader. Under the provision in the Constitution Act, I do not - think it possible to make the arrangement suggested. However, if on further consideration we come to a different concluskm, we shall not hesitate to apprise the House. Mr MCCoix - It is a very important question.",16

Consideration resumed from 15th January (vide page S859)Item 74 - Manufacture s of metalN.E.I., including engines, boilers, pumps, machines and machinery, n.e.i.; also screws, n.e.i., axles, springs, and plated, and mixed metulwaro, including plated cutlery, ad valorem, 25 petcent. Upon which Mr THOMAS had moved, by way of amendmentThafcfchewords ""and on and after 16th Jonn""ary, 1902, free"" be added. ; - Mr BROWN (Canobolas) - This is prac: tically the last series of items in this division, and ib has caused a considerable .amount of discussion. It has called forth ""the criticism of the bwo leading gladiators on the fiscal issue-the leader of the Opposition and the Minister for Trade and Customs. In bhis division, whilst we are dealing specifically with a number of items, we have a peculiar conglomeration. It includes articles from engines, boilers, and - pumps, down bo plated cutlery. One of the reasons why so much attention has been 'given to bhis ibem is the very large 'extent to which ib affects the mining industry, inasmuch as pretty well all the "" most expensive and complicated machinery - required in the production and treatment of 'minerals is included, and it is proposed, so far as the indusbry is affected by the Tariff in this way, bhat baxation bo the very large ' extenb of 25 per cenb. shall be levied. In the discussion of the preceding items I have taken the sband of endeavouring to secure what I consider reasonable and fair consider""ation for those of our population who are engaged in the primary industries or natural 'productions that are in operation here, and so far as my knowledge of the effect of the Tariff goes I am bound to con'fess that,whilst special privileges are given to ' those who are engaged in manufactures of 1 u secondary rather than a primary nature, and those who are engaged in the manufact u r e of articles that can never be expected to reach the proportions of natural in' dustries, such, for instance, as the manufac' ture of wax vesbas, so far as limiting com-, petition from oubside is aimed ab and .concerned, no like consideration has been given to the great mass who are eDgaged in the more primary forms of production,. ' arid in productions of a national character. This item comes under that particular category. Whilst it is proposed to levy a 25 per cent, duty on all the machinery that is jlbhe raw material of the miner, it is proposed to give that. amount of consideration td those who - happen to be engaged in the - manufacture of mining machinery. I hold' thab whilst the advantages proposed to bd conferred aff'ecb bub a very small secbion '. communiby,the disadvantages that will result therefrom affect a very large section of the| commuuiby, and one bo which we owe perhaps-more than to any obher our position in bhisCommonwealbh from a national stand-point. If it were nob for the development of the mining industry, and the natural advantages we possess through our mineral resources, we should not be the Commonwealth we are today. The settlement of' the country would not have reached its. present large dimensions, and our progress. would not have been so marked if ib had not been for our extensive mineral resources, and the large number of ourpopulabion engaged in bheir exploitation. In supporb of this view, I desire to direct the attention of the House to a pamphlet, which has recently been prepared by Coghlan, giving a summary of the mineral statistics of the whole of the States of the Commonwealth from 1861 to 1890. According to table 45 on page 16, the mineral wealth of New South Wales for the period referred to amounted to £132,000,000, whilstthat of Victoria totalled £260,000,000. Themineral wealth of Queensland amounted to £60,000,000, of South Australia to£25,000,000, of Western Australia to£23,000,000, and of Tasmania to17,000,000, or a tobal of £519,000,000. Of the total production of mineral wealth in New South Wales, gold represents. £48,000,000; silver, £30,000,000, andcopper £5,000,000; whereas in Victoria, gold represents £257,000,000 out of a total of"" £260,000,000. Whilst Victoria has had to face and solve the problem of dealing with what are known as refractory and low grade ores, she has not had bo cope wibh the difficulty to the same extent as havebhe obher Sbates of the Commonwealth. It is upon those engaged in dealing wibh these refractory and low-grade ores that the proposed duty on mining machinery will fall most heavily,- and I hold that it will operate to the detriment of the industry generally. It is in the interest of those who are engaged in mining, and particularly in the production of wealth from refractory and low-grade ores, that I appeal to the committee to vote against the Government proposal. It does not matter from what particular source wealth comes. Whetheri t is produced from the bowels of the earth, or is the outcome of complicated operations in the factory, ib is equally wealth, and the of the| production of ib is equally desirable. T do nob wish bo take any action that would in any way.prevent the legitimate production of wealth by means of manufactories, but all I ask is that reasonable consideration should be shown for those who are engaged in extracting wealth from other sources. I appeal to the committee to consider the position of the mining interests so far as the States of New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia are concerned, because these States have not been favoured to the same extent as Victoria with large gold deposits, capable of exploitation without the necessity of solving the problems of treatment which those engaged in mining in the other States have had to face. In that part of New South Wales which I have the honour of representing, there are large mineral deposits. In the initial stages the miners, like those in Victoria, had rich alluvial deposits to work upon, but now these have been exhausted, future mining operations must be of a more complicated and expensive character. Upon this subject. I havereceived communications from a number of mine managers, and practical miners of large experience, all of whom claim that the duty now under consideration, and the Tariff generally, will operate to the detriment of the mining industry. Among these letters is one from the representative of Orange in the State Legislature, who has had a life-long experience in mining, and knows what he is speaking about. He has had control of one of the largest mines in that district, and has been largely instrumental in bringing about its development. He states that he is now called upon as the manager of a mine, which is one of the deepest in New South Wales-operation s are now being carried on at about 1,200 feet below the surface-to face the problem of dealing profitably with low - grade ores. his endeavour to profitably treat these ores, he advised the large English company, which he represents, that it would be necessaryfcoexpend a considerable sum of money for the purchase of up-to-date machinery. That purchase, I understand, was practically agreed on, but when it became known what the effect of the Tariff would be in adding to the cost of this necessary machinery, it was decided to cancel the order.",16

20,Mr BROWN,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I am not in a position to say, because the manager did not me that information. 25 o 2",18
21,Sir JOHN QUICK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Mine s at Bendigo are worked at 3,000 feet.",18
22,Mr BROWN,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"We must recollect that between Bendigo mining and Lucknow mining there may be a wide difference, and the State member for Orange, who is the manager of the mine, and a very capable man, informs me that the problem he has to deal with is presented in the low grade ores.",18
23,Sir JOHN QUICK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,There are low grade ores afc Bendigo.,18
24,Mr BROWN,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,It was for the purpose of treating those low grade ores that special machinery was necessary.,18
25,Sir JOHN QUICK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Why were tenders not called for 1,18
26,Mr BROWN,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"It was because of the smaiiness of the margin, as shown in the cost of production, that the order was cancelled. I am quite satisfied from my acquaintance with the honourable member for Orange,fchafcif it .were possible to give preference to colonial machinery, he is the man to give that preference.",18
27,Sir JOHN QUICK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,He has not tried to get colonial machinery.,18
28,Mr BROWN,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"If the honourable and learned member can show that the manufacturers of Bendigo can produce this necessary machinery quite as well, and at the same cost as that at which the manager proposed to import it, I have not the least doubt that those manufacturers will speedily have an order. I have another communication from the manager of a property in my electorate, in which is invested something like £200,000 of English capital. This manager informs me that he has to deal with the low-grade problem, and that until recently he was working afc a very In narrow margin. He goes on to say that, as an outcome of the increased taxation, he has been compelled to dispense with the services of 100 men, and that it is a question which will have to be determined hy his company whether the mine shall be closed down or operations limited very considerably, or whether they will launch forth on the large scale which is considered necessary in order to make the mine pay. Right through the country of which I am speaking is an enormous mineral area, and whilst it is a fact that as auriferous country it has been rich, the auriferous deposit has give now been worked out. The problem which has to be faced in the future is deep sinking, and the treatment of refractory or low-grade ores. For such work there is required the most up-to-date machinery that can be obtained; and operations must be carried on at the minimum point of cost, in order to bring about development and establish the industry on a permanent basis. Further west in my electorate is another deposit of a more complicated character, carrying ores of gold, silver, and copper. For a considerable time this deposit was worked profitably, but the fall in the price of metal some years ago caused operations to be practically suspended. Owing, however, to an increase of prices, and more particularly owing to new and improved methods of treating the ores having been adopted, the properties in this area have been worked profitably for some years. They give promise of being established on a firm basis, and of opening up an immense area of country for profitable occupancy; and but for the mining I could see no possibility of satisfactory settlement for a considerable time to come, owing to the smaiiness of the rainfall. As the result of recent falling prices, and the increased cost of machinery and of living, caused by the Federal Tariff, the number of hands employed on the mining properties has been reduced; and the question is now being considered whether it would not be wise for the time being to suspend operations. I ask the committee this is not an industry of a national character. It is an industry which contains within it possibilities of infinitely greater wealth tkan can be looked for from the mere manufacture of mining machinery. If the mineral wealth is not here, the Government may impose a duty of 100 per cent, on mining machinery, and yet do very little towards developing the manufacture of the latter. thing necessary is to develop mining, and make a demand for machinery. that the Government, in the method which they have adopted, are sacrificing the mining interest for the benefit of a few manufacturers, and that their amounts to "" killing the goose with the golden egg."" I do not wish to labour this matter, which has been very ably dealt with by the leader of the Opposition and other honourable members. There are honourable members of the House who have practical mining knowledge in the different States, and who are in a Mr Brown. position to lay before us valuable information. But I should like to refer honourable members to an article in the Australian Mining Standard, which is a very ably conducted journal, published specially in the interests of mining. The matter which finds expression in the columns of this journal may be regarded as different from that in the daily press, in so far as this particular publication represents the requirements of the mining industry, and is conducted by experts who thoroughly know the subjects with which they deal. The article takes the ground I have taken from the outset, namely, that the industry is natural to this country, and one to which the Commonwealth in no small degree owes its present position amongst the peoples of the world. It is contended that the mining industry forms one of the items of wealth production in the Commonwealth, and that because of its pioneer character-becaus e of the diffi- culties and disadvantages with which those engaged in it have to contend, when they are compelled to go into the wildsand deny themselves the conveniences of civilizationadditional burdens should not be imposed upon it as proposed by the Government. This writer summarizes the extent to which the States at the present tune are dependent upon this source of wealth. He states that Western Australia derives 60 per cent, whether of its total wealth from its mineral production, Tasmania 50 per cent., Queensland. 18 per cent., New South Wales 16 per cent., Victoria 12 per cent., and South Australia 5J per cent., or an average all round of approximately 18 per cent. These figures indicate the important factor which mineral wealth represents in the general development of the States. During the course of this debate a big point has been The first made of the great advance which has taken place in the manufacture of mining I hold machinery in Victoria. It is claimed that this State is capable of competing with the most up-to-date machinery manufactured in any other part of the world, and that it conduct can produce it as cheaply. If that be so, there can be no objection to the Tariff submitted. But the writer to whom I have already referred holds quite a different view. Speaking of Victoria he saysIts method of mining, of management, of gained reduction and extraction, are unfavorably criticised by every visiting expert.",18
29,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Who is the writer ?,19
30,Mr BROWN,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I am quoting the encourage opinion of the editor of the Australian MinThe ing Standard, who says that the opinion - visiting experts is to the effect that torian mining, as far as the reduction extraction of gold from ores is concerned, not up to the standard which obtains in other parts of the world. He then goes on to show to what extent this Tariff will affect existing mining enterprises which conducted upon a large scale, particularly assuredly go under. in Western Australia. I have already shown to what degree it will affect the inspecial dustiy in New South Wales, and this exance. pert authority sums up the position thusAs we have pointed out on more than one vious occasion, however it may apply to others, the miner is a man who derives ticle of benefit from protection either directly indirectly. He stands in dread of no competitor. He asks for no assistance at the expense of neighbour. His product is an article the market price of which protection is powerless advance, and it is one that must be exported fore its value can be realized. If Australasian could not be exported it would be a worthless drug. Silver, copper, tin, and lead are in same case ; yet protection anathematizes export, and concerns itself only about local manufacture. Nevertheless, the miner, though he derives benefit from protection, must pay its full cost in the advanced price of every dutiable import uses, and every local manufacture it affects, be is now called upon to do this at a time his industry is fighting against a serious sion caused by the market decline in the value of products. Silver, copper, tin, lead, are down, and only taxes are up. Who can gainsay that? The proposal to bare levy a duty of something like 25 per cent, upon the machinery that is required for development of this particular industry may seem a very small charge to the cased protectionists of Victoria, but by those who come from the other States, particularly from New South Wales and Western Australia, where the industry plays such an important part in the wealth production, and where hitherto mining machinery has been included in the free list, it must be regarded as a very serious and heavy impost indeed. As I have than already stated, the mineral deposits of those States can scarcely be regarded as being in proposed. the same category as the minerals of Victoria. The Victorian miners have not been confronted with the same problems as the other States have had to face. In New South Wales the miners have had to deal with low grade and refractory ores which are not susceptible of easy treatment. hold that it is necessary that we should this form of wealth production. miners do not ask us to favour them in of any particular. They know very well tnat Victhey have tocompete with the whole world. and No form of taxation which the Government is can impose can save them from competition with the low-paid labour of other countries, and even with the black labour of some parts of the world. If they are not prepared to are compete under these conditions they must All that they ask is to be left alone. They seek for no concession, ask for no special assistI t would be fruitless for them to do so. But they do urge that they should not. prebe loaded with crushing burdens for the some sake of a comparative few who might be no parbenefited by this tax. I hope that the or committee will see the reasonableness of his giving this great industry every consideration. Personally, I should like this Parliato ment to copy the example of New South beWales by placing mining machinery on the gold free list; but, failing that, the proposed the duty should be reduced at least to 10 or 15 per cent. We have levied a duty of 15 per cent, upon the implements used by the no farmer, and it appears to me that the he agricultural industry is upon all fours with and the mining industry. It would not be just when to place the large body of miners throughdepresout the Commonwealth at any greater diszinc, all advantage than that under which our farmers labour. We shall be doing only justice to both these great industries if we put them upon the same level as the the Government have put protected industries. For example, where they have protected hardthe manufacturer of cloth or of other articles, they have been careful in nearly and every instance to exempt from duty the machineiy required for their manufacture. To adopt a similar course here would be only a matter of common equity, and I will undertake to say that, by placing mining machinery upon the free list, the Commonwealth would benefit to a greater extent it will by the imposition of any taxation of a protective character such as is",20
31,Mr MAUG ER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR," I am fully aware of the value of time, and the necessity for bringing the debate on this item to a close as quickly as possible.

Eor intelligence, force character, and power of combination, I do not'think the miner can be excelled. I am sure that the miner of Victoria, at rate, and I think I know him pretty well, is quite prepared to make a sacrifice, sacrifice is involved-and I say there is sacrifice involved-in order to open up avenues of employment that will distinctly benefit himself and his family.",20

The honourable member for Maranoa is quite wrong when he says that this assistance has been .given only to wealthy mining companies.

49,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"That is so, but my honourable friend has heard the reasoning that this duty is going to press heavily upon .mining companies, and that they in turn will have to reduce wages or discharge their hands. If mining companies have been given handsome support by the State, should not that act in the other way, and should they not in consequence be able to give increased employment, which would benefit the working miners ?",22

Surely that is a reasonable proposal, which must commend itself to every patriotic citizen of Australia ?",22
54,Mr THOMAS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Is it not fair to put it the - other way about ? Seeingfchafcthe Government taxes mining companies by extra taxation upon the machinery they use, ought they not therefore to subsidize them in the way they do 1",22
55,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I have yefc to have it proved that mining companies are taxed by - duties upon machinery, because I hold that - a protective duty is not a tax. If it is - effective it will secure competition in the home market, and that local competition will cut down prices, and those wsing mining machinery will be benefited as the result of that competition. I hold in my hand a petition from a body of men; equally as deserving of support and encouragement, and who, I am sure, will command the respect of this committee f quite as much as do the miners-and .1I have told honourable members my attitude towards the miners.

56,Mr THOMAS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Nex t to the lawyers : the lawyers are first.,22
57,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I am very much obliged for the interjection, because when we hear lawyers strongly advocating free-, dom of trade, knowing all the protection, they have for their own profession, I begin fco think what a pifcy it is fchafc we cannot have free-trade in law for a little time, so; that we may derive some benefit from it. I find that there are no less than 15,675: men employed in the various engineering and' machine manufacturing works throughout the Commonwealth. In presenting this, statement of their case, I am acting on behalf of these men, who are unanimous in 1 their desire that the Commonwealth Parliament should not take any step that would > be likely to crush out what, from every/ point of view, is one of the best industries in Australia. So far as I have heard, there: is no sweating in the engineering trade.. Engineers and ironfounders pay good wages.. The men belong in the majority of instancesfco trades unions, and are respectable citizens. In a statement signed by their executive officer, they say 'tlieir manufacf tures includeManufactures of metals, steam engines,' machinery, agricultural implements, bicycles, portable engines, gas engines, oil engines,' forgings and cast-iron work of all descriptions. We have here some of the ablest workmen, some, of the most skilled artisans in the world, and we : contend almost any class of machinery can be manufactured in the Commonwealth. They go on to urge that if we reduce the duty-to say nothing about wiping it out; . as the honourable member for Barrier pro-, poses-the result must be disastrous; that when, upon the revision of the old Victorian Tariff, the duty was reduced from 35 to 25 per cent., hundreds of men were thrown out of employment, and machinery manufactured previously in this State was imported from either Germany or America.",22
58,Mr VL SOLOMON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,When did that revision of the Victorian Tariff take place ?,23
59,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,In 1896.,23
60,Mr VL SOLOMON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,That was about the time of the great depression in Victoria.,23
61,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"No ; we were then beginning to emerge from it. It is a remarkable fact that, while every one of the industries in Victoria in connection with which the duties were reduced in 1896, showed a decrease of employment subsequently, all those industries in relation which the duties were increased or remained stationary showed a marked increase in the number of their employees.  member account for machineiy being sent from Queensland to South Australia, notwithstanding a duty of 25 per cent., and from Victoria to Queensland, where a duty of 25 per cent, had also to be paid ?",23
62,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,There may have been very many reasons for it . ,23
63,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I will. As an illustration of what frequently takes place, I would point out that the Otis Engineering Company, for example, may have been slack at the time. They have in their employ some of the best skilled mechanical engineers whose services they are anxious to retain, and in times of depression they frequently build and stock a large quantity of machinery that they are very glad to sell, even at a loss, in order to continue to vide work for their workmen, and so retain their services. M i . PAGE - Bot h of the plants I refer to were made to order.",23
64,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"There may have been other reasons of which I know nothing, but the honourable member may be sure that they were very good reasons. As in Victoria, so in America. Whenever there has been an undue reduction of duty, there has been a decrease in the number of hands, a reduction in wages, and a general stagnation of trade. That is a matter of history, and it is borne out by the statement of the secretary of the Engineers' Society. We want, as far as possible, to mitigate that evil. I regret very much to say that there appears to be a tendency on the part of public bodies, as well as private citizens, to deprecate everything Australian,  the honourable member supports do that.",23

67,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"My honourable friend would not like to see the Government displaced. He has thrown up his hat time.? out of number for the good work they are doing. I am no apologist for them any to more than I am an apologist for protectionists who occasionally vote free-trade because the industry affected does not happen to be in their own State. I hate inconsistency of any kind, and am no apologist for it .",23
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,The honourable member does not object to a little inconsistency now and again.,23
69,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I think I have been a. consistent protectionist ever since I entered public life. There may have been a lapse occasionally, but we are all inclined to that, not excepting my honourable friend. I was. pointing out, when interrupted, that there is a strong and growing tendency on the part of mining companies, city councils, and public boards, to deprecate everything. Australian or Australian-made.",23
70,Mr KNOX,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,It U quite a mistake to say that.,23
71,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I speak of that which I know. I have had frequently to head pro- deputations to the Melbourne.and Metropolitan Board of Works, to point out to them, that Victorian manufacturers are able to build engines as good as any that can be made in any part of the world. But for the duty on imported machinery we should not have been able to induce them to place the orders in question locally. The duty made it imperative that, in order to. save £ 8 0 0 or £900, as the case might be, the members of the board should vote forhaving the machinery made in the State.",23

74,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,They are supposed to be a very strong protectionist Government.  Germany for railway carriage springs ?,24
75,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I am not aware that they have done so. If they had done so while I was a member of the State Parliament I should have moved a motion of censure on them. It appears to me that Australians, are quite good enough to fight for the Empire, and to fight loyally, but they are not good enough, when it comes to making their own necessaries. people will send to Germany, Italy, Prance, or America, but they will not have. Australian-made goods. I am sure that if our workmen are only given fair play, they can produce machinery as good and as cheap as can be produced in any part of the world. I should like to point out that the machinery involved in this item does not relate solely to mining. Let us admit, for the sake of argument, that the proposal to place a duty of 25 per cent, on mining machinery is too high, and that it should be reduced to 15 per cent. I would remind honourable members that this item is of such a drag-net character, that it includes machinery which, it is admitted on all hands, can be made in Australia just as effectively and as cheaply as in any other part of the world. Why subject that class of machinery to undue competition ? There is electrical machinery, for instance. I have here a statement, both by employers and employees in Victoria, setting forth thatWe lire in a position to build any t3'pe of motor, dynamo, or generator in use.",24
76,Mr KNOX,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Who says that ?,24
77,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"This letter is signed both by emplo} es and employers connected r with electrical works in Melbourne, and I shall be happy to escort the honourable member over the works. I am sure the honourable member is like the Presbyterian kitten; he only wants his eyes opened. 'Once that is done, he will change his colour, and support the proposals of the Government. The firm whose letter I am about to quote have made direct-current dynamos and motors, alternating-current dynamos and motors, electric locomotives, and haulage plants for mining and other purposes, and electric pumps, and have already built machines up to 500 horse-power. They say that they have made about 20 per cent, of all the motors in use in Melbourne. As to thequality of their work, they sayWe have built work for some of the best knowrii English makers for use in the colonies, and have, at their request, put on their name-plateonly. This, we think, should be conclusive evidence as to quality.",24
78,Mr THOMAS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Why is that done ?,24

80,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHAKN,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Who does, it? Some Mr Mauger - Quite a number of firms. I can give the honourable member the name of my authority, and then he can. make inquiries for himself. It is well known that Australian work is continually being put upon the market and sold as. English or American work. In one of our largest distributing houses, when they run out of certain lines of paint brushes, they get unstamped brushes from a local manufacturer, and sell them as English-madebrushes.",24
81,Mr THOMAS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Is not that fraudulent ?,24
82,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,The honourable member is now reflecting upon the importers. I understood him atfirstfcoreflectupon the manufacturers. I do not believe that the manufacturers would do a thing of fchafc kind.,24

87,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Yes . I am colonially clad from top to bottom, including umbrella and necktie. The letter continuesElectric motors, dynamos, generators, &c.,. although not specially mentioned in the Victorian Tariff, were always classed as comingunder machinery. We would therefore ask you, when this item comes on for discussion, to usayour influence in having the same classification fixed, unless machinery is cut down below Mr. Kingston's proposals (23 per cent.) If such reduction is made by the House we would like electric motors, dynamos, generators, &c, to be .subject to 2d per cent. - Surely if this machinery can be made here, .and sold as cheaply as the imported article, it is the duty of the committee to do all that is possible to foster the industry.",24

89,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I cannot say how many - are employed in it ; but the possibilities ,of - electricity are unbounded, and if you ,give - our electrical machinists and engineers a fair chance, an avenue of employment will be opened up which will be very advantageous to the people of the Commonwealth.  member call a fair chance-5 0 per cent ?",25
90,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Were it not for the - requirements of revenue, I think it would be a good thing for the people of Australia - to put on a duty of 50 per cent. As to the - effect of protection upon prices, the following opinion of Mr Webb, the late Victorian Minister of Agriculture, will be of interest. Replying to a deputation, he is reported to have said thatAs far as his expei-ience went, he found that ""the cost of a factory was not increased by the Ihigh dufces. Two years ago he bought an engine - and boiler for £160, and now they could be bought for £127, though in the meantime the - duty had been raised to 33 per cent. On the - other hand, a 90 gallon cream separator, which - cost £47 10s. before the duty was taken off sold at the same price. Similar effects were apparent in regard to reapers and binders. The effect of duties may be to temporarily raise' prices to the consumers, but when a number of factories get into full play prices are reduced again. I have evidence, and the Minister for Trade and Customs has evidence, of the fact that nearly all the machinery required for the Commonwealth - could be manufactured in the country. If the honourable member for Barrier can cite instances of patented machinery which is not likely to be made here, or cannot be made here with profit to the manufacturer .and advantage to the consumer, I shall be ready to join with him in getting it introduced free of duty ",25
91,Mr KNOX,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Will the honourable member say, since he knows that the effect of protection is to make everything cheaper, whether the consumers are crying out for Ihigh duties ?",25
92,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,The constitution of this committee goes to show that the consumers are in favour of reasonable duties. There can be no doubt that that is so in Victoria. Ninety-nine out of eveiy 100 consumers in the district which I represent are in favour of duties of all kinds which will give Australian workmen a preference.,25
93,Mr THOMAS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,That is because they believe that the duties make things cheaper.,25
94,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"They know that they get boots, clothing, machinery, and everything else more cheaply now than before they had protection. I ask my honourable friend, in endeavouring to obtain the removal of the duty upon mining machinery, not to try to get rid of the duty upon all machinery.",25
95,Mr THOMAS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"If the committee will let mining machinery come in free, they may do what they like with other machinery.",25
96,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"The committtee would undoubtedly be ready to admit free mining machinery which cannot be made here, but I know as a matter of fact that within a mile of this building there are spring factories employing men at good wages which would be shut down tomorrow if the radical amendment of the honourable member were carried. I urge that the importance of the machinery - making industry, the petition presented by the society of engineeers, and the representations of the manufacturers should be regarded, and that still if the committee makes a concession in the case of mining machineiy, it should retain the proposed duties upon the other machinery covered by the item.",25
97,Mr GLYNN,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR," I do not intend to refer generally to the question of machinery. I thoroughly agree with all the remarks which the honourable member for Barrier made in his excellent speech in asking that the articles included in this item should be duty free. I think that the Opposition is under a debt of gratitude to the honourable member for having during the adjournment gone to Broken Hill to make himself thoroughly conversant with the whole case from the point of view of the miner. I should like, as I may not be here when the division is taken, having to - leave, to draw attention to the item of engines. The committee will remember that oil engines have been placed on the free list. 1 do. not know why in the .administration of the Tariff a duty of 25 per cent, is still collected on some oil engines. I know that when oil engines were removed from the earlier portion of item 74 they fell under the particular part we are now dealing with-""n.e.i.""-and so would be subject to a duty of 25 per cent.; but I could not for a moment imagine that the Government would use that drag-net, and take advantage of the fact that the committee desire to put them on the free list.",25
98,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Can the honourable and learned member give us a specific instance in which that has been done?,26
99,Mr GLYNN,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,I had a letter this morning which seems to be a case in point.,26
100,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"If the and learned member will send it to us we .shall have it investigated. Certainly, a mistake has been made.",26
101,Mr GLYNN,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I am not going into the particulars, but I have a case where the duty has been collected, after remonstrance, on motors which are worked by volatile oil, and they come under the trade term of oil engines. However, if the Treasurer tells me that the matter will be corrected, I shall send him the letter.",26
102,Sir GEORGE TUBNEB,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,AV e shall have it inquired into.,26
103,Mr GLYNN,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Oi l engines are at present on the free list, according to the declared policy of the Government.",26
104,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,At present.,26
105,Mr GLYNN,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"The Treasurer declared that he intended to put them on the .free list, but that he might consider the policy of giving a bonus for their manufacture.",26
106,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,We propose later on to ask the committee to reconsider that - question.,26
107,Mr GLYNN,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I hope that the committee will do nothing of the sort. I know that there is some idea of the Government recanting on the liberality they displayed in putting oil engines on the free list. As regards gas engines, which are subject to a 25 per cent, duly under this head, I am informed by men competent to judge that ' there is no true trade distinction between gas engines and oil engines, and that if one ought to be free the other should. Oil engines are worked by gas generated from - oil; steam engines are really worked by gas .generated from water, and gas engines are worked by coal gas. As a matter of fact, - some exporters can send gas engines here as oil engines, because by attaching a modern invention- a vaporizer- a gas engine can be used as an oil engine. I believe that on the Continent they are described in some of the advertisements as engines capable of being worked by coal gas or by oil gas. Under these circumstances, there really is no distinction between the two types, and there is no reason why, one having been put on the free list, the other should not also be exempt from duty. The purchasers of gas engines are entitled to equal consideration even with the farmers, who are, I believe, the chief purchasers of oil engines.",26
108,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"But the oil engines were put on the free list by mistake. honourable Mr Glynn - I dare say that something was found out afterwards which did not suit the local trade. However, gas engines are largely used by small men. They are used by small printers, by workers who are ambitious to become employers; and if you put on the free list, as you have done, the. linotype machine, which dispenses to a larjp extent with labour-the rich employer's machine- I cannot see why gas1 engines, the machinery 'of the poor printer, should not also be put on the free list. Then, as regards the. employment given, the honourable member for. Melbourne Ports has mentioned that if this machineiy could not be manufactured here, he would not insist upon protection for the manufacturers. There has been protection to the extent of 30 per cent, on these engines for over twelve years in Victoria. There are, I am informed, only 35 persons engaged in the manufacture of gas-engines in Victoria. There are two leading manufacturers, and one has 10 employees and the other 25i In New South Wales, I believe, there is only one manufacturer. He does not work the whole week. His output for two and a quarter years has not totalled ten engines. So that the protection in Victoria indicates that the high rate of even 30 per cent, has not brought about the results anticipated by those who framed its Tariff. There is a reason why the local production of engines cannot successfully compete against importers. In America, in England, and to some extent on the Continent, the manufacturer of particular engines is a speciality. One manufacturer turns out a gas-engine of a particular class, and another manufacturer makes a gas.engine of another class. But with our limited market, as has been insisted upon by the honourable member for Barrier, it does not pay manufacturers to experiment upon new types. I am informed by two or three importers, that the principal type of gasengine here-almos t the only type-is the Otto; that, in fact, the local manufacturers make from the expired patent, and in some cases the new inventions imported are able to work at an expenditure of 40 per cent, less than the engines which are locally turned out on the expired patent, a 'matter that is of exceedingly great importance to the purchaser. Upon that point, as showing the difficulty without a large market of even old manufacturers turning out new classes of machines, I shall quote from n letter by a leading importer which I received yesterday from AdelaideManufacturers have not the plant and ence necessary to build such large engines. To show the difficulty of attempting the building such large engines without experience, we may mention that a reputable firm in England had been making good small engines took a contract for four 100 horse-power engines, and the behaviour of those was so erratic that after months' use they were all taken out; If mines find gas-engines necessary to economical working, why practically force them to the liability similar experience as that mentioned ? In another paragraph of the letter he bears out what I stated as regards the manufacturing from the expired patentWe beg to point out that all engines tralia that we know of work on our principal's expired patent, namely the ""Otto"" patent, nothing practically has come forward in Australia to supersede it. If anj'thing did, a patent give ample protection. The duty of 25 per cent, means - of course 27-Jper cent., and I am informed that import charge is 20 per cent. You have therefore got for these gas-engines a tection of 47i per cent., which seems to monstrous. The price of the local engine, to say nothing about quality, is only 5"" cent, less than that of the imported engine, although the protection afforded is 47^ per cent. I shall give one instance which ought to be fairly conclusive, from the point of view of the miner, as to the inexpediency imposing heavy taxation on these engines. I have a letter which shows that, before tion here. In the initial the Tariff, an impQrter in South quoted £5,000 as the price of certain mining machinery. The Tariff, however, was introduced before the order had been carried out, and he was compelled to re-quote his price with an addition which made £6,300, and whether this mining plant is taken .or not will depend Mr Glynn. upon whether the duty of 25 per cent, remains upon the Tariff. As to the incidence of the duty, I could quote from various invoices. I have an invoice here which shows that a gas engine which costs£ 4 0 in England, and which upon being' landed here costs, with the import chargesand the addition of 10 per cent., £ 4 8 8s.,. is subject to charges after landing amounting to £ 1 5 16s. 3d. In other words, there is the difference between £ 4 0 and something like £ 6 0 in favour of the local manufacturer. I think these considerations will certainly justify the committee in treating gas engines with much greater liberality than is proposed. If we do not succeed in placing the whole of the engines, n.e.i., on the free list, gas engines, which are experivery largely purchased by miners, ought of certainly to be exempted from duty.",26
109,Mr RONALD,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Southern Melbourne) who I sincerely hope that the proposal of the Government will be carried, as I regard it as twelve in the highest sense reasonable. We must not forget that in the very near future the of a raw material used by moulders and other workers in iron will be subject to a duty imposed with a view to promote its production within our own borders. There is no doubt that within the Commonwealth we have large iron deposits-in Tasmania, in Ausin New South Wales, and elsewhere-and and we may look forward with confidence to the establishment of smelting furnaces in would Australia. This, however, cannot be expected, unless a duty is placed upon the rawmaterial. Meanwhile, the workers in the iron within the Commonwealth are almost wholly dependent upon scrap iron for their proraw material. At one time there was an be export duty of £ 3 per ton on scrapiron in Victoria, but that has now been taken per off, with the result that Chinamen are gathering up the iron and shipping it out of the country. Very soon, therefore, our iron workers will be deprived of their present source of supply, and will have to fall back of upon the raw material produced by the blast furnaces that we hope to see in operastages of Australia smelting operations, the price of the raw material required by moulders will undoubtedly be raised, and they will have to pay the duty of 10per cent, imposed for the protection of the smelters. A 15 per it cent, duty upon the manufactured article particular would reduce the protection granted to the iron worker's to 5 per cent., which would be of no value whatever. If we are to have manufacturers could not compete. protection, we do not want it merely i name, and the imposition of anything less than a 25 per cent, duty would have - disastrous effects upon the iron-working dustry. Within a short distance of this House, I could place my hand upon 250 moulders and expert workers in iron, and this number probably only one-fifth have been able to obtain work since the great duction of the duties on iron in Victoria. Therefore, unless we wish to throw more these men into the ranks of the unemployed, I would ask the committee to very.seriously ,-consider the position. The iron industry of the utmost importance to any comshould munity. We can do without a great many things, but not without iron. The day will come, I hope, when we shall do our own ship-building and bridge-building, but unless our industries are to be stifled, in the time we must insist upon having something more than mere nominal protection. A same time, it should be understood that no protectionist who is a sane man would try to impose a duty upon mining machinery which cannot be made within the Commonand wealth. We have always shown the utmost indulgence to all patented articles used the dairying and farming industry, and are prepared to do our best to prevent those - engaged in the primary industries from being unnecessarily handicapped. If it be shown that certain machines are indisported 2>ensible to miners and cannot be produced here, there is not a man in this Chamber who will not readily say that such articles .should be admitted free. If , however, - can make them here and employ our own men in preference to foreigners, we should the duty proposed, in order to give our local promise. industries the necessary protection. Many parents are apprenticing their sons - come workers in iron, and this affords one - of the best outlets for the energies of young people. If , however, we afford protection to the industry, our skilled workers will have no chance of holding - their own against the cheaply-paid labour be paid. - of the old world. We shall have no difficulty in competing with countries where the wages paid are equal to those received by - our own artisans, but we do fear, and with good cause, the cheaply-paid labour of the continent, by means of which our markets can be flooded with material sent here at very low freights, to be sold at prices with which our local The n effect of admitting these foreign goods free will be to throw our own artisans out of employment, and give work to the foreigners. inI hope the present duties will be considered in view of the certainty of a duty being placed upon the raw material, which will of reduce the protection afforded to our iron workers to a merely nominal amount, unless rethe Government proposal is adhered to. Mr .KNO X (Kooyong) - I find that the of information which I had desired to lay before the committee is being gradually brought under the notice of members, and is that very little is left for me to say. I like to state at the outset that whilst I sit on this side of the chamber and theoretically believe in the principle of free trade, I do not consider it my duty to go to the extreme point of that theoretical faith. meanI dissent from the position that the Tariff is not to be considered in the light of a comt the promise. I was returned to this House, not to press free-trade theories, nor to assist protected industries, but to regard first the financial necessities of the Commonwealth, to give to industries now in existence such incidental protection as is possible. As in to whether the proposal of the Government we is intended to be a fair and reasonable compromise, I may, perhaps, be permitted to refer to actual figures relating to Western can Australia. In 1900, Western Australia immachineryto the value of £3,023,0S5, upon which duty, on the separate Tariff of that State, was paid to the amount of £151,155. That machinery, under the prowe posed Federal Tariff, would pay duty - amounting to £ 7 5 5 , 7 5 0 ; and that, I venimpose ture to think, is not a reasonable com",27
110,Mr KENNEDY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,That machinery would to benot all come under this heading.,28
111,Mr KNOX,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I am dealing with maour chineiy on which, under the specific Tariff no of Western Australia, £151,000 would have to be paid, and on which, under the Federal Tariff, as proposed, £755,000 will have to",28
112,Mr KENNEDY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"It would amount to £20,000 under this heading.",28
113,Mr KNOX,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"If there is any difficulty about these headings, the responsibility must lie with the Government, who, in the judgment of a large number of honourable members, have not placed before the committee a suffieienthy analytical statement in I regard to the various items. I cannot take the responsibility of determining what the intentions of the Government are, and I am now dealing with the whole of the items in connection with the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Barrier. Having seen what the effect will be in Western Australia, let us look at the position in New South Wales. The value of the machineiy imported into New South Wales in 1900 was £655,975, which, of course, was free of duty. The Government propose to add to that a fourth, which amounts to £163,000.",28
114,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"But the honourable member is assuming that all that machinery will pay duty ; as a fact, it will not be so.",29
115,Mr KNOX,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I ""will make that qualification, if the right honourable gentleman will allow me. I am prepared to admit that, ticcording to the offer made by the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customslast night, there will be a considerable free list. And, as I desire to be absolutely fair, I acknowledge that the conditions will be very much altered by the benefits which the Commonwealth will derive from interstate free-trade, a blessing which we have now secured. I am bound, however, with the qualifications I have admitted, to show the hardship which will fall on Western Australia and New South Wales if the Government proposals are carried out. But I feel that the Minister for Trade and Customs must have seen that the sense of the House is in favour of a considerable reduction, and I am perfectly persuaded that ultimately we,shall get a just and reasonable compromise between the proposal of the honourable member for Barrier and that of the Government. The Minister for Trade and Customs last night challenged honourable members to indicate any machineiy which could not be serviceably produced in the Commonwealth. I can give the right honourable gentleman a list of such machinery, beginning with certain tubular boilers. If the right honourable gentleman desireSj I can give him many reasons why these boilers, which are protected by special patents, cannot be made here, and show that they are an absolute necessity where inland carriage is an important item. I can refer also to air-compressor plants and pumps,and - the Riedler valve, which mean the expenditure of large sums of money. There is a certain class o£ amalgamating plant - which is protected by patents, and cannot be.made in Australia. The parts .canbe made here, but the owners of the patents prefer that they should be made in their own countries. Then there are various, blowers for furnaces. Every one knows that while a blower for ordinary purposes might be made here, when we want high speed and high pressure, and a large volume of air per cubic inch, we must have the highest class of blowers, which are protected by special patents in Europe and America, and cannot possibly be produced in the Commonwealth. I can also refer to crushers, briquettin'g plant, conveyors and elevators, and Luhrig fanners, and also to special kinds of concentrating tables, converter machinery, condensing plants with special appliances, and certain rock drills, consumers and superheaters. I would here like to refer to the prejudice which is said to exist against locally made articles ; but in which I absolutely decline to believe. In my opinion the honourable member for Melbourne Portsis absolutely without justification in the statement he made.",29
116,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,In regard to what 1,29
117,Mr KNOX,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,The statement that there is a prejudice in favour of a foreign article as against the local article which can beobtained at the same price and of equal quality.,29
118,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"The honourable memberought to be in trade, and he would change his opinion.",29
119,Mr KNOX,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I am prepared to show that the companies with which I am associated! purchase, possibly, more mining machinery and more mining plant than any other similarcompanies in Australia. I desire, as oneinterested in this question, to show the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs that there are at the present time being introduced into this country what areknown as heat economizers and super-heaters,, which, owing to the patent protection, noone dare make in Australia. These appliances cost £5,000 to land in Tasmania, and the saving to be effected in heat is equal to25 per cent., so that the outlay is repaid in four years. I refer to this matter in orderto show from a practical stand-point whatessential factors of success in miningenterprise in Australasia lie in theeconomies to be effected in the treatment of low-grade andcomplex ores. Then there are the A b t engines, and Abtrack rails for steep grades. Last nightthe Minister for Trade and Customs very fairly agreed that every opportunity should be given for placing such articles upon the free list, or, at any rate, allowing such a reduction to be made upon them as would materially assist the industry. But had the intention of the framers of the Tariff been carried into effect, most of these articles, which it is absolutely impossible to manufacture locally, would have been compelled to bear the burden of this enormous duty of 25 per cent. ' Recently I got one of the best authorities upon metallurgical and mining matters to favour me with his opinion in regard to the economies which might be effected in mining machinery. I do not wish to advertise that gentleman in any way, and, therefore, I refrain from giving publicity to his name, but certainly ho stands acknowledged us probably the best authority upon the subject in Australasia. I shall, however, be very happy to supply his name privately to the two Ministers at the table. He says The economy in mining machineiy may be said to have two distinct features, first the economy of maintenance, and secondly the economy in a machine having u larger capacity over one of a less. The greatest expense in maintaining machinery to accomplish* the work is the amount of fuel expended to do this work - It is a well-known fact that the latest types of engines, pumps, and compressors show a saving in fuel from 10 percent, to' 15 per cent, and, in some cases, even more. This saving is accomplished by a first class design, and in a good many cases by patented features of such machinery. A further saving in fuel is accomplished by machinery and appliances invented in the last years, viz. : Superheaters, economizers, &o. Where in the past it was not considered neeessaiy to make use of every unit of waste heat, it has now become a practice with economical maintenance to use such patented appliances, even at the great first cost. As is well known, from year to year it is the Striving of the mines to increase the capacities of their output atfchesame cost of running In Western Australia that very feature is most prominent. It is clear that the rate of the returns in that great mineral country must decline. The average yield per ton of ore will have to be reduced, and, in future, the profits to be derived must be secured by increasing the quantity of ore put through the various processes of reduction and treatment. The authority whom T have quoted continuesThis is, to a very great extent, accomplished by machinery which is improved from time to time. I may mention here the fact; that eight years ago the capacity of a 20-inch steam stamp higher. was atfcheaverage of about 250 tons per day ; whileafc the present time a steam stamp of - the same size, and working under ; Tarif. SS7-5 conditions, and with the same kind of ore, has a. capacity of about 350 tons. This increased capacity is due to several novel features in the desiffa of the mortar, screen surface, and foundation. Also, the ordinary stamp mill of today has approximately 20 per cent, to 30 per cent, morecapacity than that of six or eight years ago. This is alsofchecase with most offchemining machinery, and has enabled mines being opened up and worked afc a profit, which heretofore could not. have been thought of. I refer to this fact because the mines atBendigo are using the same class of crushing stamp as they used 10 or 20 years ago. They are denying themselves the benefitthat would accrue from the employment of a higher class of machinery which would give better and more effective results. I do not wish to be misunderstood. My desire is to see every piece of machinery that is used upon our mines manufactured within theborders of the Commonwealth. I say that unhesitatingly. It would be to the advantage of the country if the machinery could, be manufactured locally, but the character of the various articles which I have: enumerated suggests that we are going in an entirely wrong direction when we suppose that we are benefiting themining industry in Australia by endeavouring at the present stage of ourhistoiy to maintain a number of manufactories within the States at an extreme rate of duty. It has been said that themachinery which is locally manufactured is. equal to any that can be imported. In support of this statement, I may mention that the total expenditure upon plant and! machinery by the Broken Hill Proprietary Companj' up to the 30th May, 1901, was£1,213,114. I have been at considerable pains to ascertain how much of that amount was expended upon imported machinery, and 1 find that, speaking roughly, it represents one-fourth. That was for machinery which cannot be efficiently and properly made here. So faras that company is concerned, the honourable member must confess that there was noleaning in favour of the importer, as against the local manufacturer.",29
120,Mr KINGSTON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Is the honourable member contending that the local price must be quite as low as the imported price ? Would, he not give a preference to the local manufacturer, . even if his price were a little. Mr KNOX - No , I do not think that the same would be a business proposition",30
121,Mr KINGSTON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"The honourable member - would be prepared to concede something to - the local manufacturer, even at a slightly .higher price 1",31
122,Mr KNOX,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I think that as a pure matter of business, we are entitled to con-sider only what will do the work most efiectively at the cheapest price at which we can secure it .",31
123,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,That is the free-trade doctrine.,31
124,Mr WILKS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,It is the other doctrine too.,31
125,Mr KNOX,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"That is the doctrine held ""by every business man. who sits on the - opposite side of the House, and it is the law - of supply and demand which"" controls the whole world, and which no legislation will - ever upset.",31
126,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,It is being upset every - day. ..,31
127,Mr KNOX,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I am dealing at the present moment with the suggestion that there is a prejudice in favour of the foreign manufacturer. I have stated what Broken Hill has spent upon machinery, and the Mount Lyell Company has spent up to - date £664,206 purely in plant and mining .machinery. Of that sum, less than one-fourth was spent upon imported machinery. I - wish to show where the prejudice comes in. M'.ount Lyell today would not be in exist-ence if it had not been for a special class of machineiy, which had to be imported from America. I refer to the Bessemer converters, the hot stoves, and the special .material which I went to America to secure for the purpose of treating the Mount Lyell - ores. The patent rights for this machinery have expired, and we freely gave to the local manufacturers the plans of the machinery which were brought here by the metallurgical expert who came here to take - charge of the works. An y manufacturer in Australia had the right to view these plans, and they have now been able to make these big converter vessels and - special class of stoves, and they can make them successfully. If we had imposed a prohibitive duty upon the various special machines brought here, - probably Mount Lyell would never have been opened up today, and the various manufactories throughout the State that have benefited by the lessons learnt from the plans phiced at tlieir disposal would have lost all that work.",31
128,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Nobody suggests prohibition.,31
129,Mr KINGSTON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"-Does the, honourable member say that the difference between 4s. and 5s. is prohibition ?",31
130,Mr KNOX,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"So far as the Tariff is concerned, the Government are asking for os. We want 4s., and I hope it will be less than 4s. before the discussion is completed. Another company. has spent £72,000 in machinery. I have tried to work out the proportion, and I find there is no foreign prejudice in this case, inasmuch as only £15,000 of that sum was spent upon machinery imported from a foreign market. I wish at this stage to deal with a reference made by my honourable and learned friend, the member for Corinella. He and I , as old schoolfellows, understand each other, and I know that the honourable and learned member would not make a statement to this House which he knew to be inaccurate. I wish to show, however, that he was misinformed. What the honourable and learned member stated was that a manufacturing firm with whom the companies with which I am connected do a large business, and from whom we obtain most satisfactoiy results, tendered for certain machinery,- and that a higher tender was accepted from a large firm in the United States. This morning I asked permission from the company, to secure the facts. I find that the tender of the firm to whom the honourable and learned member for Corinella alluded was for £4,925, but they were not prepared to supply an entirely new .plant. They offered to adapt and make certain alterations to old engines to connect with it . Another very prominent manufacturingfirm tendered at a higher rate on the same modified conditions. The only Australian manufacturers who tendered for a straight-out new plant were the Otis Engineering Company- a company which does splendid and effective work. Their tender was for £6,801. The American tender was for ±'5,900 for a completely new perfect plant, without any question of doubt as to the various patents attached to the machinery. The rejection of the tender of the Castlemaine firm was because it was for an adapted plant with special, patents added to the old machinery. The general manager of the mining company, who stands I believe prominent in his profession, was brought to Melbourne purposely to advise with regard to this matter, and I have today seen the minute of the board in which they indicate distinctly that the manager ' recommends, in the interests of the company, in the interests and effective working mine, that the American tender should be Coast. accepted.",31
131,Sir GEOKGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Were both prices for delivery at the mine?,32
132,Mr KNOX,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"No . Both prices were for delivery at the ship's slings at .Port Pirie, I believe.",32
133,Mr MCCAY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"The honourable member does not mean to say that the machinery offered to be supplied by the Australian firm was second hand machinery ? - Mr KNOX - Oh n o ; the firm offered - to go to Broken Hill to adapt the machinery - there, to attach these various new applimitted ances, and they represented that for the amount at which the}' tendered, they would ' make the old machinery as effective - new plant.",32

135,Mr KNOX,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"We l l it was old machinery ' in a sense, but I do not wish to make any point out of that. The question was, ' whether we should adapt the old plant, or have a completely new plant; and the recommendation given to the company strongly in favour of a completely has new plant. I wish to add that the the only other tender from a local manuproduction facturing company, tendering the same conditions, was nearly £1,000 above the tender accepted. I hope thereadvantage fore that my honourable friend is prepared to recoirnise that he has been misinformed.",32
136,Mr MCCAY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,I will make further quiries.,32

My wish has been to deal with this subject from broad stand-point, rather than from the whole world. point of view of how it will affect Broken Hill , Mount Lyell, or any particular town in northern Queensland, Western Australia, or the other States, . have grown round these great undertakings. The honourable member for - mania, Mr O'Malley, has had the advantage of going to the West Coast of Tasmania, and he has seen there the primeval forest - converted into magnificent towns, totalling - some 20,000 inhabitants.

139,Mr KNOX,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"There are over 20,000 people on the west coast of Tasmania, where the primeval forest has been converted into healthy towns. The same change has taken place at Broken Hill , and also at Kalgoorlie and other large mining cities in Western Australia. It is estimated that for every one person employed in mining enterprises there are at least five, and probably seven, other persons whobenefit by the industry. I intended originally to deal with this question from a general point of view, and I collected some figures which I may be perprobably to quote in part, although I do not propose to give the committee half the details which I should have given had I as a spoken yesterday. To-day, statistics show that the mining industry has benefited it was the Commonwealth to the extent of nearly £600,000,000.",32

The honourable member for Canobolas quoted a great many statistics relating to relative proportion of the total wealth of mining in each of the States, under and I do not propose to repeat them. I am suffering, however, from the disthat, although I have prepared statistics on the point, my honourable friend has got in before me. This is a most unfortunate time at which to propose these inhigh duties, because the mining industry was never more depressed than at present. be There is not a man or a woman in .Ausand tralia who is not directly or indirectly affected by the tremendous depression which a has come upon this industry throughout the",32

143,Mr KNOX,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I am not able to follow Tasmy honourable friend in his sophistries, although I always try to see a thing fairly. No doubt he is a magician. I would impress upon the committee the serious condition of the industry at the present time. In December, 1900, lead was £ 1 6 13s. 9d. per ton.; today it is £ 1 0 6s. 3d. per to n ; copper was £72 5s. per ton; today it is £45 15s. per ton ; tin was £127 2s. 6d. per ton; today it is £101 per ton. that is to say, zinc, was £18 16s. 3d. per now it is '£16 10s. per ton; pig iron £3 8s. per ton ; today it is £2 ton. Silver was 2s. 5 13-16d. per oz. std.; now it is 2s. 1 ll-16d. essentials to success in the mining industry shows a tremendous reduction in value. would ask the committee to notice this important point, that these losses in values press. come out of the profits, and affect the possibilities of working a mine. If we going to add increased responsibilities to those who direct mining companies we shall take away their ability carry on. I claim that I have always solutions had a desire to see the industry flourish, because of its commercial benefit Australia, and the fact that it is most beneficial to an immense number of In my - association with various mining tralia, companies I have derived more satisfaction from the knowledge of the large 'field of employment which they created, than from any monetary advantage which I ment have gained from them. I have referred already to lower grade and complex ores, and I have told the committee how the States will be affected. The profits can only be made out of economies. Lead ores are now almost unpayable. Copper ores are becoming unpayable, and if there is any attempt to impose fresh obligations upon those engaged in this industry, I am satisfied, from the knowledge I possess, that the must fail. I intended, when I referred the quantity of machinery employed in industry, to show that I could speak with some authority on this question, inasmuch as my firm is the Australian representative of the largest combination of manufacturers in the United States, until recently known as Fraser Chalmers and Company, but now known as Aliss Chalmers and Company. have brought out these facts in order electricity. to show that the interests which assist in carrying on, and my own ture financial interests, are concerned in curing cheap and effective machinery. I am interested in getting effective and .England, satisfactory machinery at a fair price rather than in using foreign machinery. one is honest in dealing with this matter, a one cannot ignore the fact that at the sent time we are - not getting the same results from the labour employed as Mr Knox. formerly obtained.

146,Mr KNOX,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"The Chambers of Mines of Victoria and of Western Australia have deto sired me to Jay before the committee the.re'which they have passed, and which affirm their opinion that if high duties are to imposed upon mining machinery the mining industry will seriously suffer, particularly men. in New South Wales and Western Aus-where the artificial conditions which exist in Victoria have hitherto not been adopted. I wish now to deal shortly with another aspect of the question, the employof electrical plant. W it h water power we can get tremendous energy out of electrical plants. I think that the Minister for Trade and Customs was right in refusing to receive personally, before the framing of the Tariff, a deputation from the importers of electrical appliances in Australasia, but their representations to the Comptroller of Customs, who received them, were carefully taken down, and I believe were read by the industry Minister. Those who composed that deputato tion represented capital amounting to the £20,000,000, and they gave a number of reasons why a reduction should be made in the duty upon electrical machinery. As I do not wish the debate to be unduly prolonged, I shall notgo into those reasons, except to indicate what all who have given attention to the matter must realise that I - the economic force of the future must be I should like to-see works of a I sufficiently large character to manufac' all our electrical requirements sestarted in Australia, but as I have seen most of the electrical works in Germany, and .the United States, I can assure honourable members that those who enter If upon such undertakings must , embark very large sum of money in pretheir enterprise if it is to be effective and complete. As it is to the econowe | mies effected that we must nowadays look for our profits, one company that I know of is proposing to expend £24,666 upon an tlectrical ^plant, which will save £18,000 .a year, and another company has it under consideration to expend £35,000 upon a plant, the use of which will result in an annual saving of £20,000. Those companies employ a large number of men, and the future of the men will be jeopardized if we impose such high duties upon this .machinery as will not permit of it being used. I am persuaded, however, by the temper of the committee, that a fair compromise will be secured. I accept the offer of the Minister to freely consider all representations .in regard to patented, appliances, and his promise to place .them upon the free list. I ask honourable members generally to consider the benefits conferred by the .mining industry upon the whole community. Large numbers of splendid men are employed in the mines of Broken Hill , Western Australia, Tasmania, and Queensland, and these men have families to support. At ; the present time there is ,a very small margin between profit and loss in the case of many companies, and .if they have to shut down their .mines thousands of men will be turned out of work. Qnly this morning I attended .a meeting of a company employing a .large number of men. Their profits are so small that soon the mine may not pay at all ; but it was .the unanimous decision of the directors to continue for another month, to see what course events will take. The .men engaged in mining pursuits deserve as much consideration as do those who are employed in factories. I claim to have given a great deal of time and attention ..to mining interests.

164,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,The honourable memme ber voted for sheep-shearing machines to be us to manuplaced on the free .list.,35
165,Mr CRUICKSHANK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Probably I did, because honourable members could not is a show me that those machines could be made here at a reasonable cost. I feel that there are many honourable members like myself, t who are not particularly bound to any lines. We are ready to vote as we think best. From the earlier speakers I did not get to sufficient information with regard to the the complaints made by those who work in the the mines. We have not been shown, by those who have had practical experience, that the „ a machinery which is used in the mines cannot be made in the Commonwealth. I was very glad to hear the Minister for Trade comand Customs state that he would be prepared to meet the honourable member for Barrier, and to put on the free list any machinery which he thought could - not I the same view. I intend to support a 15 per cent, duty, but I am willing to consider it any suggestion to place on the free list any the machinery which it can be shown cannot be made here.",35
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR," I have listened attentively to this debate, and I have not heard a single reason which holds weight for one moment why the mining industry should be singled out for exceptionally heavy taxation. Every other industry affected by this division of the Tariff has been treated with moderation, very but immediately we come to mining machinery we find a 25 per cent, duty imposed. What was in the minds of the Ministry to lead them to make this heavy a 25 impost upon an industry which has been shown by the figures quoted by the honorI f able member for Kooyong to be in a very and bad way indeed ? There can be no doubt that just now mining is at a very low ebb, and that many of the mining companies scattered throughout Australia are in a critical condition. We have heard from the honourable member for Barrier that at Broken Hill the industry is veiy depressed, and that if the present unfavorable conditions are continued much longer, many thousands of men will be thrown out of employment. The same thing applies to mining operations in other parts of New South Wales. Owing to the low price of copper, the Great Cobar Company are about to close down two of their smelting furnaces, and discharge a large number of their hands. I could go on multiplying instances to show that the mining industry is perhaps at us low an ebb as it has been for many years past, and yet, strange to say, whilst the industry is in the midst of this keen struggle for existence, the Ministry propose to place a heavy impost upon the raw material for mining, which, I think, ought to be absolutely free of duty.",35
167,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Are these copper mining companies likely to require new machinery immediately?""",36
168,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I will come to that in a moment. We have had the usual statements made today to the effect that the mining industry receives encouragement from the State, ancl I wish to call attention to the disingenuousness of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, when he stated that £'100,000 had been paid over to mining companies by the Government of Victoria. He would not tell the committee - althoug h I invited him to do so, and received an insulting retort for my painsthat this money was loaned to these companies, to be repaid as soon as their operations would permit of it.",36
169,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Supposin g they are not successful ?,36
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"What has that to do with the point ? The supposition is that they are going to be successful, otherwise the money would not be voted. If , when the grants were being asked for, it was made clear that they were required to carry on purely speculative work, they would not be voted. Every amount is granted on the supposition that it will enable the company to achieve success, and that therefore the money with interest added will be refunded. I understand that £40,000 has been granted for prospecting purposes by the Government of Victoria. In New South Wales £20,000 per year is so expended; but every penny of the money is supposed to be repaid out of the proceeds of any industry that may be brought into existence through its outlay. I do not know what occurs in Victoria; but in New South Wales not one penny is granted for prospecting purposes except on the understanding that it is to be repaid with interest, and therefore the grants made to mining in this way afford no parallel to protective duties imposed under a Tariff such as this for the benefit of a particular class of mechanics.",36
171,Mr KINGSTON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Has any large proportion of the prospecting money been refunded?,36
172,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,No ; because the money is as a rule expended to very little purpose. I regret to say that no very good results have followed from these grants.,36
173,Mr VL SOLOMON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"They have been swallowed up by picnic parties, in most insfci&nc6s",36
174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I am not prepared to say that. In some cases good results have followed, and there is always a possibility of valuable finds being made. Every penny of this money has been voted to enable men, not so much to develop industries that have already been brought into existence, but for the purpose of prospecting with a view to the discovery of new leads of gold. When money has been applied for to develop a mine, it has always been refused on the ground that it was not intended to be spent in that way.",36
175,Mr KINGSTON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,How is the prospecting carried out-by Government or private parties ?,36
176,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"By private parties; and, as I have said, I regret that the money is not expended to much advantage to the State under present conditions.",36
177,Mr THOMAS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,It is practically wasted.,36
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"The money is not spent in the development of the industry, but in seeking for something which may never be found, and if a profitable discovery is made as the result of the' expenditure, every penny is supposed to be refunded to the State. Are honourable members on the opposite side prepared to treat manufacturers in the same way as they deal with the miners ? Are they prepared to ask those people, into whose pockets they are putting money by means of these duties, to make a refund when their industries have assumed paying proportions'! Tf not, it is idle to endeavour bo institutea parallel bebween these duties and the prospecting granb.",36
179,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,To whom does the honourable member suggest bhat the money should be refunded ?,37
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,To the Treasury.,37
181,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"What does the Treasury pay them ? Mr. JOSEPH: COOK - The Treasury pays them nothing; but the people of the country are being' asked to pay 25 per cent. I expect the honourable and learned member from Ind i to poo-pooh the idea and say' that a protective duty is not a tax. Unfortunately, however, we know only too well that it is a tax and'a very heavy tax indeed, as they have found out in Ne\v South' Wales. I take exception altogether bo this species of argumenbation, and I deny the right of the honourable and learned member for Indi to make for himself a definition of' protection. He is entirely ignoring the' definition's of protection that have been given by all' theeconomists of the world', and is bolstering' up his own theories and humbugging the miners of Victoria by making his owndefinition and' bli'en seeking to find proof of its accuracy. I deny the right of the honourable member to do bhat. He cannot fell me of any1 economist who has argued' bliab ib is protection, in the economic sense in which the question has always been reasoned, to malite roads andbridges and'give aid to prospectors. It is n'O'iise arguing the point, because I altogether deny the righb honourable member's righb to make such' a definition' at this time - of day. What are the facts as to mining machinery ? Here are one or t\vo facbs bo which I ask blie honourable' member' bo direct his attention if he wants to reason' upon the matber. The Great' Cobar Copper Smeltiing, Company-are imporbiiig.machifiery, and as bn'e principal directors arc protectionists, I take it they wouldnob send' abroad' if .they could' get ma'chin'ery as good manufactured' i i i Victoria' or any obher Sbabe. Th'e facb is, however, bliab this company aTe importing machinery, and they have jusb paid duty amounting bo £400; and, furthef, a large cement manuacburing company in the same neighbourhood have' paid over £1,000' as duty on machinery. Instances of thab kind could be multiplied as occurring every day in New South Wales. I do not understand how it is-that the'Victorian'people can never see that machinery of any kind is raised in priceby these duties, when our experience is that we are continually paying over the counter cheques for considerable amounts in theshape"" of duty. It is the greatest puzzle to be told, as we are constantly bold in bhis Chamber, bhat a protective duty is not a tax, seeing that every day wefind such dubies bo be a bax which 1 we very much resent.",37
182,Mr THOMAS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"The Victorian Deep Leads Mining Company, near Maldoir, a little over twelve months ago paid £6';000 duty on mining' machineiy.",37
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Wit h facbs like bhese staring us in the face, it isidle bwaddle bo say bhat a protective duty is'not a bax. Here we have the Great Cobar Copper MiningCompany; wibh copper at a price lower than it has been for many years, and when' theindustiy is threatenedwith total collapse if something is nob done to raise prices, payingduties amounting' to £400; and cemenb works in the same district paying over £1,000. Yeb honourable members like the'honourable member for Melbourne Ports, wibli .effrOnbery which is litble less tliair brazen, fell usbhat with aduty machinery costs no more; and bhat aprobecbive dtoby is not a tax. How can the* payment over the counter of these amounts in solid' cash' contribute in any way to the 1 raising or the-maintenance'of the wage fund 1 out of which copper-smelbers and others have' bobe paid ? Ib' is of no use bo tell me bhat the empU^'ment ofthesemen will help people in other industries, or bo'advance any of bliesimilar' absurd' argumenbs we have heard.",37
184,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Surely the honourable member does nob believe in such a thing as a ""wage fund""?",37
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Of course I believe in awagfe fund. I believe also that 1 labour has bo create bhat fund' before it can be available'. Does thehon'ora/blte' member bhink' that wages dtfop' do-svn from the skies 1 Mr Mauger' - I should l'ilfce bo know whab the honourable member means by ""wage fund.""' Mr. JOSEPH COOK,- I mean the balance ab the'bank out'of which wages are paid as pay-day comes round'. I do nob mean "" wage fund'"" in the same sense as I believe the honourable member means ib. ML-. MAUGER - I understand the honourable member now.",37
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I am not talking abstract economics now, but citing hard facts; and I ask how the payment of these amounts as duty is going to provide any more wages for the workmen in the employ of the companies I have mentioned. The Only effecb of these impositions can be to decrease the amount available for the' payment of labour. Of course, honourable members may go off at a tangent, and say that these duties create a diversity of employment and multiply opportunities for labour. But these are bald statements which do not avail anything. They cannot be brought to a focus which will enable pro - 1 tectionists to show that the copper smelters and cement makers afc Cobar will have more rate. money available out of which to pay wages. That isfchehard, immediate, practical' tion to be faced in connection with the dustries of which I have spoken. pound of taxation put on the mining inhave dustry must tend to decrease wages; i cannot by any possibility tend to more ployment. Above all times in thehistory of the Commonwealth, this is an inopportune time at which to makefcheheavy imposition on the mining industry proposedby the Government. Last night we were told that all this was being done in. the interests labour. We are told, for instance*-by think, the honourable and learned member for Bendigo-that he advocated this duty for the sake of labour, and he quoted f rom Government Statist, I presume of Victoria; as tofchewages of boiler-makersand patternsfcatemenbsquobed makers in various countries of the world. Of course, it was shown that wages are lowest where protective duties have been longest! in existence-in such places France, Italy, and Germany-and that young countries the wages are highest. these figures are entirely useless and' mistorian leading. The comparison was made, not environment between Australia, Erance, England, and the United States; but in each case one State of America is singled out, and the wages paid' there quoted'. In one case, necticut was singledioufc, and'in another case Massachusetts. WTliy these bwo States should be singled out, instead of taking the whole of the United States, I am at a loss to know.",38
187,Sir JOHN QUICK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,There is no return available giving those particulars.,38
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"In my opinion there is a, return, had the Government Statist cared-fcoavail himself of it. I undertake to say that the return for Pennsylvania is at least as available asfchereturn for large Connecticut or Massachusetts.",38
189,Sir JOHN QUICK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I saw the original returns as given inthereports of the Commissioner of Labour to Congress, and I checked them.",38
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Does the honourable and learned member tell me that the return, for - Pennsylvania is not available ?",38
191,Sir JOHN QUICK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Not in the official returns;,38
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,But in some other return?,38
193,Sir JOHN QUICK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I did not see it , at any",38
194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I distrust any quesfigures emanating from the Victorian deinpartments. I will tell the honourable Every member why. Since Goming here I found that the officersof the Vict fcoriani Government departments are so emimbued wibh protectionist ideas that they actually colour all their reports accordingly-. For insbanGe, only the obher day Minisbers presented reports from their officials; pointing out how this impost and that was going to affect Victorian indusof tries from a protectionist sb&nd-poinb. I , I submit that that is a matter which the officers of the department have no righb bo bake into-consideration whenfurnishing in the formation to the Minister for Trade and Cusboms. Yet more bhan once we have had from officials in the Minisber's deparbmenb in which they incidentally poinb out. how the figures 1 which they present bear upon the protecas tionist theory as applied fco the indusi n tries in question. When I find this But sort of thing obtaining in regard to Vicstatistics, and when I discover this aboub the probecbionisb officers of Victoria, I disbrusfc the figures which come from them. I make no reflection upon the veracity of theseofficials; I believe Conthat they one as veracious as any body of officials. I merely say that these problems areput to them with, psrhaps; a little party biasi n the framing of them-, with the resultfchafcthere is a strong bias in the information which the officers supply.",38
195,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,I suppose' the honourable member's argument would not apply to other Sbabes in an opposibe direction ?,38
196,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I can tell the honourable member that in all my political life I never remember a case in which an officer of a Government department in New South Wales made any reference whatever to the policy of the country, unless specifically asked to do so.",39
197,Mr MAUGEE,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,I can show the honourable member a report by a Government officer in New South Wales in which the free-trade policy of that country was challenged.,39
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I dare say, but the honourable member cannot show me first of all that the opinion of that officer upon the matter in question was not invited per medium of the Minister. The honourable member cannot show me a single case where of his own volition an officer has attempted to discuss the policy of free-trade versus protection.",39
199,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I have the report, and I can show it to the honourable member.",39
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Ver y likely. What must be the effect of the imposition of this duty upon the mining industry ? Clearly that the expenses of the industry will be increased ; and where such an increase occurs there is less money available for the payment of wages and interest than would otherwise be the case. There is no escape from that conclusion. Some noted economists in Victoria have made the position very clear from time to time. For instance, I notice that Mr David Syme makes this point very clear in the book which he has published. He says that whenever the cost of a commodity is enhanced, there is invariably a decrease in wages. Of course this opinion is a veiy curious one when we remember that it emanates from a man whose object today seems to be to boom the protectionist doctrine in the State of Victoria. It is to be regretted that, at a time when the mining industry is afc its lowest ebb, the Ministry should go out of their way to visit it with this extraordinary and totally unnecessary impost.",39
201,Mr KENNEDY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR," I do not propose to deal at any length with this question, and it is only in order to test a few of the statements which have been put forward that I rise at all. It is admitted by all sections of the committee that it would be injudicious to do anything that would injuriously affect the mining industry. We are all striving to do what is best for the industries of Australia. Our only difference is as to the means by which fchis can be accomplished. Protectionists andfree-traders alike are also anxious to do whatever is possible for the establishment of any' industry of a wealth-producing character in Australia, and here again the difference which exists is only one as to method. Where we appear to diverge is upon the question of whether the mining industry will be materially affected by the imposition of a duty upon some machinery which is used in that industry. I say at the outset that I am not prepared to impose a duty upon any machine or parfc of a machine that cannot be manufactured in Australia, because I fully realise that the price of that machine, or part thereof, will be increased by the amount of the duty. We can reduce our differences somewhat by understanding some of the lines upon which we can test the question at issue. We have heard the oft-repeated statement by those who hold free-trade views, that protective duties increase the cost of any article. They now appear, however, to run away from that statement, and to be content with having made the bald assertion. Upon this particular item we have had that statement frequently repeated. It is suggested that there is to be an imposition of a tax of an enormous amount; upon the mining industry, to the extent of the whole rate of duty proposed to be levied upon this particular line. I was rather astonished at the statement made by the honourable member for Kooyong, when I interjected that the amount of revenue expected to be collected under the item now under consideration was in Western Australia only £24,000. The honourable member' was attempting to show that through these duties the cost to users of machinery was going to be increased to the extent of £150,000. The figures of anticipated revenue from these duties, as prepared and circulated, show that in Western Australia, on the whole of the items included in this particular line, the revenue expected to be collected-anduponwhic h somuch stress was laid by the honourable member for Kooyongamounts to only £24,000. The honourable member stated, in reply to my interjection, that he would come back to that and explain the position with respect to it . Unwittingly or otherwise, he failed to do so, and it is for that reason I desire to direct special attention to it . On page 3 of the return of estimated revenue, it will be found that} excepting screws and axles, the total revenue anticipated from the duties on articles included in this item, including engines, boilers, and machinery, plated and mixed metalware, and manufactures of metals, n.e.i., amounts for all the States of the Commonwealth to £280,000, and in Western Australia the estimated amount is only £24,000. As included in this classification, - there must be considered the amount of duty to be collected upon plated and mixed metalware and manufactures of metals, n.e.i. It is therefore as well for us to understand at the outset what the taxation involved really amounts to.",39
202,Mr FOWLER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"It is not a question of the duty, it is a question of the enchanced cost of the machinery to the consumer.",40
203,Mr KENNEDY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"That is just the point . I am - coming to. The honourable member for Kooyong gave away his whole position in some later explanations he made, because what he had to say with respect to Broken Hill and Mount Lyell applies with equal force to Western Australia. What did the honourable member tell us with respect to Broken Hill ? He told us that with respect to a particular mine there, £1,300,000 had been expended in machinery alone, but that machinery to the amount only of one-fourth of the sum was imported from abroad, showing that although they had the whole world to range overbecause they had no duty whatever to pay upon that machinery-three-fourth s of it was supplied from the other States of the Commonwealth.",40
204,Mr VL SOLOMON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Because certain classes of machinery can be just as well manufactured in the States as in any other place.,40
205,Mr KENNEDY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"In the words of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, there is ample proof that there is no justification for doing anything which will injure the manufactories in which that machinery is being made. It is also a proof that the cost of the machinery is not increased.",40
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Who wishes injure them?,40
207,Mr KENNEDY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,I venture to say that the abolition of the duty on that particular class of machineiy will certainly abolish those manufactories.,40
208,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"It could not affect Broken Hill , where they have had no duty so far.",40
209,Mr KENNEDY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"It is not going to affect Broken Hill in the future, inasmuch as, notwithstanding the fact that there was no duty upon machinery imported into Broken Hill in the past, three-fourths of the machinery, costing £1,300,000, was made in the States of the Commonwealth. A peculiar feature of the case is that that machinerv was being made in States in which a duty was imposed upon machinery.",40
210,Mr VL SOLOMON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Thaf c shows that we do not need a protective Tariff to enable us to compete.,40
211,Mr KENNEDY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"That is a very old yarn. M.r. V . L . SOLOMON - And a, very true one.",40
212,Mr KENNEDY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"If c does prove that with a protective Tariff in order to establish the manufacture of machineiy here, we can make machineiy and supply it to the users of machinery as cheaply as they can get it from elsewhere. Then, with respect to Mount Lyell, the honourable member for Kooyong told us that out of £664,000 worth of machinery erected there, less than one-fourth was imported from outside the Commonwealth-anothe r proof that the major portion of mining machineiy can be made within the Commonwealth. The honourable member then went on to particularize some patented mechanical appliances in the shape of economizers in one direction or another, that were of a special kind, and were a material factor in developing Mount Lyell, and he mentioned super-heaters amongst others. A ny one who is conversant with boilers or engine furnaces knows the value of super-heaters, and knows the proportion of cost of a super-heater-o r fuel economizer in other words-to the boiler'and furnace. What does it amount to? To not onetwentieth of the cost of the machine. These super-heaters are patented appliances, and have not been manufactured in Australia up to the present time, so far as I am aware. Indeed, they have only recently been applied to machines here, and I know of some into stances where agents here are asking to have trials given to them at the present time. Yet, because they are included in this classification, the honourable member for Kooyong, and a great many other honourable members, wish to have placed on the free list the whole of the machinery; boiler. ?, and everythingpertaining to them-, and all the appliances to utilize the motive powerand worlc all parts of' the machinery. there any justification for that? I am prepared* to go all the way with any honourable member in putting, upons the free-list all these-patent appliances which'.cannot be manufactured' here, orwhich are only inlimited use. Evero wherethey have been) fully proved: it may be a considerablenumber of years before-they would be used ona very large scale, and we know it is only, when we can manufacturein. quantity that there-is a; justification for any one embarking in a manufacturing enterprise. We know that boilers are used for many other purposes besides driving mining machinery,.and' certain engines-andparts attached to boilers connected with mining plants may be used foirthe same class ofwork, in pumpingor driving machines for other purposes.. It"" is because a considerable field is open for' that class of manufactures that manufacturers 1 in Australia are able to' manufacture that classof machinery. Another peculiar fa""eb iB that in Victoria, Queensland',, and South Australia the duties in. the past upon this particular class of machinery have been practically on) a pan-: In Queensland they have been 20'p'er cent.,, in-Victoriafrom 25 to 30' per' cenifc., and in SoubliAusbralia 25'j 20, and 1-5 per Gent'., according to the classification, of the machinery: Mr V . E. SOLOMON - In some portions ofi Soubli Australia only. Infche Northern Territory machinery has been absolutely, free, and' that is where the largest portion of mining machinery was imported. - Mr KENNEDY. - There - may be a specialreason for that. South Australia liasfchecheap Jap-and' the Chosv. there,, and many obheicheap' biiings prevail, bhei-e. which would mot be allowed in ofchei; parts 1 offcheState.",40
213,Mr VL SOLOMON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,We wished to courage ind'usfcBiesi there. Mr KENNEDY . : - I do not know that - it was; altogetherto> encourage industry there-.. There may be many other reasons for it. 1 Mr V. E.. SOLOMON --That is 1 Parliament said.,41
214,Mr KENNEDY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"When wecome to inquire closely into the facts, wefind that there is only avery limited quantity of the appliances included in this section which there is any necessiby bo have placed on - the 1 free list in order, not to enhance bhecost bo the usersof bhose-appliances: The honourable member'for Kooyong has proved, that Is ini his own: statement.

They Gan be made not only in Victoria, but in Queensland. We have the statement made last night b}' the honourable member for Maranoa, that a : firm in Maryborough,. Queensland, competed successfully in the open market for the supply o£ awinding plant fora South Australian mine, notwithstanding that it had to pay a duty of 20 percent, on the l plant. Tliehonorable member referred' also to machineiy being, sent from Victoria 1 into-Queensland, nobwithsbanding the-ability of the Queensland manufacturers fco make, 1 ib. There musb have been special' circumsbances appertaining bo each case; enabling the firms mentioned to competesuccessfully with those of the States inwhichthe machinery wasrequired. That is the case at times in Victoria. A manufacburing firm may chance bo beexceedingly busy,, or may be overhauling ibs plant, ab abime when"" cerbainwork is required;, and' bherefore ib is nob able to submit a tender for it , although at anobher bimeib would' be' able bo compete successfully. I am nob arguing now as bowhab the duty should' be to enable our' manufacturer'sto got on compefcimg successfully with the outside* worldy but we know that in many instances, where ports are open to the world, the surplus, sbocks of large manufacburing, centres elsewhere come enin and. crush the local manufacturer oub of the market. We have-had experience, of that in Vicboria and i a some of the other Sbabes. As soon as local competition is defeated what is theresult ? The indentagents, or importers fix a price to suit themselves. We have had repeated illustrations of that. what That is why I shall always supporb a duby which will, in the first instance; enable our manufacburers bo-compete successfully wibh the surplus products.of other portions of the world, and eventually create sufficient competition amongst themselves bO' prevent the consumer of the' articlesfcheyproduce being charged enhanced prices. We have had many diverse' opinions expressed upon this question. I wish'it to be'clearly and tinctly understood' that, as I have said right! through' the discussion' oir the Tariff, vote will not be givenfor the imposition 1 duty onany particular machine that may be required' to develop our' industries; which-cannot be' successfully manufactured in Australia-; or for a duty materially and continuously' increase the cost of the' machine to the users. I want to make a clear-cub distincbion in bhis par bicular insbance. I shall support a rate of duby on boilers and all the machinery and appliances used bo convey motive power that will be: sufficient to enable our manufacturers fco go oir asfchey have been doing in the past. Bub ifr there an effectual' patent appliance ofl material use bo those engaged' in the' development of the mining indusbry, I venbure bo that theGovernmenb and bhose' sitting been, oehind them would have nohesitation' in putting it on the free list. To say that we should place everything' bhat has been patented on'the free list' is; however, simply anr absurdity.

222,Mr CONROY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,There was no duty in New South Wales.,43
223,Mr KENNEDY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I am not prepared to say, in view of the extended market which has been given to our manufacturers by federation, that a 25 per cent, duty is absolutely necessary. I have, from the outset, taken the stand that as, with free-trade between the States, the manufacturers have a larger field to operate upon, they should be prepared in some instances to accept lower duties, and I am prepared to go in the direction of supporting lower duties in this case; but I shall not support a proposal for placing the whole of the machinery coming under this item upon the free list.",43
224,Mr SPENCE,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR," It has always surprised me that protectionists who are consistent whenever manufacturers are mentioned throw over their faith when mining is spoken of. That has occurred veiy markedly during the present debate. Why the miner should not receive the benefits of protection when they are given to men following other occupations is a puzzle to me. The only reason that will account for the attitude of some honourable members is that they lay it down as a principle that those who manufacture for export should not receive the benefits of protection; that protection is only for men who are making things for sale within the Commonwealth. Some good has been done by the discussion, because we have the admission of the leading protectionists in the committee that they are prepared to admit dutyfree machinery which cannot be manufactured within the Commonwealth. That the Government was not prepared to do at first. I hope that the committee will act upon that principle throughout the memconsideration of the Tariff. I cannot understand why the representatives of mining constituencies should oppose the granting ""Why was of assistancefcothe mining industry, but I can understand the honourable and learned member for Bendigo doing so, since new machinery is never introduced into the district which he represents. There they have rich mines, and all they have to do is to sink deeper and deeper into the bowels of the earth. They do not require the complex and costly machinery which is necessary elsewhere. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports wishes to tax all machineiy, so that it may be manufactured within the Commonwealth, and to compensate the miners by granting prospecting bonuses. I would point out, however, that it is not within the power of the Federal Parliament to grant such bonuses.",43
225,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,B y this Tariff we shall supply the States with sufficient revenue to enable them to grant them.,43
226,Mr SPENCE,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"That is a misleading statement, which will not be fulfilled unless the Governments of the States make a veiy decided departure from the practice which they have hitherto been following. I represent a back country district whose undeveloped riches are enormous. The Cobar mining centre is seriously affected by this Tariff, and will be still more seriously affected by it in the future.",43
227,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,It is affected not so much by the Tariff as by the low price of metals.,43
228,Mr SPENCE,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"That district is quite different from the Victorian mining districts. I have been a practical miner from boyhood, having filled most of the positions connected with mining operations. The Cobar district is one which it is very difficult to prospect, and its resources cannot be worked without the investment of a large amount of capital in up-to-date machinery, because of the refractory and low grade ores which have to be dealt with. In places such as where they quarry out the stone and crush the sandstone and slate you would not look for gold in Victoria. The State has given some little aid in the shape of small votes for prospecting to miners. But it is very difficult country to prospect. It can only be prospected on scientific lines. After they find anything no one will put down any money until it is opened up. Some money has to be spent-it may be by a syndicate-to develop the mine. Then comes the purchase of machinery, ancl the question whether they will put machinery on the ground will depend on its cost and the results they are likely to get. It would be better if the States were to adopt a different policy, and give a bonus to every company which would put up a plant. To speak about the money being given to the mining industry from the prospecting vote is beside the mark. Mining development, I unhesitatingly assert, will be retarded if you increase the cost of the necessary machinery : and as a great deal of machinery has been invented and made in other countries where they have been ahead of us in dealing with refractory ores, and the patent rights are protected, it ought to be admitted duty free. Otherwise, mining as an industry will be thrown back. Take the mines which are in existence. The Cobar copper mine, which alone employs over 700 men, has already shortened hands owing to the low price of copper, and the directors threaten that they may have to discontinue operations. Previous to the low price of copper forcing the shortening of hands, the company had under consideration the question of putting up improved appliances in Cobar itself to do all the smelting, and extending its operations. Several adjoining mines have only quite recently added to their plant most up-todate appliances. As mining goes on there, the country changes until you get down to the sulphide ores, and they are constantly introducing new machinery of the latest type. This talk about the duty not adding to the cost of the machinery amuses me very much. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports asserted that' if a duty is imposed, it cheapens the cost of the article, and in the very next sentence he said that when the duty is lowered it causes the factories to discharge hands. If he can explain the contradiction, I shall be very glad. The honourable member for Moira has offered an explanation. I know that, as a rule, you can produce locally an article as cheaply as it can be imported, but the question of efficiency counts. Take the manufacture of railway engines here. I think the original cost of the local article was higher than that of the imported article, but it turned out to be cheaper, taking into account its life-time, and the fact that it required less The honourable member for Moira said that if we strike off the duty in relation to those factories which are established in the Commonwealth, then the importers will swamp the market. It reminds me of another occasion when the honourable and learned member for Bendigo was very much worried with the mental picture of ships loaded with mining machinery waiting for an opportunity to run the blockade and dump it all down on the wharfs. He forgot a fact which is known to every man connected with mining or any other industry that requires large machinery-and that is that it is not made and kept in stock to any large extent. The importers will not swamp the country with large machinery, because it is only made when it is ordered. A mining company, if they want a first-class machine, very often have it made according to their own plans and design, and their own engineer superintends its manufacture. They prefer to take the colonial-made article if it can be made at anything like a similar price, because of the saving of time in getting it and the greater certainty of its being up to their standard. But to put a duty on those things which cannot be made here because of the existence of patent rights is manifestly to levy a heavy tax on mining, and to retard the industry is not in keeping with a protectionist policy. I claim that the mining industry should get as much consideration as any other, that we should not sayfcothese machinery manufacturers, ""Youare going to have allfcheprotection and other peoplenone."" Miners are as much entitled to protection as are men working in the foundry. The idea that by merely imposing a duty you will make a foundry pay is ridiculous, if at the same time you close up the outlet for the machinery they are going to make. What we really wantfcodo is to assimilate the mining industry, which makes a big call on the manufacturer of mining machinery, and other tilings which are made in foundries, for then you provide employment in the two industries. But if you so tax mining as to throw it back or retard its progress, then you injure all the industries which depend on its success. That is very clear, I think, to any one. Hence I contend that this item should be carefully reconsidered by the Government, in view of the information which has been submitted here. From what I have heard from most ardent protectionists, it is evident that we do not repairs. require to impose this high duty. Ifc is evident from their own arguments that they do not require any duty to keep the industries going. If the local .article can be supplied as cheaply as the imported article, they >do mot require to bolster up the manufacturers by a duty. They have got on to their feet, and .are able bo compete. The idea of ships coming along - with loads of-machinery, .and dumping it on the market, is ridiculous. .1 support the .amendment to pub mining .machinery on the free lisb. I recognise thab there are ;a number of ibems which might be left oub. I trust that blie duby - will be reduced on the whole of the ibems, even if the amendment is defeated. At any rate, all those lines .which admibbedly are patenbed and made in .obher counbries should be pub on the free lisb.",43
229,Mr EISH ER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR," I have nob much bo say on bhis question, because I bhink thab mosb honourable members .have made up their minds. I am somewhat in a difficulty regarding the attitude of some members of the Opposition on account of a statement made here by the honourable and learned member for Parkes during the want of confidence debate. At page 6553 of Hansard, after saying that-he - was present at a meeting in blie Sydney Town - Hall, when the free-brade parby were belling the elecbors of New Soubh Wales whab they purposed doing, he is reported to have said I was prepared, moreover, though I was si free trader, to continue .something like Id per cent, towards the industries of Victoria. I knew veiy well that the natural protection which every industry in Australia obtains by the great distance of this country from Europe means in itself 15 per cent, in some cases, and even more in others, and that therefore when duties of 15 per cent, were imposed it. meant 30 per cent. He said, further, that even if the free traders were - reburned in a majoriby, he would still be prepared to give 15 per cent, protection to the esbablished indusbries of Vicboria. I would ask, where is the consistency of an honourable member statirig ab the elections bhat he was prepared to do a certain thing, and then, after coming here, supporting a proposal in a directly opposite direction T So far as I am concerned I do not inbend bo follow any such course. I have no hesibation in sayingbhat I am a free trader in principle, but I ask whether, during the federal elections, ib w.as competent for:any straightforward, sensible man to declare wholly and solely for free-trade. - Did nob the leader of the Government state that it would be impossible to impose high protective duties, or, on the obher hand, to ' carry oub the free-trade .principle in its entirety 1 Is it not true, .also, that the leader .of the Opposition .made practically the same sbabemenb, and have nob bobh bhese righb honourable gentlemen declared bhemselves to be opposed bo direct taxation, which I personally favour. How will it be possible either to cut down the duties in order to bring them into accord with.free-trade principles, .or to adopt such high protective duties as will reduce the revenue down .below the requirements .of the Commonwealth 1 I stabed ab the elections bliab I was in favour of a revenue Tariff, and that the indusbries .already esbablished wibhin the Commonwealth would have my cheerful support. I have no objection to a revenue Tariff with a .protective incidence, especially in the direction of protecting engineering work. Among my constituents there are a .large number-of miners who gave me their supporb, and ,knew exacbly my position in bhis mabter. Ib would be exbremely regrettable if any action of this Eederal Parliament were bo have the . effect of reducing the number of people engaged in iron - working. No country can be greab unless ib has a large number of skilled axtisans working in iron, and for that reason I,am surprised at thestatements of some honorablememberswhoprofessprobecbionisbprinciples. Of allfcheindustries that I should feel disposed to.protecfc, the iron industry stands first. I go further and sayfchafcI am at one with the leader of the Opposition, when he sbabes that if the iron industry is to be esbablished in Australia ib should be done by the Sbabe or the Commonwealbh, so thab the cost involved will not have to be paid by the purchaser, of the articles in the shape of higher prices, but by the general community in the form of taxation. If the iron industry is destroyed by any action of this Federal Parliament, it will be the duty of the Eederal and State Governments to re-establish it for the benefit of our own people. This is no Utopian idea, but its fulfilment will come. We jjave heard a great deal about the formation of manufacturing and speculative rings, and I ,know some very shrewd business men who think it possible for rings to control the production of any commodity. If this is true, it will be necessary for this great country to form a national ring for the protection of its own inberesbs. I was surprised bo see some honourable members supporting a duty of 30 per cent, for the protection of caudle making, and other comparatively minor industries, and yet showing ^difference as to whether an industry employing about 15,000 skilled artisans is swept out of existence or not. I do not view this matter from the same stand-point as the protectionists. I do not believe that protective duties have ,a tendency to cheapen goods, and I .would not tell my constitutents that prices would cheapened by putting a 25 percent, duty on mining machinery. I have, however, told them that tire effect of a protective duty has been to establish foundries in every part of Australia, including one at Maryborough, in my owu electorate, which is able to compete with any foundry in Australia. One would think, from the discussion we have heard, that there are only two States in the Commonwealth, namely, Victoria and New South ""Wales, but I.may inform honourable members that in Queensland we produce a very large quantity of the veiy best of machinery.",45
230,Sir JOHN QUICK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"The iron workers there have been protected by a 25 per cent, duty.",46
231,Mr FISHER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Ye s ; for some eight years we have had a 25 per cent, duty, and very few complaints have been made with regard to machinery that can be made in the State. Some exception has, however, been taken to the duty, so far as it applies to machinery that cannot be made in the State.",46
232,Mr HARPER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"-The duty,* then, becomes one of a revenue character.",46
233,Mr FISHER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Yes , and the 25 per cent, duty now proposed by the Government is a revenue duty. It cannot be regarded as a prohibitive duty in any - way, because it is estimated to bring in something like £285,000.",46
234,Mr VL SOLOMON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,We do not know what the item includes.,46
235,Mr EISHER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"That is one of my own difficulties. I have been somewhat surprised that the whole of this discussion should have raged round mining machineiy, and should have been directed particularly to the effect that the duty will have upon the mining industry of Broken Hill . regret very much the condition of affairs at Broken Hill , but I am quite sure that if this Tariff had been proposed whilst Broken Hill was at the height prosperity the discussion would not have turned so much upon the condition of industry there. Coghlan in his statistics gives the number iof men employed in iron working, engineering, foundries, &c, as follows-Ne w South Wales, 3,950; Victoria, 4,855; Queensland, 3,862 ; South Australia, 2,696; Western Australia, 7S3 ; Tasmania, 316; and New Zealand, 1,642. It will be seen that Queensland occupiesno unimportant position intheiron workingindustry. be The establishment of foundries in the particular district of Queensland to which I have referred has enabled us to get the veiy kind of machinery we require on the gold-fields. TJje machinery may not have been got exactly as cheaply as under absolute free-trade, but, taking into consideration the convenience of having men on the spot to do repairs, the loss altogether is not very great. I admit that the same set of circumstances do not apply to every district within the Commonwealth, but I justify the course I have taken .on the ground that the views I am expressing now I expressed clearly to the electors who sent me here. Then there is the further ground that both the leader of the Government and the leader of the Opposition haA'e declared against direct taxation; and as we must have revenue, I am firmly of the belief that it is desirable to get it from those commodities which are being produced by industrious and trained mechanics within the Commonwealth. As to whether these engineering enterprises could possibly continue without protection, I am inclined to think that they could not to the extent to which they are being carried on at the present time; and to deprive them of protection would be to do an injustice and a wrong, seeing that the Commonwealth, if it was formed on anything, was formed on a compromise which should be religiously observed. As I have already pointed out, a prominent free-trader like the honourable and learned member for Parkes stated in the Town Hall, Sydney, prior to the elections, that he was prepared to see a minimum duty of 15 per. cent. Afterwards, I understand that honourable and learned member associated himself with those who desire to place I all these commodities on the free list, and that oertainlyis very inconsistent onhis part.",46
236,Mr EOWLEH,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Did the honourable aud learned member say a .minimum or an of its average duty of 15 per cent. ?,46
237,Mr FISHER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"The exact words used the by the honourable and learned .member for Ptirkes, in speaking on the motion of sure on the 29th October last, in House, were:I will tell the honourable member what mid I am not ashamed of it. I think on question, whatever honourable members think of my opinions, I can show a perfectly sistent record. What I said was this. I of four speakers who addressed a great free-trade meeting held at the Town-hall, Sj'dney. speakers were the leader of the .honourable member for Wentworth, myself, and another. I then told the people of Sydney that even if the free-trade party of New South had a majority in the Federal Parliament, sonally would be no party to suddenly sweeping away the whole of the Victorian Tariff, because . said I should prefer to emulate the statesmanlike attitude taken up by the leader of position towards the sugar industry of .State in gradually reducing the duty over a series of years. And I say that knew afc the time that the financial requirements of the Commonwealth would prevent us, "" we had such a majority, from sweeping existence altogether the duties in Victoria elsewhere. I was prepared, moreover, though was a free-trader, to continue something like per cent, towardsfcheindustries of Victoria.",46
238,Mr FOWLER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I only wanted to make the point clear, and did not interject in spirit of hostility, It seemed an ordinary attitude for the honourable for Parkes to assume.",47
239,Mr FISHER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I do not quarrel with interjections, which are sometimes useful bringing out points. I complain that some 6 honourable members seem to think that this is a Victorian industry only, though I have shown that Queensland has nearly as many mechanics employed as the former State. It would not be possible for these foundries and engineering works to pay the same standard of wages without protection as they do now, and I am not, at the very set of the Commonwealth, going to break compact or compromise which, unwritten though it be, I regard as being as binding if drawn out on parchment. I hope and believe that the larger market which Australian Commonwealth affords will able manufacturing firms to do better i future than they have done in the past. Later on, when these firms, by the extent the market within the Commonwealth, are able to meet outside competition on comthat paratively fair terms, will be the time attack protectionist principles on a basis.

240,Mr FOWL ER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"-Althoug h this Wales debate has already, perhaps, exceeded the I perlimits it ought to have occupied, still I feel I should be lacking in the performance of I my duty if, as the representative of the the Opmetropolis of a State which is keenly in that terested in this particular item, I did not -£1 by £1 take a little time to appeal to the Governnow. I ment and their - supporters, to reconsider even if the attitude they have adopted on this out of item, more particularly in connection with and mining machinery. I can put all the I earnestness of which I am capable into .15 an appeal of this kind, which virtually concerns not only my electorate, but the whole of the State of Western Australia, and in a any lesser degree, but, at the same time, in a extranot unimportant degree, concerns the welmember fare of the whole of the Commonwealth. In this connection I may be allowed to say, though, perhaps, I am not strictly in order, in that Western Australia is somewhat at a disadvantage even in a House of this kind, which I feel sure intends to do its duty impartially to all the various States. Western Australia is in the position of being legislated for by a large number of representatives who have never seen that State. I would ask the Government, when they deal with the question of travelling expenses, to outtake into serious consideration the advisaa bility of putting aside some small portion of the money allotted for that purpose, as to .enable honourable members to take the sea voyage to Western Australia, in the order that they may realise for themselves ensomething of the tremendous possibilities n the which undoubtedly lie before that State. Although honourable members are perfectly of willing to recognise the claims of Western Australia, and to do justice all round, I feel if they possessed a personal knowledge to of the requirements of that State they would true probably be induced to regard with even more consideration the requests of its repreof sentatives. I have travelled over a very large extent of the gold-bearing country I have been associated in my travels with perhaps the most experienced miners and prospectors who ever set foot upon Australia, and I can say from my own knowledge, and from the opinions expressed by them, that there is no country in the world which possesses such an enormous area of promising auriferous country as does the State of Western Australia. We have there a belt of gold-bearing country which is, roughly speaking, 1,000 miles long by a breadth in some places of 300 miles, almost any part of which is capable of being exploited with advantage. People who merely have a knowledge of the gold-fields of the eastern States would be overwhelmed with surprise could they be transported by some Arabian A'ifjhtx magic into the middle of some of the districts which I have A'isited in Western Australia. In the eastern States one has sometimes to look very hard for indications of gold. At the very best we get what miners call a "" blow"" here, and an ""outcrop"" there. Western Australia there are districts extending for many miles which no one can traverse without continually crossing reefs carrying gold which are constantly cropping out on the surface, and which only await the enterprising capitalist. The Murchison district, speaking of it generally-becaus e ' it is now subdivided into many others-is remarkable in this respect. I have stood upon a large "" blow"" of quartz, 30 feet wide, and perhaps 30 or -40 feet high, rising up from the plain like a great natural wall, and from the top of that elevation I have been able to look across the country for miles, both before and behind me, and to trace that reef, which, as it stood up, looked for all the world like some of the pictures which 1I have seen of the ruined sections of the Great Wall of China. I do not say that the whole of such a reef as that will pay. But I do say-and I know from personal experience - that mining machinery has been dumped down upon certain sections of a reef like that, and in spite of all the disadvantages which are associated with the opening up of a new . country, the quartz has been shovelled into the batteries, and it has been made to pay handsomely. We are already producing a large quantity of gold in Western Australia. We have many Bonanza mines, but these . are only those which have been able to carry on on account of the unusual richness of the stone. There is an enormous and 23 Q Tariff. [1G JAN., 1902.] Tarif. 8893 incalculable quantity of quartz in sight in Western Australia which is only waiting for some reduction in the cost of working it to enable people to make handsome fortunes. The great difficulty which has faced us, and which will confront us for many years to come, is-as the honourable member for Kooyong has pointed out-the problem of the profitable treatment of low grade ores. As soon as that can be overcome, I feel sure that whatever prosperity we may have enjoyed in Western Australia as the result of our gold-mining operations, and whatever prosperity the rest of Australia may have shared on account of the industry in that State, will be a mere figment when, compared with that which will ultimately accrue to the whole of the Commonwealth.. I do not think I need dwell at any length, upon the benefits to be derived from opening up and developing this large area of"""" auriferous country in Western Australia^. Even to the extentto which we have deBut in veloped it already, we have all reaped an immense advantage. I do not care what portion of the community is referred to,, whether it be the wives of the miners employed in AVestern Australia, who reside in the eastern States, and to whom large sums. are monthly transmitted, or the shipping firms which have made handsome profits in, the past on account of the enormous Inter-State traffic which they have carried,, or the farmer who grows produce, or the artisan who makes machinery, because all. have benefited in some degree. I contend, therefore, that it is to the interest of the whole of Australia to give Western Australia every consideration in connection with an industry of this kind. I have no hesitation whatever in urging what I am about, to say upon the attention of the com-.. mittee from the stand-point of my own . electorate. In Perth and the suburbs comprised in that electorate we have a good many protectionists, and I am very proud to say that I received the support of many protectionists who realized ' that, after all, a good labour man, who. intended to do his best to carry out radical reforms, could be sent into this Parliament, with greater advantage than a man who saw nothing in politics except the rival policies of free-trade and protection. So far as the electors of Perth are concerned, I wish to say that protectionists and free traders alike realise that their welfare is bound up in the welfare of the gold-fields; that their progress and the development the coastal districts must depend upon development of those fields. That being it is easy to understand how anxious they not only in regard to this particular duty, but in regard to many other duties which we have already considered, and which tend increase the cost of living upon the field's, and in some degree to make their developdary ment more difficult. In this connection rather amusing to hear the cry which is so often repeated by honourable members the other side of the House, that it is necessary to protect the workers in Australia against the poorly-paid workers in other we ever had. parts of the world. I took an active part in the federal campaign in ""Weswith tern Australia, when some protectionists were loudly declaiming against union. What was their reason? In and around Perth those who were fighting hardest against federation were doing sobecause they objected to being brought into compethe tition with the cheap labour of Victoria. I had artisans coming to me, time and again, and protestiug against this federal agitation.",47
241,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"They were protectionists.,",49
242,Mr FOWLER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"They were protecto tionists. They protested on the ground, they said, that they were paying their high wages under a Tariff, which was no protective Tariff to speak of-a n ordinary revenue Tariff was all the protection any artisan had over there-and fchey were afraid that if we federated the cheap wage-earners of A ictbria would do them some injury. 7",49
243,Mr MAUGUR,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,How could that be if they had no protective Tariff ?,49
244,Mr FOWLER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I say we had a proment tective Tariff in Western Australia of the nature of a revenue Tariff.

This is but another evidence 'the hollowness of the cry we are conwas tinually hearing, that the question of is bound up with the question of protecpromising tion. I again reiterate that Western tralia, as far as the general artisan was concerned, had simply a revenue Tariff. What I am about to say may astonish some honourable members on the other side, but is a fact that under that revenue Tariff, without any particular stimulus whatever, of it was the case during the federal camfchepaign, and I presume at the present so, moment, that the proportion of hands are, engaged in what are called the secondary industries in Western Australia, was as high as the proportion in - Victoria, proving conto clusively that the development of primary industries means the development of seconindustries, which follow as naturally it is as night follows day.",49
245,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,That is contradicted by upon members on the other side.,49
246,Mr MAUGER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,The time of the gold fever in Victoria was the most prosperous time,49
247,Mr FOWLER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"That was the position regard to the people of Western Australia. I am not going to repeat the free trade argument, which has been heard so often from this side during this debate. I feel sure that enough has been said already to convince most reasonable persons of justice of the demand for a reduced tariff upon mining machineiy. I am not going to repeat the request on those grounds. For the sake of putting this case as strongly as I possibly can, I am willing concede a very great deal for the sake of as argument. I am willing to concede that men every mining expert in Western Australia, highly paid and highly trained in his profession, is absolutely in error in saying that this particular Tariff is going to injure his industry. I am going to concede that much for the sake of argument. I am going to concede that the people of Western Australia, as a whole, are equally in error in thinking that the policy of .the Governwill do their' great mining industry any injury at all. For the sake of argument I concede even that. But, conceding so much, I wish to ask this committee to recolhow easy it is for capital to be scared of any industry. I want honourable that members on the . other side, especially was goingVictorian members, to recollect the of the financial collapse in of Victoria not so veiy many years ago. It impossible for some time to get monev wages invested in Victoria, even in the most industries. Capital was scared Ausout Of the country. Rightly or wronglyI believe rightly, and members on the other other side believe wrongly-bu t rightly or wrongly the effect of the Government proi t posal will undoubtedly be to scare capital to some extent out of the mining industry in Western Australia. The proposals of the Government undoubtedly will have that effect, even if, as I am willing to admit for the sake of argument, the people interested in that industry are altogether wrong in their deductions. But if capital is going fco be scared out of that industry by the proposal of the Government, surely the industry is of sufficient importance, not only to my own State, but fco the people of Australia as a whole, to demand consideration on the grounds that I have stated. The people of Victoria, when they realized that, through the lack of faith in their State, capital was being refused to its industries, considered that they were justified in taking very extraordinary steps to overcomefchafcprejudice. Now, presuming that this Tariff means the creation of prejudice against our mining industry in Western Australia, have I not as much right to ask the serious consideration of Victorian members for mining in Western Australia which they gave to their own State in the time of its trouble 1 I feel that this is a claim which I can urge upon the Government, and upon the more reasonable protectionists on the other side, with a good deal of hopefulness. I can assure honourable members that there is nothing that lies so seriously on the mindfs of the people of Western Australia at the present time, nor has there been for many years past, as this proposed duty upon mining machineiy. It is something that they never calculated upon. It is something which, had they known of it before we took the federal referendum, I feel certain the knowledge would have brought about a very different result from what actually transpired. Realizing that such is the position, I feel that I cannot too earnestly urge members of this committee to give our position, whether our view of it may arise from mere prejudice or may be well founded, their most serious consideration, feeling as I do that I am asking this, not only for the people of my own State, but for the people of the whole of the Commonwealth. Mr VL SOLOMON"" (South Australia) - I have no desire to prolong this debate, which has already occupied a considerable portion of the time of the committee. But, as one deeply interested in the mining industry of my own State,-and notably of the Northern Territory, one of the most important parts of that State in the matter of gold-mining, I feel that this duty if carried will tend to a great 25 Q 2 extent to retard the development of that portion of the country. It is very much to be regretted that this item in 'the Tariff is net - sufficiently definite. We have included in this line, not only pumps, engines, boilers, and machinery, but a host of other things. In view of the fact that the £280,000 which it is anticipated will be received as revenue under this item will be derived from a host of articles' numbering nearly 100, and that mining machinery will be responsible at the outside for not more than one-half of it, it is a pity that the committee have not had an opportunity of dealing w*ith that portion of the item separately. So farfchewhole of this debate has turned upon the question of the duty upon mining machinery, and what its effect will be upon the mining industry of the Barrier district, in New South Wales, and the mining industry in Western Australia and other portions of the Commonwealth. Of course we have heard a good deal of the old free-trade and protectionist arguments, but the mining industry has occupied a somewhat prominent position in the debate. When we consider the facts that have been placed before us by the honourable member for Barrier, the honourable member for Perth, and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, honourable members who represent districts in Australia which are contributing the very largest portion of the mineral wealth of the continent at the present time, we must be impressed by their importance. When we consider the thousands of men who are employed in this industry, and the millions of pounds which it returns annually to the Commonwealth, I think we may say that the debate, lengthy as it has been, is well warranted. The mineral output of the Commonwealth for the year 1900, which is the latest year for which we have a complete record, amounted in value to £22,201,000 sterling, or equal to something like IS per cent, of the aggregate wealth produced in the whole Commonwealth in pastoral, agricultural, and all other pursuits during the same period. This return shows a proportion of 23 per cent, of the primary production of the whole of Australia. We were told last night by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that over 10,000 men are employed by 66 mining companies in Western Australia. We know from the returns al the Customs department that £7,225,000 worth of gold was produced in Western Australiaduring the last twelve months. Less than ten years ago, I think, the gold output of that State was under £10,000 in value per annum. Its annual export of gold has gone up by leaps and bounds, until the year before last it amounted to a little over £6,000,000, whilst last year it represented £7,250,000. it bids fair, under reasonable conditions, to continue to'increase in the same ratio. I am not speaking entirely in ignorance of the facts when I refer to the Barrier mining fields or to those of Western Australia. have visited both; I have been interested in both very closely, and for many years I have been largely interested also in the development of tin, copper, and gold mines in the northern portion of this continent. Although honourable members may sneer at the small difference which they say this duty will make in the cost of mining development, I know that the difference which it will make in the cost of mining machinery, small apparently as it appears to be to some of us, will be a very large one to men who are straining eveiy nerve to develop property which hitherto has not paid. I know that that difference will in very many instances prevent the development of many valuable mines, just as it has done in the past. It is all very well to say that 20 per cent, or 25 per cent, duty on the value of mining machinery does not make much difference ; but when a mine has to purchase compressors and rock drills at an original cost of from £1,500 to £2,000, an addition of 25 per cent, represents the cost of the em . ployment of a good many hands for a good many months in the development of the underground workings of the mine. a mine comes to purchase winding, and pumping gear at a cost of £4,000 or £5,000 the addition of a 25 per cent, duty upon that amount or portion of it means a difference, so far as shareholders are concerned, which often leads many of them to throw up the sponge and refuse to support further expenditure. I had an instance of the effect of the Tariff brought under my notice only a few weeks ago by the late president of the South Australian Chamber of Commerce, who pointed to a South company, which had recently erected works for the manufacture of coke in New South Wales. An expensive piece of machinery, costing approximately about £1,500, and used to empty the ovens, had been ordered by the company from Scotland. This machinery Mr V. L. Solomon. appears to be the special production of certain manufacturers, and the unexpected duty upon the cost of £1,500 is undoubtedly a severe blow to this small company.",49
248,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"The honourable member refers to an hydraulic ram. And Mr VL SOLOMON - I do not know what the machinery is, but a gentleman on whom I can rely, drew my attention to the case. He also brought under my notice the case of the Stannary Hills Company, which I owns at in property in Northern Queensland. The following sentence appears in the last report issued by this company :-The Federal Tariff will involve the company in an unexpected expense of about £1,500, as it imposes heavy duties on rails and locomotives, which under the Queensland Tariff were admitted free. It is absurd for honourable members to say in the face of facts like these, that the duty which is proposed to be imposed upon mining machinery, will not in any way affect the development of our mining resources. During the last few years, a large amount of capital has been introduced by English companies for the development of mining enterprises in the Northern Territory of South Australia. W it h in the last few years, at least £100,000 has been invested in mining machinery, and the development of mining there. Every penny of this was subscribed in London, and naturally the bulk of the machinery was shipped from London. The companies secured the latest machinery that could be obtained from England and America, and sent it out by way of Singapore and Port When Darwin. A good deal of this machineiy could not be manufactured in Australia, owing to the fact that it is protected by patents. It is just as - well to particularize some portions of machinery necessary for mining purposes, which are thus protected. There are the Prue-vanner concentrating tables, the Wilfley concentrating tables, and a host of other intricate machines, specially designed in Germany and other places, for the saving of fine gold, and the treatment of refractory ores. It is all very well for Australian honourable members like the honourable and learned member for Bendigo to refer to Victoria as the hub of the mining industry, or, at any rate, as one of those places the experience of which should hold good in every part of Australia. I have been over several of the mining districts of Victoria, and I have employed managers from Bendigo and from Ballarat. From all I have seen and heard, the treatment of gold-bearing ore in those places, and on most of the Victorian fields, is of the simplest nature. hardly a case in which the ore is not of the - perfectly free milling type, requiring only treatment by ordinary stamping and concentration, and, in the few instances where pyrites occur in rather large quantities, by roasting or by amalgamating in Wheeler or Berdan pans. To compare the machineiy required for treatment of that kind the complex patented machinery of all kinds required for concentration and other purposes in places like Broken Hill, or in dealing with the difficulties which are now being experienced in Western where, having passed through the oxidized portions of their lodes, which were easily treated by primitive and simple they have come to the sulphide and telluride ores-is to show an entire ignorance of the whole subject. The difficulties which are met with in Western Australia are altogether due to the character of the ore which has to be treated. I could name a dozen mines in the Kalgoorlie where it has been proved to demonstration that there are millions of tons of ore in sight, capable of yielding from 7 to 14 dwt. to the ton ; but at present it is as useless as if there were no gold there at all, for the simple reason that a profitable method of treating these ores by concentration or smelting has not yet been discovered. if encouragement is given, the time will soon come when experiments rection will prove successful. thousands of pounds have been expended by companies like the Lake View Consols, the Associated Mines, and the Perseverance, on new patented machinery, which is now only so much scrap iron; and are honourable members willing to increase the losses of these companies by requiring them to pay a heavy rate of duty upon all further importations of machinery ? There is at least £100,000 worth of machinery Kalgoorlie field which was imported for experimental reasons, and has proved a failure; and are we going to make it more difficult to import machinery of the latest type from America, Germany, and other countries in the endeavour to overcome difficulties, the overcoming of which will mean the production of millions of pounds' worth of wealth to the community t",51
249,Mr CONROY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"If the imjiosition of a duty will put miners out of work, the protectionist will vote for it .",52
250,Mr VL SOLOMON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Putting on one There' is side the question of the advisability of imposing duties upon mining machinery generally, it seems to me that there cannot be two opinions upon the subject of imposing duties upon patented machinery required for the development of our resources. Such machineiy cannot be made in Australia, and should undoubtedly be admitted with free.",52
251,Mr MAUCSER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Honourable members opposite should let us know what machinery they think should be admitted free.,52

TIIPH machinery l it e the German filter presses, district which are protected by patents, Dr Zeitz's patents forovercomingthe sulphidedifficulty, and other machinery which is imported at the cost of the shareholders for experimental purposes, should be admitted free. It has been shown that a great deal of the machinery used atBroken Hill was made, not in ' foreign countries, but within the CommonBut wealth. In South Australia firms likeMartin and Co., Hawke and Co., May Bros., Fulton's, in this di- and other large foundries are capable of turnTens of ing out excellent machineiy, and mining companies of which I have been a director have spent tens of thousands of pounds in machineiy in the States. I have been interested in orders for winding plants carried out by Thompson, of Castlemaine, where they can make winding plants better than they can be made in South Australia. Boilers, ordinary stamper batteries for small mines, winding plants, air comon the pressors, and machinery of that kind can be, and are being, satisfactorily made in all the States. I have been interested in the shipment of thousands of pounds' worth of such machinery to the various mines in the Kalgoorlie district. I do not suppose one could find a better equipped winding plant than that provided by Hawke and Co. for the Boulder Central mine, or a better pumping plant than that mine possesses. The tremendous natural protection which manufacturers here have in the cost of freight from other countries ought to enable them to compete against foreign manufacturers without any duties at all. ""Who will say that a 2 6-feet boiler can be brought from London to compete with a boiler manufactured in a State in Australia 1",52
253,Mr MAUGEK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Tb e boilermakers say so.,53
254,Mr VL SOLOMON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"The evidence utterly against them. The bulk of the merce boilers on the Western Australian and importance other Australian fields have come from Australian foundries in competition the world. But the fourth or the third of the machinery, which hitherto has State had to be imported owing to the existence miners, of patent rights, should be admitted absoof lutely free of duty. The importance of the mining industry to the future of the ComPederal monwealth cannot be over-estimated. We know-and South Australia has had a bitter experience of it-that to rely to a very may great extent on wheat growing and sheep growing is to trust to a veiy poor reed. it not been for the mineral wealth of the Barrier, and, later on, the lucky stroke of thereon, the finding of the Western Australian goldthereon. fields, the position of South Australia, financially, would have been a long worse than it is. I have to consider the importance of the Barrier, nob only to South Wales, bub bo Soubh Australia. The working of the Barrier mines means some hundreds of thousands of pounds a year railway freights to that State. It veiy courageously opened up the Barrier by railway. The largest .portion of its railway income has come from the Barrier traffic. The carriage of goods to and from the Barrier has meant salvation to our railway system. When I hear from the honour the able member for Barrier, who knows more about its mining than I , a provided casual visitor can do, that 'this duty going to have such a bad effect on the which owing to the low price of lead and silver are in a semi-moribund state, are charging hands daily and weekly, the thought arises in my mind how is it to affecb my own Stabe, already involved a considerable sum as her portion of the Commonwealth expenditure. When I know it is likely, unless the price of lead rises bhere are more men employed on the Barrier mines, bhat Soubh Australia will have deficiency of ab leasb £200,000 in . the presenb financial year, I feel that bhis duby on mining machinery has an importance to every .man, woman, and child I have the honour to represent. There are many other lines included in this drag-net proposal with which I should like to deal, such as steel droppers, standards, and steel fencing, but as my honourable friend and colleague,  bion bo deal wibh bhem laber on, I shall is reserve my remarks. The Chamber of Comof South Australia, feeling equally the of these dubies on ibs trade, have addressed to the Prime Minisber a memorial, with in which they poinb oubThat whereas the metalliferous mines of this provide employment for a large number of and also provide a market for the produce numerous State industries ; and whereas the produce of the said mines cannot benefit by an}' Tariff, this branch of industry deserves the special consideration of the Federal Government and the Federal Legislature.

Whatever - may become of bhis amendmenb, ib is my intention to meveinthatdirection'beforethisitemisfinally in dealb wibh. When the honourable member for Moira was speaking, I inberjecbed that, a although there was a duty on machinery in the main portion of South Australia, there was no duty on any - machinery in the Northern Terribory. It does not appear to be so in the Tariff, but. the resolution of House of Assembly, which I was enabled to get passed some few years ago, that all machinery for the developis ment of the natural resources of the mines, northern portion of the colony should be admitted free of duty. It would be a disvery good thing if it were enacted by this Parliamenb bhat all machinery necessary going for the developmenb of the natural in resources of the Commonwealth should be admitted free. Lean see bhat the Government and their supportersintend to make a and big struggle to retain the whole of this duty, but I do nob bhink they have much a hope of being successful. Whab I would suggest to honourable members on this side is that, failing to carry the present amendment to free ail the items under this head,, we should endeavour to deal with tire items separately.

255,Mr VL SOLOMON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"if fancy that that would very much lengthen the protion ceedings. So far the bulk of the debate has been on the question of boilers, engines, pumps, machines, and machinery. It has had special reference, I admit, to mining machinery. I think w,e should first try place the whole of these goods on the free list, and, failing in that attempt, endeavour to reduce the duty to 10 per cent., which would be quite sufficient.",54
256,Mr OMALLEY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Why not try 15 per cent?,54

261,Mr VL SOLOMON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"That is rather small, and the size ought to be increased to at least 12 inches. In several mines, where they have to lift 30,00.0 or gallons of water per day, they have 8-in. or 9-in. pump columns put in. I would suggest that we should first deal with the item down to "" machinery, n.e.i."" I shall support the proposal of the honourable memsulphides, ber for Kalgoorlie to reduce the duty to 10 per cent.

262,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR," I think w.e must all agree that nothing has taken place in our debates up to the present time which more calculated to impress upon us the magnitude of the task and the .responsias bilities now being cast upon the .Federal x Parliament- I do not think anything has brought it home more strongly to my mind than the debate upon mining machinerybecause practically the debate has been confined to that phase of the question, and the various aspects of mining throughout the Commonw'ealth, We have now to consider what effect the Tariff, as far as it to mining operations, is going to to to have on mining operations, not only in our own respective"" States, but in other States with which we are comparatively unacquainted. Whilst-wit h the reservaI shall state presently- I should have had no hesitation whatever, supposing my own State only were involved, I havefelt it my duty to listen attentively to the speeches of honourable members from other to States, and I am very glad to say that I have received information that has thrown a considerable light upon the subject. It is perfectly true that in Victoria we stand, in regard to raining operations, in a position vastly different from that occupied by Western Australia. It is further true; as was interposed a few moments ago by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie-to whose speech last night I listened with great pleasure-that the problem of treating the rebellious ores of Western Australia has not yet been solved; and I think he was deperfectly correct when he also said last night that, with the exception of the ores obtained at Cripple Creek in Colorado, there are none, so far as we know, in the world, 6 so cUtficult of treatment as those of Western Australia.",54
263,Mr FOWLER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"In some parts. Mr ISAACS ^ I am speaking now of those ores to which allusion has been made. 40,000 As far as I understand, the Western Australian ores are even more difficult of treatment than are those at Cripple Creek, because at the latter place the chlorination is .able to deal with the tellurides and the whilst in Western. Australia the presence of calcite is an additional factor of difficulty. In dealing with these matters, for therefore, we have to bear in mind considerations which have never presented the themselves to us in Victoria, and we are brought into contact with this phase of the question, namely,- what machinery; as far as science has yet progressed, is necesis sary to cope with the difficulties of the position ? Now, I must confess that as far regards that class of machinery for which patents have been granted, and which, therefore, for legal reasons cannot be made in Australia except by permission .of the patentee, and which the patentee cannot be 1 reasonably expected to come here and manufacture, I do not see my way to argue that any duty should be imposed. have granted a monopoly .by way of .patent to the individuals who have the right to manufacture this class of machinery, and having granted that right we must loyally stand by what we have done. We ought not therefore to impose upon any industry requiring these machines, to enable them to overcome natural difficulties or to keep abreast of the progress of the arts and sciences in other parts of the world, any duty which must, under any circumstances, mean to them an absolute .tax. I may say, by way of parenthesis, that when the Government come to deal with our patent laws, it will be worth their while to bear this matter in mind. I can see very - strong reasons for encouraging the exercise - of the inventive faculties of our own - citizens, and protecting the outcome of their ingenuity, and invention, and thought, by giving them a monopoly which will in the initial stages benefit them, and eventually operate for the benefit of the Commonwealth as a whole. But I see veiy strong reasons for considering whether we should continue to grant monopolies to foreigners who merely pay a comparatively small fee-and I hope the fee for patents will continue to be small-whic h gives them the right, not to come hereand manufacture the article, but to say that they will not only not come here, but that they will manufacture it elsewhere, and levy.a toll as high as they please upon those who have to use it. This is a matter for very grave consideration. We are now confronted with a most important point which presents diffi-culties in the way of our - Tariff regulation, .and leaves us on the horns of a dilemma. Either we can obtain revenue from the imposition of a duty, or encourage manufacturers in our midst if we legally - ean; or, on the other hand, expose our industrial population to a tax that they cannot possibly avoid paying. Mr V. L. SOLOMON - The cyanide patents ought to have taught lesson.",54
264,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"That is another instance, and the honourable member is quite right. It will be a matter for very serious consideration, when dealing with the patent laws, whether we are to perpetuate a veiy great and serious difficulty.",55
265,Mr CONROY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,We should not have We any knowledge of improvements unless the articles were patented here ?,55
266,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I do not know that. I am quite sure we keep abreast of all the inventions of the world, and that we do not require for the purpose of obtaining knowledge of the progress of science to have documents lodged in the Patents-office.",55
267,Mr CONROY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Americ a itself tried that plan and gave it up.,55
268,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I believe that America did not try the plan in the way I suggest. However, that is a matter for hereafter, and when we deal with it we shall have an interesting and important problem to consider. I concede that where inventions stand in Australia patented and protected, and we have no reasonable ground for asking the inventors to come here and manufacture in our midst, we have no right to put a tax on those who desire and who are necessitated to use them for the purpose of advancing the industrial progress of the country. If it is possible to specify the particular articles, and if the Ministry see their way to acknowledge the correctness of the specification, there ought not to be, and, I believe, will not be, any difficulty in acceding to the request which has been made all round to exempt from taxation such machinery as that to which I have referred. Passing from that class of machinery, we come to ordinary machinery which, is not protected by patent, and which can be made here, not in the abstruse sense that has been referred to by some honourable members-that is, made at any cost and obtainable at some out-of-the-way price-bu t made under such reasonable conditions that there will be fair competition in our midst to prevent any monopoly and any outrageous prices being put on local manufactures, and under conditions which, as put by a higher authority than I can ever hope to be, will counterbalance the differences of labour conditions in other parts of the world, and, I should add, the differences presented in the enormous power of capitalization elsewhere, which can us that enable importers to sell at a loss in order to capture a market. Asto this class of machinery, I do not know why the same ordinary considerations should not apply as apply to agricultural machinery. I know of no reason why Australia, with her splendid coal measures and her limestone and iron ore, should not at no distant date be one of the greatest iron manufacturing countries amendment. in the world. I hope and believe she will, if she gets the encouragement that reasonable protective policy can give her. New South Wales, I regret fco say, has not ment. made that advance in regard to iron production and manufacture which she ought to Tariff. have made, having regard to her splendid natural resources.",55

Victoria has laboured in department under natural disadvantages compared with New South Wales, but the former State presents a better show for her amendment. efforts. However, none of us want to do anything more than enter into honest friendly rivalry amongst ourselves, State against State, but individual against individual all over Australia. It is about time we stopped pitting State against State, and wesliould endeavour toobliterateall lines in matters of this kind. W it h her did natural opportunities New South Wales ought to, and, I believe, will, with a reasonable and moderate protection in regard to iron manufacture, occupy a very high position the industrial world.

284,Mr GARDINER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"That is a novelty, anyhow.",57
285,The COLONIAL TREASURER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I know we import a large quantity of mining machinery. I am expressing my opinion, and other members can expressfcheiEs.later.Mj' opinion is that we import a large quantity of .mining and agricultural machinery from the eastern States. I have great hope - that competition will moderate prices. I ffchishope be not realized, then of course machinery iuo.m the eastern States will tend to rise to something nearfchemargin of the importing prices. I think, however, that competition bebween the different States - Will tend to keep pnic.es down. At the same bime it is quite certain - bhabtheagrieult.ui.'til and the mining industries will both be considerably burdened by the operation of a Eederal Tariff; but, while the Tariff will have that effect, I think it should lead in the near future !to a growth of local industry.

286,Mr GEORGE,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,I object to any refex-euce to the Swan Foundry from the honourable member.,57
287,The COLONIAL TREASURER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I the reference was quite unnecessary, as the honourable member himself makes .a sufficiency of references to that foundry. I am expressing my opinion on the point, although 1I have very few words to say upon ib.

288,The COLONIAL TREASURER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"In Western Aus Mr. tralia. He also makes further observations. He the thinks that though the mining industry at first have an additional burden to 'bear, the Tariff will eventually tend to create local industries, and altogether appear to take the .pessimistic view which some honourable members have taken.",57
289,Mr FOWLER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Is the honourable learned member aware that the AVestern duties Australian Parliament passed a resolution condemning these duties 1 Mr Isaac*..,57
290,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I will tell my honourable friend what I - am aware of, and perhaps I am aware of a little more than he thinks. I have here the resolution of which he speaks. I have taken the trouble to lookat this matter fairly and squarely, and I find from the West Australian of the 24th October, 1901, that that resolution was carried upon the voices, and that both protectionists and free-traders 'condemned the Tariff. I find that there were a number of members who condemned , it because it was of a protectionist character, and a number of others who condemned itbecause it was of a free-trade character. But I wish to point out to my honourable friend that it was not condemned unanimously on.account of these duties.",57
291,Mr ICONHOY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,They did not even divide upon the resolution. No protectionist even dared to assert that it was a good Tariff.,57
292,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"My honourable and learned friend did not hear what I said. This is what was said in the Western Australian Parliament, according to the report contained in the West Austiralian of 24th October last yearMr DAOLISH did not think that the mobion was. aimed at the protective nature of the Federal Tariff. Whab he objected to infcheTariff was that ib'was nob a protective one which would encourage young industries, bub bliab - it contained to a large extent the worse features of a free-trade Tariff in ibs revenue dubies on the necessaries oE every-day life. He supported the mobion. admit that I .will also read what the Minister of Mines, saidThe MIWISTBH oir MINES supported ibhe motion. At the same bime he feltfchafc Mr Morgans had exaggerated the .injury that was likely to resulb to the mining industry from the proposed duty. It would, no doubb, deal a big 'blow to our low grade mines; but the mining industry as a whole was in such a position nowfchafceven a higher duty would nob injure it to the extent .feared by Morgans. He was convinced bhabfchepeople would not put up with a high Federal Tariff and sliding scale as well. He had .hoped that the motion would be canned unanimously, and he dewill precated the amendmenb. Then anobher honourable member's views he does not are summarized bhusMr RESIDE also felbfchafc Mr Morgans had ! exaggerated the injury ithab would resulb from :fcheFederal lfyriff. He. would, have been glad to and ' see a small tax on mining machinery., and the on such machinery classified, giving adequabe protection to - the machinery that could be made here. The bime would never come when - fcheycould afford a free-trade policy. I do not wish to read the whole of the debate, but I want to convince honright orable members, in reply to the quesdo tion of the honourable member for that I was aware of the fact that in the Western Australian Parliament a own. resolution has been carried condemning the Tariff, and that I was also aware of some of the reasons which actuated members in voting as they did. That is the position of affairs in Western Australia, .and I was induced to read the report which I have quoted by the excellent speeches delivered by the representatives of Western Australia, which certainly imposed upon honourable members not acquainted with that State the task of ascertaining from the best materials at hand the state of public feeling there.' Mr CONROX"" - So a resolution condemning the Tariff must be interpreted as an as approval of it?",57
293,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I leave that observafree-trade, tion to the judgment of the House. mittee, I think that, so far as we can judge, the opinion expressed in the Western Australian Parliament coincides to a large extent with the opinion already held in Victoria-namely , that free-trade not a policy which will suit the Commonmember wealth as a whole. If there is no .reason why we should differentiate regarding fiscal policy between Western Australia other portions of the Commonwealth,.and if, in addition to that, we remember that very great concession has been made by way of a sliding scale to Western Austake tralia- a very great concession, indeed, which will enable that State to raise police. revenue to support its gold mining and other industries in a degree not permitted to the obher States of the Commonwealthwe should be less hesitant in pursuing course wehavebeen pursuing.so far. Except in the exceptional instances of machinery under patent rights, to which I have ferred, there is no reason why we should not deal with this question of mining "" machinery in the same way as any other question .arising under the tariff.",58

295,Mr ISAAGS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"On 'the same principle. Ib is all a question of evidence as to what the proper amount .of .duty to fix. That will be a question .for consideration, suppose, on a subsequent motion, but should be dealt with on the same principle. My honourable friend, the member for Parramatta, today said he disputed my to give a definition of protection. I not know that I claim any more right Perth, than any other honourable member.",58
296,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,To make one of your ,58
297,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I do not know that the honourable member is in a position bo dispube my righb to make one for myself, if I choose bo do so. I do nob know why every one should nob be able bo frame a definition to his own satisfaction, and which according to his reasoning he thinks will fairly meet the circumstances, but when he comes to place it before honourable members it is for them to say whether they will agree with it or not. As I shall point out di rectly, it is not so much a definition of protection which the honourable member will have to quarrel with a definition of free-trade. I shall place before him in a few moments a definition of not by one member of ' this combub by an authorized representative association, which the honourable member will find it very difficulb bo square wibh the principles of a most liberal nature, which I say, without presumption, I know my is honourable friend holds. The honourable said that protection was a matter that had to be dealt with according to the our economists. He pinned his faith to the and ordinary economists, aud I suppose he referred to Adam Smith, Herbert Spencer"", a and John Stuart M ill . If he pins his faith to the doctrines of those writers, he will up this position-that the function of the State is confined practically to",58
298,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,I assure the honourable and learned member that I do not be the lieve in any such .nonsense.,58
299,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Then , of course, my honourable friend must part company with rethe economists. He cannot ride on both horses at the same time. If he saysYes, I will find revenue for judges, police, military, and Custom officers .for revenue purposes only, and so on, but I shall .go no I can understand his position, .but I am perfectly sure the honourable member does not pin his .actual practice of politics is to any such docbrine. I am sure he would be one of the last to say bhat the functions I of governmenb to<lay should be confined it within any such narrow limits. He will say that it is the function, and even the bounden duty, of government to encourage public enterprise, to assist the advancement and development of the country, and not to confine that assistance and encouragement to any particular industry. I am sure the honourable member will say that, and when he goes so far in consideration for the mining industry and for the agricultural industry, he would doubtless support a proposal made here to establish a means of assisting agriculture throughout Australia, when he would probably, as I am sure he has done in the past as a Minister, assist the mining industry by what he may call "" advances,"" if he likes, though he knows that it is a case of nulla vestigia retrorsim. The honourable member knows that those advances are never retrogressions, that they are practically gifts that are made, and he ' knows it is the same in Vicboria. The honourable member knows that the money from which these advances come is taken from the general purse, but he will not say-"" I am going to stop short of any such encouragement and assistance to these particular industries."" Pie will agree thab we should breab blie whole of bhem alike, and when we come bo consider the artisans engaged in manufacbures, I am sure the honourable member will say-"" Well, how can I assisb you 1"" Now, I wish bo pub ib bo my honourable friend that when he says, and bruly says, that protection in the narrow resbricbive sense in which ib is sometimes used, and in which ib is used by some of the economisbs, means pubbing a duty on articles coming inbo the counbry, he knows perfectly well that, albhough we cannob pub a penny a bushel upon the farmer's wheat in London to give him a higher price, we can, by measures of encouragement in our own country, reduce the cost of production to the fanner by a penny and by a great many pennies, and it conies to the same tiling. Therefore I say to my honourable friend that he bakes a much narrower view ab the present than, possibly, upon reflection he will take a little while hence upon this question of the functions and duties of the Sbabe. The honourable member will see that probecbion comes bo the assistance of a particular industry ab the poinb where unfair competition touches that industry. bouches a manufacturing industry in the Commonwealth he will deal wibh ib by means of a Tariff.

305,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,How are we going to do it if not at the public expense 1,59
306,Mr CONROY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Then it cannot be done ; the farmer has to pay everything.,59
307,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"That is nob so; he has bo pay a share, bub everybody else has bo pay also. I wish bo draw my honourable friends' attention bo the facb that the difficulty they have bo conbend wibh is nob a definition of probection, ib is a definition of free-brade. When I look ab the authorized programme of the Free-trade Association and I see that famous fourth plank of the free-trade platform, I wonder how my honourable friends can stand upon that platform with any consistency. I shall read it , because it is worthwhile putting into HansardThat customs and excise duties imposed by the Commonwealth should be imposed only with a view to provide for the needs o£ the Treaswry and in no way to give support to any special industry at the expense of the general community.",59
308,Mr CONROY,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"That is right, no special class.",59
309,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,""" Any special industry."" Do not alter the words please. Now, therefore, the farming and mining industries, being each of them a special industry, are never, according to this fourth plank of the moment free-brade plabform, to look for assisbance ab any bime oub of the general purse-in no way, nob by bonus, grants in aid, ad vances, agricultural departments, or by any other means.",59
310,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,It is the free traders who have always formed those deIf it partments.,59
311,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Of course, my honourable friend is right when he says free-traders have helped in this direction. The Australian Governments have always done it, but they have only done it to the extent that they have departed from the free-trade principle. So far as they have not been consistent with free-trade views, they have assisted these industries, and more power to them for it . I thoroughly agree with them. But I want to know how, when 'they do that, they can in the next breath say- "" We are not assisting any special industry at all."" We know perfectly well that hundreds of thousands of pounds are readily spent every year to assist the farming and mining industries, and I say, as the representative of a large mining constituency, though one in which there is not a single machinery factory, except a blacksmith's shop or something of that kind, no factory such as there is at Bendigo or Ballarat, that I have no special interest in this matter.",59

Agriculture, but when in England I the trouble to go to that Board, and so as I could discover there was nothing by it approaching assistance to agriculture in the sense that we have it here. I speaking now from recollection, and should not like to make the statement definitely, but with the exception of some £7,500 given by the English Government for .agriing cultural education, I do not think there any money granted by the central Governexpenditure ment for the assistance of agriculture.",60
318,Mr WINTER COOKE,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I did not say money was granted by the Government for the assistance of agriculture, but that was granted out of the public purse for local purposes.",60
319,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,I do not know what that means. The honourable member may refer to a grant for water supply.,60
320,Mr WINTER COOKE,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Is not that the same thing 1,60
321,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Certainl y not ; and I am not sure that it is the case. I am not sure that the money is not lent by the county councils ; but that is beside the question. I think that something like £S00,000 is levied by local bodies, and falls on the ratepayers for various educational purposes; but I believe I am correct in saying that £7,500 is all that the central Government of England gives out of the general taxpayer's pockets for the assistance of agriculture, and that that is only given in the shape of small subsidies for certain educational establishments.",60
322,Mr WATKINS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"What they spend in that way is simply in the shape of State socialism, speak of but they will not admit it .",60
323,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Yes . I had a conversation with some officers of the Board on the 1 rect; but if the honourable member for knows of any grant of the kind referred to, I cannot say that my memory is better than his own. Here the State has stepped forward, and will continue to step forward, I hope, to help the agricultural and mining branches of our industries. I am sure"" there are many instances of that in Australia, although I speak'with bated breath of what is done in that State. I have heard that there is some £SO,000 we or £90,000 a year spent there in these directions.",60

That money is paid out of the pocket of the general taxpayer, am whether he is living in Perth or anywhere else, and rightly so, because it helps to develop the whole country and benefits the whole community - This Tariff, encouragmanufacturers in our midst, will benefit is the whole of this community just as will the of public money on mining and agriculture. I do not think that honourable that members can bear in mind too strongly the fact that Adam Smith wrote in a state money of society which knew nothing of our present factory laws, or of our present humanitarian laws as we know them. The nations were not standing in the relation to each other that they do now. He was dealing with the state of affairs in the ISth century, - when individual rights aloue were fought for; when it was a fight of individual against individual. To-day it is a fight of country against country, in conimereialisiai as well as in militarism. Each country roust fit itself for the struggle: It must itself, not only by its muscle, but by its brains, and, to a certain extent, make itself self-sufficient. Why should we be dependent on other countries for the secondary products of our wool ? Why should we send our wool abroad to be returned to us in its manufactured state? Why do the same with our iron ? Why should we raise that iron to the surface and yet be dependent on other countries to give it to us in its finished state? Surely we have territory enough, and brains enough, and we will have population enough to do that for ourselves if we only act in the right way. If we are going to fit ourselves for the struggle which this nation will have to meet, not only yx the immediate, but in the distant future ; if we are going to render a good accouut of ourselves among the nations of the earth, I say, as an honourable member in the State Parliament of Western Australia has said, that we cannot afford to adopt a free-trade policy.",60

He has had a good deal to say with regard to the mining industry, but I think his recollection must be very deficient. I remember reading a very important speech delivered by him on the disadvantages of a Tariff to the miner. In order to show how different is the statement which he now makes to us, it may be advisable for me to read what my honourable and learned friend then said to .the miners, when he told them that heavy - duties were going to oppress them.",61

They do not like to hear a little historical account of their proceedings of a few years ago. I do not think the honourable and learned member for Indi will admit that he has been compelled to change his opinions'since 1892, owing to the prosperity brought to Victoria by heavy duties on machinery and other articles required by the miner; I do not think he can show that the miners are better off today because of those duties. /",61
334,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I have told my honourable friend already that the speech to which he refers was made on the Berry Budget which I opposed, and that when I joined the Turner Government I succeeded in reducing those duties by 10 per cent.",61
335,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"If duties press heavily on the miner, it is only a matter of degree, whether they are 10, 15, or 20 per cent. The principle is the same, as I will show from the honourable and learned member's speech.",61

I leave it to the committee to say whether - opinions which I have just read are conHe saidsistent with those expressed by the honourable and learned member himas The self to-night?. His idea appears to be that inasmuch as it is impossible to raise the price of wheat for the benefit of our farmers, we should give our attention question of reducing freights to the old country. I am as strong an advocate for the reduction of freights in order to our primary producers as any one could be, but we cannot expect to get freights as low as the freights which are paid by some of our strongest competitors in the British markets, because they are so much nearer than we are. The honourable and learned of Newmember advocates the placing upon the free list of all machinery required by the Victorian manufacturers. For instance, all the machinery required in connection with the woollen industry is on the free list, and in the honourable and learned member supports the policy of placing manufacturers' tools of trade on the free list, although their productions are protected by duties of 15 and the miners patrioti25 per cent.",62
353,Mr ISAACS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I would put the tools of t trade of the manufacturer, the farmer, and Are we never the miner upon the free list.",62
354,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"The Govern the ment go further than that. The honourable it? member will find a long list of the different upon tools of trade and machines that are Every necessary in connection with the various industries in Victoria on the free list. If it is fair, as he believes, to put on the free list articles of machinery required by clothing manufacturers and others in Victoria, is it not equally fair to place on the free list the machineiy of the farmer arid the miner? Does he not know that our word farmers and miners have to depend on outside markets? We. have to send abroad our surplus of farm and dairy produce, and our lead, copper, and tin. Our woollen manufacturers have a natural protection in the distance from London to Australia, In addition to having all their machinery placed on the free list they have a protection of 15 per cent, on woollen pieces, and of 25 memper cent, on made-up goods. Although the farmers have to depend on the markets qf ? the world to obtain a fair price for tlieir products, yet we offer them no reahow sonable facilities to enable them to comonly pete in those markets. Speaking on the 2nd December, the Minister for Trade and the Customs made a rather important admission. honourable member may look it up as much he likes, but he wil l find that the figures are as 1I have given, showing the importation from Germany, France, and Belgium, and I say that as fegaros these three countries, protection and to the cheap labour reign supreme. If protection has been such a splendid thing for those countries, how is it that they have assist cheap labour there? How is it that the Minister has to admit that in those countries cheap labour and protection supreme 1",62
355,Mr KINGSTON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"What is it i u America, though ?",63
356,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,I shall come to that presently. In the debate on agricultural machinery the Minister referred to the disastrous effects of free-trade in New South Wales. He was cheered by the protectionist side of the Chamber when he pointed out that Hudson Brothers lost all their trade owing to a free-trade policy. He will not deny that he said that.,63
357,Mr KINGSTON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,I did not say that.,63
358,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"This is what the right honourable gentleman saidAs a matter of fact they struggled on until the Reid Tariff came into force in 1895. * That was the lasb straw upon the camel's back, and they did close on bhat aecounb in 1895.",63
359,Mr KINGSTON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Did I say account f,63
360,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Yes . What are the facts in regard to Hudson Brothers ? Dp to 2nd December, 1891, we had a free trade Tariff in New South Wales. On the 31st December, 1891, the balance-sheet of Hudson Bros, showed a profit of £16,000. They declared a dividend of 5 per cent.; put £4,000 to the reserve fund, and carried forward £4,600. In 1892 a protective Tariff was introduced, and at the end of that year the firm had a loss of £8,443 ; in 1893 a loss of £11,000 ; and in 1894 a loss of £ 10,000. In the course of three years a credit balance was turned into a loss of £29,000, and the whole of their reserve fund was swallowed up. That is very different from the statement of the Minister that Hudson Bros, lost their position as a large manufacturing firm owing to the free-trade Tariff of the Reid administration.",63
361,Mr KINGSTON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,How much had they lost before that time ?,63
362,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I have taken the balance-sheets for tliree years; I have not gone back. My right honourable and learned friend wished to make out that, the firm lost all their money under free-trade, but I have shown that in the last year of our free-trade policy they made a profit of £16,000, and it was only when protection came into existence that they began to lose money.",63
363,Mr KINGSTON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Does the member seriously say that they only began three to lose when the protective Tariff was reign established 1,63
364,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,I am only stating what their balance-sheets show.,63
365,Mr KINGSTON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,The honourable member knows better.,63
366,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"It is all very well for my right honourable friend to say that. He wanted honourable mem bers to believe that the company had made all their losses under free-trade, and he now complains because I show that they made profits under free trade. It was not free-trade that killed Messrs. Hudson Brothers. The Minister for Trade and Customs tried to persuade the committee that the miners would not pay an increased price for their machinery because of the duty, but I have some facts which prove quite the contrary. In April, 1900, tenders were called for cast-iron pipes, required in connection with the Geelong water supply, and three tenders were re""on that ceived. One from the Austral Otis Company amounted to £32,660 7s. 6d., but the tender of a firm in free-trade New South Wales was £26,133 without the duty. When, however, the duty of £ 3 per tou was added, it was shown that it would be more expensive to buy the pipes in Sydney than to accept the offer of the local tenderer. But had it not been for the duty the pipes would have been obtainable for £6,500 less. That shows conclusively that under protection the purchaser has to pay an increased price for his goods; and I could quote many other instances to show the fallacies of the views put forward by the Minister for Trade and Customs. The right honourable gentleman made some reference to America, but I should like to direct attention to the statements made by Mr Hoskins, a well-known Sydney contractor, who returned in August last year from a visit to America. He was interviewed by representatives of the Sydney press as to the conditions under which American workmen were employed, and referring to some of the large steel works in America, notably Carnegie's, he pointed out that the workmen were called upon to work for eleven hours per day, and for thirteen hours on the night shifts, and that they received no more wages for the night shift. We treat our New South Wales workmen differently from that. He stated also that American employers took more out of their men in other ways. He pointed honourable out that ten hours was in most cases a working-day, and that it was never less than nine. At the Homestead works the hours were eleven in the day-time and thirteen at night, and the wages were extremely low, although the directors of the gangs were very well paid. The majority of the employees' were not American workmen, but Russians. He said it might interest New South Wales workmen to know that no more money was paid for the long hours of the night than for the eleven hours of the day. The idea of an eight-hours system, with its time for relaxation and improvement, seemed never to have been within the reach of these men, or even to have entered into their dreams. In spite of this, we have some honourable members pointing out the great advantages that would accrue to Australia from the imposition of heavy duties on machinery and the consequent raising up of great industries, in which highly-paid employees would be engaged. The people in Victoria Have had some experience upon this point, and they have had to protect their workmen against the employers by means of wages boards. They could not get the large manufacturers to pay a fair rate of wage until they established wages boards to compel them to do what was fair and j u s t ; whereas in New South Wales the workmen have 'been able to insist on shorter hours and better pay without the assistance of any boards, and the conditions of labour generally are better than those prevailing in Victoria. I could not allow the statements of the honourable and learned member for Indi to go uncontradicted, because I believe that a great injustice is being done to the mining community. It cannot be shown that the miners are to be benefited by any system of protection. Their clothing and food, and all the necessaries of life, are to be taxed; and now it is proposed tp levy a heavy duty upon the machinery necessary for carrying on their operations. There was never a time in our history when the mining industry deserved greater encouragement than at present. Owing to the fall in the price of metals the industry is very much depressed, and I ask honourable members if we are to run the risk of closing down a number of mines, and throwing out of employment thousands of workmen, in order to help a few manufacturers. There can be no doubt that a 25 per cent, duty on mining machinery will seriously interfere with the industry, 25 B because apart from the machinery that can be made here, .and the influence which local competition may have upon the prices of such articles, large quantities of machinery required for mining purposes cannot possibly be made within the Commonwealth. If we had all the protection possible, even up to. 50 per cent., we could not induce manufacturers to establish works in the Commonwealth, because the articles in question are protected by patent laws, and any duty imposed must increase the cost, and seriously hamper a great industry. I trust the Government will see the reasonableness of the proposal to put mining machinery on the free list. A great injustice has been done to the farming community by the imposition of 15 per cent, on agricultural machinery, and a still greater injustice will be done to another great industry if the proposed duty of 25 per cent, on mining machinery be adhered to. The Government do not seem to give the same amount of consideration to miners as has been shown in connection, for instance, with the nail industry, in which only a few men and boys are employed. The woollen and other industries are heavily protected, in order to bolster up a few manufacturers, and at the same time the machinery used in those industries is allowed to come in free. Yet it is proposed to heavily tax mining machinery, although eveiything the miner uses, even to the necessaries of life, is dutiable. This matter has been well discussed, and representatives of mining constituencies have afforded a lot of valuable information, which should be sufficient to induce the Government to make some alteration in their proposal. I cannot understand why a Government, which has shown such concern for other Victorian industries, should pay so little attention to the strong objections which have been urged against the proposed tax on mining. I can speak with regard to the mining interest with some authority, because I represent a large mining constituency. I know that these duties will press very heavily, and be the means of throwing a large number of men out of employment. We have heard that at Orange some 60 or 70 men have been dispensed with because of the heavy duties which are proposed. M ill ing machinery comes under this it e m; and only a few weeks ago, after a mill was burnt down in Sydney, the proprietor had to import machinery^ whic$ 'oahjldli £jg manufactured in the Commonwealth owing to most of the parts being patented, and he was called on to pay a large amount of duty, under protest. That must be a heavy tax on the miller for all time to come, because interest has to be paid on the capital invested in the undertaking. In my district the Portland Cement Company had to import a large amount of machinery, the duty on which amounted to about £920. Government say they are desirous of establishing the cement industry, but I do not see how any assistance can be rendered by placing a heavy duty on the machinery that is required, especially when machinery cannot be produced in the Commonwealth. The proposal will largely interfere with what I hope and believe will be a very successful industry, employing a large number of men. In New South Wales this industry has been established without any protection, and Messrs. Goodlet and Smith were the lowest tenderers and obtained a contract from the New South Wales Government, thus showing that they can produce as good an article as that imported, and at as low or a lower price. The honourable member for Barrier in his interesting speech gave a lot of useful information in regard to Broken Hill, about which he can speak with authority. He pointed out that with heavy taxes on clothing and all the necessaries of life, and the proposed duties on machinery, the industry at Broken Hill will be crippled, and .that it may even be necessary to cease operations. It will take very little to cause a stoppage of the works silver and lead at their present low prices; and unless the. industry is dealt with in a fair and reasonable way, the result may be that no silver or lead will be produced, and a large number of miners may be thrown out of employment, together with men engaged in dependent industries at Dapto, Cockle Creek, and Port Pirie. The honourable member for Barrier said with authority, having received reliable information from men who understand the position of affairs, that the increased cost of production caused by this iniquitious Tariff will probably result in the mines being closed down, and in disaster to the mining .industry. And what occurs at Broken Hill will, no doubt, occur in other places. One argument which has been put forward is that a large amount of machinery has already been imported, and now. only Mr Sydney Smith, new parts are coming in. It must be remembered, however, that new machineiy is being invented every day, and unless we are up-to-date in mining and agriculture, we cannot hold our own in the markets of the world. We hope that there will be developments in mining and agriculture, and if that be so, it will be necessary to obtain new plants. It is asserted that The all the machinery that is required can be produced in Victoria at a less cost than that imported. But importers and those who control mines are the best judges on that point. When machinery is locally that produced, purchasers have not to wait until orders are fulfilled from England, but can watch the progress of manufacture. W it h all these advantages it is evident that if they could obtain machinery locally at anything like the cost of the imported article, they would not incur the trouble, expense, and delay which must result from sending to foreign countries for it . I speak warmly upon this question because I feel that the interests of a great body of men depend upon the course which this Parliament adopts in regard to the matter under discussion. Other items in the Tariff of infinitely less importance have been debated for several days. We do not find women taking the place of men upon mining fields. Only the real breadwinners of the family are employed upon those fields, whereas in most of the industries referred to by honourable members opposite women are chiefly employed. If a heavy protective duty has been the means of helping the various with industries in Victoria, how is it that during the last decade this State has lost 10 per cent, of her population chiefly consisting of young and vigorous men ? It is impossible for honourable members opposite to justify the imposition of such heavy burdens upon the miners and agriculturists of the Commonwealth. It seems to me that the great industries upon which the Commonwealth must depend for its success are receiving the least attention at the hands of the Government and of Parliament. I cordially support the amendment to place mining machinery upon the free list, and failing to carry that I shall endeavour to secure a substantial reduction in the rate of duty proposed.",63
367,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR," We have had a very long discussion concerning this particular line in the Tariff,, but I do not complain of that, because I think a large amount of useful information has been disseminated by honourable members who hare a practical knowledge of many of the facts relating to the articles .covered by the item. I am free to confess that, listening to the very interesting speeches which have been delivered, I have learned many things. I do not propose to follow the example of the honourable member for Macquarie by indulging in a disquisition upon the relative merits of protection and free-trade. ' I think that honourable members should confine their attention to the articles included in this line, and endeavour to do what is fair and just to the industries concerned. We must not be led away by a desire to help the mining industry only. We must recollect that there are other large industries which have been established, and which I am certain none of us desire either to ruin or injure. It appears to me that the honourable member for the Barrier has gone a long way further than he intended. This particular item embraces a large number of articles, and is estimated to yield a revenue amounting to nearly £300,000. If the proposal of the honourable member were carried all that revenue would be sacrificed, and we should run the risk of ruining some industries, besides seriously injuring others. I am perfectly certain that very few honourable members intend to vote in favour of exempting all these articles from duty. The task which, we have to perform is to determine what is a fair amount of protection to bestow upon articles which can be manufactured here, what is a reasonable revenue duty to impose upon those which cannot be manufactured here, and what articles should be placed upon the free list, on the ground that they are used in the mining industry, to which we desire to give substantial assistance. We are told that we have n<5 right to ask for a higher duty upon mining machinery than that which has been levied upon agricultural machinery. That argument has been used several times, but it seems to me that there is a very great difference between the manufacture of agricultural machinery and the manufacture of mining machinery. In the former case, the plant required is not so extensive as it must necessarily be in the latter, in addition to which a large number of articles of a particular class are unquestionably required in the case of agricultural machinery, whereas in the case of mining machinery it often happens that only a very few articles of a particular stamp arerequired. Under these circumstances there is some justification for imposing a higher duty upon mining machinery than the committee have approved in regard to agricultural machinery. We have been challenged because we have exempted from taxation a large number of machines which - are used in various industries. But we do that on the ground which has been rightly urged by many honourable members with regard to other articles, that where these particular machines used in trades are not now made and are not likely to be made in the Commonwealth for a number.of years, it is hardly fair to handicap the various industries by putting heavy duties upon the machinery which they use, unless we can see that there is a likelihood of that machinery being made here. Until I heard certain statements made here tonight I was under the impression that practically the whole of the machinery used in connection with our mining industries was made in one or other of the States. No doubt nearly all of the States are interested in the manufacture of machinery. We find that in most of the States it is being manufactured, and I join with the Treasurer of Western Australia in the hope he has expressed that before many years are past the people of Western Australia will be manufacturing a very large quantity of the machinery used in that State. It is perfectly certain that the greater part of the mining machineiy being used in Australia is being manufactured within the Commonwealth. We have had specified today for the first time certain parts of various machines which are patented and which are not made here, but while that would be a very good ground for admitting those particular portions of machines free, I hardly think that my honourable friend who brought the matter before us so prominently, and gave us such full information, will go the length of saying that we should also admit free other portions of machinery which can be made here at a fair cost and of good workmanship. It has been said that some of the machinery manufactured in these States is not as good as it ought to be, but I think it will be generally admitted with regard to machinery, and especially with regard to mining macliinery, that in the various States of the Commonwealth as good machinery is made as any that can be imported. We may not be able to get the latest patents, but the bulk of the machinery made in the different States is well spoken of by those who have to use it , and is looked upon as working well, and as being beneficial to the mining and manufacturing industries.",65
368,Mr THOMSON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,And is being sold against the competition of the world in some-of the other States.,67
369,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"We have exported some, and I suppose my honourable friend opposite bases the old argument upon that, that therefore we do not require any duty, and we should allow ourselves to be open to the competition of the "" sweepings "" of different parts of the world. I think the fallacy of that argument has been shown over and over again, and I am not to ' be led aside to deal with it on this occasion. We must all be anxious to assist the mining industry so far as we possibly can, always bearing in mind, as I have mentioned before, that there are other industries which we must not seriously injure. That being so, we have to see to what extent we can meet the wishes of honourable members who have brought forward certain facts for our consideration. But we must not assume, as some honourable members apparently do, that the whole of the machinery used in the mines of Western Australia - will be imported from over seas. I think the greater portion of it will be made in one or other of the States as soon as the sliding scale now in existence is abolished, and that the only articles which will be imported are those which we cannot make within the Commonwealth That is a fact which we must bear in mind. I cannot agree with honourable members who have spoken so strongly about the duties here proposed ruining the industry and shutting up our mines. We have been told that the Barrier mines are going to be so seriously injured by the imposition of a duty upon machinery that they probably will not be able to carry on, and thousands men will consequently be thrown out of work. I think that is an altogether overdrawn picture: Unfortunately at the present time many of our mines are not in as good a position as we should like, and some of us feel it hard that we should have to contribute towards the cost »f carrying on those mines. But it is not every day that mines buy a large amount of macliinery. Machinery once bought will last a mine for four or five years, and if we were to divide even the amount here spoken of in duty over a period of years, it would not appear a very large item. If even the full duty proposed of 25 per cent, were imposed, what would it come to in a place like Western Australia 1 The imports, we are told, are about equal in an ordinary year, and if the whole amount collected in duties was spread over the great output of that State, it would come to a very small amount per ton. But we are free to admit that we have now heard facts with regard to a comparatively small portion of the machinery used which would induce us to fall in with the wishes of honourable members with regard to some of the items. The statement was made last night that the price of machinery in Western Australia was raised immediately the Tariff was announced. That statement has been made on two or three occasions, but we have never been able to obtain any satisfactory evidence of it. We have never been able to obtain any details, or the mention of any special case in which it has actually occurred, while persons who are manufacturing machinery in the different States tell us that there is no foundation at all for the statement made.",67
370,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"No , but we have to pay the extra duty, five times as much as we had to pay before.",67
371,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"My honourable friend must realise that one of the great reasons why the Australian States federated was because we hoped to become customers of each other. We never believed that when we were federated each State was going to get as much as it possibly could from outside the Commonwealth. We did hope that the various States would become customers of each other for different commodities, and in that way would render each other great assistance. I venture to say that a large quantity of the class of machinery, which during the last few years of has been imported, into Western Australia from abroad, will in future be obtained within the Commonwealth. In that way those using the machinery will not have to pay the duty which our friends profess so much to fear..",67
372,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Our duty was only 5 per cent ,67
373,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Wester n Australia will in future, I hope, have a. better duty, and will not be called upon to import, but will make a large quantity of this machinery within the State itself. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - And if they do not, it will be made for them in Victoria.",67
374,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"We l l I hope we shall make some in Victoria, and that we shall get some from New South Wales. I hope we shall forget these little differences between the States, and that we shall not get our goods from different parts of the world, but as far as possible from within Australia. There is one example which I can quote in connection with this question of mining plant. I know of it because the gentleman interested is the present Premier of Victoria, who gave me the facts in connection with it at the time, some twelve or eighteen months ago. There is a very large mine, the Victoria Gold Estates, at Moolort. It is an English company with English directors, and naturallyand T do not blame them for it-the y preferred to obtain British machinery. They imported the plant for the first shaft from abroad, but they found that several alterations had to be made, and several 'things had to be done to it , and, when they came to get a second plant of a similar description, I am glad to say they got it in Victoria. That plant has been working for a considerable time, has given every satisfaction, and it did not cost the company as much as the plant which they imported previously. There are other mines with regard to which I have been supplied with information. There is the Grand Duke Company, for example, which, in the first instance, imported certain machinery, but upon requiring further plant of the same description, obtained it in Victoria. The company is perfectly satisfied with the work done by that machinery, and with the price which it paid for it . I have no doubt whatever that plant can be turned out within the Commonwealth as good as any that can be imported from abroad.",68
375,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,Where does the Grand Duke Mine carry on operations 1,68
376,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"In Victoria. It is to have four shafts. It has one down already, and is sinking another.",68
377,Mr KIBWAN,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,But that is free milling ore.,68
378,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I admit that there are exceptional cases in which dutiable machinery would be required in Western Australia that probably would not be requisite in this State. We are prepared to give every consideration to the statements made by honourable members in this regard, and to meet these difficulties as far as possible. The great difficulty is that this item deals with a large number of articles. Undoubtedly some of them should be dutiable at the rate we mention. What we desire to do is to deal with the N . E . I . item, which would include all things that we do not specifically mention, and which we think should remain subject to a duty of 25 per cent. That is a protective duty to a considerable extent, and to a considerable extent it is also a revenue duty. My honourable friends of the Opposition must realise that we cannot afford to throw away all the revenue that we expect to derive from this item. We must secure-a reasonable amount.",68
379,Mr THOMSON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,If the duty were reduced a larger revenue would be obtained.,68
380,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"That is what some of my honourable friends say. It is plain that we 'would not get as much as we expect to receive under the Tariff if we wiped the duty out altogether, and that is what certain honourable members of the Opposition desire to do. In regard to the machinery in this particular item, ""Engines, boilers, pumps, machines, and machinery,"" we think that we might fairly meet the wishes of the committee by placing a duty of 20 per cent, on all that is manufactured here.",68
381,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"It takes some screwing to get a "" fiver "" out of the Government.",68
382,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"The honourable member ought to be glad to get anything. I think that with a duty of 20 or 25 per cent, the greater portion of the machinery required for mining purposes will undoubtedly be made within the Commonwealth. All that will be imported will be those portions that cannot be manufactured here. We are at one with the committee that such machines or portions of machinery sliould be made absolutely free. The difficulty is to know how to do that in a fair and equitable manner, while at the same time preventiug the possibility of frauds being committed. We have been considering several methods which have suggested themselves to us, and we think the safest course to adopt will be to specify, as far as we possibly can at the present time, all the articles which are not made here, and, therefore, ought to be on the free list.",68
383,Mr THOMSON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Does that proposal relate to mining machinery alone, or to machinery generally ?",69
384,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"To mining machinery, in regard to which we desire to give the greatest assistance. We are prepared to give up any revenue in order to help the industry, and if any other machinery is brought under our notice which should be treated in the same way, we may be prepared to give up whatever revenue we expect to receive from that source.",69
385,Mr HABPEB,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,There are many other important branches of business employing patented machinery.,69
386,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Without having further information as to how it would affect the revenue, I am not prepared to say that we will give up the whole of the revenue to be derived by means of a duty on patented machinery. I am dealing now with the matters relating to mining macliinery, which have been prominently brought before us during the debate. Seeing the difficulties which the mining industry has to contend with, we are prepared to go with the committee to the full extent of making the articles relating to it absolutely free, provided that they cannot be made within the Commonwealth. What we propose to do is to specify as far as we can in the exemption list all those articles which should be exempted from duty, a number of which have been mentioned. No doubt honourable members who have a knowledge of what is required will give us further formation. We shall be glad to investigate such information, and see whether the articles mentioned should be placed on the free list.",69
387,Mr VL SOLOMON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,That is almost impossible. The Government change their opinions every week.,69
388,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Will my honourable friends of the Opposition have a little patience? I have not said that my proposal necessarily includes all machinery. I am just as well aware as they are that it would be impossible to specify everything. When interrupted, I was about to say that we propose to have a clause which will give to the Minister power to exempt any other items of a similar kind 'which are not included in the list, - taking care that all exemptions are placed before Parliament at the earliest possible date, Parliament may know what has been done, and express an opinion with regard to the correctness or otherwise of the action of the Minister, if it desires to do so. We think that we have met the committee as far as we possibly can with regard to these items in proposing the course I have indicated. It is utterly unreasonable to expect us to exempt all mining machinery. As I have pointed out already, nearly the whole of that machinery can be made in the Commonwealth, and if that be the case, we ought to assist our iron trade in its manufacture, which gives employment to a very large number of men. We have heard of the large number of men employed in our mines. We know that they do good work, and that we derive great benefit from them. We must remember also that a large number of men, with a great many persons dependent upon them, are employed in manufacturing machinery and other requisites for mining, and we cannot be expected to consent to make absolutely free those articles which can be produced here. We are prepared to reduce the duty on those articles that are imported, and to go the length of making patented portions and all patented machines which cannot be made here absolutely free. Having agreed to do that, I think we have met the committee in a fair spirit. We have gained information which we did hot possess at the outset, and it is our wish to do what is fair and right, and not to crush the mining or any other industry. I trust in- that the committee will allow us to proceed with the item N . E . I ., which will cover all that we do not specify. Then we wil l call on the committee to deal with engines, boilers, and pumps. We can deal with those separately or together. It will then be competent for honourable members to suggest any other articles that they think ought to be subjected to the lower duty. I would appeal to the committee not to think of making these articles absolutely free, or of placing on them 10 or 15 per cent, duties-whic h .right through our campaign have been regarded as mere revenue duties-bu t to support the proposals to which the Government are prepared to agree, and make mining and other machinery which can be manufactured here dutiable at 20 per cent.",69

390,The CHAIRMAN,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,The question before the Chair is the proposal of the honourable member for Barrier to add certain words to the duty.,70
391,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I suggest that we should follow the practice which we have adopted hitherto. It was suggested to us, and we accepted it in order that the committee might have the fullest opportunity to vote upon every line of the Tariff if necessary. A number of articles are set down at 26 per cent., and it will be competent for the committee to reduce the duty in cases where they think a reduction desirable. Honourable members will also be able to have articles which are not now specified inserted, and the rate of 25 per cent, for articles "" not elsewhere included "" will apply only to articles which are not dealt with specifically.",70
392,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"Robertson) The Treasurer has admitted that this has been a most valuable one, but the arguments advanced seem to have been ing thrown away upon him. The honourable and learned member for Indi pointed out that very large quantity of the machinery in use in Western Australia was manufactured in Australia- a proof that the local manufacment turers are able to successfully compete foreign manufacturers in the supply machinery which is not patented. As a duty matter of fact, the natural protection given to the local manufacturer is equal to thing like 15 per cent., and that should quite enough. The honourable and learned member for Indi is willing that patented machineiy, which cannot be made here, should be admitted free, but apparently the companies cannot Treasurer will not agree to that.",70

399,Sir GEORGE TURNER,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,I cannot do that.,70
400,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"The honourable member for Perth has referred to the vast deposits of ore in Western Australia. The existence of this ore was pointed to many years ago by that great geologist, the Rev. J. E. Tenison Wood,, who has also stated that there are similar deposits in the Northern Territory and elsewhere. Mr . Wood was a geologist of European reputation, and he has pointed out that there is untold mineral wealth in Australia. I suppose that honourable members would like to see our mineral resources developed, and that wealth won from the soil; but how can that come about unless we foster the mining industry? Honourable members who claim to be protectionists, and who are always speaking of debate fostering native industries, have an opportunity here. We can foster the minindustry by making it possible for those engaged in it to obtain their machinery and a other requirements at as low a price as possible. But in spite of the heavy decline in the selling price of metals, the Governpropose to place a duty of 25 per cent, against upon mining machinery. The honourable of member for Barrier has told us that this is equal to increasing the cost of the output of the Barrier district by from 7s. 6d. someto 10s. a ton. In Western Australia, be where the output of gold has been even a little larger than that of New South Wales, there are mines which have been shut down altogether, because the afford to pay for machineiy the high prices created by this duty. The Mining Standard of 16th made January makes a statement of the utmost the importance as to the decline in the value of metals. In 1900 t in was selling at Are we to £153 per to n ; today its value is £ 1 0 4 per be ton. Copper has come down from £ 7 9 per ton to £ 4 5 10s ; lead from £ 1 8 per ton to £ 1 0 8s 9d ; spelter from £ 2 2 per ton to £ 1 6 8s. 9d.; and silver from 30 3-16d. the free list. to 25 ll-16d. per oz. the patenEver since the framing of the Tariff, assuming to have taken place nine months ago, there has been a decline of £20 per ton in tin, of £27 in copper, of £2 in lead, of £2 in spelter, and of 2d. per ounce in silver. Stated in percentage, the fall is in copper, 34 cent; in lead, 17i per cent; in tin, 14 3per cent; in silver, 7*3 per cent; and in spelter, 3 per cent. In three out of the four gold-producing continental States the output shows an aggregate falling-off of 239,982 oz.', namely, in Queensland 14,721 oz. ; in New South Wales, 74,926 oz. ; and in Victoria 17,845 oz. The article winds up with these most significant words, to which I have been requested by an honourable member who has spoken to direct the attention of the committeeThe most important Australian manufactories of mining machinery are not those established under the upas shadow of the rigid 25 per cent. Victorian duties, but are represented by the great firms of Walker's Limited, Maryborough, Queensland, and James Martin and Company Limited, Gawler, South Australia, in both of which States the duties are more elastic. In Queensland air compressors, ball mills for ing quartz, rock drills, roller mills for crushing quartz, steel rings for quartz mills, screens, gratings, and vanners are on the exempt list; while machines and machinery, and parts thereof required for mining purposes, which are not specified, and are of new invention, may be exempted from time to time by the Governor in Council. In South Australia, also, there is a long exempt list, and a still larger introduction, at less than the Victorian rate. With a 10 per cent, duty, and the natural duty represented by freights, charges, &c, equal to at least the other 15 percent., the Australian manufacturer would have all the advantage he can reasonably desire ; while to increase this by yet an additional 15 per cent., with the assurance that all but the margin to keep the market will go on to the price of the article, and so burden the mining industry, is a proposal which should be resisted to the uttermost as impolitic, inopportune, and absolutely ruinous. Those honourable members who have listened to me may, at their leisure, look through these extracts, but I suppose that they have made up their minds to support the proposal of the Government. , Mr KENNEDY - We read it some time ago.",70
401,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"The honourable member proposes to support the proposal of the Government He is not using his own judgment in the matter, because, if he did, I take it that he would desire to develop the mining industry. If he has that desire, then he should make the machinery essential for its development as cheap as possible. That seems to be the common sense of it . The Minister for Trade and Customs, who wishes to see the Northern Territory developed, should exert his influence with his colleague and see that the duty on mining machinery is placed at most on a 5 per cent, basis as a compromise.",71
402,Mr KINGSTON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I think I have done as much mining as any honourable member on that side, and the duties never bothered me.",71
403,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"In South Australia a very great deal of mining machinery is manufactured. It can be found all over Australia. The South Australian manufacturers"" can compete successfully in the making of stampers, engines, and boilers. They require no protection. The cost of bringing out thearticles from the old world15 per cent - is sufficient protection to them. I cannot understand any man of common sense who desires to see the mining ind ustry developed supporting a Government who would propose to levy a duty up to 25 per cent, crush- on the articles that are required for its development, with the assurance at the back that many mines are shut down because they cannot afford to pay the money for the machinery. The Minister smiles, but the duty would increase the cost of the machinery by 25 per cent. Only by today's mail from Queensland I received a letter in which it is stated that on an island off thecoast they have a deposit of wolfram equal to anything in the world, which they are unable to develop because of the increased cost of the machinery that would be required. The amount of money at their disposal is not sufficient to enable them to procure the machineiy. The policy of the Government is a means of retarding the development of various mineral deposits in all parts of Australia. On behalf of the mining industry of Australia. I make an urgent appeal that the cost of production shall not be increased by increasing the cost of machinery that is absolutely necessary for its development. I bring honourable members once more to the argument in that lengthy speech of the honourable and learned member for Indi, who quoted from Hansard a statement made by a Minister of the Crown in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia, that under a 5 per cent, duty most of the machinery used in the development of its mining industry was brought from the adjoining States, and not from Great Britain or any other part of the world. The Minister for Defence has confirmed the statement that most of the machinery which is used in Western Australia is made in Australia. I urge the committee to support the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier and thus do something for the mining industry of Australia.",71
404,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR," I - wish to say a few words before we go to a - division, because I think that the imposition - of this duty is of the greatest importance to the whole of the Commonwealth. The honourable and learned member for Indi said that those who were senthereto representWestern Australia were sent as free-traders. 1 - deny positively that we were sent to support the bare free-trade principle. We were sent with the idea of keeping the Tariff as low as we possibly could, and it was merely mentioned by the Free-trade Association of Australia that we were sent here in their name. We were sent with - the understanding that we should have what - was called a revenue Tariff. It was understood there that it would be an impossibility under the circumstances to get free-trade, .as it has been known in New South Wales. I make this explanation because the honourable and learned member seemed to lay .great stress upon his statement with regard to the free-traders. We are not bound to free-trade in respect of all items. There .are certain items in respect of which - we have had the benefit of free-trade - for some years in Western Australia. The consequence is that with an increase of population the revenue has increased. However, that is beside the question at issue. I feel sure that after what has been said, - and the information which has'been afforded - as to the resources of Western Australia in : regard to mining, the eyes of many will be opened as to the condition of affairs in - that State. I am sure that everything will .be done that is possible to foster an industry which, from the production of some hundred - ounces of gold a few years ago, has been so developed as to produce millions - of ounces, the output representing last year £7,000,000. In addition to gold-mining, we have tin-mining, coal-mining, and lead- mining in Western Australia, and a good many of these mines are, so to speak, worked from hand to mouth. The machinery they - use is somewhat old, and will have to be re- newed in a very short time, and it will be a .great hardship if five times the present duty .has to be paid. I have heard of one case 'where, a few months ago, £1,000 in duty was paid, and only recently five times that .amount had to be paid in connection with an--, exactlysimilar, importation. Many enterprises - have beenundertaken in Western Australia which will be .stopped if--the Government proposals are 25 s carried. Contracts for the construction of tramways have been entered into on the understanding that .the 5 per cent, duty would continue, and now there has been a stoppage of the work. Similar circumstances will arise in connection with the Coolgardie water scheme, contracts for the construction of eight sections of which have been en-' tered into, so as to carry water 360 miles to the gold-fields. These contracts were entered into on the basis of a 5 per cent, duty on machinery, and it can well be imagined how the work may be effected by an imposition of a duty five times as great on the huge appliances which are required. If the proposed duty be imposed disputes will, no doubt, arise between the contractors and the Government. These are not the only instances of the kind, and in a young country like Western Australia a heavy duty on articles of machinery will seriously affect the whole of the community. The shipping interest also will be affected. A few years ago the shipping which traded to Western Australia was represented by a few hundred tons, whereas now it is represented by millions of tons; and taking all these facts into consideration, I ask the committee to seriously consider the position. The fact that Western Australia is isolated from the' rest of the States is a reason why she should have every consideration, and be dealt with liberally.",72
405,Mr THOMA S,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR," I understand that if the amendment, as I have submitted it, goes to a division and is lost, the Government will not have an opportunity of dealing with the separate items, but will have to deal with them in gldbo. I am prepared, therefore, in order to treat the Government fairly and courteously, to withdraw my amendment, and submit another to the effect that, after "" N . E . I . , "" the word "" f r e e "" be inserted. This will give the Government an opportunity of subsequently dealing with the separate items.",72
406,Mr KINGSTON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I was going to make a similar suggestion, and I have every reason to acknowledge the courtesy of the honourable member for Barrier. We have been discussing to a great extent mining machines, engines, and pumps, and I think that if we postpone the consideration of the words - "" N . E .

It would be anomalous, even from a protectionist poin t of view, to allow ships, machinery and all, to be b u i l t abroad and to enter the Commonwealth free of duty, w h i 1st charging a d u t y on ships' engines required to be embodied in ships constructed here by these who desire to give employment to our ' o w n workmen. That is a matter which b o t h sides of the Chamber will no doubt be prepared to consider, and I shall bring it up at a later stage.",73

414,Mr GB EDWARDS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR," I move- 1 That the words "" steam, gas, and oil, 25 per cent., and on and after the 17th January, 1902, 15 per cent."" be inserted after the word ""engines."" I refrained from speaking upon the amendment submitted by the honourable member ,for Barrier simply because the views which I held had been so ably expressed by other honourable members, and I wished to avoid Unnecessary waste of time. But I think that the period has now arrived when we should settle what is to be the rate of duty imposed upon the various .motive powers in use. To my mind, that duty should be a uniform one. The difference between an oil engine and a gas engine is confined to the valve, and if we make a .difference in the duty imposed upon the "" 25 s 2 AYJS. two classes of engines the revenue will be defrauded, because an engine which is intended for a certain purpose can, with a very slight expenditure, be altered so as to serve another purpose. I would further point out that the prosperity of many of those industries, which it has been our aim to foster, is determined, to a very large extent, by the price at which these engines can be obtained - I might instance the boot industry and the biscuit industry, besides a NOBS. variety of others which we have already protected.",74
415,The CHAIRMAN,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"I find, upon reference to the amended Tariff, that oil engines were made free on and after the 13th of December.",74
416,Mr KINGSTON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"May I suggest that we are now dealing with engines generally, and that the matter to which the honourable member refers can be dealt with under exemptions.",74
417,Mr GB EDWARDS,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR,"That is all veiy well, but the Minister for Trade and Customs must know that with a very PAIRS. trifling expenditure oil engines can be converted into gas engines. Therefore if he exempts oil engines from duty he should also place gas engines upon the free list, otherwise the revenue will be defrauded. However, I shall be content to move in the direction of placing gas engines upon the free list at a< later stage. I think that course should be adopterl, seeing that oil engines have already been included in the list of exemptions, and that they are practically identical with gas engines.

426,Mr BARTON,MACHINERY OR GOODS FOR," In moving;That the House do now adjourn, should lik e to report to honourable members that in answer to a cablegram which I requested the Governor General' to send to Mr Chamberlain, reporting the resolutions at w h i ch we had arrived o n Tuesday, and bur gratificatio n that we were able to report those resolutions, His Excellency has received and transmitted to hie the following cablegram addressed by Mr Chamberlain to him :- 4 Your telegram of today - The people and Government of the mother country gratefully appreciate the patriotic and sympathetic terms of the resolutions passed by the House of Representatives, and they welcome this public repudiation by the Commonwealth of Australia of the calumnious charges which have been brought against British soldiers, andThere is a word missing, which, I think, "" humane ""conduct of the war. The resolutions, coupled with the splendid way in which wealth has shared the sacrifices and efforts of the mother land during the contest forced upon her in South Africa, are heartily valued throughout His Majesty's dominions, and afford fresh evidence of the unity of the Empire and the spirit and determination of ibs sons. I do .not wish to add fuel to a fire, but there has been placed in my hands a Berlin publication entitled the Bloody Hook o j the Transvaal, with 24 illustrations, by some artist named Jean Veber. Erom end to end it is a series of absolute atrocities, so defaming our nation, our soldiers, and our dead Queen, that the most inflamed proBoer must denounce it . I do not wish to say anything about this, that is not absolutely necessary and in reason, but I wish to refer to two of the cartoons-no t the worse, but perhaps the most illustrative. One depicts the "" Glorious Britannia,"" as she is called, in the flames of hell, amidst the torments and jeers of the damned, with Mrs Kruger amongst the angels deploring Britannia's fate; while the other depicts the General in command of the British forces in South Africa in a most devilishly suspicious attitude. I wish to say no more except this : we were told that some of these things wanted verification. I hold the verification in my hands, and I am sorry that that verification exists. I turn to the more pleasurable aspect of the matter, which is that there is evidence in the cablegram which I have read, not of any insane or unkind desire to triumph ungenerously, but evidence of welcome in the feeling that we all belong to one nation and to one Empire, meaning that we are one great aggregated nation, and that our works in our nation, while we hold together, arc not only for the common honour, but for the common-safety.  the Prime Minister whether certain rumours which I have heard this evening in regard to the appointment of a High Commissioner for the Commonwealth are correct.
