1,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I desire to ask South Australia 1 the Prime Minister if he has seen the reports published from time to time as to ghastly butcheries perpetrated in theÂ« Balkans. If so, will he consider the visability of cabling to the Imperial authoricertain ties a protest, on behalf of Australia, against their continuance and urging those authorities to strain every nerve, conjointly with the other European powers, to speedily bring them to an end ?",12
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"E very reader of the - daily press must have noticed the reports received referring to what I think the honourable member has properly termed the ghastly tragedies in the south-east of Europe. There exists in that corner of the Continent a condition of affairs which one would rather expect to find in the centre of . darkest Africa, or in some other hopelessly uncivilized country. I am perfectly sure that the unanimous sympathy of Australia is with the honourable member in his that these tragedies should speedily brought to a conclusion.",12
3,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The Right Honourable ' A. J. Balfour says that there are faults - on both sides.,12
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Probably there are. I never knew a case to which that remark would not apply in some degree. It is, ever, obvious that the main burden of the blame for the atrocities which have been committed rests upon those who are the same blood and faith as the people of mission ? the rest of Europe. I am sure that the feeling of Australia is unanimous matter, but hesitate to telegraph an expression of sympathy lest our action might be considered due to a suspicion on our part that the Governments of Great Britain of the other nations of Europe are not just as alive as we are to the deplorable conditions which obtain and to the necessity for altering them. I trust that the present unsatisfactory state of affairs will speedily be at 2.30 brought to a close.",12

No decision has, however, been arrived at up to the present.  move Colonel Lyster from South Australia, in what way can the Commonwealth derive gain from that officer touring South Australia with the object of obtaining the information necessary to enable him to more effectively administer defence matters in that State? - Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - That point will be considered when the matter comes up for decision.

14,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,RIFLE CLUBS IN WESTER N,"The honourable member was good enough to give me notice of his intention to ask this question, the answer to which is as follows :The rifle clubs in Western Australia have hitherto been enrolled under any regulations, therefore have no official standing. Steps are now being taken to gazette these clubs under Commonwealth Rifle Club Regulations. An rangement was made by Sir John Forrest, prior to these regulations coming into force, these rifle clubs in Western Australia, voluntarily formed, but which are affiliated with the National Rifle Association, were able to acquire certain issue of ammunition ; and in order to avoid couragement, pending the gazetting of these clubs under the new regulations, and therefore bringing them into line with all other rifle in the Commonwealth, the Commandant of Western Australia has been authorized to tinue the issue of ammunition within reasonable limits to those clubs which have applied in regular manner to come under che new regulaI tions.

I am quite aware that at times overtime work is necessary. But I am quite sure that a great strain has been put upon both the male and the female employees, and I believe that in some instances the health of the female typists has broken down. While we desire to be as economical as possible, we do not want to kill our employees. I trust that the right honourable gentleman will inquire into the matter.",14
25,Sir JOHN FORREST,RIFLE CLUBS IN WESTER N,"I shall be very glad to make inquiries, but I have not heard anything about the subject alluded to. It is astonishing what information the honourable member is able to obtain concerning matters in my Department of which I know nothing. I have seen some of the young ladies, and it did not seem to me that their health was being injured ; but probably the honourable member is a better judge of that than I am.

32,Sir JOHN QUICK,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"the Minister for Defence, vpon notice I. Whether his attention has been directed to the following paragraph in a Bendigo paper, dated 29th September :"" Mr A. R. Thurlow, who resides off Forest street, and who was formerly a sergeant in the Submarine Mining Company of Engineers, has constructed a model of a military invention (an armoured horsecar) which he is bringing under the notice of the War Office.

Will he bring the matter under the notice of the State Commandant, so that the armoured car ma}' be inspected and reported on by some competent staff officer at an early opportunity ?",15
33,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"In reply to the honourable and learned member, I beg to state :1. This invention has not been brought under the notice of the Department. 2.

Sir EDWARD BRADDON - Will the Prime Minister make arrangements for the vote of the House on the Bill relating to the selection of the Capital site not to be taken until Wednesday next?",15
34,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL," The request which the right honourable member makes is, that under the circumstances the vote on the Bill relating to the selection of the Federal Capital Site shall not be taken before Wednesday next. I do not think there need be the least difficulty about that under. taking. But I wish the House to be prepared to commence the discussion on Tuesday; it will certainly be Wednesday beforewe can come to a decision. To prevent any loss of time it will be necessary to commence dealing with the' question on Tuesday, though there is no prospect, I am afraid, of concluding the debate on that day.",15
35,Mr THOMSON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL," The Prime Minister is now asking us to pass the third reading of the Appropriation Bill. I think that before we do so we should have an assurance from him that the Capital site matter will be carried to a definiteconclusion before Parliament rises. What I mean by a definite conclusion is that either the site shall be selected, or that the mattershall reach the deadlock stage, at which it will be absolutely impossible to select a sitetbis session. I gather that it is the honourable and learned gentleman's intention to try to attain a definite conclusion, but I wish to hear a statement made by him before the Appropriation Bill receives our assent.",15
36,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,We certainly will endeavour to reduce the Capital sites to two-on e chosen by this House and one by the Senate.; and if it be possible we will bringabout an agreement between both Houses.,15
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL, I should like to know what violent hurry there is for the passage of this Bill ?,15
38,Sir GEORGE TURNER,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,The Senate must have a fair opportunitv to deal with it.,15
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"Undoubtedl y the Senate will have an opportunity. I have no doubt that that House will deal with itas quickly, perhaps, as we did. We put the Bill through in almost as many minutes asthere are stages. I have never seen an THIRD READING. Appropriation Bill which received less conTURNER) prosideration than this one has had.",15
40,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"The Estimates took a longtime to consider, and this Bill will be considered from the stand-point of Estimatesin another place.",15
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,I wish to knowwhether there is any special need for urgency at the present time.,15
42,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"Yes , because while this House is dealing with the question of the Capital site we wish to give the Senate an opportunity to deal with the Estimates which are embodied in this Bill. It must be remembered that from the point of view of the Senate the discussion on this Bill is equivalent to our discussion on the Estimates. The Appropriation Bill is the only measure that gives the Senate an opportunity to consider the Estimates for the year.",15
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"This is the one measure which we ought not to surrender too hurriedly to the Senate. We ought not to give them the Appropriation Bill whenever they think fit. There are obvious reasons why an Appropriation Bill is held back in all Parliaments. How do we know what is going to result in connection with the selection of the Capital sites? No on& can see the end of that troublesome busi- ' ness, and none of us knows precisely what is going to eventuate between the two Houses.",15
44,Mr FISHER,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,If we pass this Bill we shall soon know the end.,16
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"We have been I promised that we should see the end of this business ever since we commenced to coni able member for Wide Ba}'. sider it. But we seem to be progressing backwards. I believe that on the first conpriation sideration in the Senate there was only difference of one vote between the two parties. But we have progressed so much in regard to the solution of this difficult matter that, last night, there was a sent difference of seven votes on a division. That does not augur a speedy and definite settleGenerally ment of this matter. I wish that I could be as optimistic in regard 'to its discision some honourable members appear to be. 1 do not think that this Bill ought to pass third reading until the Capital site has selected, or at any rate until some promise of finality has been reached. Under the circumstances I would ask the Ministry to defer the third reading of the measure at least a week. Certainly it ought not be sanctioned until the important business which is before the two branches of the Legislature is in a fair way of being detersite. mined. That is one of the fundamental present principles of parliamentary government. I would urge upon the Ministry to agree the course which I have suggested, and to postpone the third reading of the Bill for a week.",16
46,Mr FISHER,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL," I do not blame the Government for attempting get this measure passed as early as possible. To get the Appropriation Bill out of the way is a wise proceeding on the part of any Ministry, because it places them in the position of being able to settle with Parliament whenever they may think fit. Of course there is something to be said in favour of the early passage of the measure through this House, because of the position of the Senate under the Constitution. The other Chamber naturally desires time to consider it. Nevertheless, as was stated by the late Prime Minister, the determination of the Capital , site is one of the most important questions with which this Parliament has been called upon to deal. It is quite unusual for a subject of such magnitude to be decided after Supply has been granted to the Government for the full period 11 KZ of the year. At the same time, if the Opposition do not think it worthwhile to enter a 1 - protest against the adoption of the course which is proposed, no charge of haste can be laid against the door of the Government. ! Mr G. B. EDWARD S (South Sydney) quite endorse the remarks of the honor| able member for Parramatta and the honorAccording to i my parliamentary experience, the ApproBill is the very last measure which a should be passed by Parliament. Seeing that the selection of the Capital site constitutes the most important business with which we have had to deal during the presession, that question ought certainly to be decided before this Bill is disposed of. speaking, the Appropriation Bill is finally dealt with only a few hours before as the prorogation of Parliament. I admit that our Constitution is somewhat different its from the Constitution of the States, and been that some deference must be paid to that difference. That fact in itself, however, is not sufficient to justify the passage of an Appropriation Bill at the present juncture. for Throughout the session I have constantly to blamed the Ministry for neglect in failing to submit for our early consideration the question of the selection of the Capital But despite the gravity of the position I think that the reputation of the Prime Minister is such that the House to will be prepared to accept his assurance that the list of eligible sites will be reduced to two, and, if possible, to one, before the session closes. It is only upon that understanding that I am prepared to allow the to third reading of this measure to pass.",16
47,Mr BROWN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL," It was only to be expected that the Government would endeavour to push this very important measure to its finil conclusion as soon.as possible. To my mind, however, there is no immediate hurry to pass its third reading. Several other measures are awaiting our attention. Despite the fact that the question of the selection of the Federal Capital site has been given considerable prominence from the very inception of this Parliament, its consideration has been deferred - till the closing days of the present session, and very little time is now available in which to deal with that matter. Moreover, present appearances point to the probability of future complications with the other Chamber which must inevitably result in further delay. I repeat that there are other important measures which have still to engage our attention-notabl y the Patents Bill and the Defence Bill. If we agree to the passing of this measure, it means that we shall lose control over the Government. The latter will then be able to close the session at any time they choose without consulting the House. But so long as the Appropriation Bill is held in abeyance, honourable members are in a position to exercise a controlling influence upon our procedure. I do not think that it is unreasonable to ask that the third reading of this Bill should be deferred a little longer. The adoption of such a course will not inflict any hardship upon the public servants, and, therefore, there is no need whatever to unduly hurry the passing of the measure, unless the Government desire to bring the session to a close at an earlier stage than Parliament would be disposed to approve of in view of the incomplete state of the business upon hand. I would strongly urge the Ministry to consider the request which has been preferred by some members of the Opposition.",16
48,Mr WILKS,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL," The honourable member for Wide Bay has certainly given the members of the Opposition a very timely reminder of their duty. He has declared that, whilst it is to the interests of the Government to secure the early passage of this Bill, if members of the Opposition alive to their responsibility they will on its further consideration being deferred. I thoroughly agree with his remarks. I view of the fact that the Federal Capital site has not yet been selected, I hold that it would be unwise to sanction the third reading of this measure. As has already been pointed out, several important measures have yet to be passed. How would honourable members feel tomorrow morning if, when they arrived at the House, they found the parliaagainst mentary shutters up 1 Immediately the propriation Bill is passed, the Government will be in a position to flout the will of liament, and to close its doors. I feel strongly tempted to submit an amendment which will have the effect of compelling the Treasurer to furnish us with some, informaI tion in regard to this matter. Treasurer now replies the debate will closed.",17
49,Mr SPEAKER,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,No .,17
50,Mr WILKS,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"That being the case, it is unnecessary for me, at this stage, to move an amendment in order that honourable members may have full opportunity to discuss this question. I trust that the Treasurer will make a statement to the House, as requested by the honourable member for Parramatta. At a most critical stage in her history, New South Wales today finds herself without her full measure of representation in either House, and if the leader of the Opposition were present I should hope to hear him strongly oppose the third reading of this Bill, pending the settlement of the Capital site question. We have received an assurance from the Prime Minister that the matter will be dealt with, but we know that the Victorian press arid various public meetings held in this State have bitterly opposed the selection of a site, and therefore there is a danger of the question being shelved for this session. B3' preventing the third reading.of this Bill today we shall be able to avert the anticipated danger, and it is my duty to join with other honourable members in exercising that power. I ask the Treasurer to say that he will not press the passing of this Bill through its remaining stages before New South Wales has secured her full measure of representation in the Federal Parliament.",17
51,Mr MCDONALD,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL," If the House agrees to the third reading of the Bill it will create a very dangerous precedent. It is the duty of every honourable are member to protest against the adoption of insist such a course. The moment we agree to the third reading of the Bill our power over n the Ministry will disappear. We know that important legislation materially affecting all the States still remains to be dealt with by us, and if we allowed this Bill to pass we should have no means to combat an attempt made by the Government on some flimsy pretext to shelve that legislation. I think that every honourable member should protest the granting of such a power to the ApMinistry. I have never heard of the adoption of this practice in the House of ComParmons, or in any Legislature in Australia. Of course, if the House is foolish enough to acquiesce in the Government proposal, the Treasurer cannot be blamed for making it . f it is necessary that another place should If the have ample time to deal with the Estimates, be an arrangement should have been made to enable it to consider them as soon as they left this Chamber, the Appropriation Bill meanwhile being kept back until the last moment. In that way we should have been able to overcome the difficulty suggested by the Treasurer. This is a very serious matter, and if a division is called for I shall certainly vote against the motion. I feel inclined to move that the debate be adjourned until next week : but in any event I think that the Government should give us some assurance that they will not seek to pass the Bill through its remaining stages for at least another week.",17
52,Sir GEORGE TURNER,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"I quite admit that the practice usually followed in the States Parliaments is to keep back the Appropriation Bill until all other measures have been dealt with. We must not forget, however, that we are working under a new Constitution, and that the position of the Senate is altogether different from that of the Legislative Councils of the States. The Senate has a right to request the reduction of any item in the Appropriation Bill, and it is therefore only fair that it should have a reasonable time to consider the Estimates, and to obtain the fullest explanation in regard to them. In these circumstances we cannot adopt the practice of the States Governments, and hold back this Bill until the last moment. That practice works very well in the States Legislatures, because the Legislative Councils of the States can simply reject or accept an Appropriation Bill, and, as a rule, they agree to such measures as a matter of course. This House, if it doubted the promise given by the Prime Minister, would be justified in refusing to pass the Bill at this stage. The only object which honourable members could have in view in adopting that course would be to retain control over the Government. But, as my honourable and learned leader has given a definite and distinct pledge to the House that the Federal Capital question will be advanced this session as nearly as possible to finality, even if it is impossible to finally settle it , I fail to see why any opposition should be shown to the Bill being read a third time today. An Appropriation Bill is held back, as a rule, simply to enable the House to have a check upon the Government, The honourable member for Dalley is afraid that if this Bill be passed today he may find tomorrow that Parliament has been prorogued, and that the question of the Federal Capital has been shelved. I am astonished that he should make such a suggestion.",18
53,Mr WILKS,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,My only fear is that the Government will not be able to control another place.,18
54,Sir GEORGE TURNER,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"The honourable member did not base his objection on that ground. He said he was afraid that if we passed this Bill today he would find tomorrow that the doors of Parliament had been closed, and that the Government had failed to invite the House to proceed with the consideration of the Capital site. If we held back this Bill until both Houses had dealt with that question, we should have to send it to another place at a time when it would be impossible for honourable senators to give it proper consideration. In view of the pledge given by the Prime Ministerwhich I am certain is accepted by the majority of honourable members- I see no reason why we should not now agree to the Bill being read a third time, and thus give another place a fair opportunity to dis cuss it.",18
55,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"Robertson) No doubt the Government will endeavour to keep the promise made today by the Prime Minister, but we cannot overlook the fact that they have no control over another place. I occupied a seat in the gallery of another place yesterday, and, whilst there, saw the will of the Government flouted by the majority of the members of that Chamber. Doubtless if they considered their purpose would be served by again taking up that attitude they would not hesitate ito do so. I do not think that the Government will fail to make an effort to carry out their promise to this House, but we have no guarantee that they wil] be able to do so. If we allow this Bill to pass we shall part with our control over the Government. I contend that it is the duty of representatives of New South Wales to see that this measure does not pass through its remaining stages until the question of the site of the Federal Capital has been dealt with. The Treasurer urges that another place must be given ample time to consider the Appropriation Bill. Let us remain here in order that it may have an opportunity to do so. Let honourable members of this House be the sufferers. I therefore feel inclined to move that the debate be now adjourned.",18
56,Mr SPEAKER,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"The honourable member, having spoken to the motion, cannot move the adjournment of the debate. . Mr HENRY WILLIS - Then I suggest that the adjournment should be moved by the Government. It is necessary for the representatives of New South Wales to see that the interests of that State are conserved. We shall be placed in a very unenviable position if we have to return to our constituents and to say that we allowed the Appropriation Bill to pass before the Capital Site question was dealt with. I ask the Government, in order that they maybe protected against action which may be taken in another place, to consent to the adjournment of the debate until the Capital question has been dealt with.",18
57,Mr HUGHES,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL," I desire to emphasize, if it be necessary, the remarks of the last speaker and of other honourable members as to the need for an adjournment of the debate. As has been well pointed out, no control can be exercised by the Government over the members of another place, nor indeed can they exercise an effective control over the members of this House after the Appropriation Bill has been passed. Whilst I have every confidence in the honesty of the Government, their intentions are one thing, and the intentions and acts of their supporters here and of the members of another House are quite another thing. Ihe representatives of theStateof New South Wales in this House are entirely at the merc\ of honourable gentlemen who, not r to put too fine a point upon it , are not exactly eager for the selection of the Federal Capital. They would not bother very much if it were not selected this session, could view with equanimity the possibility of its not being selected during the first session next Parliament, and doubtless would sleep well if they knew that it would never be selected at all. Therefore, as the Government cannot effectively control the members of this House, and have no control whatever over members of another place, I think that they should agree to the suggested adjournment of the debate, at any rate until an opportunity has been given to this House to decide the Capital question. I do not think that we are asking too much in making that request. The Government cannot state definitely that they will not prorogue until the matter has been dealt with, because they have no means of carrying that promise into effect.",19
58,Mr MCCAY,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL, I confess to being unable to follow the line of reasoning adopted by honourable members who ask for the adjournment of the debate upon the ground that we shall have no control over the members of another place if we pass Appropriation Bill through all its stages this House. Their suggestion amounts this : That we should not send the Appropriation Bill to the Senate until the members of that body have concurred with us in the selection of a site for the Federal capital.,19
59,Mr WILKS,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,Until we have tried to obtain their concurrence.,19
60,Mr MCCAY,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"Suppos e we keep back the Appropriation Bill,, and ask the concurrence of the Senate in the selection of a certain site, but that they decline to concur with us, what advantage shall we have gained; unless it is argued that we should say to them- "" We shall not send you the Appropriation Bill until you will concur with us"" 1 I do not think honourable members could seriously entertain the suggestion. But the only inference to be drawn from their arguments is that that position should be assumed.",19
61,Mr MCDONALD,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,What control shall we have over the Government if we pass the Appropriation Bill ?,19
62,Mr MCCAY,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"Parliamen t will have no control over the Government after the Appropriation Bill has .become law. W it h regard to the suggestion of the honourable member that we should keep back the Appropriation Bill, and endeavour to make some arrangement which will enable the members of the Senate to discuss the Estimates of Expenditure in some other form, I think that this House has given away of already too much of its control of the purse. I shall never be a party to increasing the powers of the Senate in connection with financial matters. The members of the Senate are entitled under the Constitution to consider the items in the Estimates as they cannot be considered by the Legislative Council of a State, and to enable them to exercise that power they must obtain the Appropriation Bill before the last moment of the session.",19
63,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,Le t us at least try the arrangement proposed.,19
64,Mr MCCAY,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,I do not feel sanguine about the success of any arrangement with another place which will not involve the abandonment of further rights of this House. My view is that we have already gone further in parting with our rights in connection with financial measures than we should have gone.,19
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,The honourable and the learned member is now furnishing excellent in reasons for the view taken by those who to urge the adjournment of the debate.,19
66,Mr MCCAY,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"I fail to see that I am. Honourable members who urge the keeping back of the Appropriation Bill are labouring under a delusion. We must rely upon the good faith of the Government so far as - our relations with the Senate are concerned. The position of the Appropriation Bill will not have any effect in bringing the Senate into line .with the House of Representatives upon the Capital site question. Besides, we cannot keep back the Appropriation Bill indefinitely. Therefore there is no force in the veiled threat that would be made by ""taking the course of action suggested. I do not wish to leave the House to the uncontrolled mercies of any Ministry, but we must either accept or decline the assurance - of the Prime Minister. If we accept his assurance it will not matter to us where the Appropriation Bill is, and so far as the Senate is concerned, it does not matter where it is, because we cannot in the least - degree control the actions of the members - of that body.",20
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,What did the honourable and learned member understand the .assurance of the Prime Minister to be ?,20
68,Mr MCCAY,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"That the Capital question would be dealt with in this House before the end of the session, and that he would try to have it dealt with in the other House.",20
69,Sir EDWAKD BKADDON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,That he would - do all he could to have it settled between the two Houses.,20
70,Mr MCCAY,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"Yes . That is as much as lie could do, whatever the position of the Appropriation Bill.",20
71,Mr MCDONALD,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"He assured us that the ""Conciliation and Arbitration Bill would be passed this session, but where is it ?",20
72,Mr MCCAY,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"If the honourable member doubts the sincerity of the promise given, that is another matter. I do. not see how the position of the Appropriation Bill can possibly affect the question in view of the relations between the two Houses, and the fact that we must, .sooner or later, send on the Appropriation Bill, and that we must also hold the elections at the same time that the Senate - elections are being held.",20
73,Mr KINGSTON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL, I with that desire? fail to follow the honourable and learned member for Corinella in his observations. did not understand that it was suggested that we should hold the Appropriation :for the purpose of bringing pressure to bear I on the Senate or anything of that kind. Who suggested it 1,20
74,Mr MCCAT,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,It was suggested.,20
75,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,No one suggested it .,20
76,Mr KINGSTON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"I listened very carefully to the remarks 'of honourable members, and I did not hear any suggestion of the kind. If it had been made it would have at once struck my notice as a most startling proposition. What I understand is that the retention of the Appropriation Bill undoubtedly affords the House the most powerful means of exercising control over the Government. Of course, we can go on as long as we like passing Supply Bills in order that the affairs of the State may be carried on from month to month, but once we pass an Appropriation Bill which provides for the expenditure for the remainder of the financial year, welose our constitutional power so farasit relates to the control of the finances and of the Government. I think that that is a proposition of the most elementary character, and I do not see how it is possible to put the matter of retaining the Appropriation Bill other than as bearing upon the control which this House exercises over the Government. W i th regard to the action which should be taken by us, I think that we ought to settle the question of the Capital site as soon as we possibly can. I venture to say that honourable members are sick of it, that Australia is sick of it, and that the most mischievous consequences would ensue if we had to go to the elections before finally settling the matter. I hope that in the early stages of the next Parliament two matters will be removed from our consideration-tw o matters which have troubled us too long. I hope that the fiscal issue will be settled once and for all-or , at any rate, for a considerable period-upo n the basis of the continuance of the Tariff now in operation, and also that the Capital site question will be disposed of.",20
77,Mr MAHON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,I thought the right honourable and learned member wished to see preferential trade brought about ?,20
78,Mr KINGSTON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,Of course 1 do.,20
79,Mr MAHON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,Then how does the right honourable gentleman reconcile his statement as to the settlement of the fiscal question,20
80,Mr KINGSTON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,Does the honourable I member suppose that the whole fiscal question will have to be re-opened in order tc Bill deal with that matter ?,20
81,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,It must be.,20
82,Mr KINGSTON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,I hope not. Honourable members need not lay that flattering unction to their souls. I do not think that the fiscal peace which honourable members desire to see maintained will be disturbed by the consideration of the question of preferential trade. We can easily give effect to that principle without reopening the whole fiscal controversy. I am indeed sanguine that when we meet next year both these questions will be out of the way. I would beg of the Government to spare no pains whatever to get the Capital site question settled this session.,21
83,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"Hear , hear; that is our intention.",21
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,We suggest that in the meantime the Government shall hold this Bill over for one week.,21
85,Mr KINGSTON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"If the Government are agreeable to comply with that request, well and good, but I do not think I should be prepared to give a vote which would press the matter upon them if they are disinclined to accede to what honourable members ask.",21
86,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,The Senate will have no work for next week except the consideration of this Bill.,21
87,Mr KINGSTON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"Then the sooner they get it the better. Let the Government keep their noses to it . Judging from the Prime Minister's statements, I think that he is fully seized with the importance of removing from the constant notice of the Parliament and the people this question, which ought to be settled and which has all too long remained unsettled. I hope, therefore, that he will do all that is necessary to insure that both Houses shall express their choice ; that he will persevere, and not be induced by any desire to get into the haven of recess to spare any pains. As I believe that the Government will do all they can-Appropriatio n Bill or no Appropriation Bill-and that they will carry out what is the undoubted wish of this House, I am prepared to assist them in doing what they propose.",21
88,Mr THOMSON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,They have given an absolute promise.,21
89,Mr KINGSTON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"Yes . They have not shilly-shallied with the question : they have not adopted terms of dubious meaning, but have pledged themselves as absolutely as any Government could do Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND> BUILDING S) BILL (1903-4). THIRD READING. Motion (by Sir GEORGE TURNER) proposed - That the Bill be now read a third time.",21
90,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"Parramatta) With reference to what has been said on the Capital site question, I desire to point out that no one on this side of the House questions the sincerity of the Government. We do, however, doubt their ability, with the Appropriation Bill out. of the way, to carry the determination of the Capital site to a conclusion. We have known Governments to make promises before. I need scarcely remind honourable members of the statement recently made by a right honourable gentleman nolonger a member of this House, in perfect good faith, concerning a matter of vital importance, and of the fact that within one short month a course exactly opposite to that indicated by him was taken. That statement was made in the same good faith as the statement of the Prime Minister in reference to the Capital site. No one doubts his sincerity, or that it is his intention to carry his promise into effect. In. politics, however, no one knows what a day or an hour may bring forth, and there is. nothing like being ready for emergencies. Therefore I urge that the consideration of the Capital question should be postponed for a week, or until we can see how matters are likely to shape themselves between the two Houses. All the talk about the Senate having no work to donext week is quite beside the question. The Senate has had many holidays extending over a week during the present session. They had one recently because there was nothing for them to clo, and therefore there is nothing novel in the other Chamber being able to go away for a week. In view of the fact that this is the most vitally important matter which we have been called upon toconsider this session, I would' urge the Government even now to leave the consideration of this Bill over in order that we may see what kaleidoscopic changes may take place. We cast no reflection upon the Government or the Prime Minister, but we say that, as has happened before, political eventualities may cause the Prime Minister to take action contrary to the solemn promise which he has just made to> the House. We have had recent experience that this is possible in politics, even assuming good faith, and all the like. We have seen that these political turnovers can take place, and what has happened will probably occur again. I therefore ask the Government to allow this Bill to stand over for a week at least.",21
91,Mr BROWN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL, I rise to elicit some information from the Prime Minister at this juncture. There has just been handed to honourable members a document containing the minutes of evidence taken by the Royal Commission on Capital Sites..,22
92,Mr SPEAKER,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,The honourable member is not in order in discussing a matter that is not connected with the Appropriation Bill.,22
93,Mr BROWN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,Some reference has been made to the Capital Sites question.,22
94,Mr SPEAKER,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"Quite so; the honourable member will understanl that the reference which has been made to that question has been by way of a suggestion that this Bill should not now pass, but that the third reading should be taken at a later stage. Any reference to any printed paper concerning the Capital Site would be quite out of order in discussing the third reading of this Bill.",22
95,Mr BROWN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"It is on the point to which you have referred, sir, that I wish to elicit information. I wish to point out that one reason why the Bill should not now be disposed of is that we have been promised certain additional information bearing upon the Capital sites, and that, in accordance with that promise, we have today received documents containing a report of the evidence. But we were also informed that we should be supplied with the minutes of the proceedings of the Commission.",22
96,Mr SPEAKER,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"I would point out to the honourable member that that matter might have been brought up in the form of a question earlier in the proceedings today, and it may be brought up at a later stage, on the motion for the adjournment of the House; but I do not see how the honourable member can connect it with the measure now under discussion.",22
97,Mr BROWN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"I wish to urge the postponement of this Bill, for the reason that, so far, honourable members have not been supplied with ful l information bearing upon the Capital Sites inquiry. A postponement would enable us to get that information, and we should be in a better position to deal with the sites. I hope the Government will see their way not to take from the House the power which we possess, as they will do by putting through this measure. There is no immediate hurry for it. I trust that they will accede to the wish of the Opposition in allowing it to stand over for at least a few days, so that we may be better able to see our way with respect to other matters which the Government have asked the House to consider.",22
98,Mr THOMSON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"North Sydney) Whilst 1 quite recognise all that has been said in connection with the desirability, under ordinary circumstances, of not giving the Government the Appropriation Bill until the principal business of Parliament has been transacted, I also recognise the claim that the Senate should be allowed time for the consideration of the Bill, which covers the Estimates for the entire year. While I think that the Government could, allowing for all that, have left over this Bill for another week, I also recognise that we can hardly go to the extent of resisting the.proposals of the Government so far as not to assent to the third reading of the measure until the Capital site and all the other business of Parliament has been absolutely cleared up. Since we have to agree to send the Bill to the Senate before other business is concluded, I felt that the best thing we can do is to obtain from the Prime Minister an absolute promise as to the carrying out of the principal item of business that remains to be transacted before Parliament is prorogued. There has been some doubt as to what the Prime Minister actually promised. To me his promise was not capable of doubt, and I will now state what I understood it to be. I understood the - Prime Minister to promise that before Parliament is prorogued there shall be, if possible, a selection by the two Chambers of one site; or, if that is not possible, that there shall be a selection of one site by each Chamber. Those words are plain enough, and are easily understood.",22
99,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,""" If possible.""",22
100,Mr THOMSON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"It is not "" if possible "" ; there is to be a selection of one site "" if possible,"" and if not, there is to be a selection of a site by each Chamber.",22
101,Mr KINGSTON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,Would not the Prime Minister's promise extend to endeavouring to make the two Houses agree 1,22
102,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"Hear , hear !",23
103,Mr THOMSON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,I understand that that is part of the promise-that the Government will endeavour to arrive at the selection of one site 03' both Chambers.,23
104,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"Hear , hear !",23
105,Mr THOMSON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"The Prime Minister accepts that; but if it is not possible to secure an agreement between the two Houses, he promises that there shall be a selection by each Chamber of a site.",23
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,""" If possible.""",23
107,Mr THOMSON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"The promise of the Prime Minister is an absolute one, and is a stronger hold upon the Government than retaining the Appropriation Bill. I , for am prepared to accept the Prime Minister's absolute promise, because I think we can get nothing stronger by taking any other - course that we have the power to adopt. It is our power that we must consider well as our desire. I have confidence that the Prime Minister will see that mise is fulfilled, not only to the letter, in the spirit.",23
108,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL," I hesitate to address myself again to this question, but if I not, a misconception might possibly be allowed to take root. No promise has been made by me with regard to this matter that <lid not express the intention adopted long ago as part of the policy of the Government. I intended from the first to take a course which would settle this vexed question and cordially re-echo and agree with the remarks of my right honourable friend of any other issue. the member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, that the whole' Continent, as well as the State of New'South Wales, desires to see it settled once and for all. As far as lies in our power, what we proposed to do originally, and what we still to do, is to commence next week in this House, and endeavour, if possible, before its end, to get a conclusion arrived at by honourable members in regard to the selection of the site. If we fortunate enough to succeed in that, the proposal of this House would be put before the other Chamber the week after. The Senate will have the whole of next week to dispose of various Appropriation Bills before themthe principal Appropriation Bill, that relating to works and buildings, and the two! minor Bills relating to arrears. Those measures will occupy the time of the during next week. If this House is fortunate enough to make its selection of the site-as I hope will be the case; if necessary sitting late and long for that purpose-then , in the week following, the members of another place will have an opportunity of agreeing or of disagreeing with us ; whilst we on our part shall take up the Defence Bill, and the minor measures that are still before Parliament. That business will occupy us while the Senate is considering the question of the site. If the Senate agrees with what we have done, practically the work of the session is over, and we shall depart. If the Senate does not agree one, - thoug h I cordially hope they will-w e shall take steps to endeavour to arrive at some harmonious agreement. Nothing will be lacking on the part of the Ministry to arrive at such a conclusion. It is possible, as of course, that the Senate may refuse to come to any decision. It is also possible his prothat this House may do the same; but although I think, from my knowledge of the feeling of honourable members on both sides, and of public sentiment in the country, .neither House will receive any endid couragement to prolong the indefinite and unsatisfactory state in which this matter stands. The Government desire to get the question settled and out of the way as speedily as possible. It has been part of their policy from the first to remove this vexed question from the arena of politics, and I hope that ; the policy we shall submit to the country will not be interfered with by the intrusion Question resolved in the affirmative.

109,Mr GLYNN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL," I move That the following new clause be inserted :"" 1 1 9 A . It shall be the duty of all patentees and their assigns and legal representatives and of all jjersons making or vending any patented article, for or under them, to give sufficient notice to the public that the same is patented, either by fixing thereon the word ' patented ' together with the day and year the patent was granted and the number of the patent; or when from the character of the article this cannot be done, by fixing to it or to the package wherein one or more of them is enclosed a-label containing the like notice ; and in any suit for infringement by the part}' failing so to mark, no damages shall be recovered by the plaintiff except on proof that the defendant was duly notified of the infringement, aud continued after such notice to make use or vend the article so patented."" The object of this clause is to prevent any action for an infringemen t of a patent being t a k e n by a patentee unless he marks upon the patent the fact that it is patented. The provision is taken from the revised statutes in America, where it has been found to w o r k admirably. H i the r to a number of bogus patents have been issued, and held in terrorem over people who have been using inventions which they did not know were patented. I have adopted the provision in vogue in America, with ODe variation, which was in the nature of a suggestion that I saw in the L a w Quarterly Review of J u l y last. As the Prime Minister does not oppose the amendment, it is unnecessary for me to say a n y t h in g f u r the r .",24
110,Mr THOMSON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL," I should l i k e to know the exact meaning of this clause. For instance, it is declared that .the word "" patented "" shall not appear on an article unless it be patented. But where is it to be patented ?",24
111,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"This relates, of course, to patents taken out in the Commonwealth.",24
112,Mr THOMSON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"The word ""patented"" m i g h t appear on an article which had been patented not in the Commonwealth, but, for example, in the U n it e d States of America, and I desire to know whether a n y difficulty will be created.",24
113,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,No .,24
114,Mr THOMSON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"If an article patented elsewhere is imported in to Australia with the word "" patented "" upon it , will this provision interfere with the sale of it ?",24
115,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"If the honourable member looks at the interpretation clause PATENTS BILL. he will see that it is there provided that "" patented article "" means an article patented in the Commonwealth, and the whole of this clause turns on patented articles. Proposed new clause agreed to.",24
116,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"I move That the following new clause be inserted :"" 9A (1) The Commissioner may, in relation to anj' particular matters or class of matters or to any particular State or part of the Commonwealth, by writing under his hand, delegate all or any of his powers under this Act (except this power of delegation) to a Deputy Commissioner, so that the delegated powers may be exercised by him with respect to the matters or class of matters or the State or part of the Commonwealth specified in the instrument of delegation. "" (2) Every delegation under this section shall be revocable at will, and no delegation shall prevent the exercise of any power by the Commissioner."" If honourable members turn to clause 12 they will see that we have omitted paragraph (e), which gave the Commissioner the r i g h t to delegate any of his powers to a Deput y Commissioner. It seemed to be too important a power to include with the Commissioner's a u t h o r it y to summon witnesses and receive evidence, and accordingly it has been placed in this special clause. We have particularized it so that in delegating any authorit y the Commissioner will indicate the particular matters, or class of matters, or the particular part of the Commonwealth to which his delegation is to extend. The power is the same as that originall y provided in clause 12, save that the Commissioner is now given an opportunit y to adjust it to the necessities of each case. It might otherwise have been assumed that "" delegation of powers"" meant a delegation of all powers over all the Commonwealth. This delegation probably will be chiefly used, in the first instance at a ll events, in the appointment of a Deputy Commissioner in each State, who, u n t i l the whole system becomes completely unified, will be able to act in such matters as the Commissioner thinks fit to in t r u s t to him . Proposed new clause agreed to.",24
117,Mr GB EDWARDS,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"No r t h Sydney). - I move That the following new clause be inserted :"" 1 8 AA patent may be transferred in the form and in the manner prescribed by endorsement on the back thereof, signed by the proprietor and the transferee, and on the production of such patent so endorsed the Commissioner shall cause the transfer to be registered."" The object of my amendment is to facilitat e the transfer of patent rights. At present the cost of transfer is, in some cases, far greater than the cost of taking out the patent itself. In very many instances holders of patents who may happen to be impecunious are utterly prohibited from transferring a right which may be of some value, although not valuable enough to justify the large expenditure at times involved in preparing the various deeds necessary to enable a transfer to be made. I wrote to the late Minister for Trade and Customs some time ago, suggesting that when he was drafting this Bil l he should embody in it some such simple reform as this. The right honourable member apparently did not think it worthwhile to adopt my suggestion, but I would remind the Committee that the reform, if it is a reform, is one which we have carried out in relation to transfers involving very much larger suras than are usually associated with the transfer of a patent. It has been introduced into our land laws by what is known as the Torrens transfer system. One can transfer property of very great value at a cost of about ten shillings, exclusive of the tax. Life assurance policies may also be transferred by endorsement, while one scrip, perhaps of the value of Â£100,000, may be transferred by a duly witnessed endorsement. It seems to me that we might well adopt this very simple expedient in order to facilitate the transfer of patents. It would be a very great concession to poor holders of patents, who have already received much consideration at the hands of the Committee.",24
118,Mr WATSON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,How would the amendment operate where a patentee had assigned his interest in some patent ?,25
119,Mr GB EDWARDS,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,There are other provisions in the Bill which deal with assignments.,25
120,Mr WATSON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,But how would it operate if a patentee desired to assign only a proportion of his interest in a patent 1,25
121,Mr GB EDWARDS,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"I am not a lawyer, but I think that the patentee in such a case would require to have a deed drawn up setting forth the interests of the several parties. But if a man were the original patentee, and still held the patent right, he would beable under this amendment to transfer it at a cost of 5s. or 10s. I was obliged on one occasion to take over some patents in New South Wales, and in one case the transfer cost me over Â£20. I had to go to the Patent Office-jus t as one was called upon to visit the Titles Office in connection with the transfer of land under the old system-wit h a bundle of documents tracing the holders of the patent from first to last, and showing the various releases and liens upon it . We should have a system under which patents would be retained in the office of the Registrar, and a certificate issued setting forth that "" A . B . "" is the holder of letters patent, giving him the privilege of a certain invention. Under that system, if "" A . B . "" wished to dispose of his rights, he would simply have to write on the back of the certificate a statement of transfer to "" CD . , "" who would have the transfer registered for a small fee, and thus complete the transaction. At present transfers have to pass through the hands of lawyers, who are called upon to display much ability in tracing the various holders of the patent rights, and in drawing up long deeds of recital. The adoption of my proposal will confer a great boon upon a very large number of holders of patents, who are unable at present to do anything with them because of the cost of the transfer. Proposed new clause agreed to.",25
122,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"I m o v e That the following new clause be inserted :- ""42A. (1) An appeal shall lie to the High Court or the Supreme Court from any decision of the Commissioner under the preceding section. ""(2) The Court shall hear the applicant and the Commissioner, and shall decide whether and subject to what conditions, if any, the application and specification shall be accepted."" Clause 42 did not provide for an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner. The amended clause embodies most of the provisions of clauses 42 and 43, with the exception of sub-clause 6 of clause 43, in regard to which I shall submit a proposal at another sitting. Proposed new clause agreed to.",25
123,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"I m o v e That the following new clause be inserted"" 82A. JSvery patent shall be granted subject to the following conditions :(a) That if the patented article is reasonably capable of beingcommercially constructed ormanufacfcured,orthein van tion patented is reasonably capable of being commercially worked in Australia, the patentee or some person authorized by him shall within five years after the date thereof commence and after such commencement continuously carry on in Australia the construction or manufacture of the patented article or the working of the invention patented in such a manner that any person niay obtain the patented article or the use of the invention at a reasonable price : and (6) That if the patented article is reasonably capable of being commercially constructed or manufacturedin Australia, thepatentee shall not after four years from the date of the patent import it or cause it to be imported into Australia. AVhat is desired is that when a monopoly is granted in the Commonwealth the patentee, or some person authorized by him, shall, if required, commence and continuously carry on the construction or manufacture of the patented article within Australia. The enormous development of chemical manufactories in Germany, now one of the most prosperous elements of the trade of that country, is largely due to the restrictive provisions of the German patent law. Formerly Great Britain controlled many of the most valuable and profitable chemical manufactories, but when the patentees found that they were under no restriction to manufacture in that country, while they were required to manufacture in Germany, they were induced to remove their operations to the latter country, to which they have proved one of the most prolific sources of wealth. Another illustration of the same result is the manufacture of linotypes, the patent rights in which, owing tc the provisions in the German law, were purchased for about Â£150,000 in that country as compared with something like Â£800,000 paid for the patent rights in the United Kingdom, and possibly some of its dependencies, and it is understood that the development of linotype manufactories in that country is largely due to the provisions of its patent law. The principle underlying the clause is so important that, in order to insure its acceptance, I have introduced conditions which will make it operative only in cases in which it is evidently not injurious to the legitimate interests of the patentee. For instance, the patented article must be reasonably capable of being commercially constructed or manufactured, or the invention patented reasonably capable of being commercially worked within the Commonwealth. The condition as to the working of a patent within the Commonwealth need not be complied with if the consumption of the patented article within Australia would be too small, or if some necessary element would be so expensive that its manufacture here would be an injury to the patentee, and involve an increase in the price of the article.",25
124,Mr GLYNN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,Who is to determine that 1,26
125,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"It would be determined by the Commissioner in the first case, and, on appeal, by the Court.",26
126,Mr GLYNN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,Such a provision will supply a splendid lot of problems for the High Court.,26
127,Mr CROUCH,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,It might be made conditional upon trades of a similar character being carried on within the Commonwealth.,26
128,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"I do not think it desirable to narrow the provision in that way. It might be possible to establish a new industry upon conditions favourable to the patentee, and it would be unwise to impose any restriction such as the honourable and learned member suggests. There is no desire, under this power, to extract anything more then can reasonably be claimed. Surely when a person is being granted a monopoly, it is reasonable for us to say-""Tak e your monopoly and enjoy it, but if you can manufacture your patent with commercial success within the Commonwealth you will be called upon, in return for the monopoly you enjoy, to supply the requirements of the community by manufacturing here."" That seems to be only reasonable, and the conditions under which it is proposed to make the demand of the patentee, appear to remove the chief objections which apparently led honourable members in another place to strike out the clause. These amendments I propose will require to be embodied twice within the clause and also in the patent itself. W it h safeguards which I have indicated to honourable members, I believe that the provision will afford a means of legitimately increasing the productions of the Commonwealth, that it will result in advantage to our industries and to our people, and, at the same time, inflict no undue hardship upon the patentees.",26
129,Mr GLYNN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL, The Prime Minister did not mention that the amendments agreed to in clause 83 almost dispense with the necessity for this new clause.,26
130,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,That was because I did not desire to enter into the whole question again.,26
131,Mr GLYNN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"Clause 83, as amended last night, provides that the Court shall decide whether the price at which a patent is sold is a reasonable one. If it is found that it is sold at an oppressive or unreasonable price, after two years from the 'time of issuing the patent, a compulsory licence may be granted so that any person in the Commonwealth may manufacture it. The Court also has power to absolutely revoke the patent. Notwithstanding that drastic alteration which goes far beyond the English law, the Prime Minister now asks us to agree to a provision which is not to be found in any Patent Acts except those of Canada and Germany. I am informed that the provision in the Canadian Act has proved a dead letter. A similar provision was embodied in some of the South Australian Patent Acts, but proved inoperative. It was recognised that if it enforced, it could only lead to an increase in the price of the patented article. For instance, honourable members must realise that it would not pay the Singer Manufacturing Company to manufacture sewing machines within the Commonwealth. The same remark would apply to the manufacture of linotypes. It is only by centralizing their work that these great manufacturing firms can turn out an article at a small cost. The Singer Manufacturing Company have been able to establish a successful branch in only one place, namely, Scotland. There is no necessity for this provision, which amounts to protection and nothing else. It is not required to tone down the effects of the monopoly granted by a patent, but is an attempt to enforce the local manufacture of articles in respect of which we have granted patent rights. though no working conditions are imposed upon patentees in the United States, the greater part of the time of the SupremeCourt is taken up in dealing actions relating to patents. There is no doubt that during the last twenty or thirty years an enormous number of patent actions have been dealt with in America. Nearly the whole of the jurisdiction of some of the district Courts is monopolised by patent actions, aad similar results would be brought about here. Among other questions which the Courts would be called upon to determine here would be the question, for instance, whether a patent machine could be manufactured at a fair price, and such questions must lead to endless litigation. The patentees would be subjected to continual harassment, and I hope that honourable members will not consent to pass such an anomalous and drastic provision. . Mr Glynn.",26
132,Mr THOMSON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL," I should have thought that every possible security-mor e than was desirable-ha d been afforded by the amendments which were accepted last night. Under the provisions referred to by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, if a foreign patentee did not consider it desirable to manufacture in the Commonwealth, it would be competent for any one whothought he could successfully manufacture the article to apply for a compulsory licence to enable him to do so. Now we are asked to insert another provision which would have this effect. . If it did were not pay any one in the Commonwealth to apply for a compulsory licence, and it did not pay the patentee himself to manufacture within the Commonwealth, the patent might be revoked. That would their mean that any person manufacturing in a place where there was no patent law, such as Holland, could gain the advantage of the patent in our market, in spite of the money spent by the patentee in registering the patent within the Commonwealth.",27
133,Mr KINGSTON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"The Attorney-General must be satisfied that there is injury to thetrade or manufactures of the Commonwealth before proceedings for revocation of the patent are taken. That is provided for in Clause 82B, which imposes a restriction upon the proceedings.",27
134,Mr THOMSON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"That does not affect Almy argument. We know that many patents do not assume any great value until after the patentee has spent many years in creating demand, and with that frequently it is only during the last year or so of the period for which the patent is issued that the patentee receives any return for his ingenuity and enterprise. In other words, the patentee has. to work his patent into repute. It is now proposed that if at the end of that period the patentee has achieved success and worked up a demand for his article in the Commonwealth, the patent shall be subject to revocation. A patent may be revoked before the patentee has been able to secure sufficient outlet to permit of his establishing works within the Commonwealth. I do not think that is a fair provision. Moreover, it is to be left to the Court to decide whether a patent can be commercially and profitably manufactured within the Commonwealth. That is a very delicate question to be decided by any court. The patent may be essential to the carrying on of certain industries, and if the cost of manufacture is increased through the requirement that it shall be made within the Commonwealth serious inj ury may be inflicted. The decision of the Court may have the effect of impeding the progress of industry. If a patent were not manufactured in Australia, more than sufficient security would be given to the public, because any person could obtain the right to manufacture under a compulsory licence. I object to the provision in the first place, because there is no necessity for it ; secondly, because the High Court would be called upon to settle very delicate and difficult questions; and thirdly, because it would operate, not only unjustly towards the patentees, but injuriously to the best interests of the Commonwealth. Mr A. PATERSON (Capricornia) - I thoroughly sympathize with the views expressed by the honourable member for North Sydney. There are many classes of patented plant and machinery which must be obtained from abroad. For instance, the plant used in meat works is in nearly all cases imported from America. Most of the machinery has been patented in America, and is also protected by patent rights throughout Australia. The Americansare very sharp business people, and if they found it to their advantage to make this machinery in the Commonwealth they would do so apart from any legislation. If we enacted that all patented machinery should be made within the Commonwealth, we should practically prohibit the introduction of much valuable plant, and thus make a very grave mistake. If an attempt were made to manufacture within the Commonwealth all the machinery we required, the cost would be very largely increased, and I do not see that any good object would be served by passing the clause. - Mr WINTER COOKE (Wannon) - I wish to add my protest to the objections which have already been urged against this clause being restored to the Bill. It was very properly rejected in another Chamber.",27
135,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,But the honourable member must not forget that I am modifying it .,28
136,Mr WINTER COOKE,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"I cannot quite follow the modifications, because they do not appear in print. It would be difficult for me to conceive of any modifications that would remove the objections which I have to the clause. It seems to me that any such provision would result in increasing the cost of patented machinery,, and that, the effects would be the reverse of beneficial to our industries. In a great many instances patentees have been unable to get their patented articlesmanufactured within the Commonwealth except at a much greater expense. As has been already pointed out, the community islargely protected by the clauses to which, the Committee agreed at a previous sitting. I therefore hope that the proposal of the Prime Minister will be rejected. Question-That the proposed new clause be inserted-put . The Committee divided. Ayes ... ... 16 Noes 13 Majority. AYES.

Of course it will be impossible to take a vote upon the matter on Tuesday evening, but I trust there will be no delay upon any grounds whatever in arriving at a decision. I hope that the two questions-the method to be adopted in selecting the site, and the relative merits of the different sites-wil l be dealt with at once.",28
138,Mr MCDONALD,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,Si t up all night.,29
139,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"It may be necessary to adopt that course later, but it will not be necessary to do so upon the first night.

When - we comcapital mence to vote upon the sites, I hope will be agreed that there shall be no more debate.",29
140,Mr A MCLEAN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,Has the Bill been circulated yet?,29
141,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"It will be circulated night. It consists of only one clause, contains a blank which the House will asked to fill.",29
142,Mr MAHON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,Why do the Government Tuesday. themselves not accept the responsibility of filling in the blank 1,29
143,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"I am perfectly prepared to accept that responsibility, but do think it would be a proper course to adopt in this case. No question of Ministerial prestige, influence, or any personal consideraits tion whatever, should be involved in the determination of this question. that honourable members will mark the order of their preference for the different sites, viewing the matter from an Australian the stand-point. When we have decided the method of selection to be adopted, I trust that an exhaustive discussion will then take place upon the respective merits of the different sites, and that we shall then proceed to vote, vote, vote, until we have reached finality. If we mingle the two questionsthat is to say, take a vote on one site and | then have a discussion upon the merits of other sites, take another vote and have a further discussion-w e shall never reach finality. But if honourable members will be content to at once debate the merits of the sites finally-and I trust that we shall have attentive Houses throughout--whe n the discussion is finished we ought to be in a position to vote and to continue voting until we get an absolute majority in favour of one site.",29

151,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"We may not hope to have a full House on Wednesday next, when we shall probably enter upon the consideration of this question with a view to final determination. I have had nothing to say so far in relation to this matter, but I trust as one of the members of the Conference of Premiers at which it was.agreed to insert the provision in the Constitution relating to site of the capital, I feel that it is especially my duty to see that nothing is done to baulk the intention of the people as pronounced by their vote on the Constitution ;; Bill. We have to think not only of New ! South Wales, but of Victoria, to both of ;1 whom we are pledged, and to both of whom, ,, I hope^ we shall show that we have the | fullest intention to keep the bond.",29
152,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"In what way we pledged to ""Victoria ?",30
153,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"Althoug h there is nothing in the Constitution to show that we aTe pledged to' Victoria, we are indirectly pledged to her in so far as we have agreed that the capital site shall be not less than 100 miles from Sydney. I understand that that was a concession made to a feeling on the part of Victoria.",30
154,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,And some of the other States.,30
155,Sir EDWARDBRADDON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"I do not understand the statement made by the Prime Minister that we shall have to consider, on Tuesday next, the method in which the vote shall be taken. I was under the impression that the House had practically settled that question by resolution.",30
156,Mr DEAKI N,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"I hope so ; but method of selection provided for in the resolution to which the right honourable gentleman refers was to be adopted at a Conference of both Houses. probably have to agree to adopt the same course, or a course which will be practically the same.",30
157,Sir EDWARDBRADDON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,I trust that the question will be finally dealt with within the next few days.,30
158,Mr BROWN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL," I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether he can furnish the House with more information with respect to the suggested sites than has already been supplied to honourable members. The honourable and learned gentleman's predecessor promised that, in addition to the evidence taken by the Commission of experts, the minutes of their meetings and certain exhibits handed in by witnesses should also be furnished to the House. I wish to know whether that promise is to be fulfilled.",30
159,Mr CROUCH,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL," If there is one question more than another which ought to be considered when we are determining the site of the Federal Capital, it is the question of cost. But, so far as I have been able to discover, the papers which have been circulated give no estimate of what will be the cost of the Capital. I understand that the late Prime Minister, in reply to a deputation representing the Shire Councils of Victoria which recently waited upon . him, stated that the cost would not exceed Â±'-500,000 j but .in the course of the discussion of this question which took place 11 L are on a motion submitted to the House some days ago, it was said that it would be Â£10,000,000. That estimate was generally accepted. I should like the Treasurer to j give us an estimate of what the cost is I likely to be before we are asked to decide j this question. It would be very unfair to | call upon honourable members to make a 1 selection in the absence of information as to whether the cost will be Â£500,000, Â£10,000,000, or more. The question of cost will certainly affect my vote. If the cost is to amount to Â£10,000,000,1 do not think that we should at present select a site, and that I is the position which many honourable mem! bers may take up. I would ask the Prime Minister to say whether it is not possible to put before the House a definite statement as to the expenditure to be incurred, and | how the necessary funds are to be raised. the It will be difficult for us to determine the site of the Capital next week, unless we know how the necessary funds are to be raised. I do not think that we could now We shall provide Â£10,000,000 for such a work, and I trust that before a selection is made the Treasurer will furnish us with an. estimate of the cost. Unless he does so we shall be veiy much in the dark in deciding this question.",30
160,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL," The only bearing which the question of expense at this stage can have upon the proposals to be submitted to the House next week is in so far as it relates to the consideration whether the Federal buildings would cost more at one site than at another. Some people speak anxiously of the cost of the Federal Capital; but that depends upon what it will comprise. It may consist merely of two simple Chambers in which Parliament will meet, with the necessary Government offices, and, somewhere near at hand, accommodation for. honourable members. Those buildings may be constructed of any material. They may be of the utmost simplicity, or they may be designed to last for any time. The question of what shall be spent upon the capital will rest entirely with the people of Australia and their representatives. The representatives of the people will spend as little or as much as the people please to authorize ; but no one can now offer a precise opinion that would be worthy of a moment's consideration as to the actual cost of the capital until we have determined its size, its area, the nature of its buildings, the date at which we shall go there, the water supply, temporary or permanent, to be obtained, and the communication, if any, to be established. Each of these items requires to be considered before we come to any estimate of cost.",30
161,Mr CROUCH,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,We are to make a selection regardless of the cost ?,31
162,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"In making a selection we shall regard the cose of the land. We have information bearing upon that point as well as general information as to the cost of providing a water supply. The site, however, will be selected without reference to the kind of Federal city which is to be erected upon it . The question whether it shall be of the bark-hut order of architecture, or consist of marble halls, will rest the people. The only matter to be determined next week is where the Federal citywhatever it is, and whenever it is to be occupied-shal l be.",31
163,Mr WATSON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,Will the Prime Minister say whether he will cause the estimates of the cost of the resumption of land within the several suggested areas to be printed ? The late Prime Minister promised to have that information put before the House.,31
164,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"They are not very lengthy documents, and I think that they can be printed by Tuesday next. That is one element of expense which we shall have to consider ; it depends on the area to be acquired.",31
165,Mr KINGSTON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,Are we going to devote. termine the area to be taken over ?,31
166,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,We are to deal with one question at a time. We are first of all to determine the site of the capital; the next question for our consideration will be the exact area to be acquired.,31
167,Mr KINGSTON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,HOW and when do the Government propose to deal with the second question ?,31
168,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"The question of area cannot be dealt with this session, because will give rise to a number of other considerations as to the sources of water supply, their development, and so forth. I also raise the question of communication.",31
169,Mr KNOX,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,The question of the area taken over may affect the selection of a site.,31
170,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"We shall have before us reports as to the areas of Crown lands which are available, and honourable members will be entitled to take those reports consideration. We ought also to consider, all events, whatever our authority may the matter, the willingness of New South | Wales to part with any larger area than that to which we are absolutely entitled under the Constitution. It might be desirable in some cases to take over a very much larger area than that named in the Constitution. I hope we shall.",31
171,Mr A MCLEAN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,Would New South Wales be able to prevent our buying land ?,31
172,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,No .,31
173,Mr A MCLEAN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,The Government do not anticipate that there will be very much Crown land within the site selected ?,31
174,Mr WATSON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,There are fairly - large areas of Crown lands within or just beyond some of the proposed sites.,31
175,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"Thes e are at present all secondary considerations. Once we have with determined where the capital shall be, we shall have to consider its area and the land to be taken over, the date of occupation, the question of water supply, the means of communication, and a variety of other issues. But we must first fix the site of the capital. The question to be determined next week is where the capital shall be. Once we have dealt with that matter we shall be on the high road to a full and free discussion upon the other issues.",31
176,Mr WATSON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,Does not the Prime Minister think that the question of area has some bearing on the question of site ? Mr .DEAKIN - Indirectl y only.,31
177,Mr MCDONALD,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,It would influence my,31
178,Mr DEAKIN,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"It can have only an indirect bearing on the general question of the site. We surely cannot commence to debate the question whether we shall take over 100 or 1,000 square miles before we decide where the capital shall be? Having determined that question with some regard to all these other matters, but without attempting to finally dispose of them, we shall have to consider what we are to spend upon the capital, and it when and how we shall expend it.",31
179,Mr KINGSTON,ALLOWANCES TO POSTAL,"After making a selection, we might be disposed to hark back on t may account of the decision as to area. Mr.DEAKTN - That is possible, although to be very improbable.
