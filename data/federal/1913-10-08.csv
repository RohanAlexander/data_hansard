1,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I ask the Postmaster General, in reference to a circular which he has distributed to honourable membera, and which conveys information regarding new postal arrangements, whether these new arrangements have yet come into operation ? The circular is dated the 17th September, but I am informedthat yesterday, when a merchant went to the Melbourne Post Office, and wished to send a lettergram to Broken Hill, he was told that t i e regulation providing for the sending of lettergrams was not yet in force.",12
2,Mr AGAB WYNNE,Unknown,"The proposed hew regulations were sent to the Crown Solicitor to draft, and he has advised that an amendment of the Act is required to bring some of them into force. I propose, therefore, to introduce a short amending Bill, which, I hope, Parliament will pass. ELECTORAL ROLLS.  Minister, upon noticei. Is it a fact that 80,000 names were added to the New Sonth Wales electoral rolls by the nse of dummy cards,-or cards not signed by the persons whose names they bore? 2. If so, by whose instructions were such names added to the New South Wales rolls? 3. Were similar instructions given in regard to the other States? 4. Will the Minister lay upon the table of the House a copy of these instructions given, and inform the House of the extent to which these dummy cards, if any, were successfully used in each State?",12
3,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is1, 2, 3, and 4. Rolls were prepared under a proclamation, a copy of which is attached. Clause 5 thereof reads"" If the Commonwealth Electoral Officer is satisfied that any person is entitled to be enrolled on any new roll as an elector he may (notwithstanding that no claim for enrolment has been received from such person) cause his name to be placed on the new roll for the subdivision in which such persou lives. Uut this provision shall not relieve any person from his duty to fill in, sign, and send in a claim for enrolment."" In each State the names of all persons, ascertained by the police to be qualified for enrolment, at the time of the preparation of the rolls, were, as usual, included therein. Claims for enrolment were obtained as far as practicable at the time of the electoral canvass, but for some persons whom the police returned as qualified for enrolment personally-signed claim cards were not at the time of the canvass obtainable owing to temporary absence, illness, &c. The Commonwealth elcloral officers considered thut they had sufficient evidence and authority under the proclamation to include the names of such persons in the roll, ancl did so. This, and not the dummy cards, account for the names of such persons appearing on the printed rolls. In order to make the card index as complete as possible for detecting duplications, the Chief Electoral Officer, purelv as an administrative act. directed that typewritten cards of names ot persons legally on the roll who had not sent in cards should be inserted in the index, pending the receipt of personally-signed claim cards. The outstanding cards gradually came in, until at the time of the elections they were reduced lo less than 1 per cent, of the whole. CUSTOMS AND EXCISE REVENUE.

I do not tliink it will be desired that should say anything in regard to the ter at this stage.",14
11,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,We wish to know exactly what are the reasons for desiring will take it . to introduce the Bill .,14
12,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The practice which is growing up of discussing proposals at this stage, though in accord with the Standing Orders, is, cases, I tliink, an inconvenient one, because it leads to the discussion of sures before they are actually before House. The usual plan of deferring bate until a measure has been introduced, and the second reading moved, is much better. It is only on extraordinary sions, when a Minister may think i ferable to make a statement on the motion for the introduction of a there should be any discussion at this stage. When there is debate at the second-reading stage, members have the B i ll before them, and can speak with a knowledge of its provisions.",14
13,Mr FISHEK,Unknown,We know all about the Bill. The right honourable member gave us full information when speaking on Budget.,14
14,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"T h at is so; but, although honourable members may know all about this Bill , they cannot know all about other when the motion for leave to introtrue duce them is moved. The object which statements. the Government have now in view is to do what is thought just to Tasmania, to give effect to the unanimous mendation of the Royal Commission which considered the financial position of the denial. State, in regard to Federation. Parliament voted a grant of £500,000 for the assistance of the State, and this amount £95,000 was paid up to the 30th June last. Having reconsidered the whole matter, and knowing that the people of Tasmania are very anxious to these questions. obtain the full amount recommended the Royal Commission, and, indeed, feel that they have not been treated as they deserve, Ministers now propose a further grant of £400,000.",14

All that ill we have obtained from him is a statement the Conthat the Government are going to give The honourable member has merely submitted a bald proposition. He has given us no informaI tion as to whether the authorities in Tasmatmania or anybody else have applied for this sum.,14

17,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,O r whether the Government have the money to give.,14
18,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,The Treasurer will give you all that information when the in most Bill is submitted.,14
19,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The only conmeaclusion I can come to is that the honour the able member and certain honourable memdebers on the other side have been privileged to see the B i ll before it has been introduced. If that is not so, how is it occathat the honourable member' seems to t preknow so much about the measure ?",14
20,Sir JOHN FOKEEST,Unknown,"It is outlined in Bill , that the Budget speech.",14
21,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I do not know anything about the Bill , but the Treasurer will give you full information by-and-by.",14

23,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Is that so ? ,14
24,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,It was not. Bills Mr MCWILLIAMS - That is just as as the honourable member's other,14
25,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,If that is so-and and I do not doubt the honourable member's recomword-it is an absolute scandal.,14
26,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"You might take a The last Mr MCDONALD - I object altogether to this system of government by Caucus of which is being carried on. It is about time that the country knew how Caucus ridden the party on the other side are. When they meet in Caucus they discuss I do not object to by Tasmania getting this amount, but I object to the method which is adopted.",14
27,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,That is your real object.,15
28,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I tell the honourable member that it is not, but if it was I would oppose this proposal pretty strongly, and there would not be much hope of him seeing it adopted.",15
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,You never get your feet now but you challenge somebody - You are like a bantam.,15
30,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"L as t night the Prime Minister threatened to apply the closure, and I challenged him to do it if he dared.",15
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"We done it if we had wished. Mr MCDONALD .^-1 know that, but the honourable member had not the courage to do so.",15

36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"You "" gag,"" and we applied it .",15
37,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order ! It is impossible for me to hear the honourable member because of the interjections which are being thrown across the floor. I trust that honourable members will assist ine to preserve the peace of the Chamber.,15
38,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I would like to have an assurance from the Prime M in ister that the measure to be brought in presently was not circulated at the party's Caucus this morning?,15
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Will you sit down if I give it to you ?,15
40,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I would only have to get up again. I have only two chances of addressing the Committee on this motion.,15
41,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,It was culated.,15
42,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I am prepared to accept the honourable member's word.,15
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It has never been submitted to the Caucus at any time in any place.,15
44,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The honourable gentleman is quite right. It has never been submitted to the Caucus in detail.,15
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,O r in any other way.,15
46,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The honourable member has qualified his statement by saying "" o r in any other way."" Honourable members on the other side have been talking among themselves as to which is on the best way to bribe the electors of Tasmania, and this is one of the schemes for that purpose.",15
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Do you say that this is a bribe to Tasmania ?,15
48,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,It is a bribe to the people of Tasmania. could have Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Is that the opinion over there?,15
49,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,No j that is my opinion.,15
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Oh ! we love The CHAIRMAN - Order !,15
51,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The Treasurer should have told the Committee that an intimation has been made by the people of Tasmania that this extra sum of £400,000 is required, but he gave us no information on the subject. All that we could get fro m him was that this is a bad method of conducting the business t we have no right to debate the motion. What is the object in submitting the motion ? It is only for the purpose of passed the debate, and for no other reason. If it was not intended that the proposal should be debated, why does the Treasurer go through this procedure? He must recollect that when similar motions were submitted during the last Parliament honourable members on his side never lost an opportunity to talk.",15
52,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Ver y seldom.,15
53,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"And the worse offenders were the Prime Minister and the Honorary Minister. In the circumstances, therefore, they ought to be the last to object now.",15
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Eighty-the e Bills.,15
55,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Yes , eighty-three Bills were passed in the last Parliament. Did we not give the honourable member a Bill last night-on e Bill one day? not cirI thought that that was very good. Some weeks ago the Government got the Audit Bill . What more do they want? Tn any case, I do not see that there is any special reason for hurrying forward this proposal. The Treasurer might well have allowed it to stand over, and permitted us to deal with that other i mportant measure, the Electoral Bill . He submits this proposal when he knows that the Senate is not going to sit for a fortnight or three weeks. Sir JonN FORBEST - I want to get the Bill before the House.",15
56,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Why did the Government permit the Senate to be adjourned ?,16
57,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Surely you going to allow an injustice to be done to a State?,16
58,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Is Tasmania so much in need of this money that it has to make an appeal to the Government? If honourable members say that the State is in that position, I am quite prepared to act with them.",16
59,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The Government are carrying out the unanimous recommendation of a Royal Commission appointed by the Fisher Govermnent.,16
60,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,You said that Tasmania was a necessitous State. M>. TUDOR - For that reason only.,16
61,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,1 deeply regret to hear that statement. I do not think that Tasmania is a necessitous State.,16
62,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The Premier said they were in a necessitous state.,16
63,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,What I am afraid of in relation to the proposed measure is that other States may take up a position similar to that of Tasmania.,16
64,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Wester n Australia does.,16
65,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Not only may Western Australia, but also Queensland. Where is this sort of thing to end? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Queenslan d got assistance in the form of the sugar legislation.",16
66,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I do not hesitate to say that if a similar inquiry were conducted in relation to Queensland it would be found that nearly £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 would have to be given to that State. I do not say that Queensland requires such assistance; at the same time, I do not think that Tasmania really does.",16
67,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Queenslan d has no intention to ask for it , anyway.",16
68,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"No . If an inquiry were conducted on similar lines as in the case of Tasmania, it would disclose a corresponding state of affairs in regard to Western Australia and Queensland; and, perhaps, South Australia, too.",16
69,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Wester n Australia had special treatment for five years.,16
70,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Yes . In the circumstances I think that the Treasurer was not justified in coming down and merely saying, "" Here is a resolution, and we want you to pass it . "" We are entitled to more than that. But if the right honare not orable gentleman were to come down from time to time and make a reasonable explanation, it would facilitate the passage of his proposals. Iustead of that, however, he submits a bald proposal, and if any honourable member on this side asks a question or desires some information, he is told that a statement will be made on the second reading of the Bill . That method of conducting business is not creditable to the right honourable gentleman, because lie is always desirous of being extremely courteous and fair to the House. I think he would do himself more justice if he would explain why it is necessary to introduce a Bill for this purpose, and not be content with the mere statement that we have fro m honourable members opposite that the Government want to carry out the unanimous recommendation of the Royal Commission on the Tasmanian Customs leakages. I am not prepared at. present to say whether that is a good or a bad reason, but I must certainly enter my protest against this method of conducting the business of the House. If the Treasurer will not give us more information concerning this matter I trust that the Prime Minister will do so. No one was more ready than he was when in Opposition to give information to the House in reard to all sorts of questions. I hope that e is not ill , and that there is nothing to prevent his giving the Committee this afternoon the benefit of that f u n d of knowledge, the possession of which he showed so well when he sat on this side of the chamber. If the Treasurer does not know the exact policy in the mind of the Prime Minister in regard to this proposal, perhaps the Prime Minister himself will tell us what he proposes to do. Is the money to be paid over in one lump sum this year, or is it to be paid by instalments, distributed over a number of years ?",16
71,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,All that wil l appear in the Bill .,16
72,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The Treasurer must anticipate some discussion if he tries to rush measures through in this way.,16
73,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Swan-Trea surer) [2.52] - I do not l i k e it to be thought that I have any desire to keep back from the Committee information that should be in its possession, and no one knows better than does the honourable member for Kennedy that the proper time to explain the details of a Bill is when the motion for a second reading is submitted. This practice of debating a preliminary motion is quite unusual i u this House, and is very inconvenient. On every such motion we now have, during this session, had a long debate. In my Budget, statement, as reported at page 1789 of Hansard, I stated fully what we intended to do in regard to the proposed grant to Tasmania, and mentioned the proposed mode of payment, and the amount that would be paid every year. I have explained our reason for introducing this Bill , and have, I think, said all that is necessary t ill we reach the second-reading stage.",17
74,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [2.54] The Treasurer, in his anger",17
75,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I am not angry.,17
76,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Then I hope the House to something like £5,000. will be spared a speech from the right honourable member when he is angry. H tells us that in the course of his Budget mania another £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 . "" statement he gave us all the information we require, but who can say that he has not since changed his mind? Does he not belong to a Ministry composed of honourable gentlemen who have altered their political principles as often weather changes?",17
77,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member does not do this ""stone-walling well.",17
78,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I am not attempting to "" stone-wall.""",17
79,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable and earning nothing? member is "" stone-walling,"" and he will be sorry when it is all over.",17
80,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The Prime Minister makes what he thinks is a clever remark and theu looks to see how his press supporters take it . Has Parliament come that point later on. to this?,17
81,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Yes , it has.",17
82,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Hav e we reached such ing £300,000 a year. a stage in the National Parliament that the party in power uses its position utter mere parrot cries ? The Treasurer, in his Budget statement, said that the Government proposed to supplement grant made by the Fisher Government by a further sum of £400,000, so the payment up to the full amount recommended by the Royal Commission which dealt with this matter. It was the belief of Tasmanians that that State had suilered great loss because of Customs leakages, due to the stopping of the issue of Inter-State certificates.",17
83,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,So it did.,17
84,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The Commission unanimously decided against thab contention.,17
85,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"-They estimated the loss through Customs leakages at about £10,000 a year.",17
86,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Tb e Premier of Tasmania, on the basis of the findings of the Commission, made an appeal to this Parliament under section 96 of the Constitution- a very proper provision enabling any State to apply to the Commonwealth for aid. To Tasmania's appeal this Parliament did not turn a deaf ear. The late Government passed a Bill providing for a grant of £500,000. Under that Act we began with a payment approaching £100,000, the last of the in stalments which we declared should extend over a period of ten years, falling away The present Treasurer, with a great flourish of trume pets, says, "" We are going to pay TasB u t how do the Government propose to pay it? By granting as a first instalment, this year, the handsome sum of £5,000. In this year of prosperity-the year of a big surplus left by others-the Treasurer proas the poses to pay an instalment of only £5,000.",17
87,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The r i g ht honor"" able member, when Treasurer, loaned all his surplus. - Mr FISHER - Would the right honourable member have the money locked up This money is earning £300,000 a year. Is that the Treasurer's trouble?",17
88,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,It is. We cannot get the money when we want it .,17
89,Mr FISHER,Unknown,We shall deal with,17
90,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Leader of the Opposition says that £2,500,000 is earn",17
91,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The Treasurer is reto ferring to the Trust Funds. The late Government very properly invested all money that was not required for carrying the on the government of the country.,17
92,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We shall have to as to bring get - the money somehow.,17
93,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"If the right honourable member will make inquiries as to when the loans mature, he will find that during this year he will have more money than he can spend.",18
94,Mr HANS IBVINE,Unknown,What commitments ?,18
95,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The honourable member can deal with that subject better on the platform than in this House. There are no commitments from the previous Government.,18
96,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,M a n y millions.,18
97,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The honourable member is not worth replying to when he is dealing with this question.,18
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Not worth replying to, because he tells the truth .",18
99,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,It is not the truth ; it is a deliberate l i e !,18
100,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"- Will the honourable member resume his seat? Since I put the resolution to the Committee the proceedings have been more in the nature of a conversazione than of a parliamentary debate. I do not wish to proceed to extremes, bu t I must remind the Committee that I am under compulsion to carry out the Standing Orders just as much as honourable members are to observe them. I hope that in future those who are addressing the Committee will be given an opportunity to make their speeches without interruption.",18
101,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Then let the honourable member for Grampians say such things?,18
102,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order 1 It is most disorderly that the moment I have called for order an honourable member should immediately break the Standing Orders.,18
103,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"But for the endorsement of the Prime Minister, I should not have taken any notice of the remark made by the honourable member for Grampians. Does the Prime Minister say that we have any commitments which could not have been met during our term ?",18
104,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Yes ; most serious commitments.,18
105,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"A r e tliere any commitments which are not already dealt with under Acts passed by previous Governments dealing with loaus, or any more than the usual commitments which would have been necessary no matter which Government might happen to be in office? However, this is not the time to deal with such matters. When honourable members opposite come out into the open in this House and attempt to make good the statements they have made elsewhere we can deal with them full y. Objection was taken by the honourable about the member; for Franklin to my reference to the fact that £5,000 of the proposed grant should be paid in the first year.",18
106,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I made no objection.,18
107,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I understood the honourable member to remind me that the grants would go on increasing. That is true. It is proposed that the amount to be voted for the second year shall be £15,000, and for the third year £25,000. Assuming that the present Government continued in office during the full term of the present Parliament, the contribution would be £5,000 plus £15,000 plus £25,000, and would that not be an enormous amount for the Government to contribute in three years out of the proposed grant of £400,000. Is that not a splendid effort on the part of those who profess a desire to help Tasmania? We recognised, when in office, that the need of Tasmania was pressing, and was not a matter for the future, and we therefore paid the highest amount in the first year. But the present proposal is like the present Government in all that they do. They are abounding in promises and do the least possible the way of why do you fulfilment. The Treasurer might very well have told the Committee why ' the Government propose to give Tasmania only £5,000 in the first year. A complaint was made that fbhe late Government Hid not deal very handsomely with the report of the Commission, and my rejoinder was that they made an earnest effort to meet the recommendation of the Commission, and then left it to Parliament to deal with the matter. I am not opposing the additional grant proposed, but I say that the Government, though they may have shown their real intentions in the method they propose for making it , have not shown their bona fides by proposing to give small grants in the early years when the money is required by Tasmania. For that reason the Government proposal is faulty, and ought to be altered.",18
108,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"GwydSr) [3.5] - Ia m wondering when the Treasurer will recognise his responsibility to this House. He has had one or two lessons as to what members require on the introduction of a Bill , but he does not seem to have profited by them.

He is at liberty to make .himself heard only by way of brella, or even a parasol. interjection, and dare not make a speech. By interjection, he tries to misrepresent the proceedings in this House, and he has not the courage to stand up and tell people of the country what he means.",19
113,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member is not discussing solution.,19
114,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I am discussing the Prime Minister's treatment of the resolution.,19
115,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,That is not in order.,19
116,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I compliment the Government on being in a position liberal to Tasmania, but I remind the Treasurer that the Government can claim no credit for that, because it is due the surplus left them by the wise finanpounds. cial administration of their predecessors. It is easy for the present Treasurer to be liberal with the money saved by other people. It is all very well for the r i honourable gentleman to assume the r t l of bountiful father to Tasmania by payI ing away money left to him by the vious Government. If the previous Goassistance in the first instance. vernment had not lef t a surplus, what chance would Tasmania have of getting this money? The Government have been be increased to £1,000,000. left a surplus of £2,600,000 by their predecessors, who managed the finances of the Commonwealth in an exemplary way, but what does their liberality consist of? A paltry 5,000 sovereigns for the first year is to be given to this necessitous The object is to provide something with which t q dress the Governhow ment shop window. They have a few things hanging up in it already. They started by hanging up a great deal of dirty linen, and it will be found to overby shadow every other thing they hang in I thought that, when the Treasurer rose after the honourable think meinber for Kennedy, he intended to give the information which the Committee required. Is the Treasurer, or is the Prime aware that there is a far better justification for a grant of this money to people of Sydney to meet the losses they have suffered by reason of the actions of the Government than there is to give The Government are hoping that this grant will be a placard all. which they may use effectively in the",19

Those who were here at the time know that the original purpose of the inquiry was to ascertain the amount of an alleged Customs leakage, but it was not possible to discover a penny of Customs leakage, and there is not a word about leakage in the report of the Commission.",21
163,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Yes . The Commissiou quesestimated the leakage at approximately £10,000 a year. On the sugar",21
164,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The Commission recommended a grant of £900,000 to Tasmania, because its Premier made an appeal on its behalf as a necessitous State. The honourable member for Bass must be congratulated on the success he has had i u this matter, because it is difficult for a private member to get any motion car",21
165,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We were all in,21
166,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"We were in favour of inquiry. The members of the Commission were the late Sir William Lyne, the honourable members for Herbert, Balaclava, Adelaide, Swan, Wimmera, and the ex-member for Fremantle. Practically the Commission was composed of Tasmanian members, with the honourable members for Wimmera, Herbert, and Adelaide, not many other members attending regularly.",21
167,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,The honourable member for Herbert was a regular attendant.,22
168,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member for Franklin has handed to me a report of the Commission, from which I gather that the Commissioners found it impossible to state definitely the loss sustained by Tasmania in Customs leakage, but were of the opinion that they were justified in estimating it at £10,000 during the last seven years of the bookkeeping period, or £70,000 altogether. I went into this matter very carefully when in office, and came to the conclusion that there was no leakage.",22
169,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,There would be no evidence of leakage in the Department.,22
170,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I obtained evidence from persons sending goods to Tasmania. Manufacturers sending imported goods from here were not likely to place the value of the imported raw material on a low basis; they were more likely to keep it at a high value, as it would then appear that their profits were small. know of twenty or thirty manufacturers in Victoria who could give evidence to that effect. It is no wish of mine to do Tasmania an injustice, and I congratulate the State on its success, though I do not think that the grant is deserved.",22
171,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,The honourable member appears to regard his investigation as - superior to that of the Commission.,22
172,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I obtained evidence that the Commission did not try to get.,22
173,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,What evidence was that? We had all the Customs offiany cers before us.,22
174,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I believe that if an officer gave hostile evidence, he was cut short, but that if a witness gave evidence bolstering up the case for Tasmania, he was made welcome, and leading questions were asked to help him out.",22
175,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,That is most unfair.,22
176,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The r e were two Tasmanians on the Commission, and tliere were four Labour members.",22
177,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The late Sir William Lyne was practically a Tasmanian.,22
178,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Has the honourable member carefully read the evidence ?,22
179,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I have not read all theevidence, but I have gone through a great deal of it . I think that the honourable member for Franklin will acknowledge that I have taken as much interest in this matter as any other honourable member, though I have never been able to see eye to eye with him in regard to it .",22
180,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I do not thin k the honourable member ever grasped the leakage question.,22
181,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"We have a habit of saying something of that kind about those who differ from us. Last night the honourable member for Werriwa said that he was the only man in the House who understood the sugar question. Mr CONUOV"" - I said that no Labour member understood it. '-'",22
182,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"A number of Liberals are of the same opinion as we are, but apparently the honourable member would regard them as right, and us as wrong. I have done my best to understand the leakage question, and I think that I understand it as well as does any other honourable member. The Commission re- commended a grant to Tasmania, but not in respect of any leakage.",22
183,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,The leakage was a very I subordinate matter.,22
184,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Yes . The claim in respect of leakage was - practically abandoned.,22
185,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Is the honourable member in favour of the Bill , or against it?",22
186,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I got up to show that no leakage was proved.,22
187,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The honourable member said nothing when his Government proposed a vote of £500,000 to Tasmania.",22
188,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"And I do not tliink that Minister will say anything against this proposal; it is not usual for a Minister to criticise a measure of which a colleague is in charge, and the Treasurer, I am sure, would feel h u rt if any of his proposals were criticised by a colleague. The other day we saw the Minister in charge of the Electoral Bill thrust aside, but I do not think that the Treasurer only would stand that sort of thing.",22
189,Mr FENTON,Unknown,What was disclosed before the Commission was appointed ?,22
190,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That there was no leakage, and I think that both Sir GeorgeTurner and the present Treasurer wrote minutes to that effect. But, of course, if Tasmania is hard up, as her Premier affirms, she must be assisted as a necessitous State.",22
191,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Wester n Australia has been receiving assistance for years. Mr TUDOR. - For the first five years of Federation Western Australia had a special tariff, which was reduced according to a sliding scale. Then came a period during which the State received no special treatment, but now it is again being specially treated. Tasmania, if necessitous, is equally entitled to special treatment.. But the financial position of the States should be dealt with as a whole. However, I shall reserve my further remarks until the Bill has been introduced. Mr ROBERTS '(Adelaide) [3.42'; This is wholly a financial matter. Some time ago a Royal Commission investigated the financial position of Tasmania as affected by Federation, and recommended a grant to the State in aid of its finances. The majority of the members of that Commission were Labour members, and I congratulate the Treasurer and his supporters that, notwithstanding their repeated denunciations of Labour, and their continual assertion that Labour members know little aboub finance, tliey have accepted in full the recommendation of the Commission. So I . again offer my sincere congratulations to the Treasurer. There is not a shadow of a doubt but that the right honourable gentleman, with others behind him, have, from their own point of view, Seen the necessity of undercutting, or, if they do not like that word, out-bidding the Labour party. They look upon the action of the Fisher Ministry last year, in deciding to assist Tasmania to the extent of £500,000, as having had some favourable result with the electors.",23
192,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,You are attributhind. ing motives.,23
193,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"They consider situation of such a nature that it is perative on their part to do something a similar direction, and they propose do it in such a way as to get the greatest possible credit, while giving ab the predirect sent time, and within their reasonable life, the least possible sum of money. intend to support the motion. I have not the slightest objection to the introconsideration, duction of the Bill . But I do take tion to the method adopted by the surer in endeavouring to secure kudos [ 6 8 ] -2 his party, and at the same time attempting to belittle what was done by his predecessors.",23
194,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,How did I do that? You had better explain what you mean.,23
195,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I do urge upon the right honourable gentleman, if he desires to do anything which he believes ought bo be done, to do it for what it is worth, and not for the sake of the kudos which he and his party will obtain therefrom - to do it without an attempt to depreciate what was done by his predecessors. Suppose he asserts now that he is conscientiously doing this thing, believing it to be right, noble, and national.",23
196,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I have said so.,23
197,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"If that be the case, why sliould not the right honourable gentleman grant to his predecessors a like situation, and believe that they last year, when they decided to commit the Commonwealth to an expenditure of £500,000, were acting in a similar manner",23
198,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I supported them.,23
199,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Rathe r than do what is being done-attempt in g to undercut the other party, and to depreciate the oue action while belauding the other ? If a comparison has to be made, it should be made, in my belief, in something like this way, namely, that the Fisher Administration committed the Commonwealth to assist Tasmania, on an average, to the extent of £50,000 a year for ten years; while the present Government propose to add to that assistance to the extent of £44,444 per year for nine years. If the Treasurer desires a comparison, he comes out in a somewhat weak position-at any rate, in a secondary posit i o n ; and, as there are only two in the race, he could not possibly be further beThat is the extent of the commitments that will be made under this prothe position. When we were inquiring into imthe financial conditions of this small in State-smal l in area, and, I am sorry to to say, small in statesmanship-w e found that it had been rather hard pressed. A request was made from the responsible Government for assistance from the I Commonwealth under section 96 of the Constitution. Taking that request into together with the geneexcepral condition of the State, the Royal TreaCommission unanimously approved of for a grant of £900,000 over a period of ten years, starting with a payment of £120,000, and gradually reducing the annual payment until, in the tenth year it would be £50,000. The Government of the day were unable to see their way clear to accept in full the recommendation of the Commission at that particular time , but they committed the Commonwealth to the extent which they thought it was advisable to do, while at the same time rendering material assistance to the little State. Their method of procedure was precisely opposite to that adopted by the present Administration. Peeling that at that time the greatest necessity of the State existed, they decided to make the largest payment during the firsb year, gradually reducing the amount during the period of ten years; or, in other words, last year the Fisher Administration were able to meet the situation to the extent of £95,000, gradually reducing the sum, so that, in the event of them being put out by any strange mischance in a national catastrophe, such as happened a little time ago, afc any rate their successors would not be too heavily committed. They themselves, feeling the necessity for that commitment, undertook to pay the largest possible sum, leaving the smallest possible amount to be provided by their successors. What is the position of the Treasurer and those who, with flare of trumpets aud flag waving, are dealing with this particular situation ? They propose to give to Tasmania, this year, the smallest possible sum (that they could give to that State, and to gradually in crease the amount, so that, if the political awakening comes within a reasonable time and they are removed from office, the heaviest commitments will have to be faced by their successors.",23
200,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"They are equalizing the payments, that is all.",24
201,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"When my honourable friend sits behind a Ministry who commit the Commonwealth to an expenditure, he, at any rate, ought to ask the Ministry to meet the heaviest possible items of it , and not to put that responsibility on the shoulders of somebody else. To-day, there are loud comments and: complaints-erroneous , misleading, grossly misrepresenting the situation-to the effect that the colossal expenditure about to be, or being, indulged in by the present Administration is due to commitments made by their predecessors. The statements are inaccurate; they are as incorrect as it is possible for statements to be. But here is a striking illustration of the way in which tliese honourable gentlemen do deliberately make the heavier commitments for their successors, whoever they may be. The presenfc Ministry are to pay, this year, £ 5 , 0 0 0; next year, when somebody else succeeds them, which, please God, they will in the best interests of this country, the new Ministry will have to find £15,000, and in the next year £25,000. If even, by a system of political jugglery, the present Government should remain in office three years-and it is inconceivable that political darkness will remain so long over the land that they could remain in office longer than that period-the y will have given to Tasmania £45,000; or, to put it in another way, less than half of what their predecessors gave to that State in one year. In these circumstances, I feel justified in continuing the comparison which the Treasurer started, and which honourable members on the other s'ide seek to belaud in such excessive terms. I happened to be a member of the Royal Commission which inquired into the circumstances of Tasmania, aud, naturally, I approve of the action which is being taken to comply full y with its recommendation. I think I am quite justified i u publicly offering my sincere congratulations to the honourable member for Bass, who was its Chairman.",24
202,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"How much did your Government pay ? Only £95,000 !",24
203,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Quite correct.,24
204,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"We l l ; what are you talking about? You have not paid any more than £ 9 5 , 0 0 0; that is not much.",24

The right honourable gentleman asks me, "" What did the Fisher Ministry pay?"" and he answers the question, "" Only £ 9 5 , 0 0 0 ."" That is quite correct-£95,00 0 in one year. My reply to the right honourable gentleman will be in the form of a question. What is he, the genius of finance to pay?-£5,000 . Sir .JOHN FORREST - No ; £90,000 year..",24

213,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"My right honourable friend asks; What did the previous A d ministration do? That Administration paid £95,000, while his Administration is to pay £5,000. And the right honourable gentleman asks me what I am talking about.",25
214,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"We have to yours, too.",25
215,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I am talking about a matter of finance, and I can understand tihe right honourable gentleman not understanding it , despite the newspaper belauding which is regularly done.",25
216,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,You are taking credit for what you did not pay.,25
217,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The - right honourable gentleman must not suppose that because he happens to have a few pounds' worth of the good things of this world he necesin sarily has a knowledge of finance. It not follow that the possession of wealth indicates the possession of brains or ability. He must not suppose that the chance which gave him a little wealth has added to his personal knowledge.. I was if making a statement when I was intermy rupted by the right honourable gentleman, and may I point out to him that while is regularly disposed to interrupt other honourable members, when he but a day two ago was reading his Budget speech, he port ? was so rude as to refrain from answering even ordinary questions which were to him with the view - of a little morei formation being obtained: lie was a mittee.

Tasmania is the gambling State of Australia. The institution known as Tattersall's, which was driven out of the other States by the force of public opinion, finds a resting-place there.

I congratulate the honourable member for I ts Govern- Bass on his success in putting before this Parliament the claims of Tasmania for assistance at the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament. I would also congratulate the honourable member for Denison who has ably supported him. The honourable member for Franklin, I suppose, deserves a little praise, but nothing like as much as do honourable members on this side of the House.",26
232,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Neve r min d the praise; give Tasmania the money.,26
233,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I mention these matters honourable because I want the people of Tasmania to credit where credit is due. At the last general election they certainly did not of give the honourable member for Bass the credit which was undoubtedly his due for his action in this matter. Apparently, Tasmania has no sense of gratitude.",26
234,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,It was his action in regard to the grant for Tasmania that,26
235,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"No . Because he did not in obtaining the full amount relike commended by the Royal Commission he was opposed. Indeed, I am led to ask whether we ought to make this further grant to people who can, apparently, be so miserably ungrateful. Tasmanians have not shown much gratitude. I think that the honourable member for Adelaide rightly emphasized the point that the Treasurer is trying to get the greatest possible credit at the least possible expense. There is nothing like an old dog for a hard road, and no doubt the righ t honourable gentleman has much perspicacity. When reading his Budget speech he would not reply to an interjection; but when the Leader of the Opposition was discussing the Budget, the right honourable gentleman was very anxious to obtain in formation from him by way of interjection, and demanded that it should be forthcoming. The proposed grant is to be extended over a period of years, so that the generosity of this Parliament will soon be forgotten. If Tasmania's gratitude is likely to materialize in the form of a few extra votes, the Treasurer will most likely exjjerience it at the next election. As the honourable member has pointed out, only £5,000 is to be paid in the first year. The Government propose to leave to their successors the payment of the bulk of this further grant of £400,000. We have had to discover this information for ourselves. But what does the Treasurer care about our request for information ? He says,"" We have a majority, and, with the exception of the honourable member for Werriwa, we have them well drilled, and we care nothing for the complaints of honourable members who ask for information."" Honourable members opposite throughout the country declared that the late Government spent millions of money "" like toffs,"" to. use the expression of the cultured gentleman who leads the present Government. In the circumstances, I ask the Treasurer how he can have the audacity to come here and ask for £400,000 as a grant for Tasmania, when he and his followers complained at the last elections of our financial extravagance, although the vote of £500,000 for Tasmania was a part of it t",26
236,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The late Government never paid it . They paid only £95,000, and left us to find the rest.",27
237,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The late Government, at all events, paid more than £5,000, which is the amount the present Treasurer proposes to pay. From the extraordinary method adopted by the Government in taking up Bills and then dropping them, we do not know whether the Treasurer really proposes to go through with this Bill ; but if , in the plenitude of time, it should get into Committee, I hope that the honourable member for Bass and other representatives of Tasmania will move that the larger payments be made first. I am sure that they have no wish that they should pass away before justice is done to the State they represent. It should be done right away, while the Commonwealth is in a prosperous condition. I do not suggest for a moment that I intend to support the Treasurer in the extraordinary naval expenditure which he proposes, and which, I hope, will never be carried by this Parliament. The right honourable gentleman proposes to vote £5,700,000 for the N a v y ; but he does not propose to pay honourable members the salary which was docked from them justbefore the last Federal elections. There would be a strike in most professions and trades if six or seven weeks' pay was stopped in the same way without any reason whatever. When we have millions of money to dispose of, justice should be done to members of this Parliament, and also to Tasmania; but that justice should be done at once; there should be no longdrawn-out payments to the people of a necessitous State. I make a final appeal to the Treasurer to give the Committee some information. Tact and courtesy are very necessary qualifications for a Minister, and the exercise of a littl e tact by the right honourable gentleman just now would greatly assist the passage of this Bill through Parliament. If the right honourable gentleman persists in his supercilious, sneering, and cynical attitude towards honourable members on this side, I suppose we shall have to p ut up with it ; but it will only hasten the downfall of the Government, which, no doubt, the public would be glad to see. I again congratulate my honourable friends from Tasmania upon their success in the carrying out of a thankless task for the benefit of ungrateful citizens.",27
238,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,They are not ungrateful.,27
239,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I have no wish to im peach the people of Tasmania; but certain individuals in that State have not a spark of gratitude in them. If the people of the State had their way, they would not be asking for this mouey.

The majority of the people of that State are grateful indeed to Fisher Government for the measure of tiiis justice given them, but a section of the people wished to have-it believed Fisher Government had robbed Tasmania of about £400,000. The majority of the people'of the State did not believe that, and notwithstanding the expenditure of large sums of money, and the strong op position brought against him, we find the-honourable member for Bass again turned with the respect of all sections the people, for his efforts in securing ' special grant.

I hope that honourable members ^generally will assist us to secure this money for Tasmania to enable over a very trying time, and that for this purpose' the Treasurer will see his way Dr MALONEY clear to give the State the this particular time.

There are quite a number of honourable members who are here for the and first time, and I am satisfied that the that more information which is given to them is the better it will be for Tasmania. When they become acquainted with the condithe tions under which that State is seeking grant, I feel certain there will be no opposition to her obtaining that justice that the which she so richly deserves.",28

That State has a lake in the centre of it from which, power could be transmitted folto any point, and yet the infamous laws at her which have operated {bhere have made that splendid little island a mendicant among the States. I am glad to know that Canaowing to the action of the late Government, and the efforts of the honourable member for Bass, Tasmania is to receive a grant of £900,000 during a period of ten years. That little island has been we do blessed, with a soil as black as coal, and the it possesses water-power second to none in Australia, and second only to New Zealand, south of the line. The Treasurer, notwithstanding his wonderful Budget- a Budget of boom, borrow, and burst-propose s to borrow £3,080,000, and offers to pay to Tasmania a paltry sum of £5,000 during the first year that this additional grant operate. Why does he not say that the Government will give Tasmania the whole additional £400,000 during that year ? If he will take up that attitude, he will be able to claim my vote. I do not believe in this cheese-paring policy under which Tasmania is to be granted £5,000 this year, £10,000 next year, and £15,000 the following year, thus leaving the bulk of the total grant provided' for in this Bill to be found by another Treasurer. Where is the brave old political warrior described by the Age to be discerned in a proposal of that sort? Does not Tasmania hold her own in mineral wealth ? Is not the north-west of that State known throughout the world for its mineral wealth ? Then from the stand-point of agricultural products, the land will grow anything. Honourable members may think that I am rather hard upon the Treasurer. But we all remember the unctuous tones in which he told us that £25,000,000 worth of minerals were being annually taken from the Commonwealth. Wliy, a little country only half the size of Tasmania takes for her produce every year no less a sum than £24,000,000 from Great Britain . That country is Denmark, where, during seven montlis of each year, people have to house their stock. In some parts of Tasmania the owners of stock have not to do that.",28
247,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Let the honourable member compare Victoria with Denmark.,29
248,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"But Victoria is so much larger that the comparison would not be fair. Denmark embraces an area of only 15,582 square miles, as against 26,215 square miles comprised in Tasmania; and yet the former obtains for her produce, each year, more than the total value of the gold output of Australia. What is the nature of that produce ? It consists of eggs, poultry', butter, Sic, all of which can be produced in Tasmania. Then, in the matter of f r u it , we know perfectly well that Tasmania oan produce apples equal to any produced in the world. She holds her own in the markets of the world, and sometimes leads the world in the high prices which she obtains for her apples. The Federal land tax will , I hope, open up a new era of prosperity in that l it t l e island. If I have spoken severely this afternoon, it is because the hand of the dead past is still controlling Tasmania in a way that it ought not to control her. Why this is to cheese-paring policy of granting to that State £5,000 during the current year out of the total of £400,000? The present Government were going to be very economical in their administration. They were going to teach the spendthrift Governments of the past how to administer the affairs of the country, notwithstanding that, the Fisher Government never borrowed a penny piece. In the face of all this, the Treasurer has' the audacity to ask Parliament to sanction a loan for £3,000,000, and to tell his Tasmanian supporters that the Government will grant that State £5,000 this year, and if they continue in office-£10,00 0 next year, and £15,000 during the t h i r d year. Such conduct is unworthy of the Government. At the instance of the Fisher Ministry, this Parliament granted Tasmania a sum of £500,000",29
249,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,To be spread over ten years.,29
250,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Then , under the Bill which the Government now seek to in troduce, at least, £40,000 should be paid to that State during the present year. Is not £5,000 a paltry sum to grant her, especially when the Treasurer is about to borrow £3,000,000 ? If the righ t honourable gentleman will borrow another £500,000 and pay this £400,000 to Tas- ' mania at once, I will vote for the proposal. I wish that little island State every success, and I am sorry that it has been in the Slough of Despond for years. I ask the honourable member for Franklin to bring a little influence to bear upon the Treasurer.",29

He knows that, under the resolution passed during last Parliaaway. ment, and made one of our standing orders, an honourable member is precluded from speaking longer than a certain time, aud that no ""stone-walling"" can take i u those circumstances. I maintain that last session honourable members voted away tlieir privileges to a very large tent. But the point I was about to when the Treasurer interrupted me was that I would not be surprised if , instead of the schedule in the Bill to be intromoney duced being based upon that which we find recorded in the Budget speech, discussion that has taken place noon will reverse the order of things, and instead of the smaller sum of £5,000 being paid to Tasmania in the first year, it will be £80,000, dwindling future years to the £5,000. I am certain that if the honourable member for turned it down. Franklin desired a friend to be helpful, and that friend came forward, and offered him a mean little sum, though he required a larger sum, the honourable member would say, "" You are not the kind friend I took you to be."" Yet that is attitude of the present Ministry towards honourable members representing Tasmania, and towards Tasmania itself. I hope the schedule will be altered. The matter of granting assistance to Tasmania is not new. As far back as 1903, appeals for assistance to Tasmania were made in both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament hy the then honourable members representing Tasmania. I take it that Tasmania was then beginning to feel the effects of the first Tariff Bill , and the effect of a small State entering into a large Union, which must be considerable in the initial stages of that Union's history. From time to time, I presume, during 1903, honourable members representingTasmania urged on the Treasurer of the day that some assistance should be granted to Tasmania, but evidently their appeals fell on deaf ears for many years. The present Treasurer occupied the same honourable position in previous Governments, and Sir George Turner and othersfor have filled the position, but to all the appeals made by Tasmanian representatives, Fusion or Liberal Governments turned a interrupts, the deaf ear.",30

He must have turned up the records in Hansard, and in the parliamentary papers, and been thoroughly satisfied, as a member of that Royal Commission, before that paragraph was incorporated in the report. The paragraph shows that, as far back as 1903, some reference had been made to the financial position of Tasmania owing to the operation of the Tariff.

My only complaint is that the Treasurer is making the first instalment of the proposed grant too small. The little State of Tasmania came into the Union without claiming any special treatment, and for many years suffered immense loss. In the country from which I came, States which found themselves embarrassed had not to declare themselves paupers; they had not to beg of the Federation for assistance. The Treasurers helped them indirectly, without letting the world know. ""When the population of those States increased, and prosperity set in , they again assumed the position of substantial integral portions of the Unio n on an honorary basis.",32
290,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"In America senator can propose an appropriation. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Necessitou s States never have to ask for an appropriation. The American people recognise that part of a nation cannot be bankrupt without it affecting the credit of the whole nation. That was not recognised before the war, because then America was only a half-Union country, some persons thinking it a Confederation, and others a Federation. The submission of the case by the South to the arbitrament of war settled the question, and made a great Union . Ever since, the States have stood by each other; all for each and each for all.

If it were able to borrow at a reasonable rate for the construction of reproductive works, it would have a larger revenueto expend.",33
293,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Tasmani a is quite satisfied with what we are doing. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Perhaps she is, but I have the right to express my views, and I have had some experience in finance. My remarks are not due to any enmity towards the Treasurer. am not trying to drive poisoned arrows into his cranium. But I have a proposition to make. I am more of a business man than I am of a politician. I do not know much about politics, and I want to know less. But I know a little about business. If the first instalment were increased, the Commonwealth would be committed to the later instalments. But if the first payment is only £5,000, a subsequent Government, or even this Government, may decline to go on with the grant. If you get a deposit of only a few shillings in regard to a contract, you may find the contractor dropping his work, and it is the same with this matter. I have brought the subject before the Treasurer already, this being no new any idea with me. If we cannot get £40,000 for the first instalment, we might perhaps get £30,000. This would enable Tasmania to go into the market and borrow sufficient to build a railway to Balfour, and to extend the line from Flowerdale into the interior. It will not be denied thatTasmania has suffered financially. A r e we to understand that the Royal Commission, with the honourable member for Bass as Chairman, and with all grades, and degrees, and kinds of Christians that composed it , made a unanimous recommendation which it did not want to have carried into effect? Its report was the first unanimous report from a Royal Commission that has ever been laid before this House, and it recommended a grant of £900,000. I have always been in favour of that recommendation being complied with. If I had not the been Treasurer I would bave paid the year, money in the morning, and there would have been no talk about the matter. L et the little State get the money in such a way that we shall know it is there for all time. I have no ill-feeling in the matter. If the Treasurer cannot, or will not, give way, we hope that he will think over our suggestion. Even if he should decide to give only £25,000, at any rate, let him give that which will mean a commitment of £400,000.  tend to support the Government in this matter, because one cannot look a g if t horse in the mouth and ask how old the horse is, as long as he will carry one. The proposal of the Government means that the Tasmanian Government are to get from the Commonwealth £90,00 0 a I year u n t il a total sum of £900,000 is paid. That is a nice little nest-egg for the State to have coming in every year. I think it is justly entitled to the money, because its representatives on both sides of the Chamber have convinced me that, as regards trading concerns, the State is only a suburb of Melbourne. "" d r u m m e r s "" from Melbourne",33
294,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Why should you refer in such a disparaging manner to commercial men ?  They "" drum "" the State from one end to the other. Tasmania is in this position, that it cannot hold its own like the other States can do. These "" drummers"" have to go to other States because the competition is so keen; but in Tasmania that is not the case. It is very easy for the "" d r u m m e r s "" to get across Bass Strait, and now the Postmaster-General has promised a daily service with Tasmania it will be still harder for the State to hold its own against the Flinders-lane people.",34
295,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"And the people of Yorkstreet, Sydney, because they do a big business with Tasmania.  bourne are taking trade away from Tasmania. We cannotshut our eyes to that fact. If we take the trade away, I say lhat the rest of the Commonwealth should come to the aid of Tasmania, and make up what it is losing.",34
296,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"You Flinders-lane people for doing business, do you?  that we should allow the Tasmanians to be crushed out of existence by Victorian or New South Wales people.",34
297,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The best way to avoid that is to give them a good amount in the initial years.  to save Tasmania from being crushed to make that State a province of Victoria.,34
298,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,No fear !,34
299,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It s population is only a third of that of Melbourne.,34
300,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Order !  the Government have arranged the amount of the payments to be made. I is not a question of paying £5,000 i the first year, £15,000 in the second and £25,000 in the third year.",34
301,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"It is, and because Bill.  concerned, that is absolutely correct.",34
302,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"They are trading on the good-will of the last Government.  These so small, are we?",34
303,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"We want to give a bigger sum.  so small because the Government have brought forward this proposal, are we ? I said, in the first place, that Tasmania sbould have got the £900,000 ; in fact, I do not think it is enough. If these factories were in good going order in Tasmania, instead of in Victoria and New South Wales, where they are doing a big business, they would have to pay in come tax, and the wages of the employees would be paid in Tasmania.",34
304,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"And land tax, too.  all taxation, no matter 'from what source it might come. Tasmania would get the benefit of the manufacturers paying the taxes, the benefit of the people consuming the different goods which were manufactured there, and the benefit of the people spending the wages earned in the State. What benefit does it get out of the wages that are earned in New South Wales or Victoria ? That is the only way in which we could equalize things. I do not blame do not see anything in the Bill to cavil at. In fact, I am very pleased indeed that the Government have done something in this direction. I , in common with honourable members on each side of the House, would have liked to see the anuual payments made larger, but, as I said before, the Government are only equalizing the payments so that Tasmania shall get £90,000 a year.",34
305,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Mak e it £100,000 or is £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0; that would be better.  manian Government will not grumble, however much honourable members may make the sum.",34
306,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I think that the payment should be made in such proportions as to full y agree with the recommendar ; and tion of the Royal Commission.  t amounts are which are to be given by the n present Government,' do not honourable year, members think that they would be smaller ir we carried what some honorof this able members suggest, and that is to make the larger payments today, which, l is at present, are arranged to be made in ten years? If we were to. adopt that suggestion, the Government might throw the Bill under the table, and so in trying to grasp a shadow we would lose the substance,",34
307,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"They do not do that.  thing in the world for the Government to do it , and to throw upon us the onus of having compelled them to put the Bill on one side. If honourable members from Tasmania will take my advice, they will vote for this proposal in to to-tak e the £90,000 a year for certain-instea d of grasping at a shadow in the - hope of getting something larger. There is the position as it appears to me. Of course, the Government have made their commitments, just the same as other Governments have made theirs.",35
308,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"No provision is made in the Estimates for even' £5,000. ",35
309,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"We know that, but it is proof that this is a sudden idea. ",35
310,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Tlier e is no provision in the Estimates for a penny.  does not prove that the Government have not had this thing in their mind's eye.,35
311,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Does it not prove that the Government are not sincere?  sible view, and that is that the Government are making this proposal for political purposes. Could we not be accused of doing the same thing last session when we voted £500,000 for Tasmania ? Do my honourable friends mean to say that we did not do that for political purposes? perish the thought! Let us be fair; let us treat the thing squarely. We did not give Tasmania that £500,000 without any thought that we were going to get a quid pro quo.",35
312,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"That is nonsense.  the honourable member; that is the ideal we would expect from the honourable member for Parkes. Suppose that we are the meanest party on the face of the earth, and are doing this thing for political purposes, is not Tasmania going to gain ? That is the only thing which concerns me, Tasmania, as the honourable member for Melbourne said, is one of the fairest Stabes in the Union, but she is the most severely handicapped one. My vote will go in the direction of accepting what the Government are willing to give. I will not look a g if t horse in the mouth. If the Government are prepared to give £400,000 to Tasmania, I , for one, intend dare t.o to vote - in favour of that proposal, especially when the Government have planned it so that Tasmania is to get £90,000 a year from the Commonwealth for a certain period.",35
313,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Bass) [5-27] - I desire to congratulate the Government upon bringing down this proposal, and, ou behalf of Tasmania, to thank bhem for complying wibh the recommendation of the Royal Commission which was appointed to inquire into its financial position since Federation. As a representative of that State, I resenb the action of any honourable member in classifying it as a necessitous State.",35
314,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That was the appeal.,35
315,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"It was not the appeal altogether. The recommendation was made, not on the ground of Tasmania being a necessitous State, but because of Tasmania having losb a certain sum annually since the inception of Federation, by the operation of Federal laws.  the hilt. ",35
316,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Certainly . I hope that Tasmania will not be referred to again as a necessitous State, or as accepting this money as a charity dole.",35

318,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,Tasmani a is entitled to every penny of it .,35
319,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"As a necessitous State, No, yes.",35
320,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"No , as a matter of justice from one State to another, under a Federation.",35
321,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I know that you would take a lot more for Tasmania if you could get it .,35
322,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order !,35
323,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"The Treasurer was a member of the Select Committee that commenced the inquiry into the position of Tasmania, and afterwards of the Royal Commission, but through having to go to London he resigned his seat on the Oommission. I feel sure that had he participated in the inquiry, and had the pleasure of examining witnesses, he would have fallen in with the other members of the Commission, and become a willing signatory to the recommendation.",35
324,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Do you say that a pleasure to examine some of the witnesses I,36
325,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Ye s it was, and especially to the honourable member, who had many a j o y f ul hour.",36
326,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Anyho w we had the in opimeter system explained to us.,36
327,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Yes , thoroughly. congratulate the Government upon their proposal to give Tasmania £900,000, but I wish to point out that they are not entirely carrying out the recommendations of the Commission. If they will do that, as I desire they should, it will make a difference to Tasmania straight away. The Commission recommended that £900,000 should be paid during the following ten years. We recommended, for instance, that in the year 1911-12 the State should get £120,000, but the Fisher Administration awarded only £95,000. Now the present Government are in power, and our award was that the State should receive £115,000 this year, but instead of that it is to get only £90,000. £85,000 under the Act passed by the Fisher Government, and £5,000 from the present Government. As Chairman of the Royal Commission, I would ask the Government to carry out our recommendation in its entirety by paying this money in the instalments which we suggested. If Tasmania is entitled to this grant, as she certainly is, in my opinion, she has a right to receive it ^.s soon as possible. If the Treasurer will promise to carry out our recommendations in this regard, I shall sit down at once, and make no reference to the unkind things said about me and my party at the last general election. The Tasmanian press then denounced me in the most scandalous way for being associated with the Labour party, and allowing Tasmania, as they said, to go to the dogs. They tried to take from me the little kudos due to me for my action in securing the appointment of the Commission. They made malicious and treacherous statements concerning our party, even going so far as to criticise the way in which the ex-Speaker and the ex-Chairman of Committees controlled the business of the Chamber. They asserted that I had jockeyed the honourable member for Wilmo t out of the credit of being the first to place on the business-paper n notice of motion regarding Tasmania's fin.ncial position. But I say now, in it was front of the honourable member, that until the present session he never had on the business-paper a notice of motion with regard to this matter.",36
328,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,I have uever said that I had.,36
329,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"But the honourable member saw the press scandalising ine, I and was not man enough to contradict their statements.",36
330,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,I did; I gave the honourable member fair play throughout the campaign.,36
331,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"During the recent campaign the Labour Government and its supporters were classed with robbers the and thieves for their action in regard to Tasmania - Notwithstanding that the then Prime Minister, the honourable member for Wide Bay, stated from the public platform that if he saw that Tasmania was in need of more money he would bring in a Bill to grant the full amount recommended by the Commission, members of the State Ministry were mean enough to denounce our party as robbers and thieves, who were doing an injustice to Tasmania. I am here to praise the Government for the action they are now' taking) but I am here also to defend my party from malicious attacks such as tliose to w l i c h it was subjected during the last election. I shall reserve until the second-reading stage the further remarks that I desire to make in regard to this matter, and shall conclude by congratulating the Government on their proposal to grant Tasmania the balance of the amount which the Royal Commission recommended she should receive.",36
332,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Wilmot) [5.35] - I should not have spoken but for the remarks made by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. The honourable member suggested that I allowed the statement to go forth that he had jockeyed me out of the honour of being the first to introduce a motion regarding a Commonwealth grant to Tasmania.,36
333,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,When we leach the second-reading stage I shall give the honourable meinber all that was said.,36
334,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The Prime M in ister will not allow many hours to be given to the consideration of the motion for the second reading.,36
335,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"What the honourable member for Bass states in regard to the press criticism to which he was subjected may be quite true, but on many occasions during the last election campaign I explained to my audiences what was the actual position in regard to this matter. I never laid claim to having placed on the busineBs-paper a notice of motion with respect to a grant to Tasmania.",36
336,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Hear , hear. I am quite satisfied with that statement.",37
337,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Indeed , I rarely alluded to the matter unless it cropped up in the course of one of my meetings. I certainly never attempted to rob the honourable member of the credit which is his due, and I am quite willing now to give him every credit for the way in which he handled the Commission.",37
338,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) ,[5.38] - I object to the statement made by the Treasurer that the Prime Minister wil l not allow many liours to be devoted to the consideration of the niotion for the second reading of this Bill . It was not a proper statement to make.",37

We know quite well that the Treasurer and his colleagues are capable of decepstarted tion in every form, and I wish to learn whether this is merely a political move on their part? Is this Bill being introduced merely with the object of advertising Tasmania a desire on the part of this Government to spoon-feed that State to an even greater extent tlian the late Governtous ment did? I objected to the grant of £500,000 proposed by the Fisher Governto ment, not because I did not want Tasmania mania to get justice, but because, after carefully considering the report of Royal Commission, I thought it was clearly proved that, during the ten years following the establishment of Federacould tion, the island State, at the very most, had not lost more than £120,000 by reason of Customs leakages.",37
342,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Owing way in which the business was transacted in connection with the Iuter-State certificate system, no one could say what was the actual loss.",37
343,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Then Tasmania was really getting her deserts, because it was a Tasmanian genius who was responsible for the "" B r a d d o n b l o t "" under which it was almost impossible, save at very great cost, to adopt such a bookkeeping system as would enable us to keep a proper check over Inter-State transfers. Whilst Tasmania has undoubtedly lost something as the result of Federation', no one can say that her losses have amounted to £900,000.",37
344,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Accordin g to the Royal Commission, the most she could claim in respect of Customs leakages was £10,000 a year, or £70,000 in all.",37

I simply did what I believed going to be justice. that, Mr MATHEWS - To my mind, the honourable member was very friendly to",37

349,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I do not know about that, but the report shows that the in Commission recommended a grant of £900,000, not to make good Customs leakages, but because Tasmania was a necessiState. Later on, the Premier of Tasmania had not the manliness to appeal this Parliament for assistance to Tasas a necessitous State, but in a roundabout way applied for something the which he seemed to think Tasmania had a riglit to receive. He applied for a grant which he thought, apparently, he obtain from the Fisher Government, backed up by the three representatives of Tasmania on this side of the House, who, if they had had the chance, to the would have robbed the rest of Australia, not of £500,000, but of £5,000,000, in order to give it to Tasmania. The cry of the horse-leech's daughter for more, more, more, was nothing as compared with the demands of these three honourable members.",37

I doubt whether the population of Tasand mania is as great as that of my electorate alone; yet she has five representatives this House and six in another place.

The obvious. trouble with Tasmania is that, ever since she obtained responsible government, she Prime Minister on these questions. has been owned and controlled by the greatest Tories that the English system could produce in any community.

They had their direct representatives in the State Parliament, and by legislation the most Conservative character they blocked the progress of the country. is hardly an acre of bad land in Tasmania; her agricultural resources are very great, deal with them. and her mineral possibilities are enormous; but the reason why they have not been "" developed, and she is obliged to come here that. and ask for a further grant from the Commonwealth, is that she has been by Tories since she has enjoyed responmembers sible government. I am not one of those who belittle their opponents, and I credit anything. the present Federal Government with being fairly long-sighted. that the day of the Tory in the State liament is almost past. The writing is on the wall. The past elections shown that in a State in which, seven eight years ago, there was not a single representative of Labour in the local liament, there are today fourteen Labour representatives out of a total of t h i r t y . The Government can see that, in the very near future, the Tory party must pass, and a Labour Government assume concism ? t r o l .

The Treasurer is aware that crusted old Tories, like himself, have, so far, had the well-being of Tasmania in their hands. Honourable members on the Government benches have howled against the terrible increase of wages, and we know that in Tasmania the lowest wages ruling in any part of the Commonwealth are paid.

During the last few years, the Victorian miners who went over to that State formed the Miners Association, and wrested their rights from the Tories of the State. There is scarcely auy trade or calling in which the wages in Tasmania are not less by shillings per day than those paid on the mainland.

They are endeavouring: - I to convince the people of Australia that they lean towards ""the weaker States. This Bill is merely another political f t the dodge. I do not say that it constitutes corruption, but it certainly goes so close to it that one can scarcely distinguish between the two things.

As far as I can see, thero is nothing in this copy of Hansard which has been handed to me that requires any answer. This is an old game of the Treasurer when he is in a difficult position. He looks up Hansard, but even then he cannot read it . The .division to which he refers had nothing whatever to do with the main principle at stake.",41
397,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,The honourable member had better put Hansard away. Do not quote it .,41
398,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I would not be allowed to do so by the Chairman.,41
399,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Did the member see the reply the Government gave to Senator Bakhap only a few weeks ago?,41
400,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"On the I3th August last, Senator Bakhap, in another place, asked the Minister representing the Prime Ministert f it is the intention of the Government to take into consideration at an early date the matter of giving full effect to the financial recommendations embodied in the report of the Royal Commission- Mr Jensen, M.H.R., Chairman-ap pointed to inquire into the incidence of Commonwealth Customs taxation as affecting the Stale of Tasmania? And Senator Millen, the Defence, repliedThe Government is not prepared to review this arrangement, which has still eight years to run.",41
401,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The acid has been put on since then.,41
402,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"At that date, they had no intention of giving a penny, and not even of reviewing the matter.",41
403,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I have been twitted with having changed my opinion in fchree years, which is not correct; but how about a Government that changes its policy in six weeks? What has brought about the change? Has the honourable member for Franklin been putting the acid on the Government, and telling M i nisters that his vote depends on this £400,000 ? Mi . 1 LAIRD SMITH - The honourable member for Bass had a motion on the notice-paper which would have been carried. said is Mr Webster - If Ministers were consistent statesmen, they would not go back on their Minister of Defence in six weeks.",41
404,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The question was asked on notice, so the Cabinet must have considered it .",41
405,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"It was not Senator Millen's reply. On a matter involving a big expenditure, it must have been the reply of the Treasurer. Now we find the honourable member for Franklin smiling at the power which he exercises over the Government.",41
406,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"But we have a majority of six on this Bill , seeing that we shall get the support of three Tasmanians who sit in Opposition.",41
407,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The honourable member need not trouble about the majority for this Bill . I shall vote for it ; but honourable in Committee I shall move to double the amount. Seeing that I can getno answer from the Treasurer, who sits like something on a pedestal too high for honourable members to appeal to him for an explanation as to why he gave Senator Millen instructions to give that reply to Senator Bakhap, I would like to know from the Attorney-General what has happened since the 13th August to bring about this change of opinion. The answer given by Senator Millen conveys more than appears on the surface. This change of front shows that the Government; are determined to hang on to the Minister of flesh-pots of office afc the sacrifice of any principle, or any decision. They cannot expect us to swallow it without protest. If they carry on like this, their supporters will have a great deal to answer for. Whether the Treasurer cares to reply or not, or whether the Attorney-General sits with a placid and self-satisfied air, matters l it t l e ; individual members of the M in isterial party, when they get on the platform, and the electors put the acid on them and ask why they have supported a Government that changes its mind in six weeks, what can they say? All they can say is, "" We do not know why the Government did it , but you sent us in to support that Government whether they did right or wrong, and we have done what you told us to do, and have carried these measures, believing we were carrying out your behest."" What confidence can we place in the measures placed before the House by a Government prepared to say one thing today and another thing tomorrow ? Is it fair to ask honourable members to take a blank cheque from a Government that do not know their own mind ? Is it fair, as a matter of common, decent dealing 1 Was the Postmaster-General a party to giving this reply to Senator Bakhap ? I hear not a word from him. The Treasurer says he put something in the Budget relating to this matter, but we cannot mix up the Budget with this question. The two things do not run on the same lines.",41
408,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Tber e is nothing in the Estimates; they have not even made provision for the £5,000. Apparently, they had not considered the matter when they were drawing up the Estimates.",42
409,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,What point 1,42
410,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,It is a strong point. Why did not the Treasurer put this in the Estimates ?,42
411,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,Probably he afraid you would learn all about it .,42
412,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"So we have it from the Postmaster-General that the ""Government did not wish us to know about this matter. I shall lose confidence in the Postmaster-General if he attempts to tell me Ministers are trying to fool honourable members while they are introducing serious legislation. Is the honourable member for Franklin instrumental causing the Government to change their views on this important question 'I",42
413,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,No .,42
414,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The credit must belong to representatives of Tasmania on the Opposition side-to those who fought for the first £500,000. Apparently, i u order to escape trouble in the future, Ministers thought they could cause these honourable members to relent somewhat in their opposition if they satisfied the report of the Royal Commission to the full . It is pleasing to know that Senator Kakhap got that admission from Senator Millen. Some do not realise what they are doing in asking questions of Ministers. Could Senator Millen dream that the Government would go back on him ?",42
415,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7..1-5 p.m.,42
416,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I desire to correct, in the few minutes that are left to me, a wrong impression that may have been created by something that occurred before the dinner adjournment. The honourable member for Franklin referred to an amendment that he moved when the Bill of the last Government was in Committee, increasing the grant to Tasmania by £70,000. I voted for the grant proposed by the Government, namely, £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0; but I did not vote for his amendment, because I understood that it was merely a political manoeuvre, and I was not to be caught. I claim credit for not being trapped by that amendment, just as I claim credit for giving relief to Tasmania by voting for the original proposition of the Fisher Government. I hope that when the Treasurer is in charge of another Bill he will take honourable members into his confidence, and tell us what it contains, instead of compelling us to a great find out, as best we can, for ourselves. The right honourable gentleman is always magnanimous, except when he is introducing a Bill ; and if , at such times, he showed a little courteous condescension, was and gave us a little information, his work would be much easier. The Government, I understand, propose to give to Tasmania this year a paltry £ 5 , 0 0 0 ; but no provision is made for the expenditure on the anything Estimates, so what guarantee have we that the money will be paid? I have already pointed out* that the Minister of Defence, in another place, told Senator Bakhap that it was not intended to increase the grant to Tasmania, because the arrangein ment made by the Fisher Government had eight years to run . When a Government are so lost to all sense of what is right and just that they will , within six weeks, go back on a statement, and declare black to be white, and white to be no colour at all, it cannot be expected that honourable members will readily accept their promises. Those who have big responsibilities on their shoulders should not perform their duties in the slip-shod way which the Treasurer follows in introducing measures. I trust that this will be the last time that I shall have to speak on the subject. Honourable members opposite envy my freedom in this respect. They are like dumb-stricken brutes, unable to speak. They are muzzled.",42
417,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The honourable member's time has expired. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported and adopted. Ordered That Sir John Forrest and Mr W. H . Irvine do prepare and bring in a Bill to carry foregoing resolution. Bill presented by Sir JOHN FORREST, the Katherine River. and read a first time. LOAN BILL. In CommiUee (Consideration of nor-General's message):",42
418,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Swan-Trea - last surer) [7.53] - I move That it is expedient that an appropriation of moneys be made for the purposes an Act to authorize the raising and expending of the sum of ^3,080,000 for certain purposes. The motion is preliminary to the introduction of a Loan Bill , which will be presented and read a first time as soon as this stage has been passed, and during the second reading and Committee stages there will be ample opportunity to discuss the proposals contained in the measure. I explained the measure, and gave the items of the schedule in my Budget speech, and it appears in Hansard. But, as it seems to be the desire of honourable members that I should reiterate what I bave already said, and add something more about the Bill at this stage, I am prepared to do so. When delivering my Budget speech, said that the Commonwealth expenditure had grown so large that it was no longer possible to pay for all public works out of revenue, and that it would be necessary to meet part of the expenditure from loan funds. The works to be provided for in this way are all of a permanent character, and such as are properly chargeable to loan funds. Those who have been members of State Parliaments will have had experience of measures of this kind. The first work that is to be provided for in this way is the railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, for which it is proposed to borrow £1,400,000. I have been informed that about £1,500,000 w i ll be required for that railway during the present financial year, and as there is a balance from last year in hand, we shall have sufficient authorization for the current year.",43
419,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,How far will the railway be taken with this expenditure?,43
420,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The honourable memher is aware that the estimated cost of the whole line is about £4,000,000, and I should say that this authorization should complete about 350 miles. We propose to borrow another £400,000 for out the the construction of a railway in the Northern Territory, from Pine Creek to The survey of a route for the line was sanctioned by the last Parliament, and in making arrangements for the construction of the railway Goverthis Government is carrying out an undertaking practically approved by the Parliament. I believe that the length of the line will be about 60 miles, and its construction will probably cost not more of a Bill for than £5,000 a mile.",43
421,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"That line ought to be built for £4,000 a mile.",43
422,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Suppos e that the cost will be £4,000 a mile, that amount will take the railway 100 miles, at any rate.",43
423,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Is it intended to use steel or powellized sleepers?,43
424,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I have heard thab it is intended to use steel sleepers, but the Minister of Home Affairs will be able to give information on that point.",43
425,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The railways are all under one Department.,43
426,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I think that the working railways are in the control of the Northern Territory AdminisI tration, which is under the External Affairs Department. The next item is one for the construction of a railway of about twenty miles in length from Port Moresby, in Papua, to Astrolabe, and the erection of wharfs at' Port Moresby and Samarai. It is bebeved that a railway between those two points will greatly assist agricultural development, as well as the copper mines which exist in the district to be served.  be consbructed ?",43
427,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I should bhink that it will be built on a narrow gauge, because ib will braverse an isolated country, and can never be connected with any other railway system. I do not know the width of the gauge which is to be adopted, but I should say that it will probably be 3 ft. 6 in.",43
428,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Has a survey for the railway been made yet?,43
429,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Not so far as. I am aware.,43
430,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Surely you going to build a railway without making a survey?,44
431,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"We could not, of course, build the line until we made a survey.",44
432,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"You will not want this money, then ?",44
433,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Yes , we will. Tins is an appropriation only for the purpose of the railway, and the money will be raised and spent as it is required. We could not enter into an arrangement to build the line unless we had a vote authorizing us to make a survey and generally to prepare to carry out the work. That is the ordinary way. Before the Government can build a railway or any other great public work, it must get parliamentary sanction for the expenditure before it undertakes the work itself, otherwise it might undertake a work for which there was no money legally available, or commence a work of which Parliament might not approve afterwards.",44
434,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,A survey may prove that the proposed railway cannot be built.,44
435,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"That cannot be the case. We have had reports on this proposal. It was considered by the previous as well as the present Government. When we took office it was. ready for action. We are taking action now. We are informed that the construction of the line is necessary, and that it will, do great good in opening up the country. Therefore, we are making provision so that Parliament can approve of our commencing operations and carrying out the work. The next item is one of £170,000 for the purchase of land for postal and telegraphic purposes.",44
436,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Will not honourable they receded from that position. members be satisfied with this general statement ?,44
437,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"All this in - a formation will be given in detail when we get to the second-reading stage of. Bill. The Postmaster-General will tell honourable members about the proposed penditure on land for post-offices, and the proposed expenditure on conduits for layto the Fleet. ing wires underground. The Honorary Minister will explain the expenditure defence generally, and on machinery machine shops, and the construction of wharfs at Cockatoo Island, at a cost of £175,000; and the Minister of Home Affairs will indicate the expenditure are not railways, while the expenditure in regard to the London Offices will be explained by the Minister of External Affairs. I do not think it is expected of me, at this stage, to go into details of all these matters. I am quite willing, indeed anxious, to give any information I possess; but I really think that that is not necessary at this time, as I am merely asking for leave to introduce the measure. If honourable members think that these works are such as will conduce to the prosperity and advancement of the country, I ask them to give me leave to introduce the Bill , and on its second reading I shall give all details, and in Committee still further details.",44
438,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Is a sinking f u n d provided ?,44
439,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Unde r the Inscribed Stock Act , a £ per cent, sinking fund is provided for in respect of all loans raised by the Commonwealth Government. I do not think that I need say any more at this stage.",44
440,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide) [8.7] - We are asked to approve of a motion, that being the preliminary step towards approving of the Government borrowing to the extent of £3,080,000. The loan mania is still strong in the Fusion breast. When previously in office honourable members opposite attempted to borrow £3,500,000 for the purpose of building a Fleet; but that policy, they found Out, was not tenable, and, with that .peculiar ability which, I believe, characterizes certain American politicians, and which is indicated in the coupletA marciful Providunce fashioned us holler O' purpose thet we might our principles swaller. On this occasion tliey do not propose to borrow for fleet-building purposes. As matter of fact, it is difficult to find out whether they intend to make any addithe tions to our Fleet, either by borrowing or in any other way, although I remember exthe Prime Minister's statement, when before the electors, in respect of additions At that time he possibly felt it necessary to say something as a on counterpoint to what was said by the and party on this side of the House. But, so far as the Fleet is concerned, I have not yet been able to discover whether it is the intention of the Government to on proceed with additions, or merely to complete the first unit now in hand, and then have a period of calm.",44
441,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is raised in this measure, is it?",45
442,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"It is not quite raised in this measure, hut the question of loans, as indicated previously when the honourable gentleman was in office, is raised in that we find that the Government propose to borrow for other than Fleet purposes. I merely instance this in order to show that the germ of borrowing is still running in a most lively way through the honourable gentleman's arteries, and apparently breaks out in various directions.",45
443,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We are looking for the germ you laid down.,45
444,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I do not suggest' that, because of the opposition which may come from the honourable member for Werriwa, they should be vaccinated in any way in order to k i ll this germ. Nevertheless, it has broken out afresh. We find that the Government propose to borrow for certain purposes. The Prime Minister will not object to my making it clear that honourable members opposite, with their Ministry, propose to spend every penny which they estimate to receive during the current year. amounts to £21,462,000. Honourable gentlemen on the other side practically contested the elections on the point of economy. Their complaints and their allegations respecting the espenditure in dulged in by the previous Administration were loud and long, and the ear of the public was tickled, as also were a very large number of persons frightened, by th© references to colossal expenditure. "" Torrential,"" for instance, was the word used by the Attorney-General to describe the expenditure. The Prime Minister said we had indulged in "" a financial carnival."" Being himself a political coryphee, that would appeal naturally to him. And the Treasurer used a different word entirely. He said that we had indulged in "" a financial debauch."" Those were the three principal words with whioh the publio were alarmed, and with which it is reasonable to believe honourable gentlemen frightened a number of electors into voting otherwise than they might have done. On this occasion, the Government propose to spend every penny they conceive will be brought in-£21,462,000 . Not satisfied with that' situation, honourable gentlemen opposite-and this indicates the hollowness a.nd the sham of their utterances at the general elections-propos e to expend the comfortable little nest-egg we left hardlythem amounting to no less than £2,652,000. That is in addition to the money which they estimate they will receive.  did you leave in the way of commitments which have to be met?",45
445,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"For instance, we did not leave the additional debt to which the Treasurer committed us this afternoon-£400,000 . I can name a lot if the honourable member desires me to do so.",45
446,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Can you not get all this in on the Budget ?,45
447,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"On the Budget, I intend to deal in detail with matters of this description; but these are just general references for the special edification of the Prime Minister, who was most prolific in his allegations respecting expenditure on this side, and who was particularly acute- I might almost say cunning-in his innuendoes concerning the expenditure by the previous Administration . He lef t much to the imagination and to the fears of the electors. Whilst on several occasions we were able to catch him makThat ing reasonably definite statements, and to prove conclusively that they were inaccurate, the honourable gentleman was fairly ready in denying the accuracy of reports of his speeches which appeared in his own party newspapers. In addition to spending every penny that they estimate to receive, as well as the surplus of £2,652,000 which we lef t them, these honourable members, who sought the suffrages of the people on statements that they were going to put a safe check upon, and to reduce, the expenditure of the Commonwealth, now propose to borrow a further sum of £3,080,000. If an expenditure of £22,000,000 in round figures was, as they allege, either "" torrential,"" a "" financial carnival,"" or a "" financial debauch,"" ou our part, how shall we characterize this proposed expenditure of £27,000,000 by the present Administration?",45
448,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,We must honour our predecessors' promises.,45
449,Mr AHERN,Unknown,They would not pay them.,45
450,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Parkes insinuates that it is essential that all these expenditures should be undertaken, and the honourable member for Indi , who is a past master in the art of misrepresentation, suggests that if our predecessors had made commitments, we would not meet them if we were in office. Both statements are incorrect.",45
451,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,The Lahour party would meet them with more taxation.,46
452,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,The honourable member is again in error. We sought the suffrages of the people on the clear statement that we did not intend to increase taxation.,46
453,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I thin k not.,46
454,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"The honourable member - for Wide Bay said he intended to propose higher Protection, and if that does not mean increased taxation, I should like to know what does.",46
455,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,We went to the country with the clear and distinct statement that we did not propose to impose any fresh taxation.,46
456,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I statement put in that way.,46
457,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Does the Prime M in ister say that we intended to impose more taxation ?,46
458,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I have that.,46
459,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,High e r duties were distinctly promised.,46
460,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Whil e the irresponsible member for Parkes will make statements as to our imposing fresh taxation, the Prime Ministeiw ill not. should like to ask the Prime Minister whether he supports the honourable member for Parkes in the contention that a revision of the Tariff would mean extra taxation ? If that is so, my retort is that honourable members opposite, the honourable member for Werriwa alone excepted, are equally committed. A r e we to understand that if the present Ministry brings in a proposal for the revision of the Tariff their supporters will not be behind them ?.",46
461,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Yes , distinctly; if it is a revision upwards.",46
462,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,And will the honourable member for Parkes take up the same stand ?,46
463,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,I am not going to be catechized.,46
464,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Honourable members opposite object to be catechized in this House, where there are men who understand something of politics, but when they are in their electorates they do not hesitate to make all kinds of assertions, knowing full well that the average elector, while having an ordinary knowledge of politics, has not sufficient time to acquaint himself with details as we can do, and that, consequently, he is not able to contradict the awful statements that are made by certain people.",46
465,Mr CONROY,Unknown,I am out for a reduction of taxation from whichever side I can get it.,46
466,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I know that the honourable member takes up that stand, and I believe that he will adhere to it , even if it places the present Ministry in the awkward position of being in a minority.",46
467,Mr CONROY,Unknown,No doubt.,46
468,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"If a situation should arise in which the honourable member's vote is necessary to keep the Government in office, then, I tliink, be will vote to keep them in power. We were informed by the party organs supporting honourable challenge the members opposite that the result of the last general election was a triumph for Protection. If Protection is to depend upon the votes of the honourable member for Parkes and the honourable member for not said Werriwa, then, judging by their interjections this evening, the so-called triumph must go by the board.",46
469,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order I,46
470,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I frankl y admit, sir, that I was drawn a little off the track by the interjections which you so generously I permitted.",46
471,Mr CONROY,Unknown,I shall join with any party to reduce the taxation on the people.,46
472,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I have just been reminded that I have generously permitted interruptions. I hope that honourable members wil l recognise that my duty under the Standing Orders is not to allow these interruptions to continue. I shall be sorry to take any extreme step; but, in view of my duty, of which the honourable member for Adelaide has just reminded me, I shall have no alternative if these interjections continue.",46
473,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"My reference to the situation, sir, was not intended to suggest that you were not properly discharging your duties. The Government and their supporters are spending every penny they can lay their hands on, as well as the surplus left them by the late Administration, and, in addition, they would go a-borOwing right gaily.",46
474,Sir JOHN PORREST,Unknown,We have been in office only three mouths.,46
475,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"If within three months the Government propose to spend everything they can lay their hands on, and to borrow every penny they can, what, in the name of fortune, will they do if the electors allow them to remain in office for three years ? I fear that the country will be reduced to a state of financial chaos which, whilst alarming, will not be without its redeeming feature. It will lay bare the awful incapacity of the present Ministry. The hollowness of their cries to the electors will be exposed, and they will stand before the people as financial shams of the most horrible kind. First of all, the Treasurer proposes to borrow £1,400,000 for the purposes of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway.",46
476,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,It is better to borrow than steal.,47
477,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Then I congratulate the honourable member on being the supporter of a Ministry which has evidently modified his policy into one of borrowing. I frankly admit that I approve rowing for the construction of this railway, but I do not know whether it is those items. that fatuousness which is characteristic of three of these proposals. Conservatism when in office that makes the Ministry think that it can possibly expend £1,400,000 on the railway during the present financial year.",47
478,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We ought to be able to do so.,47
479,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Then the Governwho ment will have to build 300 miles of railvernment, way before the close of the year, although during the three months that they have been in office not 1 mile has been structed.",47
480,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The Fisher Go-, vernment spent £750,000 on this railway last year.",47
481,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"On material, I suppose, which we left for the present Government.",47
482,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Beyon d all doubt, this amount cannot be expended within the financial year, three montlis of which have already expired. Why , then, does the riglit honourable member propose borrow it? Do the Government desire to show the electors more plainly than ever that every statement they made during last election campaign, in reference to finances, was misleading? We are asked to permit the Government to borrow money which they cannot expend within the period named. Then we have a pronot posal to borrow £400,000 for the Northidea ern Territory railway, and also £60,000 lands. for the Port Moresby railway. Does the honourable member who asked a question just now in regard to commitments suggest that we committed the present Government to the last-named expenditure ?",47
483,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Practically , yes.",47
484,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I come now to two or three other items which, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, are included under the heading of ""Loans."" We have, first of all, an item with regard to the purchase of land for post and telegraph purposes. Perhapsthe Treasurer feels that he is justified in. making this proposal, in view of the fact that the late Government purchased the Post-office site in Perth out of loan money. We did so, however, because it was clear that the purchase of that site would return 5 per cent, interest on the outlay.",47
485,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"And the land in the Federal Territory, as well as the site for the High Commissioner's office, wasof borpurchased out of loan money.",47
486,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I am not touching I am dealing only with Apparently, the Ministry is about to introduce the policy of borrowing to buy all land required for post and telegraph purposes, since, during this year, they propose to expend out of loan monsys £170,000 in that direction. Those honourable members are in the good graces of the Goand who desire the purchase of allotments in their electorates-allotment s on which some future Ministry may erect conpost-offices - should go quickly to the .Treasurer, because, if this Bill passes, he will have £170,000 with which to purchase land all over the country for such purposes, and which he hopes, possibly, will have a placating effect. Unless the M in istry can demonstrate clearly that the purchase of these lands out of loan account will give a clear return in the shape of interest over and above the ordinary rates, after providing for a sinking fun d which to will mean the redemption of the loan within a specified time, I regret that they should set out upon what is practically a the new policy-that they should place the the Commonwealth under an indebtedness in respect of loans of which all previous Governments have been able to steer clear.",47
487,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The late Government did follow out the honourable member's in dealing with the Federal Capital,47
488,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I am not now dealing with the Federal Territory, but I can quite understand that the honourable member can get no other idea into his head. I leave him to the tender mercies of the honourable member for Wimmera. That honourable member will find that the present Government propose to spend £285,000 on the Federal Capital, as against an expenditure of £137,000 by the previous Government, and in supporting them he will , no doubt, find his opportunity to make .good to the electors, his pledge to stop further expenditure in. that direction. I quite fail to understand his present mental condition when I find him sitting behind a Government proposing to increase expenditure upou the Federal Capital, and I shall fail also to understand the condition of mind of his electors if they do not protest against his action. There is another proposal to purchase land for defence purposes from borrowed money.",47
489,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The last straw.,48
490,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,Unknown,"The gentleman's Government £100,000 of that expenditure for the Liverpool Manceuvre Area.",48
491,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"And £350,000 for land in connection with the Cockatoo Island Dock. Mr TUDOR,-Tho y are all mere jelly fish on that side.",48
492,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I trust that honourable members on my own side will not make these gelatinous references, because they hurt. They go right home to what is left of the Fusion vertebra, aud may do in j u r y. At the elections i u 1910 we succeeded in preventing the borrowing of money for defence purposes, but the present Treasurer proposes now to indulge his desire in that direction.",48
493,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What is the item in the Budget? Is it £7,000,000?",48
494,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The Prime Minister is asking me to say what is meant by some item in the Budget of his own Treasurer. I am at a loss to understand, what it means, and I may be pardoned for not understanding it when members of the Ministry who framed the Estimates do not understand it .",48
495,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The Treasurer said that his officers were more likely to be correct than I was.,48
496,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I thin k so still,48
497,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I am afraid that the officials of the Treasury have been greatly Btrained in their efforts to make the right honoraible gentleman understand the Estimates, or to bring within reasonable limits his desire to borrow and spend.",48
498,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,What for?,48
499,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"To be quite frank with the Treasurer, I do not know why he desires to spend so much money. When we spent £22,000,000, that was said to be a "" financial debauch,"" and I ask the Treasurer to find for me a suitable word to characterize the proposed expenditure of £27,000,000 by the present Government. Another item of loan expenditure is £425,000 for the construction of conduits and the laying of wires underground.",48
500,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,That is the business the Government are apt at-the laying of wires underground.,48
501,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,The amount appears to be small for so virtuous a purpose.,48
502,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Parkes considers underground enhonorable gineering' virtuous, and perhaps it does authorized appeal to the honourable member in that way. The Government propose to spend only £425,000 in connection with this item. I take no exception whatever io the construction of conduits and the laying of wires, but I do take exception to the expenditure being met from loan money when the cost of similar work undertaken by previous Governments has been met fro m revenue. During the last tliree years, the expenditure from revenue in this way met all reasonable requirements.",48
503,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,What does the honourable gentleman want to strike out of the Estimates-anythin g in particular ?,48
504,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I shall tell the honourable gentleman when the Estimates are under discussion. The Government propose an entirely new policy, which must ultimately involve a considerable increase in the indebtedness of the Commonwealth; and, in characteristic fashion, they propose to pass it on to posterity. We seldom find them meeting their political obligations in the ordinary sense; and they are now doing their best to relieve themselves of the necessity of meeting their financial obligations. They propose to commit for all time succeeding Ministries, and the people of the Commonwealth, to indebted. ness, and they make no provision whatever for the repayment of these loans.",48
505,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order l The honourable member's time has expired.,48
506,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Then I propose to take advantage of my right to speak a second time. We shall have tocontinue paying interest on these loans, and if this policy of constructing works out of borrowed money is persisted in , the interest charge will eventually become larger than the amount which would now be necessary to carry out the works. The Treasurer has asked me what I would strike out of the Estimates. The honourable gentleman has, no doubt, read a very lame leading article which appeared in the Argus yesterday on the subject.",49
507,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I am. sorry to intervene with a point of order, but I foresee that possibilities may arise under the procedure which has been adopted which may give us some trouble. In the circumstances; 1 should be very glad if the honourable member for Adelaide would withdraw his request to continue now with his second speech, because I do not think that it is in accordance with the Standing Orders that an honourable member should speak more than ones without the intervention of a speech by some other honourable member.",49
508,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The r e is no doubt that the rule in the past has been not to JLIIOW an honourable member to make his second speech in Committee immediately following his first, unless no other member of the Committee desires to speak. I , perhaps, made a mistake is not asking the honourable member for Adelaide to resume his seat in order that I might discover whether any other member of the Committee desired to speak. I feel sure that, in the circumstances, the honourable member for Adelaide will withdraw if some otlier member of the Committee wishes to speak.",49
509,Mr EISHER,Unknown,Wide Bay) [8.41] - I will save the situation by saying that I regret that the resolution has been brought in in the way in which it has been.,49
510,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide) [8.41] - I shall not detain honourable members much longer. The Treasurer asked me what item I would strike out of the Estimates of expenditure. Personally, I say that I object emphatically to the proposed alteration of the policy which has been pursued for the last twelve or thirteen years of constructing works and making purchases of land frpm revenue. In the Argus of yesterday, honourable members on this side were asked if they objected to the colossal expenditure proposed by the Fusion Government, to mention the particular items to which they objected. That was precisely the stand we took a few months ago when before the electors. We were being charged with extravagant expenditure. No details were giveu, but millions were spoken of, and the public mind was considerably disturbed. At the time, we asked the Argus, and every honourable member opposite, to tell the electors which linS of expenditure undertaken, or proposed to be undertaken, by the late Government they objected to. They were absolutely unable to reply. The Budget which has just been introduced indicates clearly that, not only were the members of the present Government not opposed'to any one lies of expenditure proposed or undertaken by the late Government, but they have added to the lines of expenditure, and also to the total amount. It ill-becomes any member of the Ministry, or any of their press organs in the circumstances, to ask us which line of expenditure included in the present Government's Estimates we would strike out. It is for the Government and tlieir supporters to ""make g o o d "" to the electors. If their promises aud pledges are so unstable, and they think so lightly of what they said to secure office that they will break their promises ruthlessly at the first opportunity, it is for them to explain. I do not kuow the form the proposed Bill will take. If it is of an open character, permitting the Treasurer to borrow either from the Note Fund, the Trust Funds, or' from some outside source, the rigbt honourable gentleman must expect opposition from this side; but if , ou the other hand, it confines the Government to borrowing from the Note Fund, or from the Commonwealth Trust Funds, it is possible that there will not be any serious exception taken to such borrowing, unless it be that honourable members take exception to the new form of policy, namely, constructing out of loans certain works that were previously constructed nut of revenue. I think the riglit honourable gentleman hinted in his Budget speech that if the Note Fund and Trust Funds were not sufficient to meet the loan of £3,080,000, he would go elsewhere, and, so far as I am personally concerned, he must look for the most strenuous opposition if he proposes to go elsewhere. On the other hand, a condition that would confine him to borrowing from our own resources would be most wise, for he could borrow with much greater advantage.",49
511,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Our .resources are not altogether unlimited.,50
512,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I am aware of that, but at the same time, while the Treasurer proposes to spend nearly £6,000,000 more than he will receive in the shape of revenue, which means a very heavy expenditure, he is, by his actions or his proposals, restricting the possibility of borrowing from certain funds, which borrowing can be done in a more, safe way.",50
513,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"You r Government proposed to spend from £3,000,000 to £4,000,000 more tlian vou had revenue for.",50
514,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The £2,000,000 to £3,000,000 that we proposed to expend last year in excess of the revenue that we estimated to receive was precisely the amount that we had saved the year previously. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - Plu s loans.",50
515,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Wit h the exception of the loans from the Note Fund, the money was borrowed from Trust Funds, which we had built up during our three years' term of office. On this occasion, the Government propose £6,000,000 more than tliey estimate to receive, not from any surplus that they themselves put by, but from our surplus. And yet, by some curious mental process, they alleged during the last election that wo were guilty of extravagant expenditure. To borrow from those two funds is safer than to go elsewhere.' It can be done at a more reasonable rate, while still allowing the f u n d to earn reasonable and fair interest, and permitting of provision for a redemption fund . safer to borrow from one's own savings than from other persons..",50
516,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Y ou £3,000,000 of it up t ill 1916.",50
517,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I know the previous Administration invested the money,. but does the right honourable member suggest that we ought not to have invested it , apart altogether from the question of whether anybody succeeded us in office or not? What did he expect us to do with the money?",50
518,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,How are we to get hold of it if it is invested ?,50
519,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Did the right honourable member expect us to keep the money idle, or throw it in the gutter, or follow his example by spending it merely for spending's sake? Our method of financing was such that we were able to save some millions of pounds more than we spent, and invest it at reasonable rates of interest. We helped certain private banks, and certain State Governments, to tide over their difficulties, thus showing conclusively thab the allegation of honourable gentlemen opposite, that we were going in for a policy inimical to the welfare of the Commonwealth, was quite erroneous. Some of the loans that we made to the State Governments were for long periods, and some were short dated; they were at fair rates of interest, and ""free from all brokerage and other charges that would have had to be paid if the loans had been drawn from other sources. Certain of that money will become available during the next twelve months, and to the extent that it is available I have no doubt it will be spent, because the right honourable gentleman's Budget proves that he will spend every penny that he can lay his hands on. 1 can see no cause for taking exception to borrowing from those two funds, but I do trust that the honourable member doss not propose to initiabe a new policy of borrowing fro m to spend outside sources. The elections of 1910 proved conclusively, among other things, that the majority of the people of Australia do not approve of the Commonwealth borrowing from outside sources. The proposal then was to borrow for building a fleet. That was disapproved of by the people, and there was also general dissatisfaction with that form of borrowing. I would suggest to the r i g h t honourable member that, as his policy was turned down so emphatically on that It is occasion by the electors, it would be unwise of him to attempt to again force it on the country, especially in view of the invested smalhiess of the majority commanded by the Government.",50
520,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [8.50] - As the speech to which we have just listened will go all over Adelaide tomorrow, I should like to send out just a little antidote with it. I know the tricks of the trade commanded by the honourable member, and want to correct all the tali statements that he has been making. We are accused of proposing to spend this year £6,000,000 more than we expect to receive in revenue. That is substantially so, if loan moneys be added ta the other totals of our expenditure. But may I remind my honourable friend that last year the Government to bor for Newcastle. which he belonged also proposed to spend many millions more than they had reposed venue to cover ? I want to set those sums side by side, just to show the extent of our so-called extravagance, and the way in which, according to my orable friend's statements, the expendiTreasurer, ture is piled up. I find that last year they appropriated, as we are proposing to appropriate now, £22,683,541. In adstruct dition to that, although they approthe priated much more, they actually spent out of loan moneys £1,339.000. They of revenue. also purchased a dock in Sydney which cost £850,000. Those sums make of £24,872,000. Our total appropriations for this year are £27,246,000, £2,374,000 more. The increase in expenfamous diture during the last three years has averaged about 33^ per cent., whereas total increase for this year is only 8 9 per cent. Mr TUDOR, (Yarra) [8.54] - It was quite refreshing to hear the Prime ister's statement.",50
521,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Jus t one f a c t; that is all.,51
522,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"We shall have one or two from the other side. The Government propose to spend £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 more than was spent last year, according to their own figures. They cannot deny this; yet we heard all over the country during the recent election campaign that there was going to be economical administration. I believe the present Attorney-General stated, at the St. Kilda Town H all , that the administration was going to be more economical, and that his party were going to cut things down; yet what do we fiud now ? This is the thir d occasion on which the present Treasurer has been associated with a Loan Bil l in this Parliament. In the first Budget submitted to this Parliament in 1901 by Sir George Turner, when the present Treasurer was Minister of Home Affairs",51
523,Sir JOHN PORREST,Unknown,"No , I was Minister of Defence; but I think I - was away i England.",51
524,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member was here. In that Budget it was proadditional posed to borrow £500,000 to pay for he works. Most honourable members might search Hansard in vain for the record of the test division on that proposal, which was taken on the question of a boat har that we should also borrow to make two up an old-age pension f u n d .",51
525,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The party opposite have proposed to borrow for many things. The honsecond occasion was when the present as Treasurer of the Fusion Government, passed a Bill through this Parliament to borrow £3,500,000 to conthe present Australian Fleet, which late. Government had repealed, the whole of which has now been paid for out",51
526,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,Thank s to the abolia total tion of the Braddon section.,51
527,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I think that it was the or honourable member who at Avoca made the statement that he would strike off the roll every one who was not a ratethe payer. The honourable member said that or we had involved the Commonwealth in an expenditure of about £150,000,000.",51
528,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,I was referring to M i nCommonwealth commitments.,51
529,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member little is not particular as to a few millions. His exact statement was that we had mortgaged our resources twenty years ahead. If that was true of us, what are the present Government doing? They have an accumulated surplus of £2,600.000, which we did not spend. They are going to borrow this year £3,080,000, and this is the third occasion on which the Treasurer has been associated with a Loan Bill.",51
530,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Do you thin k there is anything to be ashamed of in that ?,51
531,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"For certain things, yes. The first proposal was to borrow for works that have since been constructed for the whole of the twelve years out of revenue.",51
532,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Where are we to get the revenue from ? Would you im pose further taxation ?,51
533,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not think the Treasurer wil l propose any additional taxation. An article dealing with the honourable gentleman's Budget in the Age of Friday last spoke of one of his pron posals as verging on insanity, but added that one gratifying feature to the taxpayer was that he did not propose any taxation. He does not, but is leaving the bill for posterity to pay. I think it was the honourable member for Maranoa who said he was going on a "" financial d run k . "" It is a case of up the Loan Bills again."" I am anxious to hear what can be said by some of those honourable members who have been denouncing the late Labour Government for extravagant expenditure. Sir JOH N FOBBEST - The member would rather tax the people.",51
534,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I would sooner pay as I go,52
535,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,Unknown,Did not build railways out of loan moneys ?,52
536,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not take exception to the railways. I take no exception to the first three and the last two items, but I do take exception to the items picked out by the honourable member for laide, such, for example, as £170,000 for the purchase of land for post and telething graph purposes. The Treasurer tells us correct. that this money is all ear-marked, so it is of no use for honourable rush to him for extra post-offices for their electorates. Personally, I want none.",52
537,Mr AHERN,Unknown,I suppose you were filled up during the term of the last Governenter ment.,52
538,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I have not had a new post-office in my electorate for twelve years. It is only fair that I should make that statement.

I do not believe that that is a right principle to follow. I presume that the present season is one "" P ill of the most prosperous we have ever experienced. Yet, the Government propose to spend, this year, £2,600,000 of an accumulated surplus, and an additional £3,080,000 , which is to be obtained from loan moneys. As I remarked the other honourable evening at a social gathering, if a man's income is only £ 2 0 a year and he spends £27, he knows where he will eventually land himself. No less a sum than Victoria £895,000 is to be spent out of loan moneys upon works which have hitherto been paid for out of revenue. I bold that the system of paying for public works out of revenue is the right one to adopt.",52
542,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The State ParliaAdements do not follow that practice.,52
543,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I do not say that everywhich the State Parliaments do is It is fa r better for us to pay that for these works out of revenue than to members to pile up big loans.,52
544,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,I do not think so.,52
545,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I feel sure that there are some honourable members opposite who are reluctant to see the Commonwealth the money market as the seventh borrower.

He gyrated from his own speech have to the Budget-papers, and fro m the Budget-papers to his own speech, in an endeavour to explain what is meant by this proposal to commit the Commonwealth to a loan policy. Only a few months ago, the Government were telling the electors that the Labour party were driving this country to insolvency. Those' who knew it , and those who did not, took up the allegation as a parrot-cry.' They repeated it like a lot of cockatoos. The Prime Minister, knowing the tricks of the trade, tried that little trick upon the people in an endeavour to throw dust into their eyes.",52

558,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I am merely expressing my regret that the supporters of the Government are not allowed to speak upon such an important proposition.,53

566,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The honourable memr ber cannot be humorous. Nobody regrets more than I do that the Government are ? about to embark upon - a policy of wholeborrowing.' Hitherto, this Parliament has been held in esteem by the ' people of Australia because it has refused to resort to a borrowing policy. States have borrowed to cover deficits now whenever they have occurred, and to play carry out legitimate public works. Then danger of such a policy is that it affords an opportunity to a Treasurer to evade his responsibilities. honourable Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Is the honourable member aware that last year his Government spent £2,200,000 of loan money?",53
567,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Yes ; and it ""was spent in establishing the Australian M i l i tary Forces and the naval power of this country.",53
568,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Did they borrow for the Navy?,53
569,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The honourable member has said that they practically borrowed the money to buy the Cockatoo Island dock. The money was borrowed in connection with Defence.,53
570,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"The point is from whom the money was borrowed. Mr. JOSEPH COOK,-We are borrowing it from the same source.",53
571,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Honourable members are taking advantage of the legislation of the Labour party, or they would be in the position of having to borrow in the open market. To-day, fortunately for them, owing to the administration of the Labour party during the last three years, they are able to take advantage of our foresight and keen discernment, and borrow money we got without paying interest. I do not object to money being borrowed for railways, because railways are an asset with a certain life. An y asset with a life that can be reasonably measured may be a just proposition to borrow money on, and can be managed so as to redeem the money borrowed out of the profits earned. In fact, it is impossible for us to build railways out of revenue, and I have not a word to say against the proposal to borrow money for railways. On the other hand, the proposal to borrow £895,000 for the three items mentioned by the honourable member for Yarra is a big departure from the previous policy. In the past, these works have always been carried out from revenue, but even if we admit, for the sake of argument, that there is some justification for borrowing money for these works, it is the duty of the Treasurer to show that they are of a character that will lead to the redemption of the money borrowed during their life. Take the item for the purchase of land for post and telegraph purposes. When the Labour party are in power, land naturally rises in value, but there is strong doubt as to whether land will not decrease in value while the Fusion party are in power. There is another item of £425,000 for the construction of conduits and laying telephone wires underground. Why lay the wires underground ? Has the Treasurer looked into the life of these wires underground? He has not told us whether they are single wires, live wires, copper wires, or brass wires, and he has not condescended to tell us what will be the life of these wires. Has the honourable member inquired as to what sinking f u n d will be necessary to redeem the money borrowed for these works?",53
572,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I am informed that these conduits will last for fifty years.,54
573,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"They may do that, £27,000,000. but in half that time they will not be adequate to carry the increased business. They will need to be torn up. Gas-pipes and water-pipes laid by municipalities were expected to last twenty-five years, but in ten years many have had to be up because of the inability of the pipes to carry sufficient gas or water.",54
574,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I desire to draw tion to the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.],54
575,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,It is good to see honourable members in the Chamber atthose tending to the business of the country.,54
576,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Non e of your side will stop to listen to you.,54
577,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I do not wish them to do so; it is to honourable members on the Ministerial side I wish to speak. The . CHAIRMAN - The honourable member is not in order.,54
578,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"There is no warrant for borrowing money to build conduits, because the Government cannot estimate their life. I venture to say that the officers of the Postal Department cannot do it , judging by their ability in the past to estimate the necessities of the Department. They have been notorious for not being able to see far enough ahead. Time and again they have made mistakes in not preparing for the growth and expansion of the postal service, and - they have the Department tangled up in such a way that it has brought, not only confusion, ' but heartburning to every Postmaster-General. We are warranted in borrowing money for any work the life of which can be fixed, because then we can establish a sinking f u n d to redeem the loan, but if we cannot fix the life of a work, and, therefore, cannot assess the sinking f u n d necessary to redeem the loan, we are treading on treacherous ground in borrowing, and we are allowing the Government to steer a course never yet steered by any previous Government, a course that is likely to lead them on to the rocks. We should know something from the Treasurer as to the nature of these conduits; we should know what we are to borrow this money for ; also whether it is to be well borrowed or well spent, and whether we are to get the money back again. We are not told bow much is to be borrowed for conduits, and how much for wires. This Government, which was going to reduce expenditure, has increased it from £22,000,000 to  ments of the Labour Government.",54
579,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The honourable member, who went about the country carptorn ing as to the extravagant expenditure of the Labour Government, is now prepared to support a Government which attenincreases the expenditure by £5,000,000 in one year. I cannot understand how be can look his fellow men in the face after telling these stories, which were like also told by the honourable member for Gippsland in his wild ravings before the electors during the last campaign. I strongly object to the spending of borrowed money on works of this kind. I ask the Treasurer whether money borrowed for Post Office works is to be charged to a general loan account, or to a separate account ?",54
580,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,He has not considered that.,55
581,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"It should be considered. The Department of the Postmaster-General should be, in the main, self-supporting. Money spent in carrying on its services should be debited to the Department, and the earnings of those services should be used to balance the expenditure.",55
582,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Why should the Department be made self-supporting?,55
583,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The telegraphic and telephonic services are carried on mostly for the benefit of the business people of the community, who profit greatly by them, and they should be made self-supporting. To suggest anything else is to suggest what is detrimental to the in terests of the country, though the honourable member may be under the delusion that his constituents can be benefited at the expense of the community generally.",55
584,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,The honourable member asks the party opposite to present a business balance-sheet of its operations.,55
585,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I am showing how a Department should be run as a business concern. Is the Treasurer going to debit against the Department the cost of the conduits for which he is borrowing, or will the cost be charged to loan account generally ? The Labour party has from the beginning set its face against borrowing, and I wonder, if the Treasurer feels it necessary to borrow this year, when he has at his disposal a surplus of £2,620,000 left by the last Government, what he will do next year.",55

587,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [9.38] I do not know that I should have said anything at this stage had it not been for the exceptional eagerness shown by the Attorney-General to defend the borrowing of money from other sources than the ordinary Trust Funds, an eagerness that was shown by his persistent questioning of the honourable member for Adelaide. The Treasurer said, in effect, "" It is all very well to talk about borrowing from the Trust Funds, but I cannot lay my [69]- 2 hands on the money, because it has already been invested."" The Budget-papers, however, show how the money has been invested, and when the payments fall due.",55
588,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Do not anticipate the speech of the ex-Treasurer.,55
589,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"We are almost within two months of the end of the calendar year, yet within two months and two weeks, £1,350,000 will come into the hands of the Treasurer from Trust Funds for expenditure. Then early in 1914. there will come into his hands a sum of £1,125,000. This is money that was well invested by the late Treasurer with State Governments. Therefore, within about six months from that - particular source alone the Treasurer will become the possessor of money to the extent of £2,475,000, and within twelve months-that is by the 30th June, 1914there will mature other sums, makiug a total of £3,800,000. There are only, I repeat, about eight months of this financial year to go. .We are not now talking about money which we intend to expend within a period of twelve months. I admit that some of the money has already been spent.",55
590,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"We have already spent over £1,000,000 on the overland railway.",55
591,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I am not going to say that tjhat money has not been spent. But within the remaining eight months of the present financial year the Treasurer will have coming into his hands £3,800,000. Y e the is wondering wliere he is going to get the money to carry out the works authorized by the Loan Bill to the amount of £3,080,000. I take it that, with the exception of the Note Issue Fund, there will also be a considerable amount of interest accruing from our splendid investments.",55
592,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The peculiar feature is that although that information is contained in the Budget-papers, yet the Treasurer does not know it .",55
593,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I cannot conceive of that. The Treasurer is complaining that he will not have the money.,55
594,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The statements I made in my Budget speech are absolutely right. If you like to twist them, very well; but there they are.",55
595,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The riglit honourable gentleman is unfair.,55
596,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,What are you talking about?,55
597,Mr FENTON,Unknown,For the Treasurer's special edification I shall read the figures from his own Budget-papers.,56
598,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"You want to tell ine what, perhaps, I have said already in that course. my Budget speech. I do not wish to hear it again.",56
599,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"This evening the right honourable gentleman has been complainplain ing, "" Where am I to lay my hands on the money to carry out these works?"" and has made that the sole reason, apparently, why he has to resort to this plan of going outsidethe Trust Funds. We do not wane sent abroad every year. that to take place. By the method of borrowing from the Trust Funds late Government saved all borrowing charges. We have not had to go to our £12,000,000. uncle in London, or to the local where it costs every borrower a considerable sum. W hy are the Treasurer and the Attorney-General so anxious the present time to go outside and borrow money fro m their friends the financiers this or any other part of the world ? they any particular purpose to serve there will come into their not only in small sums, but in big sums, and within a period of eight and a half months, no less than £3,800,000 of Trust Funds money. I have dealt with the sums that will come i the present financial year. But if the figures are only analyzed, it will that, early in the next financial year, considerable sums will come in . That shows the wonderful prudence, ability, and capacity of the late Ministry in husbanding the resources of the Commonwealth, and especially in carefully safeguarding its financial interests. I wish to quote the figures, if you, sir, will permit me to do that? do so. On the 17th September, of this year, £100,000 came into the' Treagentleman surer's hands; in October, £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 November, £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; and in December, £100,000.

607,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The right honourable has been hinting at that this 0 ; in evening. I wish to ascertain, before he actually pledges himself, what is intended be done. There will have to be an assurance given in this Loan Bill as to where the money is to be obtained.",56

610,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Not at all.,57
611,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I trust that it will not be so.,57
612,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Why do you read page 1792 of Hansard, and see what I propose ?",57
613,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Why was so much anxiety displayed by the Treasurer and the Attorney-General this afternoon? The righ t honourable gentleman says he has not the money.,57

616,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Why do you read the Hansard report of what I said?,57
617,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The right honourable gentleman said just now that he would have a difficulty in getting hold of the money just when he required it . Si r JOHN FORREST - That is true.,57
618,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Does the right honourable gentleman expect, in the remaining eight months of this financial year, to get ri d of the whole of the £27,000,000 which he has outlined in his Budget speech ?",57
619,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I do not know.,57
620,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Does the righ t honourable gentleman expect to do so? I do not think so for one moment.,57
621,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"When it is wanted we shall have some difficulty in getting the money in , because it will not be there; but, even so, I hope it will be possible to arrange.",57

He says, "" I anticipate a revenue of nearly £22,000,000, making a total, with the surplus, of £24,000,000, and, on top of that-the biggest revenue that any Treasurer has had the right to handle in Australia in oue year- I must borrow £ 3 , 0 8 0 , 0 0 0 .

The Budget-papers will explain not all these transactions. I have pointed out certain transactions in regard to loan moneys to which there is no reference in the Budget-papers. The £3,800,000 coming in this year should tide the Treasurer over this exp'en- 1 diture of £3,080,000, and I trust that he will not go outside our own funds to prothe vide for necessary works.",57

626,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,I think .the time has. arrived when we ought to have a quorum [Quorum formed.],57
627,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Thes e Governmental undertakings can be provided for either by borrowing or taxation. By borrowing, we place a perpetual charge upon future generations. It is idle-to say, so far as this loan is concerned, that it will be redeemed within a certain time. I do' not think the Treasurer has indicated that a sinking f u n d is to be provided.' Most of the States, with the exception of Western Australia, have failed to provide-any sinking funds worth talking about for the redemption of their loans. As a homely illustration, let me point out that, if we borrow £1,000,000 at 3 per cent, for fifty years, at the end of that period we', shall have paid £1,500,000 in interest, and 1 will still owe the amount originally borrowed. We shall then have to go on the market to borrow £1,000,000 in order to pay off the first loan. Such a system must come to au end sooner or later. If we go on borrowing large sums from abroad instead of endeavouring to raise the money locally, we shall place upon the people a burden that they will be unable to bear. Only a few years ago the value of our imports exceeded the value of our ex=: ports by nearly £25,000,000, and the.pre-. sent Prime Minister then pointed out that of the time was fast approaching when steps would have to be taken to prevent such a large sum of money annually leaving the I country. Having regard to, the present'- 1 state of the London money market, T do not suppose we shall be able to obtain this money for less than 4 per cent.; so that, with respect to this loan, we shall have an annual interest bill of £120,000.",57
628,Sir JOHN FOBREST,Unknown,We can borrow this money from our Trust Funds.,58
629,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Will the Treasurer say definitely that the Government intend to borrow this money from the Trust Funds ?,58
630,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,He said so at the beginning.,58
631,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We will take it from the Trust Funds.,58
632,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The honourable member, in his Budget speech, said the Government might have to go outside to obtain this money.",58
633,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I said that we hoped we should be able to take it out of Trust Funds.,58
634,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"If we raise this money abroad and have to pay 4 per cent, for it , we shall have an interest bill £120,000 a year to meet. In other words, if men, after providing for their main.tenance, could earn sufficient to set apart -£100 a year for the use of the nation, it would mean that 1,200 men would have to toil all the year round to produce an amount sufficient to pay interest on this loan. Already the people of Australia are paying, in respect of the national debt, an interest bill amounting to nearly £12,000,000 a year. About £80,000,000 of the national debt has been borrowed within the Commonwealth.",58
635,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"£92,000,000 .",58
636,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I am glad that, within the last few years, a larger proportion of our publio loans has been raised locally.",58
637,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,Is not that a bad sign?,58
638,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I think it a good sign.,58
639,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,Would it not bave been far better to spend the money in developing Australia than to have it locked up in Government securities?,58
640,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Does the honourable member think that this money, when raised, is merely locked up in the Treasury? Is it not spent in developing the country?",58
641,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,It is locked up in a lot of unproductive works.,58
642,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The interest on jbhat £92,000,000 is being spent in the country, and not abroad. I said that there are two methods of obtaining the money required to meet Government expenditure. One is by borrowing, and the other by taxation. I think that if £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 is required, wo should tax the people by that amount. Then when it is paid there will be an end of it .",58
643,Mr AHERN,Unknown,"Suppos e we wanted £20,000,000 ?",58
644,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Why £20,000,000? Why not £250,000,000? The honourable member forgets that we will seldom spend in any one year more than £1,000,000 or £1,500,000.",58
645,Mr AHERN,Unknown,"It will cost about £1,000,000 for the up-keep of the Navy.",58
646,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Does the honourable member mean' to say that we should maintain the Navy out of borrowed money?,58
647,Mr AHERN,Unknown,No .,58
648,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Borrowe d money of should be expended only upon permanent reproductive works, and on such works we should never spend more than about £1,500,000 in any one year. The honourable member will find that on the great Transcontinental Railway, which is estimated to cost over £4,000,000, the Treasurer estimates that he will require for this year only about £1,500,000, and that is all that will be provided for in the Loan Bill which is now to be introduced. I have no very great objection to this Loan Bill, as we now have the assurance of the Treasurer that the money required is to be taken out of our own Trust Funds.",58
649,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Treasurer said so in his Budget speech.,58
650,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"No , the right honourable gentleman did not. The matter was left in doubt by the Budget speech, but there is now no doubt about it , as the Treasurer has given us his distinct assurance that the money will be taken from the Trust Funds. If that be so, there will be no very strong objection to the loan from this side, whatever objection we may have to the details of expenditure proposed. If it were proposed to borrow the money abroad, I should take very strong exception to it , because I think it is quite time we adopted a better method of finauce than that which has been adopted in the past. All parties in the States in the past desired to carry on what they called "" a progressive works policy,"" and in carrying out such a policy they spent huge sums of borrowed money. While the money was being spent everything booming, and they all thought how perous they were. But a time came when they had to pay back the borrowed money, and difficulties at once arose. They are faced today with the fact that the rate of interest has gone up from 3 to 3J and 4 per cent., and they have placed themcause selves in the hands of the money-lenders at the other end of the world, because they have made no provision to meet their obligations as their loans fall due. is a humiliating position for the States occupy, and I am afraid that that state of affairs will continue for some time longer. It must be remembered that on passing of this Loan. Bill there will be be available. another borrower on the market, and we shall have seven borrowers in Australia instead of six. We know the complications which take place because of the amount! number of States desiring to borrow. Only a little time ago we had a lamentable exhibition of the haste of the various year. State' Treasurers to get money on the London market. Four States-Ne South Wales, Yictoria, South Ausber, tralia, and Western Australiahad loans falling due, and required £1,310,000. a certain amount of money to meet them. The amounts required by New South . Wales and Victoria were very large. different States sent the State Treasurers or other Ministers to London to negotiate their loans. What was the result 1 Queensside land came upon the scene. Her Treaquires. He saidsurer whipped into the London market while the representatives of the other States were on their way to the Old Country, and secured a loan of £2,000,000, the whole of which he did not want, because he lent, or offered to lend, a certain portion of it to the other States as soon as he got it. His action placed the represenhave tatives of the other States at the mercy of the money-lenders, and some of have been unable to complete their loans up to the present time. That is a state affairs which should not exist. I should regret it very much if we had to go the London money market in competition with the different States, and I repeat the objection to the proposed loan is greatly time. minimized by the assurance of the Treasurer that the money will be taken from . the Trust Funds. The Treasurer said that the Government had not the money they required, and that is what led to the ' impression that they intended side to borrow. I remind honourable mem-, bers that the Government have was with a handsome surplus of £2,600,000, prosand there is an amount of about £7,000,000 included in short-dated loans, the greater portion of which will fall due in the' next sixteen or eighteen months.: In the circumstances, the present Treasurer should be the last to complain, behe must recognise that all the money he is likely to require to carry on the great works to which the Commonwealth is committed will be available. In the That next four months about £2,400,000 will to be falling due, and in the next eight months about £4,000,000.
