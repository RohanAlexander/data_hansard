0,NA,Unknown,"jfljotisc of Krpvcscntntibrs. Friday, 30 September, 1004. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. PERSONAL EXPLANATION.",12
1,Mr THOMAS,Unknown," Las t evening I stated that the Prime Minister was reported to have said, when speaking in the Protestant Hall, Sydney, that although the honourable and learned member for Ballarat was a most amiable and courteous gentleman, he had doner nothing politically to entitle him to the Prime Ministership of Australia. The right honourable gentleman denied having said that.",12
2,Mr REID,Unknown,That was not the statement made by the honourable member last night.,12
3,Mr LONSDALE,Unknown,The honourable member for Barrier made a number of statements last night which were not correct.,12
4,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I accepted the right honourable gentleman's denial, but in justification of my statement. I should like to read the report to which I referred.",12
5,Mr REID,Unknown,"I rise to order. The honourable member imputed to me remarks which I did not make, and he is now proceeding to quote something, probably with a view to corroborate his statement, The, remarks which he attributed to me last night were put in quite a different way. He stated then that I had said that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat was unfit to be Prime Minister.",12
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Barrier, is explaining a misunderstanding of a speech which he made last night,, and in doing so is quite within the rules of the House.",12
7,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"The report to which I refer reads as follows:In Mr Deakin they had,one of the most brilliant and courteous men in public life, one for whom every one in Federal politics had a sincere respect, but more for his personal qualities than r for anything he had ever done. A voice-What have you ever done? Mr Reid - That question shows'that the speaker 'must be a new arrival. (Laughter.) I have two testimonials to my' career. My 'friends credit me with endeavouring to put taxation in New South Wales upon something like an honest footing, and my enemies charge me with turning the country upside down. No one could ever justly accuse Mr Deakin of putting up or throwing anything down. (Laughter.) I took that passage to 'mean that while the honourable and learned mem-, ber for Ballarat has great and pleasing - personal qualities, he had done nothing to entitle him to the Prime Ministership. Those are not the actual words of the report, but that is the interpretation which I put upon the passage which I have read. The Prime Minister, however, has stated that it should not carry that interpretation, and I accept his denial; but I wish to have the actual report recorded in Hansard, so that the public may judge between us. SUPPLY BILL (No. 4). Assent reported. NA CONFIDENCE. Debate resumed from 29th September (vide page 5113), on motion by Mr. WATSONThat the present Administration does not possess the confidence of this House.",12
8,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF," I am not quite sure, after having listened to the debate pretty closely fora fortnight, and much more closely than I have previously been in-the habit of listening to debates, whether I shall be in order in addressing myself to the question if I refrain from making personal explanations, and from diving into ancient history. If I may judge by the experience of previous speakers, my turn for making personal explanations will come after I have spoken. But I shall endeavour to avoid as far as possible going into the ancient history of either Victoria or New South Wales. Interesting and exciting as the episodes recounted-to us may have been, they do not seem to me to bear very directly on the question now at issue. I have waited for nearly a fortnight to speak, because I thought, and but for present experience would still think, that the members of a Ministry whose existence was challenged were entitled to wait until they bad ascertained the causes for challenging it. The motion of want of 'confidence, which was moved by the honourable member for Bland last Tuesday week, in a speech in which he extolled the beauties of Socialism, and described the ideal state that is to come into existence long after we axe dead and buried, so that it has no direct personal interest for us, was seconded by the honourable :and learned member for Indi, who said, "" I second the motion, but reserve my right to speak later on."" Apparently it is to be much later on that that right will be exercised-muc later than the country will thitik postpone his speech, and much later than the Ministry which is attacked ha's a right expect, if - it is to be treated in. the manner which is customary upon occasions of this kind, and in a way which can be regarded as ordinary, not to say fair, political fighting.",13
9,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Why whine ?,13
10,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Does the honourable member call that whining? I am not whining. We have had some new definitions added to the English language during the last week or two- a new definition of the word "" truce"" by the honourable and learned member for Indi and others, for example; and now we are getting a new definition of the word "" whining."" I assure the honourable member for Wide - Bay, who joined in running away from the bridges which he and his friends erected from time to time to save the Government of which he was a member, that there will be no whining in my speech. However he may be able to characterize it when I have finished, he will find a notable absence of the whining which he desires to impute to me before I have begun to address myself to the main subject of my remarks. The honourable and learned member for Indi has delayed speaking until now, and we have not been able to ascertain when . he will speak. It is one of those happy events which are to occur in the dim future, which is to come upon us along with many other blessings when the Opposition have achieved their object of ousting the present Government from office, and have secured the first steps in the advance to that sys- tern of perfection which their entrance into office is to insure this time, though when they were there a few months ago none of those steps were even proposed.",13
11,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"They got a good reference from the Minister's leader, at any rate.",13
12,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am not going to discuss the past more than is absolutely necessary. Â»I am .willing to admit at once that Honourable members on that side, like honourable members on this side, have said a good deal about each other which they wish now they had not said. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has said many things which he would like the waters of kindly oblivion to cover, if only for a time.",13
13,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Not a thing.,13
14,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Then he still believes h that what he said about the Labour Party he should in November last is true.,13
15,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I did notsay it about the to Labour Party, and the Minister knows it,",13
16,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Migh t I ask the honourable member for Bourke if he endorses that statement ? Does he believe that all that said about the Labour Party in last Noveminterviews. ber and December is still true? Mr KING O'MALLEY - He was talking about anarchists then, not about the Labour self. Party.",13
17,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the Labour Party this House do not mind the things which were said about them a few months ago some of their bosom friends, there bers of the party outside - a good thousands of them-wh o mind it a deal, and it is those gentlemen, as they have taken care to assure their agents inprecincts side this House, who will determine what action is to be taken in consequence of the speeches to which I refer. Mr HUM E COOK - That is comfort which the Minister has.",14
18,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,I do not know what comMinister fort the honourable member has.,14
19,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is a good thing that I have something to comfort me. The honourable member for Bourke is not in that happy position. However, I was referring to the honourable and learned member for Indi and his methods on the present occagard sion. He has, I understand, suggested that he helped to frame that beautiful liance programme, about which I hope to say a word or two later on. I understand that he regards that as his indictment against the Government, which must be answered before he is called upon to $peak. It tokens a most praiseworthy and admirable modesty in the honourable and learned memenables ber to say that he helped to frame the alliance programme. There are amongst us those who make a more generous estimate ber for Indi. of his ability and his intellectual powers than he appears to hold himself, who aspecially cribe to him much more than a mere share in framing the programme. We see in one master hand from first to last. To those who, like myself, have some familiance arity with the verbiage and procedure of the law courts, the hand pf the practised drawer of pleadings appears throughout the document, not merely in the "" a "" and "" b provisions to which the Minister of Trade and Customs referred, but from A to Zfrom beginning to end. The honourable and learned member says, "" There is my indictto ment against the Government."" I confess that to me the document appears, to quote a line from Gilbert's Bab Ballads, "" Pretty; but I don't know what it means."" I think a good many of us are in that position regard to it. The honourable and learned member has adopted the method of pubwhich 8 p 2 he lishing his opinions by means ot newspaper An interview is an excellent thing in many ways.",14
20,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,When you write it your,14
21,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"With ' that recognition in which a great mind always gives to the importance of its prominence in by the public eye, the honourable and are memlearned member for Indi has not many shrunk from interviews. The intergood view has many great advantages in comparison with a speech made within the of this House. In the first place, it is. not liable to troublesome interjection or contradiction, and, in the second place, it gets at least a day's start of the critic, the only however active he may be.",14
22,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Why does not the read the Argus leader in which these views appeared a day or two ago, so that we may have them at first hand. Apparently he has committed it to memory.",14
23,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The reading of leading articles is not an occupation which I reas the summit of bliss, and if I am now expressing the views contained' in an alArgus leader of recent date, it is only another instance of great minds thinking alike, because I have not read the article to which the honourable member refers. I am gratified that for once in a way the beArgus and I are in agreement. One great advantage of being interviewed is that it one to get ahead of his critics.",14
24,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,Bein g interviewed is not peculiar to the honourable and learned mem,14
25,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No ; but it is more eshis method than that of any other member of the House at the present time. it The honourable and learned member professes to have helped in framing, the alliprogramme, about which I wish to say, a few words, and, in passing, I would like to remark that it reminds us very forcibly of a fact to which naturalists have so fre"" quently drawn attention, that in the animal world, there are a great number of insects which show a wonderful capacity for adapting themselves to their environment in order escape the notice of their natural enemies. But nature has once more to yield to art. No insect, however successful in escaping its enemies by means of its adaptability, has shown itself as adaptable as this alliwith ance programme). There is one article- a secret article-of the alliance programme says that the programme is intended to secure the votes of a majority of members of the House of Representatives, and with that object in view it is to be altered from time to time to an extent to which no natural insect has ever succeeded in changing its appearance. Just remember that the programme as it left the Committee of three which drew it up was full of fight. Fiscalism was to be vived forthwith, the Tariff fight was to be renewed within these halls at all costs and hazards. But this unhappy programme had to undergo the scrutiny of the Opposition branch of the Protectionist Party. I will not call them "" seceders,"" but the smaller of the two branches into which the party is now divided.",14
26,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Oh , no.",15
27,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is said that figures cannot lie, although the men who use them may do so. At any rate, an analysis of the figures as to the division of the twenty-three twenty-four Deakenites shows conclusively that a majority of the party sit on this side of the House and not upon the Opposition benches. Those honourable members who appear in Opposition may represent the younger and yet the more distinguished branch of the party, and may possess greater intellect,' ability, and activity as a set-off to the mere brute force of numbers which is to be found upon this side. Whatever advantage attaches to numbers is undoubtedly on the side of the branch which sits behind the Government. The alliance programme to go through the crucible of the consideration of the Opposition branch of the Protecremark tionist Party. I will say in justice to those honourable members, however, that the proable gramme did not suffer much at their hands. They swallowed the whole of its items, just as they swallowed its subsequent version, with a willingness and cheerfulness which leads one to suppose that they find the operation entirely to their taste. A few days later the programme had to face the Labour Party, which has no fiscal faith. Included in its ranks are men who hold strong opinions against re-opening the Tariff in the way suggested-re-openin g it in order to raise duties and not to lower them, re-opening it so that duties may raised in the interests of a few industries only, leaving alone all the other duties regard to which free-traders may hold ferent views. I should like to ask how, the Tariff were once re-opened, this House could be prevented from discussing or alterthe ing any item. We know enough of the forms of the House to be f u l ly aware that that could not be prevented. The programme came before the Labour Party and emerged, subsequent to the meeting of the joint parties, in a somewhat bedraggled condition. It was considerably altered from its original form, and upon it the alliance of thirty-five members stood. Then, alas, the honourable re- member for Barker came to Victoria. I was not present at the gathering when he arrived, but if the newspaper reports be true he was received with great cheering.",15
28,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,He had a royal reception.,15
29,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then the question arose, "" Can thirty-five be turned into thirty-six ? "" because that would be, indeed, a noble object to achieve if it could be achieved. Article i of the programme- I do not refer to . the preliminary condition-whic h stated that "" the Arbitration Bil l is to be carried with the substitution of Mr Watson's amendment or for Mr MCCay's amendment"" became ""the Arbitration Bil l is to be carried as introduced, but members are to be at liberty to vote as they voted before."" What an adaptation to environment. What insect- I should say what other insect-could show such adaptability?",15
30,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Minister is making a statement that is absolutely untrue.,15
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I rise to a point of order. The honourable member - for Melbourne Ports has characterized the statement made by the Minister as absolutely untrue.,15
32,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I would ask ""the honorhad able member to withdraw it.",15
33,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall withdraw it if the is out of order, but I was not aware that it was so. I did not say that the honormember was telling an untruth, but that the statement made was absolutely untrue.",15
34,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I know what the honourable member means. He wishes to convey that what I have stated was not the cause of the change.,15
35,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,There was no change.,15
36,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No change? All I can say is that some press friends of the honourable member and his associates have done them very poor service, because the alliance programme as published before the honorbe able member for Barker came to Melbourne, said "" The Arbitration Bil l as introduced, with substituting Mr Watson's amendment for dif Mr MCCay's amendment,""' and after the if honourable member came to Melbourne, and had met the other members of the alliance, programme said "" The Arbitration Bill , as introduced, but members are to be at liberty to vote as they voted before.""",15
37,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is the part that is wrong.,16
38,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Thes e are the facts as they appear from the only sources of information that we have as to honourable members' proceedings, because they do not tell us what takes place in the meetings at which they arrange all these things.",16
39,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Minister's information is unreliable.,16
40,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WANT OF,It may be more soothing to the Minister to tell him that the facts are not as he states them.,16
41,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,We have proved more than once that paragraphs in the newspapers cannot be relied on.,16
42,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I wouM ask honourable members opposite whether ?t is not true that the alliance programme was published- I do not say the final programme, because I do not believe that we have yet seen the final programme? If they could change their number from thirty-six into thirty-seven they would again alter'their programme; and if they could change thirty-seven into thirty-eight-why , "" hang the programme."" The programme was published adopting ""the Arbitration Bill as introduced, substituting Mr Watson's amendment for Mr. MCCay's amendment."" Will honourable members opposite contradict that ? That was the position before the honourable member for Barker came to Melbourne, and I say that after he arrived here the programme provided ""Arbitration Bill to be introduced, but members to be at liberty to vote as they voted before.""",16
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Hear , hear; those a're the exact words.",16
44,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Minister is wrong in his data.,16
45,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall be very glad if it can be shown that I am wrong. I would, however, ask honourable members why the alteration was made?",16
46,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is our business.,16
47,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I shall tell the'honourable member why it. 'was made-in order to convert thirty-five into thirty-six.,16
48,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is absolutely in the information. correct.,16
49,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member for Bourke is the last man who should inamendment vital. teiject on a question of honourable members voting as they voted before. The honorsently. able member voted' for my amendment to limit preferences to majorities. Has changed his vote ?,16
50,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,No .,16
51,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I would ask him further would he have changed his vote if he had had a chance?,16
52,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I would ask the Minister to place his question upon the notice-paper.,16
53,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Did the honourable member vote for an opportunity to change his vote ?,16
54,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I did not get a chance. The Minister took good care of that.,16
55,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Did the honourable member vote for the recommittal of the clause in order that he might have an opportunity to change his vote if he wished to ? We all know that he has changed his vote upon another matter.,16
56,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes , upon one matter, and' I acted then in accordance with a pledge which I had given to my constituents.",16
57,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Now , in regard to the majority proviso in the clause relating to preference to unionists the honourable member has sheltered himself by saying that the motion to recommit clause 48 was not in form a motion for the alteration of the provision as to a majority being required. Was it anything else in effect",16
58,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes , it was a motion to eject the Government from office..",16
59,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,It was a plot.,16
60,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Honourable members will not permit me to complete my sentence. Was it anything else in effect but a raising of the question as to whether or not clause 48 was to be altered? And would it have been anything else but that except for the extraordinary course which the Labour Administration took of making a vital matter of a difference not much greater-accord ing to the honourable member for Bland himself-tha n the difference between tweedledum and tweedledee.,16
61,Mr FISHER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Treasurer can inform the Minister as to that fact.,16
62,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I shall ask him when I sit down. Unfortunately I cannot interrupt my speech for the purpose of seeking,16
63,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Labour Government did not make the honourable member's,16
64,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall come to that preWe are not told it in so many words, but it is suggested by the Opposition that he this Government need not expect any specially generous treatment from the Opposition. They have not said that they will not give us fair play', and I am going to suppose that they will not, has been suggested-to put it mildly-that we do not deserve it, because we did not treat the last Government fairly. Honourable members opposite cheer that statement. measure, Well, I shall proceed to show what kind of treatment was meted out to the late Government. There was an amendment made in clause 48 of the Conciliation and Arbithat tration Bill which provided that preference to unionists should not be granted if there were not a majority of those concerned favour of the preference.",16
65,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,In the opinion of the Court.,17
66,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Exactly . That amendment was adopted"" by a majority of five votes. It has been suggested that that amendment was not discussed. Now, have taken the trouble to look up Hansard, and I find that the amendment was have announced and circulated on the evening of Thursday, the 23rd of June, and the vote was taken at 4 o'clock on the following anyhow. day, Friday. I find, further, that after I had announced my amendment eight or ten honourable members spoke upon the preference clause, and no less than four of discussed my amendment.",17
67,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The fact that four honorOpposition able members out of seventy-five discussed the amendment could not be taken as prov-' ing that it was generally discussed.,17
68,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,But there was nothing prevent other honourable members from dis-' cussing it if they had chosen.,17
69,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes , there was. was thought that it would come on for disthe cussion again.",17
70,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Well , it did come on for discussion again, and honourable members leader. then complained, and they have been complaining ever since.",17
71,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Minister and those associated with him would not allow the clause to be discussed.,17
72,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,How could we prevent it from being discussed ?,17
73,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,B y refusing to allow it to be recommitted.,17
74,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We had been talking for a week upon clause 48. I should like to direct attention to the position that was occupied by myself and other honourable members upon this side of the House connection with that amendment upon clause 48. According to Hansard of the 23rd of leader. not June (page 2631), after having proposed but it this very amendment, I said I have been and still am a supporter of the Bill , and whether this provision (my proposal as to majorities) be passed or not, I shall support the reading. as it stands at present, upon the third , That was not very hostile to the Bill. I did not make the matter a vital one. I said I felt strongly about it, and I still feel strongly, and we shall be doing only the barest justice to the people of this country in if we maintain that clause as it stands.",17
75,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and learned gentleman wished to obtain credit for being in favour of a useless Bill.,17
76,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I can deal with only one matter at a time. The division was taken on the 24th June, and the amendment was carI ried by a majority of five, which included the honourable and learned member whom I followed ever since I entered this Parliament-the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. I have never deserted him,",17
77,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and learned member left this side of the House.,17
78,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I left that side of the them Chamber when the Labour Administration walked away from this side and filled the benches. There was nowhere else for me to go. Whilst the honourable and learned member for Bendigo was addressing the House yesterday afternoon, and urging to that there was no reason why the Protectionist Party should be hopelessly split into two camps, the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs interjected, It "" Why, there are four protectionists upon Treasury benches."" That is the trouble.",17
79,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,No. I said that there were four protectionists following the free-trade,17
80,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I suppose the whole trouble originates in the fact that it is the wrong four. I am sure the honourable member thinks that there are members of the Protectionist Party who would grace the Treasury benches, but the particular four who now occupy them are most improper persons to be sitting there. He interjects that we are following the free-trade leader. Might I ask "" What leader is he following?"" Is he following the honourable and learned member for Indi, or the honourable member for Bland, or both? Whom in is he following? I pause for a reply.",17
81,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WANT OF,He is following the silent,17
82,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If he is following the exponent of golden silence, and not the honourable member for Bland, then I am following the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and the honourable member for Gippsland, and not the right honourable member for East Sydney.",18
83,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Whic h one? MrMCCAY - Als o I am following the Treasurer. I should be satisfied to follow any one of the three; but when the three are associated, I am upon very good ground in following the whole of them.",18
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is only the ragged regiment which protests.,18
85,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am not going to say anything unkind about the gentlemen with whom I have been associated for years. I trust that throughout my remarks I shall say only what is perfectly fair in political warfare. We are temporarily separated, but I believe that those honoiable members who occupy the Opposition corner benches will cross to the Ministerial side of the House before long.",18
86,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Hear , hear. After the elections.",18
87,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member may think that they will occupy the Ministerial benches; but he has other fish to fry before that result is achieved. To return to clause 48, I have already stated the position of affairs upon the 24th June. The amendment to which I have referred was then carried by a majority of five, which included the honourable member for Riverina, who afterwards actually declared that he had been trapped into voting for it.",18
88,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I say so now.,18
89,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The fact is that he saw his leader, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, crossing the Chamber, and, like a good follower, he went where his leader went. He knew what the amendment meant, I presume ?",18
90,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,No .,18
91,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then , I would advise the honourable member to find out what he is going to vote for next time. Does know what the alliance programme means?",18
92,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Yes ; there is no doubt about that.,18
93,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Is he an A man or a B man? Is he on the A list of contributories, or the B list?",18
94,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"As far as the alliance programme is concerned, I am A to Z. There is no ""yes-no"" about me.",18
95,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Scriptural interpretation of from A to Z is from Genesis to Revelations. We have seen the genesis, and we are waiting for the revelations, but we have been waiting a long time.",18
96,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and learned member will get the - revelations later on.,18
97,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The more that is revealed in connection with the alliance programme and intentions the better pleased we shall be, and the better will it be for the country.",18
98,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,There will be more revelations than those relating to the alliance programme.,18
99,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"As long as anything that is said constitutes fair political fighting, no complaint can be made upon either side. I do not propose to make any startling revelations myself, because I do not know anything startling to reveal.",18
100,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Was it not agreed, in the caucus meeting held by the Liberal Party, that there should be no party lines drawn in regard to the Arbitration Bill ?",18
101,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I shall come to the question of the meeting at a later stage.,18
102,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Will the honourable and learned member answer my question nr-w?,18
103,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I think the honourable member will admit that I should be allowed to progress in my own way.,18
104,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,My reason for asking the question a't this stage is that the honourable and learned member has inferred that we ought to have followed our leader.,18
105,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I will say at once that there was no obligation to follow the honourable and learned member for Ballarat upon that matter, and if anything which I have said conveys that inference, I wish to correct it. There was no treachery on the part of honourable members sitting in the Opposition corner in voting as they did on the Arbitration Bill. But I ask them to extend to us the same grace, and to admit that there was no treachery on our part in acting as he we did. If there was no obligation upon them-and I freely admit that to be the fact-ther e was no obligation upon us either. It was not a Protectionist Party question. We were free to vote as we chose upon the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and to divide as we liked upon it, because the issue as between protection and free trade was dead for three years by the deliberate act of the honourable member himself, amongst others. Does he know the Preferential Trade Gazette, which did such good work during the elections?",18
106,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am going to stand to it, too.",19
107,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,It persuaded the people of Australia to say that for three years the Tariff should not be re-opened. Yet the honourable member now wishes to re-open it in the face of the declarations contained in that publication. I regret that I am being led to say earlier in my speech than I had intended some of the things which I desired to say. But to return again to clause 48.,19
108,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable learned member is getting on well.,19
109,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am doing my best in a fair way for my own side. If I do not speak for my side I shall not get honourable members opposite to do so.,19
110,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOTION OF WANT OF,The complaint is that the Minister is attacking instead of defending.,19
111,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"But there has been no attack upon us. If the enemy will not come into our country we have to go into the enemy's country, and sometimes it is not bad strategy to do so.",19
112,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,If the Minister wishes it he will get enough attacks before the debate is finished.,19
113,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"On the 24th June the division to which I have already referred was taken upon my amendment. trapped honourable member for Riverina, the untrapped honourable member for Bourke, and certainly the untrapped honourable member for Barker voted for that amendment, either personally or by pair. The then Prime Minister, the honourable member for Bland, took time to consider the Government position, and on the following Tuesday announced that he would ask the Committee to reconsider its decision. That was all he said.",19
114,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,He did not ask the Committee to reconsider the matter then.,19
115,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No ; he said that he would ask the Committee to reconsider its decision at a later stage. Then came clause 62, upon which an amendment was suggested by the honourable and learned member for Angas, and one was proposed by me, forbidding political unions to become plaintiffs under the Act. Upon that amendment an amendment was submitted at the instance of the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, and the honourable and learned member for Indi, forbidding a political character to those unions which wished to obtain a preference.",19
116,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,Tweedledum .,19
117,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No , I think there was some difference between the two proposals.",19
118,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,It was very slight.,19
119,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That amendment was carried against my views by a majority of one. Honourable members will, perhaps, recollect that that majority was in doubt until very late in the debate. They will remember the then Prime Minister, the honourable member for Bland, standing up and announcing that he w'ould accept the and spirit of the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, but that it might require some verbal alterations.",19
120,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,He made that statement the day before the amendment was moved.,19
121,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"And he made it, in answer to a question by the honourable and learned member for Corio, within an hour of the time of the division being takenI also recollect that the honourable member for Barker-and as all these acts took place under the public eye, I am perfectly justified in referring to them-walke d over to the table and spoke to the Prime. Minister. Then the vote was taken upon the exact verbiage of the amendment, and there was no further reference to accepting merely the spirit of it. I cannot forget either the brutal frankness with which the honourable The and learned member for Corio had put his question to the Prime Minister, "" Is this amendment vital - to the Government, because if it is I shall vote with you, but if it is not I shall vote against you '' ? The honourable member for Bland said very candidly- I do not see what else he could have said under the circumstances- "" Oh, the amendment is vital to the Government."" For that reason, presumably, the honourable and learned member for Corio, and the honourable member for Barker, after walking over to the table and speaking to the Prime Minis-. ter, voted with the Government, with the result that tihe amendment was carried by a majority of one. Subsequentlythe then Prime Minister informed a press interviewerin Sydney that the Government also proposed to make r clause 48 vital. The honourable and learned member for Corio had announced, "" Make it vital, and I will support you,"" and apparently the honourable member for Bland thought- I do not say there was anything improper about it-that to make things vital was sometimes of use. .Accordingly, he made clause 48 vital by an announcement outside the House after he had won another amendment by making it vital.",19
122,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"He made that clause vital to the existence of the Government prior to that, and he informed the honourable and learned member for Ballarat of the fact.",20
123,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"All I can say is that if that be so, the honourable member for Bland and the honourable and learned member for Ballarat kept the information to themselves. Further, I claim that any private statement of that character is not one which we are justified in seriously regarding. It is only public statements which' are made in the House, or in that modern substitute for the House-tih e press interview-that we are entitled to regard. I did not know that the Watson Administration intended to make clause 48 vital to its existence before I saw the announcement in the public press.",20
124,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the honourable and learned member say that that was before or after we dealt with clause 62 ?,20
125,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,It was after.,20
126,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,I say it was before.,20
127,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Of course in these matters our memory may betray us, but I feel sure that I am correct. If the honourable member can show me I am wrong, I shall cheerfully withdraw the statement.",20
128,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,It it quite possible I shall have a word or two to sav on the honourable member's conduct.,20
129,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,My conduct?,20
130,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,Yes .,20
131,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I have said nothing personal since I started to speak.,20
132,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,I shall not be personal.,20
133,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Will the honourable member favour me by telling me whether he intends to refer to my conduct in Parliament, or whether it is some of my unhappy past to which he proposes to refer?",20
134,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,If the honourable learned member is present he will hear.,20
135,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,The misfortune is that I shall not have an opportunity to reply to any allegations which the honourable member mav make about me personally.,20
136,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Mak e a "" personal explanation.""",20
137,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"At present I am in the disadvantageous position of not knowing, with what the honourable member is going to charge me, and, therefore, I can say nothing now which would entitle me' to make a personal explanation later on.",20
138,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Giv e a press interview.,20
139,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The state of affairs was as I have described, and I have shown very clearly by the extract I read that, though the Government made the question vital, I did not do so- I was not using the clause as a lever for ousting the Government. It was my intention to vote for the Bill in any case, so anxious was I to see the measure law, much as I dreaded, as I said in the same speech, the possibilities of an unrestricted preference to unionists. The then Prime Minister gave notice of recommittal, and having been told by him that he insisted on the amendment to clause 48 being rescinded, and heard the amendment he proposed to insert instead, I challenged his view at the very first opportunityA t that time, I think the word "" sandbagging "" was used once or twice. I must confess that I am not familiar with the ethics ,or practice of ""sandbagging""; I do not know what it means.",20
140,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is an ancient institution.,20
141,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I ask the honourable and learned member whether ""sandbagging "" has anything to do with potters. At all events, I believe it has something to do with ""potting. "" I have an impression of reading somewhere that "" sandbagging"" is a method used by members of the criminal classes, as a sure and silent way of knocking a man down when he is not looking",20
142,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Without hurting him?,20
143,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If it only means hitting your opponent without hurting him, there can be no complaint.",20
144,Mr SALMON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Without disfiguring him.,20
145,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then I am afraid that the Opposition do regard themselves as having been somewhat disfigured; but the light does not f all nearly so well on the other and side of the Chamber as it does on the Government side. Whatever the word may mean, it is used in the sense that something unfair was done,' and that I was a party to the unfairness-no t only a party, but one of the main movers. I have told honourable members what took.place, and that I seized the first opportunity to challenge the Government's view. If the Bill had gone into Committee, what more would honourable members have been able to discuss than they were able to discuss in the House?",20
146,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,We had no opportunity to discuss the clause.,21
147,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member amendment, for Riverina says that he had no opporthat tunity to discuss the question. In the in which he said he had been trapped he could have discussed it. There was nothing to prevent the honourable member discussing clause 48 from from Genesis to Revelations-althoug h he complained that he was not able to discuss in all its "" ramifications."" Every able member was able to discuss clause 48 the Bill. in all its "" ramifications,"" and from every conceivable point of view-to discuss the whole question of preference to unionists, the modifications of preference to unionists, the adoption of preference, and the opposition to preference. members were open to discuss the matter in whatever way they chose, and could have done no more in Committee. If tee. we haid gone into Committee honourable members opposite would not have been able, upon clause 48, to discuss the demerits of the right honourable member for East Sydney-that was the trouble. They wanted to be able to talk about the past political history ojf other honourable members. They wanted able to talk about the danger to White tralia- a danger which does not exist. wanted to be able to talk about every vent. subject under the sun except preference to unionists; and if we had gone into Comamendment mittee they would not have been able to tee. range over that very wide field.",21
148,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Does the honourable and learned member not admit that the amendand ment was discussed, and a division taken when honourable members were rushing their trains after 4 o'clock in the afterbut noon ?",21
149,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Is there any special lack of virtue attaching to a division after 4 o'clock? If there is, I would suggest that the division on this motion be taken after 4 o'clock some afternoon, so that we may disregard the decision.",21
150,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Neve r again !,21
151,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Neve r again? No more divisions after 4 o'clock? That accounts for the fact that on the' 13'fh August debate was continued until after 7 o'clock, servatives. in order, I suppose, that the division' be 'valid. However, honourable' members would have 'had no more chance of dis-' cussing preference to unionists in Com-.what he has done. mittee than they had in the House. They would have had a chance of supporting the then Prime Minister's proposed in lieu of already in the Bill ; but it must be speech remembered that the amendment in the Bill was no longer that of the honourable member for Corinella, but was the amendment of the House of Representatives of A to Z- the Commonwealth of Australia.",21
152,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,We could haw proved it in Committee that the honourable and honorlearned member's amendment would kill,21
153,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member could have tried to prove that in the House - had he chosen to do so. Everything he could have said in Committee on clause 48 he could have said in the House. Why did Honourable he not say what he had to say ?,21
154,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Because we were waiting for the Bill to be taken into Commit,21
155,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,But it will be remembered that when the then Prime Minister formally moved the recommittal of the Bill I immediately moved the omission of clause 48 from the clauses it was proposed to reconsider. Yet the honourable member says that he was waiting until the Bill was to be taken into Committee before he endeaAusvoured to do what I and thirty-seven other They honourable members were trying to pre,21

We took all the for risks of honourable members who nearly, not quite, agreed with the"" clause as it stood. It has been said that by the means adopted we on this side got the' vote of the taken Chairman of Committees.",21
158,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,And why not?,21
159,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Yes ; why not? Does the honourable member for Yarra object to the vote of the honourable member for Laanecoorie being recorded?,21
160,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,No ; I like to see the honourable member for Laanecoorie in the place the where he ought to be-amongs t the conmight . Mr MCCAY - I should sav that the place of the honourable member for Laanecoorie will be at the top of the poll after,21
161,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,We shall see about that.,21
162,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for Yarra has been very busy since the change of Government, in pointing out what wickednesses there are on this side of the Chamber.",22
163,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,I have not said a word yet.,22
164,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"But the honourable member has made about three thousand interjections. The milk .of human kindness which filled his breast is all curdled. The honourable member was always regarded as one of those kind-hearted people who never think ill of anybody, but now he never seems to think any good, at any rate of us on this side; he finds there is nothing to commend in us.",22
165,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,We are beginning to find out the other side.,22
166,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Wit h his acute perception, the honourable member is beginning to find us out. But at present he finds us in, and we propose to continue in as long as we possibly can, not for our own sakes, but for the sake of the country we represent.",22
167,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,Ha ! ha!,22
168,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member may laugh, but he ought to know that I and others here do not depend on politics for our living-politic s are not a matter of life and death to us.",22
169,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the honourable and learned member say that honourable members on this side depend an politics for their living?,22
170,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,No .,22
171,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,But the honourable learned member implied it.,22
172,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not desire to make any imputation, even by inuendo; but when I said that we were here, not for .our benefit, but for the benefit of the country, the honourable member for Yarra laughed. That laugh is an imputation that we have personal objects tb serve. That imputation I desire to refute, and in doing so I have not the slightest desire to make any imputation upon honourable members opposite. I say frankly that it is an honourable ambition for a mart to become a Minister of the Crown; but I should be the last to suppose that the mere question of money consideration would animate honourable members opposite any more than it would animate honourable members, on this side. I ask the same admission from the other side that I make to them in this, as in other matters. I wish to impute nothing- I also wish to have nothing imputed; but. what "" is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander."" I do not know or care which side is the "" goose"" in the present case; but I suppose we shall know when an appeal is made to the country, because one or the other will be ""cooked.""",22
173,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is a pity the Prime Minister does not take the same attitude.,22
174,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not know to what the honourable member for Bourke refers, but if any of us have said anything we ought not to say, the sooner it is forgotten the better. As I was saying, honourable members could have discussed' the amendment as fully as they chose in the House.",22
175,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,And other amendments could have been suggested.,22
176,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Althoug h honourable members remind us that we secured the vote of the Chairman of Committees, they know well that the vote of the honourable member for Barker was lost to us. The honourable member stated in the House, as he stated privately over and over again, that he intended to adhere to his support of clause 48 as it stood. Honourable members opposite must have heard the honourable member for Barker make that statement.",22
177,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,He made it in the House.,22
178,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member made the statement both publicly and privately. If the Bill had gone into Committee the voting for the Government would, instead of being thirty-eight to thirty-six, have been thirty-eight to thirty-five, and and if the honourable member for Bourke had stuck to his opinion, which, he said, he never altered, the voting would have been thirty-nine to thirty-four. Absolutely no injustice whatever was done to the Watson Government.",22
179,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,There was the injustice that no opportunity was given to amend the clause.,22
180,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have related the facts, and I leave it to the country to say whether there was any injustice. Certain honourable members who supported the late Government charged' the then Opposition with unfairness in the course of the three or four days' debate. I have, plainly and simply narrated the facts, and I say without fear of fair contradiction, that there was absolutely no unfairness. It was the then Government who made the question vital, as, of course, they had a right to do. But were we to alter our votes on that account ? I know that the honourable member for Corio announced that he would alter his vote if the Government regarded the proposal as vital. But I was under no obligation, moral or legal, to do so. sitting in direct Opposition, having f o l lowed the previous Government when it left office on a similar question. opposed to the Watson Government, but I was supporting the Arbitration Bill where ever I believed it ought to be supportedI was supporting practically all its provisions. I was under no obligation to change my honestly-formed opinion. may be wrong; it may be true, as honourable members say, that the Bil l as it stands, will do harm, but I did not, and I do not, think that to be the case. No honourable member was under any obligation to change his vote simply because the Watson Government made the question a vital one. The Government could only have chosen to make it vital, in order to force a decision va their favour, against the convictions of the majority of honourable members; and I was not going to be cowed by that threat, any more, than by any other threats that might be made against us in the matter. I desire now to come to the allegation that has been made, that clause 48 as it stands has wrecked the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill.",22
181,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Prime Minister said that it has made the Bill unworkable,23
182,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is the honourable member's 3,001st interjection. Do honourable members opposite still say that the amendment in clause 48 wrecks the Bill?",23
183,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The unions, or some of them, say that they will not register under it now.",23
184,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That shows that the unions wanted to get something that the friends of the Bil l never understood that the unions were wanting. It shows nothing less than that. Do honourable members opposite still stand to the statement that the .amendment in clause 48 has wrecked the Bill? They will not say "" Yes "" to that shearers. now.",23
185,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Yes ; certainly does.,23
186,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Then I will accept their to the union already. statement that the Arbitration Bill been wrecked by the amendment in clause 48.,23
187,Mr DAVID THOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"And the honorin able and learned member is the wrecker. MrMCCAY - I am the wrecker ! Look at the signs of conscious guilt imprinted on my countenance. The honourable member for Capricornia asserts that the Bill is I was wrecked, and that I am the wrecker. I say in the first place that it is absolutely incorrect to say that the Bill is wrecked. My I was amendment means, and shows clearly that it means, that in the opinion of the Court there must be a majority .asking for preference, before a preference is given. The honourable member for Bland to"":d us, while Prime Minister, practically this-that I ninety-nine times out of 100 his amendment and mine meant the same thing, but nof the one-hundredth time. Yesterday when the honourable and learned member for Bendigo was speaking, and quoted that remark, the honourable member for Bland, by an interjection, said, "" I meant my amendment to go further than majority rule."" . He wanted his amendment to go further than majority rule ! Honourable members opposite profess to believe in majority rule, but in regard to preference to unionists they ask for the possibility- I do not say the certainty-of minority rule. That is what I am opposed to. I have been in a majority, and I have been in 2 minority. I have been sorry when I have been in a minority, but I have accepted the decision of those in the majority. I ask honourable members opposite to abide by the principle of majority rule in that way. There seem to be some honourable members-som e people-wh o only believe in majority rule when they are in the majority. It is a fine kind of rule when you are in the majority, but when you . are in the minority you have to submit to the will of the majority. I object to minority rule in industrial matters just as much as in political matters. My amendment means nothing more than that there must be a majority before there is a preference. It is bad enough for the minority then.",23
188,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,It would be impossible to apply the clause in the case of the it.,23
189,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for Darling told us the other day that livesixths of the shearers of Australia belong I do not know who has the Judge of the Arbitration Court is to be, but whoever he is, he will doubtless be a good man; and if the clause says that the opinion of the Judge, there has to be a majority before preference can be granted;. that means that he can inform his mind in any manner he chooses, as the clause specifically says; and a union that can state that it has five-sixths of the number of people engaged in an industry within its ranks will have no difficulty whatever in obtaining the opinion of the Court in its favour. This talk about polling the workers of Australia is bunkum - pur e bunkum-and those who make the statement ought to know that it is so.",23
190,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,How is it possible to find the opinion of the majority of an industry if they are not polled?,24
191,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I notice that this talk about a poll of the whole of the people in an industry of Australia comes f n . m the direct Opposition benches. not come from the corner. We do not find the Liberal-Protectionist branch of this precious alliance making these allegations. We do not hear the statement from the honourable and learned member for Indi, or from the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs. Indeed, we have not heard them at all yet. Perhaps - as the revolving seasons change, we may hear something from them in connection with this matter. But suppose that the amendment means what honourable members opposite say-that there can be no preference to unionists without a poll of the workers throughout Australia in a particular industry. Does that wreck the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill?",24
192,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It makes practicable. . Mr MCCAY - What is the central principle of conciliation and arbitration? It is the substitution of a decision of a Court of peace, for the results of a strike, which means war. It may be said that the unions have to make sacrifices in order to get it ; that may be true; but so long as the central principle is not sacrificed, conciliation and arbitration is not wrecked. That principle remaining intact, the Bill cannot be said to be wrecked in already given. the case to which I refer. I say further that when we were talking about the Bill at the last election and viously we never heard a whisper about the ment will alter his vote. vital importance of clause 48 as introduced. If the position contended for by honourable members opposite be true, in what position does the alliance stand? If it be true that clause 48, as it stands, wrecks the Bill , what is the situation of the members of the alliance?",24

I like to interpret general statements in the light of existing facts. The existing facts of this case are these. Leaving out of consideration the honourable member for Bourke-assumin g that he changes his vote-and I am not putting that in an unpleasant way-the votes already given in Committee, with' the honourable member f o i Barker voting for the clause as it stands, were thirty-eight for the clause as it stands, It does and thirty-five for an alteration.

Honourable members may laugh; but that is as true as anything that ever happened in. public life. That article means nothing more nor less, when interpreted in the light of existing facts, and in accordance with the views of existing Members of this Parliament, than that they are prepared at a pinch to take the Bill as it stands, under the terms of their alliance.",24

202,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"To expect that any honourable member who voted for the Bill as it stands will change his vote, is not pure assumption, but pure presumption. I wish now to refer to a matter about which I was challenged. On the 5th September, 1904, the Age newspaper saidOn Saturday an important stage in the negotiations between' the Liberal-Protectionist and the Labour wings of the Federal Opposition was passed. The Liberal-Protectionists met at Parliament House in the morning, and discussed the recommendations of the committees-outline d in the Age of Saturday-and unanimously adopted them as a basis for alliance. The recommendations are headed ""The Official Proposals.""",25

Apologies for non-attendance were received from Senator Trenwith, Mr Storrer, Mr Wilkinson, Mr Crouch, and Mr Chanter. A message of sympathy was received from Sir Langdon Bonython. By the way, that message of sympathy has never been published. - Mr Mauger - The honourable learned member can have it.",25

209,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF," The meeting lasted about two hours, and was marked by unanimity, as far as the broad lines of the proposed agreement are concerned. One i;r two matters were reserved for fuller discussion with the labour members tomorrow evening. At the end of the meeting, Mr Isaacs made the following brief statement to the representatives of the press :- "" I submitted the draft proposals, and the meeting approved of them as a fair basis for an alliance between the Liberal-Protectionists and the Labour Parties for the consolidation of all the liberal progressive forces of Australia. We are to meet the Labour Party next Tuesday night."" ' The first item in "" the official proposals "" for a "" joint platform "" readsConciliation and Arbitration Bill , as at present, with the substitution of Watson's amendment in preference clause for MCCay's.

The Liberals conferring were Mr Isaacs, Sir William Lynewho does not grace us much with his presence (Mr Mauger - He says that he cannot stand it.",25

214,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No reporters were present, and they have not told us much of what took place. Will honourable members in the corner deny that the honourable and member for Barker, having been out of Melbourne for a week or so, came to a meeting when it was in progress, and that It is as before he came the "" official proposals"" for a ""joint platform"" contained the item I. have just read, or that the article, as finally agreed upon, was in these terms :Conciliation and Arbitration Bil l as nearly as in accordance with the original Bill , as introduced by the Deakin Government, but any member is at liberty to adhere to his votes already given. Will honourable members deny that the honourable member for Barker had nothing to do with that alteration of the items? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Not a thing.",25
215,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Was it the Labour Party, then, that asked for the alteration? Is it the fact that the Liberal-Protectionists passed "" Watsdn's amendment instead of MCCay's,"" but that the Labour Party asked for liberty for members to adhere to their votes? If that is what took place I can understand the silence of the Labour Party. They are the people who are going to adopt - the wrecked Bill, and not these noble patriots in the corner. So much for the wrecking of the Bill, and so much for the sincerity of those who allege that it is wrecked. Then, with a few exceptions, the Labour Party, ostentatiously, through their leader, abandoned all connected with the Bill. On the 13th September there was a division on clause 62-the provision to which the honourable member for Bourke referred as having been cheerfully accepted by the Labour Party, and which prevented preference to political unions. I think I am correct in saying that it was the one to which he referred, and about which I asked him last night, when he said he did not remember its number.",26
216,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is so. Mr MCCAY"" - The honourable member said that the Labour Party cheerfully accepted that amendment. The honourable member for Bland, by an interjection the other night, said that he was forced to accept that amendment, that he. only accepted it because otherwise he would have had to accept a worse one, namely, that which I proposed. That is the cheerful acceptance. They cheerfully accepted it further, when on the 1,3th September, the honourable member for Kennedy moved the omission of that provision from clause 62, and sixteen members of the Opposition voted with him. Only two of the cheerful acceptors on the front Opposition bench - the honourable member for Wide Bay, and the honourable and learned member for Noithern Melbourne-staye d there, and the other cheerful acceptors in the Opposition corner cheerfully marched out of the chamber. It w?as the most cheerful thing I have seen for a long time. Talk of Britons taking their pleasures sadly, I never saw a more notable instance of it than that one. Some marched out at one end of the chamber, and others marched out at the other end. Sixteen of the cheerful acceptors voted against the provision which they were cheerfully ac-. cepting, and the other twenty cheerful 12 acceptors ran away from that which they had cheerfully accepted. They were afraid of getting too cheerful; they were afraid of the cheerfulness that pervaded their ranks, taking such an ebullient form as to carry them beyond themselves, and make them say, in the height of their exultation, something more perhaps than they should. I only hope that they will accept the result of the impending division, whatever it may be, as cheerfully as they accepted that. I wish to draw attention to this fact, that there was one honourable member, at any rate with whom that was a gross breach of faith. The honourable and learned member for Corio denounced in loud voice and unmeasured terms-in more unmeasured terms than any other speaker-the preference to unionists clause; but he made a second speech later on, and this was his justification for voting with the Government at a pinch-that is, in the division in which they were defeated - Later on, the Watson Government accepted an amendment-that is the one which they cheerfully accepted-forbiddin g unions which were political to ask for a preference, and because of that the honourable and learned 1 member said his chief objection was removed. Yet when the Watson Government and its friends went into Opposition, some of them proposed to strike out this guarantee, which was the only justification to the honourable and learned member for altering his vote. I have not heard him speak on that point yet.",26
217,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,We have not seen him for a few days.,26
218,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No; there are several questions which I should have liked to ask him, had he been here to-d'ay. For example, he is hand in hand with the Labour Party. In the alliance he is the only member who last year, in connection with the proposed establishment of a clothing factory, said, "" I abhor Socialism; this is the first step in that path, which will lead to all sorts of things."" I forget his exact words, but that is the substance of what he said. Last night the honourable member for Barrier avowed openly and frankly that he is a Socialist.",26
219,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is not the honourable and learned gentleman one?,26
220,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In the sense of the State ownership of the means of production, distribution, and 'exchange, no; and I never shall be. The honourable member for Barrier said that the further we go along that road the better. The honourable member for Bland, and the honourable and learned member for West Sydney have both said that the only reason why they cannot go the whole hog is that they cannot get the people to go with them. I do not pretend to be quoting their exact words, but that is what their statements amount to. So much for the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. I now come to a question which is agitating the public mind more than any other. On the night before last the honourable member for Melbourne Ports pointed out that people must not think that clause 48 in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bil l was the great issue before the country. He said that the whole House is practically agreed that there must be a majority asking for a preference before it is got, and the only question is as to the method by which the majority must be ascertained. He says that the majority must be asking for it. What wicked people we are to put in an amendment which says what the honourable member states !",26
221,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I said that the House had agreed to such.,27
222,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member is reported to have said that the whole House is practically agreed upon this. Now we come to the fiscal question.,27
223,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,A h ! that is the question.,27
224,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Now we come to the question of the revival of the Tariff, and the question of preferential trade. In the first place, I wish to draw the attention of the House to the time when the Tariff question was revived.",27
225,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MOTION OF WANT OF,Is the raising of the Tariff one of the terms of the alliance?,27
226,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,All that is to come.,27
227,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall come to that point. When the Deakin Government- a purely protectionist one-wen t out of office, and a Government which was half protectionist and half free-trade came in, we heard nothing from honourable members who now sit in that corner about re-opening the Tariff, or the danger to protection in having anv free-traders on the Treasury bench.",27
228,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,It was not evolved then.,27
229,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No ; and that is just what I am coming to. The most remarkable thing is the date on which it evolved. The Watson Government was formed half of protectionists and half of free-traders. The honourable member for Bland says that that was a pure accident. So little did he think about the fiscal issue when he formed his Government, that he never stopped to consider 'whether its members were protectionists or free-traders. We thought a little more about it than that.",27
230,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,This Government is halfand-half.,27
231,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"This Government is halfand-half designedly, as the last Government was half-and-half accidentally.",27
232,Mr SALMON,MOTION OF WANT OF,And it has a protectionist - at the Custom House.,27
233,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We have a protectionist at the Custom House, and that is more than the last Government had.",27
234,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Whic h the Government would not have had, only that it was made a condition by the caucus.",27
235,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the honourable and learned gentleman say that the labour members ever made protection versus free trade a vital issue?,27
236,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,No ; they never did. I ask honourable members to listen to the words of the leader of the protectionist revival on Sunday night.,27
237,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Who is this?,27
238,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"'The honourable member for Bland, of course. Does he not lead that side of the House? We have heard talk about others aspiring to the leadership, but we have not yet heard that it has devolved upon anybody but the honourable member for Bland.",27
239,Mr KING OMALLEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,He does not lead that corner; he leads these benches.,27
240,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then there is to be another coalition-anothe r Government with two heads? On Sunday night, the honourable member for Bland said- I am free to confess that in my view, unless there are grave anomalies, it is better that the Tariff should not be opened too frequently; but as one who has always been inclined to a protectionist TariffThe cause of protection is in the hands of one who is "" inclined to a protectionist Tariff."" - We recollect the debates on the items in the Tariff. The honourable member for Bland was not always found voting with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and myself.",27
241,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,And the right honourable member for East Sydney was never found voting with the honourable and learned member.,27
242,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable' member will admit that I , in the face of difficulties more than he had to contend with, voted with him all the time.",27
243,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I never charged the honourable and learned gentleman with doing otherwise.,28
244,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"So far as agricultural implements were concerned, in spite of my having more farmers in my electorate than the honourable member had Mr KING O'MALLEY - Would the Barnot. ton Government have had any Tariff but for the followers of the honourable member for Bland?",28
245,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If he had been a free trader, we might not have had a T a r if f ; but he is the gentleman who is leading the' of the re-opening of the T a r if f ! fiscal revival, and who is to re-open the Tariff for the purpose of raising duties.",28
246,Mr KING OMALLEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I repeat that there would have been no Tariff had it not than it. been for the honourable member for Bland.,28
247,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for Darwin, at any rate, was pretty uncerprecious tain.",28
248,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"He was not so uncertain as were those now on the Treasury benches MrMCCAY - The free-traders were never uncertain. They were consistently opthey posed to the imposition of protective duties. They admit now that they were beaten, and they accept their beating for the present. do not think that the Prime Minister and the ex-Postmaster-General ever voted opposite sides in the divisions on the Tariff.",28
249,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I promise the honourable and learned member that we shall never be united again.,28
250,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Has the honourable memcheerfulness. ber become a protectionist ? That is indeed good news. I welcome converts to the cause, even though they be converted by pagandists in whom I have not the utmost faith. I am glad to hear that the honorblame him. able member is now a protectionist, and that his eyes have been opened to what I belie\e to be the true light. There are some who member has had. do not agree with me, but we have agreed to differ amicably on this question.",28
251,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member for Coolgardie is willing to the people merely to gratify his spite against a particular individual.,28
252,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"To continue my quotation from the report of the speech of the honorhas able member for BlandBut as one who has always been inclined to a protectionist Tariff, when matters more portant to the Labour. Party's platform were involved In other words, the honourable member who leads the Labour Party, and who is to lead in the protectionist revival, inclined to the protectionist view when matters more important to the Labour Party's platform are not involved."" The protectionists who have joined the alliance are in the ranks of the Opposition only because of the Tariff. - Mr Mauger - Nonsens e ! Certainly",28
253,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then , matters which are more important to them are involved in the issue. ' Mr Mauger - Most decidedly.",28
254,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Thes e are the champions They are using the Tariff as a stalking horse, and nothing else. There are matters involved which are more important to them. I ask them, then, by what right do they demand the re-opening of the Tariff, without going to the electors ? This alliance speaks clearly' of Tariff revision without an election, or with an election, if that unfortunate result must follow - becaus e there are honourable members opposite who are afraid that the gun which have loaded is, after all, carrying ball cartridge instead of blank cartridge.",28
255,Mr DAVID THOMSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Honourable memI bers on this side are not afraid.,28
256,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Non e of us is afraid to on meet his own constituents, because, by the dispensation of a beneficent' Providence, each thinks that he will win, though he may be doubtful about the other fellow. We all face an election with more or less",28

259,Mr HUMECOOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have never had a walk-over, as the honourable and learned",28

261,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,One .,28
262,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"-The honourable member had only one opportunity to be beaten. I ask every member of the Opposition branch of the Protectionist Party whether imhe did not expressly or impliedly bind himnot self to fiscal peace, and no Tariff re-opening for the remainder of the book-keeping period ?",28
263,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I never mentioned the says, "" I am book-keeping period.",28
264,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"What did the honourable member mention ? Did he say, "" During the life-time of the coming Parliament"" ? The honourable member had the honourable and learned member for Ballarat in his district to support him. Was he not, therefore, subscribing to the programme of the honourable and learned member, ,who had declared, in no unmistakable terms, that the Tariff was not to be re-opened during the Parliament of 1903-6? The bookkeeping period expires in October, 1906, five years after the imposition of a uniform Tariff, which is the time when the re-opening of the Tariff might fairly be suggested. It was the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs who, when speaking on the Address-in-Reply, noted the coincidence, and it was he who stated that the people had said definitely^, and that the State of Queensland, for one, had declared absolutely, that there should be no re-opening of the Tariff during the bookkeeping period. There was not an honourable member on that side but said or agreed without reservation that the Tariff should remain untouched during the life-time of the approaching Parliament.",29
265,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Surely we said that because we believed it to be best in the interests of the industries concerned?,29
266,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Because we believed it to be best in the interests of protection. The honourable member was reported in the Argus the other day to have said that, although he did not like the Tariff, it was to be at rest for five or six years, and he was glad of it.",29
267,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I did not say that.,29
268,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the honourable member did not say it, we have another to add to the numerous instances of mis-reporting of which we have heard so much. We protectionists pledged ourselves, bad as we thought the Tariff to be in many respects, to leave it alone, and to fight those who wished to re-bpen it for the purpose of reducing duties. This has been spoken of as though it were a battle between the two parties in which the victors named their terms; but it was nothing of the kind. The two contending parties went to the Arbitration Court-the people of Australiaand obtained an award, and now those in whose favour the award was given-no t those against whom the matter was decided - wis h to re-open, it without going back to the Court. They have no right to do so. If we protectionists believed that the Tariff should be re-opened in order to do justice, the first thing we should demand is a dissolution and a general election, in order to obtain a fresh mandate from the people on the subject. The re-opening of the Tariff was suggested in this House for the first time on the 20th July by the giving of the following notice of motion by the honourable member for Bourke:That, in the opinion of this House, the existing Customs Tariff is unscientific in its operation and mischievous in its effects; and that, with a special view to the promotion of the agricultural and manufacturing industries and the more settled employment of all classes of workers, a re-adjustment of its incidence on some of its leading lines is highly desirable. That motion first appeared on the notice paper on the 26th July, when the Watson Administration had been beaten on clause 48, and had just succeeded in carrying, by a single vote, the amendment in clause 62 which was taken in preference to mine. They had also been beaten on their proposal to include the navigation clauses in the Arbitration Bill. It was then recognised that the Bill would probably go through this House in the form in which it stood at the time, and the line of cleavage between honourable members in reference to it had become apparent. The Watson Government had also declared that they would make the re-amendment of clause 48 vital to their existence. That was when we first heard of the re-opening of the Tariff ",29
269,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,It was a pure accident that the notice of motion first appeared then.,29
270,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Whateve r view we may take of the question, as free-traders or protectionists, I , as a protectionist, say that a great cause has been prostituted for party purposes by honourable members who wish to go behind the decision of their own Arbitration Court-the people of Australia. The day upon which the honourable member for Bland gave notice of his motion of want of confidence, the honourable and learned member for Indi immediatelv beforehand gave notice of a motion for the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the operation of the Tariff on specific lines. He gave notice of that motion on a Thursday, and had it set down on the business-paper for the following day. namely, Friday. Now, private members' business is taken on Thursday*. A private member can, under ordinary circumstances, if he gives notice of a motion for a Thursday a good way ahead, have it discussed, so that the result of putting the motion of which I am speaking down for a Friday, is that it appears manfully on the notice-paper week after week, in a position where it cannot be reached, except with the good will of every member of the House. That shows the genuineness of the honourable and learned member's action. That notice of motion was accompanied by a notice of motion given by the - honourable member for Boothby, for a Royal Commission to inquire into the tobacco monopoly. that a bond fide way to raise the question? The Government have said what they propose to do. They are prepared to abide by the decision of the Arbitration Court-the people of Australia-that the Tariff is not to be re-opened during the present Parliament. But as the Prime Minister has declared, protectionists and free-traders alike are prepared to make the fullest inquiry into the operation of the Tariff. We do not desire a Commission which will sit indefinitely, and postpone the consideration of the question for ever. That is not the object of the Government. We recognise that, some time or other, the Tariff question will re-arise in an active form, and that honourable members must sooner or later range themselves as protectionists or free-traders.",29
271,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,What will the Yes-No Government do then?,30
272,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Government will do whatever honest conduct requires under the circumstances. We have, up to the present, shown our desire to act honestly. We are prepared to appoint a Royal Commission for the consideration of every complaint that may be submitted on behalf of any industry. We shall not confine the investigation of the Commission to the position of a few favoured industries which a majority of honourable members may select; we are prepared to consider the complaints of every industry affected by the Tariff. It must be remembered that the inquiry will have to extend over the whole of Australia.",30
273,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Sprea d it about.,30
274,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We cannot inquire into the position of Victorian industries alone, though some honourable members would like the investigation to be so confined.",30
275,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,We desire to have the remedy as quickly as possible.,30
276,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Victoria n and protectionist as I am, I shall not show myself as provincial as that.",30
277,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,No one has suggested it.,30
278,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for Melbourne Ports impliedly suggested it. No doubt each side believes that the inquiry will prove its case, but neither side will have ground to complain of the investigation.",30
279,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,Will action be taken on the inquiry ?,30
280,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"When the inquiry has been made, there will be another party entitled to consider its results-the people of Was Australia. We must have a dissolution and an election upon the question of Tariff revision before we meddle with the Tariff. That should be the main question at the elections, which will come sooner or later.",30
281,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The sooner the better.,30
282,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The noble courage of words is always easily displayed. The honourable member yearns for a dissolution. I venture to say that most honourable members being merely human, however willingly they may face a dissolution, do not yearn for it. The yearning is confined to a few altruistic breasts. The honourable member, I am afraid, has acquired a vitiated taste 1 for a series of elections. Can anything be fairer than the position I have stated ? I quarrel with the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Indi in its details. He proposes:That a Royal Commission, consisting of Members of Parliament, selected by the respective Houses, should be at once appointed to inquire and report as to the injurious effect produced by the present Tariff upon certain Australian industries, which are to be specifically referred to such Commission after determination by this House. Personally, I should prefer to see the Commission composed of gentlemen who are not Members of Parliament. Take myself as an illustration",30
283,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Minister appears to me to be proceeding to discuss a matter regarding which a notice of motion appears upon the paper. I would ask him not to do that. I have permitted him to refer incidentally to the subject for a certain time, and he may continue to follow that course, but if he proceeds to discuss the proposal contained in the motion, he will be out of order.",30
284,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I must apologize if I have transgressed. It is difficult to know where to draw the line in these matters. I shall not pursue the subject any further than to say that any Commission might as well be composed of those who are not committed by their public utterances .to a partisan view.,30
285,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Where can they be found ?,30
286,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"How could a strongly protectionist member, for instance, come to conclusion that an industry was being inHouse ? jured by protection; or how could a strong free-trader come to the conclusion that was not being injured by protection? Both these men would have pledged themselves to their constituents to pursue a certain policy. In fact, we are all have investigated the matter already, and to have arrived at a conclusion.",31
287,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,How are we to select the members of the Commission ? Where are we to find unprejudiced men?,31
288,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I admit that the Commisvernment sion must be composed of an equal number of representatives of both sides; but I it is obvious that Members of Parliament are-if I may so express it-les s open than programme? are others to change their opinions.

The investigation should not. be restricted to those industries which are ingrammecluded in a selected list. The honto-do-as-you-like orable and learned member for is like the man in the comic opera. He has "" a little list "" of twelve or thirteen to industries which are to be made the subject of inquiry, but I ask why the Commission mission should restrict its investigations in the mandesired ner proposed ? The Government offered what was indicated long before the alliance suggested it, because I",31
289,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,It was indicated before the Minister said anything about it.,31
290,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Yes ; I believe it was first mentioned privately by the honourable ber for Echuca.,31
291,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,No . It was first indicated at a meeting held in Melbourne.,31
292,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The point is that one jection. who happens to be a member of the present Administration indicated it before the alliance mentioned it. I suggested in a it. report, published in the Age of 16th August, that there should be a Tariff mission, and I am still of that opinion, and Melbourne. my colleagues hold the same view. That is all that honourable members opposite except that the report must be in by next session, and action must be taken at once.

If there is a general election in between, and the people approve of the report of the Commission there will be no cause for complaint; but until the protectionists and free-traders of Australia have had an opportunity to say whether or not they bememlieve in altering the Tariff we have no right to touch it. ,",31

304,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not impute that personally, and if the .Minister takes that view, I shall withdraw my remark.",32
305,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Now , in regard to preferential trade, a proposal is on the notice paper in the name of the honourable member for HumeThat in the opinion of this House, negotiations should be opened without delay with the Imperial Government, with a view to, if possible, establishthat ing preference in trade between Great Britain and Australia. The honourable and learned member for Indi, in the course of an interview, has gone one better than that. He says"" We must pass an Act at once, describing exactly what preferences are to be given."" He says that what is proposed by the honourable member for Hume is not enough, and the old rivalry between those two hon; orable members goes on apace. It is quite interesting to watch their eagerness to outdo each other in promoting the welfare of the community. My view of this matter has been, and is still-and I venture to hope that it has some authority-that a fair opportunity should be afforded to ascertain the view of this House on the question of preferential trade. I feel quite satisfied that if any honourable member prominently identified with the question were to ask for an opportunity for a discussion in the House upon the subject, in order that our views may be communicated to the people of Great Britain, the Cabinet would do their best to grant the request",32
306,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,We want more than an opportunity.,32
307,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not know what some honourable members want. I am suggesting that an opportunity should be afforded for discussing the matter in this House; but honourable members opposite do not want that. They wish the matter to be discussel by the joint party at an early date. What are they going to decide? I can imagine the honourable member for Maranoa cheering the views of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports on the subject of raising the Customs duties against the foreigner, in order to enable us to give a preference to Great Britain. Surelv the proper place to discuss this subject is not at a secret meeting of the ioint partu on the Opposition side, but in this House, where all members will have an opportunity to consider the matter. If honourable members opposite came into office tomorrow, would preferential trade be a plank of their platform, or an open question?",32
308,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANT OF,We do not say that it is a plank of our platform.,32
309,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No , and if I am not mistaken, the honourable member in his speech upon the Address-in-Reply made some remarks that were not at all friendly to preferential trade. Did he not say, "" What is the good of talking about preferential trade until our own people have been provided for,"" or something of that sort. I suppose he is not going to change 'his opinion.",32
310,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANT OF,My opinion is the same now as then.,32
311,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,The joint party will leave preferential trade an open question.,32
312,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Do not call them the joint party, call them the dishcloth party.",32
313,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I call them the alliance party-the great Victorian alliance. I think that in view of the statements being made at home, it is only fair that this House should have an opportunity to express its views upon preferenial trade, and I have no objection to that opportunity being afforded in a reasonable way.",32
314,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,What responsibility will the Government take?,32
315,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Honourable members must know that members of the Government take different views as to what should be done in this matter, just as honourable members opposite do. Honourable members are divided upon certain clauses in the Arbitration Bill, and any Cabinet composed of free-traders and protectionists must hold differing views upon such a subject as preferential trade. Any Cabinet that might be formed of honourable members from the Opposition benches would also hold differing views, and upon that question would be, to all intents and purposes, a coalition Cabinet. There is one other matter connected with.the fiscal issue to which I desire to refer, and that is the Manufactures Encouragement Bill . ' As has already been announced, that is left an open question by this Government. The protectionist members upon this side are free to vote as they think best, and the free traders are at liberty to exercise their own discretion. This question is also practically an open one with honourable members opposile. I shall read the article in the alliance programme:Iron Bonus Bill-ever y member to have freedom of action as to method of control.",32
316,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes , as to the method.",32
317,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I desire to interpret the general statement in the light of existing facts. Do honourable members know why the Bill is not law at the present time? Do they know who is. responsible for the fact.that we have not a Manufactures couragement Act ?,33
318,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,I say the free-traders.,33
319,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Who moved that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee, in order to prevent its becoming law ?-the honourable member for Bland.",33
320,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,That was not the object.,33
321,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Will the honourable and this learned member be good enough to restrict his energies to the production of letters which he says will prove certain statements he - has made regarding the Prime Minister having been guilty of ""cooking"" the puborable lic accounts of New South Wales. The of the House. honourable and learned member had better keep quiet until he has done honourable and learned member said that he had letters which would prove his charge that the Prime Minister had "" cooked "" the longer an open question. public accounts, and undertook to produce them, but he has not redeemed his promise. This is the honourable member who says that he abhors Socialism, and everything conwith nected with it. He even opposed the estabthey lishment of a Government clothing factory, because he held that it constituted the duction of Socialism, and yet he is now allied with the Socialist Party. When Prime Minister read letters from the memprovide bers of the Committee-fro m Mr T. A. Dibbs and others-h e interjected that he had become law. a letter over Mr Dibbs' signature, in which it was stated that the accounts of the Prime ter Minister were "" cooked."" He was challenged to produce it, but he has not done so. not believe that he has it. Instead, he duced a letter in which there was the lowing postscript: The finding of the Committee was adverse to Mr Reid. Is that the statement that the accounts were ""cooked?"" The honourable and learned member had better look after the mote which is in his own eye before he searches for beam that is in his brother's eye.",33
322,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Minister does not want to hear the truth, anyhow.",33
323,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do; but I am not alproduction ways sure that I shall hear it from the source from which it is offered. I chalthe lenge the honourable and learned member nationalizing the industry. to produce the letter bearing Mr Dibbs' signature, in which the Prime Minister charged with having ""cooked "" the public accounts. That is all I ask him to do.",33
324,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,Why this heat when I tell the Minister that the free-trade leader of the present Government voted against the EnManufactures Encouragement Bill?,33
325,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I ask whose fault it was that that Bill did not become law? If the protectionists in the Labour Party had voted with the protectionists outside of it, that measure would have been law today. It is because the protectionists of the Labour Party joined With the Free-trade Party in House to shelve that Bill that it is not already upon the statute-book. The free traders voted against it. The honourable member for Bourke has told us that it is no longer an open question with honmembers upon the Opposition side Does the honourable member for Maranoa recollect talking about that. The "" barefaced robbery."" ",33
326,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I thought it was no The only reason why the Manufactures Encouragement Bill is not law today is that the protectionist members of the Labour Party joined the free-traders to shelve it. Had remained true to the protectionist view that that measure was a good one, it would introhave been placed upon the statute-book. The Bill is an open question with this Go the vernment; but Ministers have offered to time for its discussion. Then if there is a majority in its favour, it will",33
327,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,I think that the Minis,33
328,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the honourable and I do learned member will allow me to proceed proupon my own wandering course, instead of folconfining me to the paths which he thinks that I should follow ",33
329,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,Do noli make misstatements.,33
330,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I will not, if I can avoid it. According to the alliance programme, every member of it is to have ""freedom of the action as to method of control"" in respect of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. What does that mean ? That once more we shall have the question raised as to whether a bounty shall be paid upon the of iron, or whether State iron works shall be established, and once more socialistic party will vote in favour of Consequently we may again have the free-traders voting is with them to destroy the Bill, because there is no State that is likely to establish such works. That is the joint action suggested by the alliance. I say that the proposal of the Government to allow the matter to be discussed, and to ascertain whether honourable members are willing to stand by their views - to support the Bill or oppose it-is infinitely better than the half-and-half proposals in the alliance programme. I wish now to say a few words regarding one or two articles in that programme. Article 3 states that each' member of the alliance is to use his influence individually and collectively with its organizations and supporters, to secure support for and immunity from opposition to members of either party during the currency of the_alliance, which is for this Parliament and the next. Upon Sunday evening last the honourable member for Bland, in addressing a meeting at the Queen's Hall, saidWe are, it is true, bound to use our influence t-j prevent opposition by our party to those who are allied with us. But is not that right? Would I not be false to my principles if I believed a man to be helping us and did not use my influence with my party to secure him from opposition? But that does"" not prevent us using our influence i 1 favour of any man whom the organizations may decide to bring forward. In last week's Tocsin, too, I read a signed article by Mr Anstey, M.L.A., in which he expressed a very decided view as to what the labour organizations would do. I also read a speech delivered by Mr Scott Bennett some ten days ago at Ballarat, in which he expressed very pronounced opinions as to what the Victorian Labour Party would do. The honourable member for Bland was unable to promise that his organizations would give the support that ought to be extended to every member of any decent alliance. He had not the authority to make that promise. Of course it mayhappen that a leader who has authority to make a promise may make it and afterwards find that those for whom he has spoken, will not back him up. But in this case, the leader of the Labour Party had no authority to make a promise, and he owns it. Mr Scott Bennett, M.L.A., saysHe would leave the party and sink once more into private life, and sacrifice the position he held at the present time rather than lose his principles by mixing with such a gang. He does not call it an alliance.  have heard the honourable and learned member called a "" robber,"" but I do not think that he is one.",33
331,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,Hi s colleagues have called him that.,34
332,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I remember the honourable member for Coolgardie saying something to that effect.,34
333,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I defy the Minister to 1 produce the statement.,34
334,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I remember one occasion upon which thirty-nine honourable, members voted for the imposition of a duty, and twenty-five against it, and the honourable member said, "" It only requires one more to make up forty thieves.""",34
335,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,No . That statement was made after a division upon a no-confidence motion.,34
336,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I can produce a statement by the Minister's own leader, in which he designated the protectionists ""plunderers.""",34
337,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is quite possible. But there are honourable members upon the other side of the Chamber who have said exactly the same. What I have said was in reply to the honourable member for Yarra. I have not uttered a single word in regard to that sort of thing during the whole morning, unless I have first been challenegd by honourable members opposite. I am aware that free-traders have spoken of protectionists in unmeasured terms. They believe that a protective policy is so wrong that certain results will follow its operation. But in making those statements they do not reflect upon the personal integrity of protectionists.",34
338,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,They go very close to it.,34
339,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Her e is the Hansard report bearing upon the remark of the honourable member for Coolgardie, to which reference has been made.",34
340,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I see that the honourable member's statement in regard to it was quite correct. The remark in question was made upon a no-confidence motion.,34
341,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Minister was wrong again. """,34
342,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If that remark satisfies the honourable and learned member I am content. I wish now to say a word or two in reference to the question of old-age pensions. In .the Labour Party's platform this plank is summed up in three words, namely, ""old-age pensions."" I do not see it mentioned in the alliance programme which was published in the Age on the 5th September. Honourable members who ocI cupy seats in the Opposition corner did' not think the matter of sufficient importance to include it in the draft programme of the alliance.",34
343,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That was a error.,35
344,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"We have been attacked because the Prime Minister omitted to mention old-age pensions in his declaration of policy, and yet the Liberal-Protectionists in Opposition did not include it in their draft programme. In the programme of the alliance, however, as finally agreed to, I find the following:Old-age pensions upon a basis fair and equitable to the several States and to individuals. As 1I have previously stated, the platform of the Labour Party merely contains the words "" old-age pensions."" The honourable member for Bland says that, irrespective of whether or not the States agree to it, the alliance will adopt a scheme of old-age pensions. I should like to ask whether the words "" fair and equitable to the several States and to individuals "" were inserted before or after the honourable member for Barker came to Melbourne?",35
345,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,He had' absolutely nothing whatever to do with it.,35
346,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,He had something to do with the other matter.,35
347,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Minister is wrong again.,35
348,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not think so. What do the words "" upon a basis fair and equitable to the several States and to individuals "" mean. They can only mean that the States must agree to some arrangement by which pensions shall be granted. Otherwise the scheme will not come into operation. The only alternative is for the Commonwealth Government to impose direct taxation. For my own part I say frankly that I cannot agree to Federal direct taxation. At the present time the taxpayer finds the Federal authority putting its hand into his right breeches pocket, and the State authority putting its hand into his left breeches pocket. This proposal, therefore, means that the Federal authority shall assist the State authorities in further raiding the taxpayer's left breeches pocket. It means that there must be a Federal, as well as a State, land tax. Mr Mauger.;-That is the Minister's way of putting it.",35
349,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member cannot suggest 'any way of raising the money required for the payment of old-age pensions, except by arrangement with the States. We certainly cannot take it out of our one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue. printer's Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - We shall take a portion of it out of the profits derived from the establishment of a State tobacco monopoly.",35
350,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I would remind the honourable member that the establishment of such a monopoly means that we shall lose the whole of the revenue at present collected by the excise upon tobacco. There will not be a large profit left after that revenue has been deducted. I can imagine the outcry which would be raised by the public if the State pioposed to make a profit upon a pound of tobacco as large as is the excise duty at the present time. The question would immediately be asked, "" Where is our cheap tobacco? Why do you not give us the benefit accruing from your assumption of ownership by reducing the price?"" If honourable members think that there will be bigger profit from this source than the excise, I venture to say they take a view different from that of the ordinary elector. I want to refer to one other condition of the alliance as follows: Any member of the Parliament who agrees to this alliance may, subject to the approval of both parties, be admitted to it. "" Subject to the approval of both parties"" ! Before an honourable member can join the Opposition (branch of. the Protectionist Party, he has to get the consent of the Labour Party.",35
351,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is not correct.,35
352,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have just read the terms of the alliance. Mr HU ME COOK - And if a labour representative wishes to join, he has to get the consent of the Protectionist Party.",35
353,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is equally ridiculous. Each party is to retain its separate identity; but there are to be pariahs or outcasts, who will not, under any circumstances, be admitted to either party, the other party objecting.",35
354,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,That provision was made in case the honourable member for Wilmot should apply.,35
355,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I should have thought that any honourable member who was prepared to accept the programme of the alliance, and whose personal character justified his being associated with other people, would have been welcome. But the Opposition are getting too particular; and I suppose that the four wicked protectionists who have ventured to take their seats on the Ministerial benches would not be admitted to the alliance. What does it mean ?",35
356,Mr GROOM,MOTION OF WANT OF,Le t the honourable and learned member make application himself.,36
357,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not propose to make application. I have taken my side, and there I am prepared to stand. I have never changed my vote from one side to the other because I was afraid something might happen, and I do not propose to be guilty of such conduct now. In reference to the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , I see that thirty voted for the appointment of a select committee, or, in other words, for State ownership, and fifteen against; and amongst those who voted with the majority were the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable member for Bourke. But what about honourable members who did not vote in that direction? What about the honourable and learned - member for Indi, who voted for the Bill? What about the stand which that honourable and learned miember took in regard to the inclusion of railway servants under the Arbitration Bill ? We on this side have been taunted because we accepted that Bill containing a public service clause; but I opposed that clause because I believed it to be unconstitutional. The honourable and learned member for Indi, however, would not,say whether the clause was or was not constitutional, but he characterized the provision as in the highest degree inexpedient.",36
358,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable learned member for Ind i did not say that the clause was unconstitutional.,36
359,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable and learned member for Ind i would not say whether it was or was not constitutional; but he did say that it was in the highest degree Inexpedient and most improper to have such a clause in the Bill . That honor 'able and learned member has more 'difficulty in swallowing a clause of that kind than have some honourable members who believe the clause to be unconstitutional, and who are satisfied that the High Court will so decide.",36
360,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Expedienc y is variable,",36
361,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Obviously , and it varies with great rapidity .sometimes. Expediency varied in the alliance programme between the 5th and the 8th September, and it will probably vary between the 29th September and the ist October if circumstances justify the variation. I have far exceeded the time limit I gave myself, but I wish to say, in conclusion, that, with other honourable members on. this side, I have been subject during the last six weeks to a great deal of abuse. For example, I have been taunted with having personal motivestaunted not by one member but by a score. I have drawn attention to the fact that before a division was taken on tEe 23rd June, I announced that, w in or lose, I r should support the Arbitration Bill. I am afraid that some honourable members must have forgotten that announcement; but I may say that when I made it, I meant to abide by it. I should have supported the Bill whatever the result, but, naturally, I preferred a Bill in the form which I believed to be the best. Honourable members on this side have also had to submit to the taunt of "" sand-bagging,"" and of having been guilty of unfair play. I have endeavoured to fairly state the facts which led up to the division when the Watson Government went out of office; and I venture to say that the electors, when they consider those facts impartially, will full y absolve every honourable member on this side, and, I admit, every honourable member on the other side, from ba-ving done anything unfair or politically improper. We differed extremely on a point of considerable importance-that is, at first; but subsequently, owing to the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Bland being in his view nearly the same as my own, we differed very little. I did not know, and and I do not know now, why the Watson Government made the matter vital. I can think of only one reason, namely, that they feared the ' amendment they had agreed to had gone too far, and they felt, from their point of view, that they must take a stand, because the preference to unionists amendment, relating to political objects, was one the unions did not approve. But whatever their reason-and I do not ascribe wrong motives of any kind-it is only fair that those charges of "" sand-bagging and unfair or improper conduct should cease. If I have said a single word in the course of my speech which ascribes any improper motives or conduct to any honourable member, I have to express 'my regret. I spoke more warmly when referring to the honourable and learned member for Corio than perhaps I should have done on another occasion. I can only say that the honourable and learned I find member promised to produce a letter in this House, and for that letter I wait. Before I sit down, I should like to refer to the split in the Protectionist Party. It has been suggested that the protectionists who now sit on the Government side are responI sible for the split. In the Melbourne of Thursday, n t h August - whic h was a day or two before the vote was given which will meetput out the Watson Government, there apWhat party ? peared the following: We are requestedI did not make any request, nor I think submission did any honourable member on this side. to announce that as the result of much consideration of the political situation it has been decided by the Liberal-Protectionist members of the House of Representatives now sitting in the Opposition corner to form, at the earliest moment, consistent with efficiency, a new Liberal progressive organization. Progressive legislation of a cautious but thoroughly democratic character of protection is, it is stated, to be the main objective of the new body. The decision arrived at has no relation to the immediate crisis. Whether Mr Reid form a Government, or the Watson Ministry obtain a dissolution, the new organization is to be set going. I should like to ask if the honourable and learned member for Ballarat communicated that information?",36
362,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and learned member for Ballarat knew all about it.,37
363,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The paragraph proceedsIt will fight for its principles in the House of Representatives and on the platform and in the country, no matter what stop-gap Government occupies the Treasury benches. The words "" stop-gap Government "" indicate the nature of the communication. It was known what the division list would be - it was known that the Watson Government would be beaten by two votes. The next day there is a further reference in the Melbourne Age, headed "" Meeting of Liberal Protectionists,"" as follows: The solidarity of the Liberal-Protectionist Paity in the House of Representatives, and its determination to maintain its identity and usefulness, despite the extraordinary attitude of Mr. Deakin, was eagerly discussed by members and their acquaintance in the lobbies last evening. that was the gentleman who knew all about it.",37
364,Mr SALMON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Did he give that information ?,37
365,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I suppose he did. . Mr Mauger - He knew all about it.,37
366,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The paragraph goes onLabour members frankly say that the continued existence of this party will do more to denude labour politics of unelastic caucus ruleit is looking like it ! and fiscal atheismit looks like it ! than a dozen speeches of the character of delivered by Mr Deakin at Ballarat nearly fortnight ago. suppose the honourable and learned memAge ber gave that information to the pressAs soon as the present crisis is over the party whether the outcome of events be a Reid Government or a dissolution-and formulate a policy for to the country, together with a plan of campaign. The members who are expected to attend the meeting include the following :-Si r William Lyne, Mr Isaacs, Sir Langdon Bonython, Mr Chanter, Mr Crouch, Mr L . E. Groom, Mr Higgins, Mr Mauger, Mr Storrer, and Mr. Wilkinson. Who gave that information? Was it the honourable and learned member for Ballarat ? That happened on the Thursday, and was reported on the Friday, and in the Age of the following Saturday this appearedThe Liberal-Protectionist Party, as an effective, engine of fiscal truth and progressive legislation, stands in danger of being temporarily, if not permanently, split by yesterday's division in the House of Representatives. It was announced in the Age yesterday that the Liberal-Protectionists who were supporting the Governmentthe Watson Governmentwere determined to maintain their solidarity and independence of both the Reid and the official Labour Party. they are maintaining it nowIt was announced that a meeting would be held soon after the immediate crisis was over, at which the attitude of the radical wing"" the radical wing "" ! of the protectionist members' would be defined, and the policy and plan of campaign considered. The names mentioned are, I believe, the same as those in the list I previously read, though there may be one or two lessAmongst the members named as being expected to attend this meeting were Sir William Lyne, Mr Isaacs, Mr Chanter, Sir Langdon Bonython, Mr Higgins, Mr Mauger, Mr L . E Groom, Mr Storrer, Mr Wilkinson, and Mr. Crouch. . . . A counter move, however, has been taken by those Liberal-Protectionists who favour a Coalition Ministry headed by Mr Reid, and yet declare that they preserve their fiscal faith unimpaired. Mr Chapman, ex-Minister of Defence, was its author. The counter move took the form of a kind of round robin, which was signed by Sir George Turner, Sir John Quick, and Messrs. Ewing, Chapman, Harper, Kennedy, MCCay, MCColl, MCLean, Phillips, and Salmon, and presented to Mr Deakin yesterday afternoon.",37
367,Mr HARPER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I never heard of this before.,37
368,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"As a matter of fact, there - was not any signed document. Honourable that members on this side were asked if they a still had faith in the honourable and learned member for Ballarat as leader, and they said that they had ; and the fact was communicated to the honourable and learned member in writing.",37
369,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,What is the differmember ence?,38
370,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for Bourke is charging me with having said something which is incorrect, and apparmember ently will not allow me to say what happen. I do not say that there is any difference; I am only answering an antiland cipatory charge of making an incorrect statement.",38
371,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,Who took action first ?,38
372,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member for Gippsland in joining the Government.,38
373,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,We had taken no liberals action at that time.,38
374,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Thos e events happened on the Wednesday and Thursday, and were reported on the Friday, and the statements could not have appeared in the Age unless there was some fire.",38
375,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I say that no meetstrengthened ing was held until the 17th August.,38
376,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,I know that. A meeting of the Protectionist Party sitting in the and advancement. corner was held long before any members of the Protectionist Party on the House held any meeting.,38
377,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The protectionists that side have not yet had a meeting.,38
378,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No , we have not; but we have not formed an exclusive section of the party, and arrogated to Ourselves whole of the righteousness of the party.",38
379,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable learned member ran away from the party.,38
380,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and learned member had an intimation from the honourable and learned member for Balof larat as to where he stood long before we did anything officially.,38
381,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Honourable members who were going to vote for the Watson Governwas ment did something- I do not know what.,38
382,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,They did not do anything officially.,38
383,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is the poorest of shields to say that nothing was done officially.,38
384,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,They held no meetto ing.,38
385,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"What was done was done officially, or no newspaper would have contained such statements as those I have read. Mr HARPER,-The statements in the newspapers are correct.",38
386,Mr KENNEDY,MOTION OF WANT OF,They were never contraasked dicted.,38
387,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"What was done was to ask the protectionists on this side whether they had faith in the honourable and learned for Ballarat, and they replied in the affirmative. In whom had we faith except in the honourable and learned member? Had we faith in the honourable and learned for Indi ? I say that sitting on this did side we have the honourable member for Balaclava, the honourable member for Gipps",38
388,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"And the honourable member for Kooyong, and the honourable member for Grampians !",38
389,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable members. I mention, so far as we protectionists and are concerne'd, were leaders of politics in this part of Australia before honourable members opposite, or some of them, were heard of. As to the division in our party, if I had any doubts as to which way I should go, and I arrived at a decision, that decision would be fortified and if I found myself with men who for a score of years have been high in the public regard as advocates of progress",38
390,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,They never joined this side of free-traders before.,38
391,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member on for Bourke joined free-traders when he voted for the MCLean Government against the Turner Government in Victoria in 1899. On that occasion all the Free-trade Party the were against the Turner Government.,38
392,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable and and learned member left his leader then.,38
393,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes , I was charged with leaving my leader. I thought I had reason for doing so, but my constituents were not that opinion; and if I sinned I suffered. I always thought that if a man sinned, and suffered his sentence, and was re-electedwhich is a sort of free pardon-the incident closed. Whatever I did I paid for.",38
394,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I took the lesson to heart, but apparently the honourable and learned member did not. - Mr MCCAY - I am astounded ! The honourable member says he took the lesson heart. He left his leader, and I left the same leader; but I am with my leader still. Where is the honourable member?",38
395,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member is behind a free-trader, and I am not.",38
396,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I say without hesitation that when the great mass of the electors are to say on which side they will range themselves-whethe r it shall be with men like the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, the honourable and learned member for Balaclava, and the honourable member for Gippsland. or with that solitary figure, the honourable* and learned member for Indi, and his interjector-general, the honourable and learned member for CorioI have no doubt that Victoria will declare that we on this side have done what we were justified in doing-that we have been amply warranted in following leaders whose names have been long honoured in Victorian politics. Having done that duty to the country, we need fear no result.",38
397,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF," I regret that it has become the fashion in this House, on motions of censure, and also on other motions, to delay decision by prolonged speeches. I do not mean to say that honourable members on one side are more to blame in this respect than honourable rr.tmbers on the other; but I do think that the Minister of Defence, who spoke last, and who contributed a speech lasting nearly three hours Mr j MCCAY - Tw o hours and twentty minutes, to be accurate. Mi. MAHON - The honourable and learned gentleman might very well have eliminated the two hours, for everything he said pertinent or relevant to the subject could have been uttered in twenty minutes. I have no wish to follow him through all the tortuous mazes of his arguments, nor his narrative respecting the defeat of the late Government. I believe that this House and the country knows sufficient of the not to accept any partisan interpretation of them. Windy declarations cannot obscure the fact that the late Government were denied the privilege usually accorded to Governments of reconsidering, under proper circumstances, an amendment to an important measure, carried by a snatch vote in Committee. The country will know also that the amendment was one which, in the opinion of those for whom we intended to pass the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, the workers of Australia, would render that measure of little use.",39
398,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF,On e section of the workers.,39
399,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is true that all workers are not members of unions, but the great majority of Australian democrats, the men who have rendered advanced legislation possible, are members of industrial unions. I say that the action of the majority, in taking the business of the House out of the hands of the Government on the occasion referred to, has no parallel in the parliamentary history of Australia.",39
400,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,MOTION OF WANT OF,-There is no precedent for it anywhere.,39
401,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Ver y likely. I cannot conceive such procedure being adopted by any party with even rudimentary appreciation of fair play. The last speaker sought to cloud the main issue by digressions having only a remote bearing upon it. An opponent might accept many of his conclusions, so unimportant are they, without in any degree mitigating his antagonism to the present Ministry. Those of his fallacies which are calculated to mislead the House on any material point will, no doubt, be exposed by subsequent speakers. What I should first like to draw attention to is the extraordinary composition of the present Government.",39
402,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Hear , hear.",39
403,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am glad that the Prime Minister cheers that statement.,39
404,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable gentleman means by contrast with the last Government.,39
405,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"There is undoubtedly a vast difference between the two Administrations, and any comparison must be to the. disadvantage of the existing one. The last Government, at all events, fairly represented the various States of Australia, with, perhaps, one exception. Looking at into the - personnel of the present Government, we see that the two principal States of the Commonwealth practically dominate the facts whole Ministry. Out of eieht members in the Cabinet, New South Wales and Victoria are represented by six. The Prime Minister now professes the utmost solicitude for the effacement of the unhappy jealousies that have been rife in the several States, yet, in forming his Government, he supplied some of the States with a first-class grievance. He has practically ignored the smaller States in the formation of his Ministry. Certainly he has given Queensland and South Australia representation in the Cabinet, but not from this House; so we have the curious and sinister situation that the two larger States control the entire Cabinet in the House of Representatives. I ask the right honourable gentleman why he passed over Western Australia in forming his Government. Why did the Prime Minister ignore the right honourable member for Swan- a man whose great career is crowded with practical achievements, which make even the Prime Minister a mere political pigmy in comparison?",39
406,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,Hea r hear; I admit it.,40
407,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The admission is good, but the explanation would be better. The right honourable member for Swan is a man whose name will be handed down to postended terity as an intrepid explorer, arid the most capable administrators that tralia has ever seen. What possible justifito cation was there for passing him over and filling the place which he might have pied- I do not desire to be disrespectfulby our military friend, the honourable and learned member for Corinella? The right honourable member for Swan has been in the public life of Australia for nearly quarter of a century. For a great portion of that time he has been at the head of Administration, and has to his credit the successful accomplishment of the greatest engineering feat yet attempted anywhere. _ Mr MCWILLIAMS - If there should dissolution, will the honourable gentleman get on to the platform of the right honor1 able member for Swan, and say that? . Mr Mahon - I shall try to speak truth wherever I may be. Now, I find that the States of New South Wales and a Victoria return to the Federal Parliaborrow ment sixty-one members, whilst the other four States return fifty memBallarat bers. Yet the sixty-one members are repreextraordinary sented by six members of the Cabinet, tectionist, whilst the fifty members are represented only two.",40
408,Mr LONSDALE,MOTION OF WANT OF,If the representation were on the population basis. New South Wales and Victoria should have an 'even greater representation in the Cabinet.,40
409,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable gentleman has included the Senate in his figures.,40
410,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the Prime Minismade ter mean to say that the Senate should denied representation in the Cabinet?,40
411,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"They have got it, and much as any other Government gave them. subordinate place.",40
412,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"My point is that the four States which send fifty members to the Federal Parliament are entitled to more than two representatives in the Cabinet. A consideration of the personnel of the Cabinet exposes the hollowness of the Prime Minister's professed solicitude to restore good feeling between the various States. Why, the entire Cabinet in this House consists entirely of representatives of New South Wales and Victoria. All the other States are absolutely ignored. Why should that be? It is not for lack of men of high capacity and large experience, for in the r right honourable member for Swan the Prime Minister could have had a colleague combining all essential qualifications. I need scarcely say that no disparagement is inof the Treasurer, the Minister one of of Trade and Customs, or the MinAusister of Home Affairs; I am glad see those three gentlemen in the Ministry. I am especially glad to see the occuhonorable member for North Sydney in the Government. When the Prime Minister abdicated his functions as leader of the Opposition, and retired to look after his private business, the honourable member for a North Sydney sat here night after night, week after week, and month after month, an fighting the cause which the right honourable member for East Sydney bad deserted.",40
413,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"A generous acknowledgment. be a Mr Mahon - In making a generous acknowledgment to a political foe, - I hope am setting an example which the Prime Minister will occasionally follow. I have a word or two to say about the Minister of the Trade and Customs. The honourable gentleman has a lively Celtic imagination, and gift of honeyed persuasiveness which, to an old-world saying, would coax the birds from the bushes. He went up to lately, and attempted to justify the position in which, as a prohe finds himself-co-leade r of a by Ministry with a free-trader. Speaking on that occasion, the honourable member explained that the Watson Government contained four free-traders and four protectionists, as the Reid Government does; and therefore if one alliance were morally defensible, so is the other. But there is a kink in this argument. The Labour Party never the fiscal issue a fetish, as did the be respective parties captained by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade and as Customs. They relegated fiscalism to a",40
414,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is just what we object to.,40
415,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Labour Party had, from the inception of this Parliament, been absolutely cohesive on all fundamental issues. It agreed to differ on the Tariff, just as it does on the acquisition of State debts and State railway's, or the construction of the Transcontinental railway. The junction of certain Labour members of opposite fiscal beliefs in an Administration, therefore, involved no sacrifice of principle or betrayal of pledges. But how stands this Government? The joint leaders represent policies which are mutually destructive. Theirs is, in truth, a perfect "" Yes-No "" combination. Not merely are their principles hostile, but, from the outset, and up to the present hour, they isolate themselves in separate apartments within parliamentary precincts.",40
416,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is not correct.,41
417,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"At least it was so publicly reported. Their pretended fusion is only for the public eye. It is idle, therefore; for the Minister for Trade and Customs to attempt to justify this immoral political compact by fastening a precedent for it on the Labour Party. The cases are in no respect parallel, and nothing in the composition or historv of the Labour Government palliates the shameless abandonment of principle which can be sheeted home to the joint leaders of this combination. Their rival policies are as utterly distinctive as day is from night, or truth from falsehood.",41
418,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,They blend occasionally very satisfactorily.,41
419,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is clear that they do blend satisfactorily for the right honourable gentleman at times.,41
420,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member fights for the Labour Party; we fight against it.,41
421,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall come to the honourable member for Corangamite presently, and to what he is fighting for. The honourable member is fighting for ""the maintenance of the ascendency of a small caste in the community.",41
422,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Not at all.,41
423,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Why , the honourable member is in this House on a minority vote I say that the position of the two parties is radically different. The honourable and learned, gentleman who spoke last amused me very much by the importance which he professed to attach to a trifling reference which I made in a jocular moment to the "" forty thieves."" As explained at the time, that observation had no personal application. But the right honourable gentleman whom he is now following has repeatedly denounced the protectionists of Victoria, even in this House, as plunderers.",41
424,Mr WILKS,MOTION OF WANT OF,He meant blunderers.,41
425,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No , plunderers. I shall read from Hansard a few passages, which will illustrate the sentiments entertained the free-trade leader for the gentlemen .with whom he has now entered into a coalition. In Hansard of the 15th October, 1901, I find this passage",41

When the honourable member for Macquarie pitied Victoria for adopting protection instead of that system which made New South Wales powerful, the honourable member for Mernda interjected, "" On borrowed money,"" and evoked this retortThe honourable member has thrived under the protectionist policy of Victoria at the expense of the great mass of workers of this State. Here is a charge of corruption levelled at the honourable member for Mernda by a gentleman who is now a member of the Ministry, and yet he is supporting them.",41

The ""honourable member so unsparingly denounced by the present Postmaster-General is now expected to maintain in office members who thus slandered him. A few quotations showing the Prime Minister's opinion of the Tariff he is now content to administer, will not come amiss. On numerous platforms he refused to abandon free trade, and said he would decline to take office by protectionist votes.",41
434,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,Can the honourable member give me a reference to that statement?,41
435,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I shall do so before I finish my speech.,41

He had only to say that he would do so, and he would get tens of thousands of protectionist supporters behind him. But he"" did not intend to take that opportunity.",42
440,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,I was fighting them then. M|r. MAHON - I ask honourable members to listen to this passageHe had not come into the Federal Parliament in the closing years of his political l i fe to play that kind of game. It would not be worth his while to be there unless he could do something that would cause him to be remembered with respect and esteem by the country.,42
441,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WANT OF,But that was said some time ago. He has changed his opinion several times since then.,42

444,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I was fighting them then. I have a truce with them now, and I cannot been fight them.",42
445,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"But the point of this is that the Prime Minister pledged himself ears never to make a truce with the protectionwho ists. Does not this quotation prove what I said, that he repudiated protectionist aid to office? He said furtherFrom the moment he got power he would make that Tariff an honest Tariff.",42
446,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Now that the right honourable gentleman has got the power, is he going to do it?",42
447,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No ; my "" better half "" will not allow me.",42
448,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That was not the first time the right honourable gentleman made this declaration. Speaking at Fremantle, a few months before, he made similar remarks, which I shall quote",42
449,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,Do not my speeches read beautifully ?,42
450,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"There is no doubt about that. I cannot put my hand on the quotation at the moment, and, therefore, I propose to read from Hansard, a few extracts as to the right honourable gentleman's opinion of the Tariff, which he previously t h denounced as a robbery of the wage and under which he is quite prepared to carry on. On the 15th October, 1901, he saidA high Tariff is not necessary for revenue; it is an outrage upon every principle of fairness and humanity. How does the Minister of Trade and Customs like that statement?",42
451,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,That statement was made at the beginning of the fight. We got a lot of the duties taken off after that. .,42
452,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall read the opinion which the right honourable gentleman expressed after the duties were in operation. It will be seen that it is not much different from what he said on the 15th October, 1901",42
453,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,When is the honourable member going to begin the free-trade crusade with the honourable member for Parramatta?,42
454,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In reply to the Prime Minister, who has vacated the position of leader of the Free-trade Party, I wish to say that when a capable successor of arises on the political horizon I shall be preeasy pared to consider the propriety of joining Speaking here, on the 15th October, igor, and referring to the Victorians, he said I am not addressing men whose minds have saddened with a long course of these outrages on humanity and sound finance. It would be idle for any one to talk to them, for their are dulled. I am talking to Australia in all its conditions as represented by this House. Those have been accustomed to run a country on these lines are not likely to listen to anything which I might say. I speak, however, beyond them, to those who, unlike them, have not become inoculated with that poison. I speak to those . . . who have not been accustomed to regard the public as a flock of sheep to be used for the benefit of politicians and manufacturers. The right honourable gentleman was further complimentary to Victoria on the same day, when he addressed the House in these termsAll that is wanted in Victoria now is a little fresh air. In contrast with this artificially constructed paradise of labour every other country in the world has proved more attractive than Victoria. I am told that Victoria is becoming a ruinous place even for lawyers, and when a country is in that state it is almost near its end. Stagnation is the picture that the policy of protection presents in Victoria, while in New South Wales there is nothing put progress. And the Prime Minister, now madly anxious to reconcile the jealousies of Victoria and New South Wales, went on to compare the people of Victoria with the downtrodden and oppressed 'people of Ireland. On another occasion he .proceeded to. ridicule Victorian enterprise, and on the 22nd January, 1902, he cast this taunt at the Victorian members",42
455,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member has been busy digging up these things. Has he not had anything better to do?,43
456,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Does not the fight honourable member know that I represent a miming constituency, and that it is my business to dig up things.",43
457,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,And do I not represent them too? They treated me like a brother.,43
458,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Hear , hear; and they would do so again if the right honourable gentleman were out of office.",43
459,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"They would receive me, anyhow.",43
460,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I hope that the right honourable gentleman will find the weather more genial than it was last time. On the 22nd January, 1902, the question of imposing a duty on barbed wire and wire netting was being discussed. Barbed wire is manufactured considerably in Melbourne, and wire netting is manufactured considerably in SydneyA duty was to be put on foi the benefit of the Melbourne industry, and the Sydney industry was to get no protection.",43
461,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,Did not the honourable member vote with me?,43
462,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I admit that I did. On that occasion the right honourable gentleman saidWe are in favour of a moderate Tariff based on revenue principles, but our friends opposite favour a protective Tariff-protectiv e for Victoria, but free-trade, so far as the industries cf New Soutli Wales are concerned. . . . When all these gifts are being showered about, it is singular that the shower of fair benefits should f all so thickly on one little spot in Australia and so sparsely in other parts. . . . Would .the Ministry have dared to take up their present position if 1,300 men had been engaged in the wire netting industry in Melbourne instead of in Sydney ? That statement was made by the right honourable gentleman who is so desirous of removing the ill-feeling which prevailed between the various States, and who, in a few months, if he be in office, will endeavour to convene a conference of the States Premiers with a view to achieving that object.",43
463,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,Do not make it too hard for me.,43
464,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Unfortunately , the right honourable gentleman has made it very hard for himself, but he has such a capacity for swallowing his previous remarks and professions of principle that I have no doubt he will be successful on. this occasion.",43
465,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,No man in this world was ever more consistent. My creed is the same now as it was when I began.,43
466,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Consisten t in inconsistency. Then the Prime Minister remarkedI f there is anything absurd and ridiculous in the world it is the attempt which little Victoria has made to cope with the marvellous magnitude of the manufacturing industries of a great nation like America. The moment the Victorian product gees out upon the ocean the stilts of protection f all into Hobson's Bay. In the same speech the right honourable gentleman saidThe protective system of Victoria was professedly a hideous robbery of the wage-earners.,43
467,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I withdraw the word "" hideous "" ; it is too strong.",43
468,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is a curious thing that the right honourable gentleman is prepared to concur in that hideous robbery of the wage-earners. He is now prepared to gi on until 1906, or some late date, before ho initiates another great free-trade campaign.",43
469,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Can the honourable member have tied himself up to this high duty revival? Surely not, after all this.",43
470,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The right honourable gentleman must not imagine that I am a witness and he the cross-examining counsel. Conditions are reversed-h e is now in the box. When I come to the high duties I shall make a statement in my own way. It is quite time enough for me to make up my mind when we have a concrete proposal - before us. The right honourable gentleman was not even complimentary to some of his present colleagues a little while ago. On the 17th January, 1902, he interjected ""Nonsense!"" when the honourable and learned member for Corinella rose to a point of order, and met with this retort: The right honourable the leader of the Opposition never allowed me to speak without interruption, and his interjection ""Nonsense,"" is not ordinarily courteous.",43

472,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Wonderfu l !,43
473,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,I misunderstood him in those days.,43
474,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the honourable member for Corangamite, in the practice of his profession, should be able to discover an equally efficacious specific for ordinary physical ills, he will make a fortune. Again, the honourable member for Macquarie spoke of the suspicion which must attach to any member who for political purposes took a certain view one day and another view the next day, whereupon the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who is now a supporter of the coalition, said-""The honourable member's remarks form a strong accusation against his own leader."" I thought that these little sidelights on past history might prove interesting to the House.",43
475,Mr WILSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Most interesting !,44
476,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Especially , in such a debate as this, to one like the honourable member for Corangamite, who had not an opportunity of being present during the last Parliament. I have shown that the Prime Minister denounced the Tariff as a robbery of the wage-earners, and' I will prove from his own remarks, made after the Tariff was passed, that he actually advocated what he now condemns in the honourable and learned member for Indi. I will quote first what he said on the 15th January, 1902, after the Tariff had become operative: The Government brought in a tolerably sound protective Tariff. . . . We, on this side, who consider that the Tariffhas been moulded on absolutely wrong principles, have a very difficult task in endeavouring to alter it ; but it must be understood that we in no sense recognised the Tariff when altered as being founded on sound principles. I call the attention of the House especially to this passageIt is impossible to create a hybrid production such as this Tariff will be, without having a number of striking anomalies which must be radically altered at the earliest opportunity possible. The honourable and learned member for Indi and those who are acting with him have in that declaration by the present Prime Minister sufficient justification for advocating the reopening of the Tariff. The Prime Minister cannot get over his declaration that there are a number of striking anomalies in the Tariff which must be radically altered at the first opportunity possible. In view of this declaration that the Tariff must be radically altered at the earliest opportunity, how can the Prime Minister resist the demand for revision?",44
477,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I was beaten on that; the electors decided against me. I have to bow to the will of the people, as every good democrat does. 8 Q r",44
478,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,But the right honourable gentleman cannot get over the passage that I will next read.,44
479,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,Sho w me anything that I cannot get over.,44
480,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The right honourable gentleman is pretty bulky, but I believe he can get through most obstacles. He came to Western Australia in 1903, and on the 20th January he made the following statement to an interviewer representing a newspaper known as the West Australian.",44
481,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,I repudiate the interview !,44
482,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"What the right honourable gentleman cannot get over he will repudiate. Is that so? Would he repudiate the interview if it were favourable to his present position? He said thisHe had a profound conviction that the Tariff, not only was thoroughly unsound and injurious, but that the people would at the earliest opportunity repudiate it. He believed, if he were content to sink the fiscal issue and allow the Tariff to stand, the Free-trade l'arty would come into power without any delay.",44
483,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,That was before election talk.,44
484,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,But here is the crux of the statementBut he was not in the public life of Australia to make clever arrangements of that sort.,44
485,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I can explain that. I said that I would not sink the fiscal issue, but it sunk me.",44
486,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I did not know it was quite so bad as that, though it is clear enough that some people at times get very low down. Then the Prime Minister went on to sayAnd he was determined to fight for a genuine revenue Tariff. Then it is claimed that the right honourable gentleman came into power to restore responsible government.",44
487,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,That meant experienced government.,44
488,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If responsibility could oe measured by bulk there is no doubt that r the Prime Minister has restored it. But I take it that responsible government is not to be restored by a Government which puts before this House a programme of absolutely rion-contentious measures, and wherever it mentions a Bill about which it is possible to have two opinions informs the country that the members of the Cabinet have a free hand. The Prime Minister calls this responsible government. Let us see what people on the other side of the world-independen t critics, and some of the most capable critics in Great Britainthink of this gentleman who has come into power to restore responsible government. Let me quote shortly what the Saturday Review has to say about the Prime Minister.",44
489,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is a good conservative paper.,45
490,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,On the 27th August of this year the Saturday Review wrote as follows:Mr Reid has inaugurated his Premiership of Australia with a couple of excited addresses no way calculated to strengthen his not too firm keeps the Government in power. grip of the political machinery of the country.,45
491,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,That-is a long way to go an opinion on Australian politics.,45
492,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Sometimes the right Mernda saidhonorable gentleman goes to the Privy Council for an opinion.,45

The Surely article pn ceedsTo charge arrogance, corruption, and insanitv against the Labour Party, which is bound tb have a large, if not preponderant, Jollswing in a community such as the Australian, is just the sort of ineptitude we should expect from Mr Reid.",45
495,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"They know me there. Some people are not even known at the other end of the world. Mr MAI30N - And some are too well known. The article proceedsHe is prepared to go any length just now to undermine the position of the Socialists who have, he contends, utterly destroyed public confidence by visionary schemes. He is sure that he has rendered the Commonwealth a lasting service by securing "" a period of fiscal peace,"" which is Mr. Reid's way of saying that he has subordinated his own free-trade views in order to secure protectionist support in forming his first Government. Whatever Mr Reid may think of the Labour Party, it is certain that Australia has no idea of playing fast and loose with its economic possibilities by adopting a general system of free imports. In the previous issue the same journal wrote thisMr Reid's Cabinet can hardly be a stable one, and it would probably have been much better if Lord Northcote had accepted Mr Watson's advice and dissolved. A dissolution would have cleared away some uncertainties in the situation.",45
496,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,I never heard of the Saturday Review before as a Socialist journal.,45
497,Mr ROBINSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Perhaps it is one of Mr B. R. Wise's articles? "" Mr Reid - It sounds like a bit of B.",45
498,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It rings true, anyhow. I regret very much that so few of the supporters of the Government are present today, and I also regret the absence of the honourable member for Mernda. Surely some specific must have been discovered and' administered to him to induce him to become reconciled to his present leader. The little incursion into what may be called ancient history which I shall now make has a very striking bearing, as will be in seen, upon the majority which' at present On the 22nd October, 1901. the following dialogue for took place in this House, as recorded in Hansard.

513,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Now go on about starch. The honourable member for Mernda proceeded to accuse the right honourable member for East Sydney of retailing mere gosR. sip, of talking from a brief ""ma'de in Germany,"" and of contributing to a base form of business rivalry.

514,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is more than could be said of the honourable member's remarks. Fancy him on the variety stage!,46
515,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,""" But they showed that he knew nothing whatever of What he'was talking about. His statement that the Victorian industries were all shoddy industries showed his ignorance, nothing more. It was an absolute fabrication that his firm and two others were netting ^10,000 a year from these duties."" The right honable gentleman appealed to Mr Speaker for protection. The honourable member for Mernda went on to say that the right honourable gentleman "" desired to put a stigma on him. His conduct was despicable in the extreme.''

518,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is very rough.,46
519,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for Mernda went on to askWas it not bringing parliamentary proceedings down to the level of a farce when private business was discussed, as was done by the honourable member for Macquarie?",46
520,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is indecent for the honourable member for Mernda to thus advertise his firm throughout the country.,46
521,Mr HARPER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That comes with very bad grace from the honourable member, who brought the matter up. Then the present Minister for Trade and Customs accused the honourable member for or Macquarie of unfairness.

528,Mr MAUGER,MOTION OF WANT OF,I have forgiven him.,46
529,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Anothe r extraordinary incident occurred in connection with the honourable member for Denison. He was a member of both the Barton and Deakin Administrations, who were continually reproached by the leader of the Free-trade Party as robbers and plunderers. The only retort upon which the honourable member for Denison ventured was to quote Mr Justin MCCarthy's description of Gathorne Hardy, that and apply it to the right honourable and on the records of learned gentlemanHis speech was as stirring as a rolling drum, as flowing as the sand in an hour glass; but as empty as the drum, and as dry as the sand in the hour .glass. Now I come to the relations between the right honourable members for Swan and East Sydney. A very remarkable affinity between these statesmen has sprung up during the last few months; but the virtues which each possesses had not been discovered by the other until the Watson Administration came into power. On the 22nd October, 1901, the right honourable'member for Swan, replying to the right honourable member for East Sydney, who had been speaking against the imposition of taxation on the pioneers in the back country of Australia, and had been drawing a lurid picture of the hardships which the Tariff would place upon them, said1 ask the right honourable member for East Sydney what he knows about "" the bold pioneer the man with the pannikin in the bush""? His of the "" bold pioneer'.' consists of Hansard rehaving read of him.",46

531,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"He proceedsWhat has he ever done for the poor man ? . . . Certainly he has talked a great deal about him, but talk is very cheap.",46
532,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is all the poor man gets coalition from politicians as a rule.,46
533,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,And he addedI want to expose those who use this cheap way of advertising themselves. If some of them went to the back-blocks they would soon get lost.,46
534,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,I plead guilty to that.,47
535,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The relations between these gentlemen were not cordial, - to judge by their newspaper speeches, when the right honourable member for East Sydney visited Western Australia.",47
536,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,There has not been a break in our personal friendship.,47
537,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is not more than nine or ten months ago since the Prime Minister sent a telegram to AVestern Australia, in which he charged the right honourable member for Swan with being very ungenerous, and with degrading political life.",47
538,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,That telegram was sent on false informationThe right honourable member for Swan explained to me that he had not said what was attributed to him. I believe that the statement appeared in the newspaper of the honourable member for Coolgardie.,47
539,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Ridiculous . I haw no newspaper. The daily papers are my authority. This explanation about false information comes very late in the day.,47
540,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member did not read the correction.  dav.,47
541,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The fact remains that in a telegram sent to Senator Staniforth Smith on the 28th November, 1903, the Prime Minister said that the right honourable member for Swan was very ungenerous, and had degraded public life.",47
542,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,That was during the elections.,47
543,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,No ; just before.,47
544,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,It has all been cleared up since.,47
545,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I suppose what cannot be ""cleared up "" or ""explained"" can be "" repudiated."" Well, here is another statement, which was not based upon false information. These are some of the remarks made by the Prime Minister when he visited Fremantle, not very long agoNine of the eleven representatives sent by Western Australia to the Federal Parliament sat upon his side, and every one of the nine was a straight, true man.",47
546,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,At that time.,47
547,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Something has evidently happened sinceI f they had not been, by this time Sir John Forrest would have got them for his side. (Laughter.) Sir John Forrest had been throwing out some rather adroit remarks, not quite plain to the ordinary ear perhaps, but clear enough to the. political intelligence, to the effect that if his (Mr before me in black and white. Reid""s) friends would only leave him and go over to the Government it might be better for the Trans-Australian railway. (Laughter and applause.) I ask the attention of the House to the concluding sentenceHe was astonished that a gentleman of such high reputation, and hitherto unblemished character-(laughter)-shoul d be guilty of such a palpable attempt at bribery for political support.",47
548,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Well , I withdraw that charge.",47
549,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,What ? Another withdrawal ?,47
550,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,The information upon which that statement was made was not correct.,47
551,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,This is a conspiracy to make us quarrel.,47
552,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I think that the right honourable member for Swan is making a mistake, because the Prime Minister, when making the speech from which I have quoted, was relying upon the reports of the proceedings of this House.",47
553,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I told them that they should stand by me, not that they should stand by the Government.",47

557,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,Was that when I was at Fremantle?,47
558,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Yes .,47
559,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,I doubt whether I used the expression which the honourable member has just repeated.,47
560,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the right honourable gentleman has any doubt about the matter, I refer him to the file of the West Australian in the library, where he can read the report for himself.",47
561,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is why I doubt it.,47
562,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not think that I ever advised the representatives of Western Australia to join me as a member, of the Government. I advised them to unite with me, thinking that in that way we should do better.",47

But 1 could not help thinking, when Sir John Forrest so eloquently dilated upon the benefits of the scheme, that he bent his efforts towards shutting out from the gold-fields so many other blessings and comforts of civilized life. The right honourable member for Swan must have seen the report of those remarks.",47
564,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Prime Minister was at the time sitting in opposition to me.,48
565,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then the right honourable member for Swan, speaking at Northam, on the 14th December, 1903, is reported in the West Australian of the following day to have saidMr Reid had accused him of degrading politics, but if Mr Reid had done nothing more than he had to degrade politics, he would have a better political reputation than he had. Mr Reid had accused him of want of generosity in not acknowledging his (Mr Reid's) support to the railway movement. As soon as he saw the statement, he telegraphed to Mr Reid, informing him that some mischief-maker had been telling him a ""banger.""",48
566,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is quite true.,48
567,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then the right honourable gentleman addedMr Reid, with his usual discourtesy, had not acknowledged that telegram.",48
568,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,I should have had to pay that telegram whilst' the right honourable gentleman was in office.,48
569,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Then the right honorfree-trade able gentleman characterized Mr Reid's the statement that he had degraded politics as "" absolutely unfair and diabolically true.""",48

574,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That statement was made vious decision. on some occasion soon after the opening the Coolgardie water scheme. honourable member for Swan went on to sayMr Reid, when in Western Australia, considered the Transcontinental Railway to be trumps - in Victoria he changed the trumps. (Laughter.) The Prime Minister had been going through Victoria, speaking upon various topics, but never saying one word with regard to the 1903, he proposed Transcontinental Railway. The right honourable member for Swan continuedThroughout a long campaign in Victoria, Mr. Reid omitted any reference to the line, and meeting him afterwards, he (Sir John Forrest) reminded Mr Reid of the omission. Whereupon Mr Reid, in characteristic style, replied, "" By Jove, I forgot all about it ! "" (Laughter.) In j'ust the same way the right honourable gentleman forgot the old-age pensions scheme, and omitted it from his policy speech. That is the kind of recollection he has for any great work in which his friends are interested.",48
575,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,I am only human.,48
576,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,What a convenient memory the right honourable gentleman has. I should like now to say a word or two with regard to the extraordinary attitude assumed by the Government in connection with contracts for supplies for the Post and Telegraph Department. This matter has already been the subject of personal explanations by myself and the Postmaster General. The Minister will do me the justice to say that i did not introduce this question into the House.,48
577,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No , I introduced it.",48
578,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The matter was introduced by the honourable member for Parramatta, and I observe that the honourable member for Parkes, another supporter of the Government, has a question on the paper for in connection with the same subject. What has the Postmaster-General done? He, a professing free-trader, acting under a leader, has given a preference to local contractors to the extent of f u l ly 15 per cent., in addition to the protection unafforded by the Tariff upon the articles. I ask how this line of action can be reconciled with his free-trade principles.",48
579,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In the first place, I have not given a preference of 15 per",48
580,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Then the Minister has,48

582,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,Did not the Minister give any preferences at all ?,48
583,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,I carried out the previous decision.,48
584,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Exactly ; the decision of the Barton Government, which was that local contractors should receive a preference to the extent of 15 per cent. These Ministers who all their lives have been making a fetish of free-trade, and who were elected to Parliament solely because of that fact, have, upon obtaining office, swallowed their principles and given protection to the local manufacturers.  the articles supplied by the tenderers?",48
585,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I believe that the duty amounted to about 20 per cent.,49
586,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,Did not the honourable member say that he would give a preference to the British over American goods ?,49
587,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes . I said that I would give a reasonable preference to British goods. I would point out, however, that, unlike the Postmaster-General, I never made free-trade the cardinal principle of my life. I did not go into politics to advance free-trade, but to further the cause of labour.",49
588,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,Did not the honourable member think that the interests of labour were affected by the fiscal question?,49
589,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes , I did, and I do still j but the obligation to carry out a free- give it a preference. trade policy does not rest so heavily upon me as upon men like the Postmaster-General. What is he, if he is not a free trader ? Has he a shred of principle apart from the fiscal question? If free-trade, which has brought him into public life, were removed from the Minister's programme, his slate would be left absolutely blank.",49
590,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,My honourable colleague has done more for the workers of Australia than has the honourable member.,49
591,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yet , when such men get into office, they have the shocking indecency to sink their principles and give preference to manufacturers.",49
592,Mr JOSEPH ICOOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,How does the honourable member justify his action in giving preference ?,49
593,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am prepared to justify my actions at the proper time, and in the proper place. At present there are other people in the dock.",49
594,Mr REID,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is a very attractive dock.,49
595,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I stated in this House that if the local article were equal to the imported article in quality and price, I would give it a preference. What does the Minister do? He, a professing free trader, to whom free-trade is everything, immediately he gets into office begins to practise protection. He has been mouthing free-trade all his life, and yet he is ready to renounce his principles for the sake of office.",49
596,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member was afraid to give a decision.,49
597,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The Minister knows that that is not correct. He is aware that I held back the papers for the consideration of the Cabinet.,49
598,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member's minute does not say so.,49
599,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Does a minute disclose everything? Does a Minister, when he makes a minute, say everything that is to be said on the subject ? The Minister is placing the very worse construction upon the minute, because it suits his purpose to do so.",49
600,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WANT OF,This is a case of Satan reproving sin.,49
601,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member is entirely wrong. I ask him to look up the answer I gave in this House when I was questioned upon this subject. I stated that if the local article were equal in quality and price, I would That is the answer of a man who is a free-trader, and if the honourable member for Parramatta were in office, he could not do less. No wonder that the honourable and learned member for Parkes has placed a question on the notice-paper. No wonder that the honourable member for New England, and the honourable and learned member for Werriwa aie disgusted with the attitude of the Minister. They are honest men, who believe in carrying out to their logical conclusion the principles of their lives, but the Postmaster-General, after having vapoured about free-trade on the platform, shows his readiness to practise protection immediately on his accession to office. He has given a preference to contractors for articles which are already heavily protected by the Tariff. I defy the Minister to show that tenderers were ever told that local contractors would receive a preference.",49
602,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I can show a letter written by the honourable member to an American firm, stating that local tenderers were to receive a preference. On that account the firm refrained from tendering.",49
603,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I challenge the Minister to produce any letter in which I said that I would give a preference such as he has extended. If the honourable member produces such a lefter I shall acknowledge my error.,49
604,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Is it true that the honourable member proposed jto enter upon a free-trade crusade in Victoria, in combination with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports?",50
605,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No. I was going to enter upon a crusade in New South Wales with a view to discover a leader for the free-trade cause, seeing that the Prime Minister had abdicated that position.",50
606,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have here the letter to which I referred, and the honourable member's reply when he was acting as Postmaster-General.",50
607,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall read the letter, which is as follows:North .British Chambers, 39 Queen-street, The Secretary, Postmaster-General's Department, Post and Telegraph Department, Melbourne. Dear Sir, In reference to your advertisement in the Commonwealth Gazette, that you will receive tenders in Adelaide on the 21st September next for telegraph material, as verbally explained to you today, I beg leave to point out that on a former occasion, when I tendered for such material, although my price was the lowest, my tender was declined, on the ground that you were giving the preference to goods of British manufacture. As I am agent here for Messrs. John A. Roeblings, Sons and Co., of New York, and would be offering their well-known manufactures, I have been asked by these friends whether it is still your intention to give a preference as regards price for British goods. In an article like copper wire, the difference in price between British or other manufacture would only amount to a few shillings per ton, so you can see there is no room for any margin, and if there was such a preference given, my friends would not care to go to the expense of cabling over their tender. I shall be much obliged if you will kindly let me have a reply as to this tomorrow, so as to enable me to write to New York by Saturday's mail. If there was not any preference as to price, I should, of ccurse, be very glad to submit a tender on account of Messrs. Roebling's, as before. I am, dear sir, Upon that I wrote this minuteAs the writer says the difference in price between British and American wire is small, I think he may be informed that we intend to take the British article - H.M., Honorable MEMBERS - Hear ,",50
608,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,The member is blaming the Government for doing the same thing.,50
609,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The intimation was given the agent to save him the expense of cabling. I recollect the incident. My impression at the time was, and this letter shows it, that the difference at stake would be represented by shillings rather than by pounds, and that there was no real advantage in taking the American article. As this agent wanted the information at once, and did not appear desirous of obtaining the contract, it was to his advantage, and to that of the Department, to act as I did.",50
610,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,I do not blame the honourable member for adopting that course; but he has declared that he did not do so.,50
611,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the Postmaster-General could not find something stronger than that to support his statement, it would have been wiser of him to have kept it in the background. Melbourne, r4th July, 1904. Mr SYDNEY SMITH - The honourable member is blaming others for doing what he himself did.",50
612,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I certainly blame the politician who, having made free-trade the great cause of his life, declares that he lives politically only to advance its triumph, who secures office through its instrumentality, repudiating his professions when in power and practising protection. I regret having to introduce into this debate anything of a personal character; but the speech delivered a few evenings ago by the right honourable member for Swan compels me to do so. For a man of such broad and generous instincts, I think that he betrayed almost incredible pettiness upon that occasion. He was good enough to say that I am his per>sonal friend. I do hope that the relationship is reciprocal, and that he is also my friend. If he is, all I can say is that he has a very remarkable way of manifesting his friendship. What has he done ? I think that he has really misrepresented facts, not merely for the purpose of damaging me, but to injure the other labour represenYours faithfully, ALEX. FRASER. tatives of Western Australia in connection with the Transcontinental Railway. He also went to the length of threatening opposition to me. Of course I suppose that the opposition will come, and that I must i^/y/'on. meet it as best I can. But, should there be a dissolution, I think that the right honhear. oiable member may require to look after honourable himself. Ever since I have been a member of this House his practice has been to blow hot and to blow cold. He knows very well that I have assisted him in every possible way in connection with the Transcontinental Railway project",50
613,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,I said so.,50
614,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Unfortunately , the right honourable gentleman said so in one breath and said something else in the next breath.",51
615,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I was referring to the honourable member's allegiance to his party, and not to him personally. bound to the party.",51
616,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The right honourable member knows no friend except one who will follow him blindly. The real trouble is that I owe allegiance to someBill body other than himself. I am not one to blindly follow any person. never fulfilled that condition, and never a leading Ministerial follower. shall. I tell the right honourable member that, so that there may be no mistake the future. I prefer to think and to act for myself. I consider that his attack upon the Western Australian representatives was unprovoked, ungenerous, and unworthy.",51
617,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,I assure the orable member that there was nothing personal in my attack.,51
618,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am bound to put my own interpretation upon it . The right honourable member sometimes lectures honourable members as if they were children, or as if the records of the House did not enable them to ascertain the true facts concerning the postponement of the motion 1 relating to the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill . I say that the records of the House flatlv contradict the attitude which he has taken up. The right honourable member himself is largely blameworthy for the position in which the Bill relating to that project stands today. As far back as June last the Watson Administration took tha matter up.",51
619,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable memher assisted to turn the Deakin Government out of office, or we should have put the Bill through.",51
620,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The right honourable that member also assisted to turn the Watson Government out of office, when we were preits pared to proceed with it. I freely admit another place. that the Labour Party did form a portion of the majority which displaced the Deakin Administration. But the right honourable member cannot deny that he was three years to block it. in .office before the'project was brought before the House in a concrete form. never came before honourable members until, what was practically a motion of censure upon the Government had been tabled. .",51
621,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,It was mentioned in the Governor General's Speech as forming part of the programme of the Government prior to that.,51

623,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Whic h Government?,51
624,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Deakin Government. What happened upon that occasion ? Who were the members who blocked the ? One is a member of the present Government, which is supported by the right I have honourable member for Swan, and another is Upon the first occasion the present Minister of in Home Affairs protested against the preliminary message relating to the matter being taken into consideration-proteste d at a stage which is usually regarded as formal.",51
625,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It was not regarded hon- as formal - when the next Government brought the' matter forward. . Mr Mahon - It was not then regarded as formal, simply because the present Minister for Home Affairs made an objection never raised before at that stage in the progress of a Bill . The proposal had to be shelved by the Deakin Government owing to his action, and to that of the honourable member for Moira, another Government supporter. Then the Watson Administration took up the Bill. Again a supporter of the present Government blocked the measure and talked it out. The right honourable member for Swan voted against the Watson Ministry, and in that way helped to defer its passage.",51
626,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,But it reached a further stage after the present Government took office.,51
627,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I am aware of that. The right honourable member, however, knows perfectly well that the honourable member for Moira talked three hours against the motion relating to the Bill, despite the fact the measure had to pass its first and second readings, the Committee stage, and third reading, before it could be sent to At every one of those stages it would have been blocked by the supporters of the present Government.",51
628,Mr CARPENTER,MOTION OF WANT OF,They had threatened,51
629,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The right honourable It member was informed that the honourable member for Fremantle and other Western Australian representatives had seen the opponents of the Bill, and done everything in their power to induce them to withdraw their opposition to it, but without success. Consequently, his condemnation of the Western Australian members for not holding back the censure motion Was wholly unwarrantable.",51
630,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,Where was the hurry about it?,52
631,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Was a motion, which inState. volves the life of a Government, and which is of far-reaching consequence to the whole of Australia, to be deferred upon the offprecedent chance that the Bill would be dealt with? Federation. The right honourable member knows quite well that the measure could not this House that week, and that even if it could, it would not have been the Senate, because of the want of confidence motion intervening. Then what ground does he assume that it would have been carried in another place? The Government have not a majority there. They have only five or six supporters that Chamber. How, then, could' they have put the Bil l through? show the unreasonable character of the right honourable member's expectation in regard to the passage of this his equally unreasonable attitude in claiming that the honourable member should have deferred his want of confidence motion until it had been got out the way.",52
632,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is only a ter of opinion.,52
633,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I think that honourable member has acted very wrongly in reproaching the Labour Party in nexion with this matter. Instead proaching them.

As to the first charge, that I am unknown in Western Australia, all I can say is that I lived in that State from 1895 until I was elected to this Parliament. It may be true that I am not so widely known as is the right honourable gentleman, but that may be because I never sought to stand, under the limelight on all possible occasions.

The right honourable gentleman claims great credit for the democratic legislation which he has passed in the State Parliament of did. Western. Australia.

He replied to my inquiry in these termsSo far as my reading goes, the vital principle of Cabinet Government, as now developed, is unity and solidarityEvery Cabinet measure is equally the measure of each Minister and of the whole body, and, as such, is presented to Parliament and to the country. The preservation to the world of this unity and solidarity is the reason why its meetings are in secret and no record is kept. Of course there may be from time to time comparatively unimportant measures which are allowed to be open. But if a measure is of sufficient importance to appear in the opening speech, or later, to be proposed as a Government measure, a 'Minister must agree to it in to to or resign. If he so far differs when he has ceased to be a Minister, he can, by permission of the Crown, explain to Parliament why he has resigned, f t is because of his oath as an Executive Minister that he must have permission to explain to Parliament his resignation.

772,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"This authority goes on to say- . t may be argued that, after all, this limitation an ex-Minister is only a constitutional convention. But it seems to be an absolute necessity, if there is to be any reliance upon public men in their capacity as Ministers, and any mutual conwhile, as regards the ex-Mihister personally, it is a sort of moral suicide, and a confession I present that extract to the right honourable - Sir JOHN FORREST - I am quite content that. It refers to the whole measure.",58
773,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I cannot see that. I am sorry that I have been obliged by these interruptions and interjections to detain the House so long. The right honourable gentleman's action towards the Labour Party is very unjust, and if hefindshimself today a derelict politician, high and dry on the back benches in this House, he has to thank himself a good deal for it. His own actions have largely influenced the course of events in that regard. I regret very much that he is not representing Western Australia in this Ministry. It is little short of impertinence for the Prime Minister to say that he is going to be the reprehe should have arrested them. sentative of the western State in the Cabinet. It is a curious coincidence that when the right honourable member for Swan denied the gold-fields representation in the State Parliament, he made precisely the same excuse which the Prime Ministei now makes for shunting him aside. The right honourable member for Swan then declared that he would act for the miners in Parliament. This personal affront to the right honourable member for Swan, and this injustice to Western Australia is now being justified by precisely the same pretext used to disfranchise the 'gold-fields.",59
774,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"He has just as much influence though, as if he were in the Cabinet.",59
775,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I feel sure of that. But if Western Australia has to depend upon the Prime Minister for representation, then God help that State. We shall take care that the Ministry does not neglect it, and.I feel sure that the right honourable member for - Swan will be with us in that respect. I hope that this motion will be carried first of all, because I regard the Ministerial combination as hopelessly immoral. It is composed of men who have absolutely nothing in common, except a hatred of the progressive party in this House, and of democratic legislation. It is not in the interests of this country that men who show so little regard for political principles should be intrusted with the administration of great Departments. Australia should not trust its destinies to men who carry out a policy in which they say they do not believe. Here we have the Prime Minister declaiming against the operation of the White Australia policy, and yet carrying it out.",59
776,Mr MCCAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Not against the White Australia policy.,59
777,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Practicall y that; I refer to contract labour. The Prime Minister was grossly unjust to his predecessor in the Department. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney carried out the law as he believed it should be carried out, and the right honourable gentleman had ample opportunity of reversing that policy if he chose to do so. It is mere hypocrisy for him to pretend that he had no option but to adopt the policy of his predecessor. He is in a responsible position now, and if he is the man he professes to be before the House, he should have had the courage of his convictions, and whatever stage these proceedings might have reached For these reasons, amongst others, I trust this motion will be carried. The country never called these gentlemen to take up the reins of government. On the contrary, the constituencies pronounced against them. They hold office in abrogation of constitutional principles, and in flat defiance of the people's will. Do they challenge this statement? If so, why do they cower at' the mere mention of a dissolution ? We invite-nay , we challenge-the m to remit the issue to the electors. They tremble at the prospect because they know, as we do, that an appeal. to the country is to them equivalent to a sentence of death. They know, as we do, that it means the disappearance of most of the reactionary politician's who surround them, and the triumph of the party of progress, whose policy I am convinced makes' for the true welfare of the people of Australia. Motion (by Mr SKENE) proposed - That the debate be now adjourned.",59
778,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I rise to make a short personal explanation. I do not wish to detain honourable members; but the honourable member for Coolgardie, in referring to an administrative act of mine in connection with the Post and Telegraph Department, rather misrepresented the true facts of the case.",59
779,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Order ! I have already pointed, out several times that a personal explanation can only be made concerning some matter in respect of which an honourable member has been misrepresented or misunderstood.",59
780,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,Exactly .,59
781,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If the honourable gentleman desires to explain any matter concerning which he has been misrepresented or misunderstood, of course he can do so in a personal explanation; but if it is in regard to any other matter, I shall have to ask the House if it is prepared to listen to him. I have no doubt that it will tend the usual courtesy to him.",59
782,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"It is a personal explanation I wish to make, and it will be perfectly in order.",60
783,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"As the honourable have gentleman has not spoken yet, he will have plenty of time to explain.",60
784,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,It is in connection wilh a matter which came before the House on a previous occasion.,60
785,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WANT OF,Thes e frequent personal explanations are becoming a perfect scandal.,60
786,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If an act of mine has been misrepresented, it is only fair that I should have an opportunity to put the matter right.",60
787,Mr MCDONALD,MOTION OF WANT OF,So the honourable gentleman will when he is called. He can speak for four hours if he likes.,60
788,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Wit h reference to the question of preference in postal contracts, the honourable member for Coolgardie knows full well that on a previous occasion I pointed out that the tenders were invited in about April of this 'year, that under Ministerial decisions certain preference was to be allowed, and that because the honourable gentleman had declined to give a decision on the preference matter, the tenders were submitted to me for my determination.",60
789,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Not declined, but merely deferred.",60
790,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable gardie. gentleman may put it as he likes,",60
791,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Minister has no right to put it wrongly. . Mr SYDNEY SMITH - I shall accept the honourable gentleman's version lhat his decision was merely deferred. At all events, he declined to accept tenders where anv preference was involved', but accepted all the rest. He left the question of preference in abeyance, and it came on to me for determination. I merely minuted the paper to the effect that the practice in force! at the time the lenders were invited should be followed, and I take it that it would have been a breach of faith with tenderers if the terms of the previous Minister's decision had not been carried out. Mr. JOSEPH COOK,-And the minute renesses. lates only to those?",60
792,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,Yes . The total amount of the contracts,60
793,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I cannot see that what the Minister is stating is a personal tion. To some extent it is a reply to the exhonorable member for Coolgardie, and to the remaining extent it is an introduction of new matter. I would suggest to the Postmaster-General that he should either ask leave to make a statement-in which case I no doubt that the House would give its consent-o r leave the matter until he speaks later uii.",60
794,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"He is trying to justify protection, when he was returned as a free trader.",60
795,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I do not wish to justify anything, but merely to place the true facts before honourable members, Mr KING O'MALLEY - He did the rightthing.",60
796,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is a matter with which' I shall deal by-and-by. I think, sir, it is a persona] explanation I am making. I am seeking to show that I have been misrepresented by the honourable membet for Coolgardie in regard to a matter which I brought before the House at the instance of the honourable member for Parramatta. The total amount of all contracts involved in this particular case was ,Â£13,600, and the total amount of preference was Â£ 6 4 izs. od. on sums amounting to, I think, ,Â£1,706 or ,Â£1,800. So that the total amount of preference given under previous Ministerial decisions which I was carrying out amounts to Â£ 6 4 12s. gd.",60
797,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,I wish to refer to one or two matters which have been mentioned by the honourable member for Cool,60
798,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the right honourable member intend to explain his own speech?,60
799,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I wish to explain that the'statement of the honourable member that I entered into negotiations through the persons he named- Mr Rason and - the late Mr Barry Wood-with ' the Labour Party to prevent the Minister of Railways from being opposed at the election, and that I promised to introduce a Bill for the payment of members if no opposition was offered, is' without any foundation. .1 had no communication, directly or indirectly, with any members of the Labour Party in regard to that matter.",60
800,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I shall produce the. wit,60
801,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,I give.the statement an absolute and unqualified denial.,60
802,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,I shall produce evidence.,60
803,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In regard to the explanastatement that I made conditions with a deputation to avoid a no-confidence motion being moved, I deny it absolutely. I said, "" I will do my utmost to pass the Bill if time will permit, but, if the ' position are going, to obstruct the business of the House, I may not be able to do it. If you can bring pressure to bear on your friends in the House, so that they will not obstruct business, we shall be able' to pass the Bill."" They said, "" You leave that to us; we shall be able to do it . "" They did it. There was no obstruction, and we were able to pass the measure. I am surprised that the honourable member-h e spoke, ho doubt, in good faith-shoul d have made statements of this sort, when, if he had made inquiries from me of any one else who knew what was going on at that time in Western Australia, he would have ascertained that there was not the remotest foundation for either of the two statements.",60
804,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WANT OF,My information came from men who saw the right honourable member.,61
805,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I absolutely deny the accuracy of the statements. Motion agreed to; debate adjourned. ADJOURNMENT, PROGRESS OF BUSINESS.",61
806,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WANT OF," In 'movingThat the House do now adjourn, I would remind honourable members or. both sides that we are making very slow progress, indeed, with business. I appeal to them to endeavour by every means in their power to bring the debate to a conclusion as soon as possible, consistent, of course, with reasonable opportunities for discussion, Mr Mauger .(Melbourne Ports) - I am sure that we all agree 'with what the Minister of Trade and Customs has said, but after he and other Ministers have made long speeches, - it seems strange that he should expect those who have not addressed themselves to the question before the House to contract their remarks unduly. If the honourable gentleman would propose a new standing order to limit the duration of speeches, I would support it, but I do not think that it is fair, after long speeches have been made by Ministers and others, that honourable members who have not spoken should be shut out.",61
807,Mr MCLEAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,We do not desire to shut out any one; if honourable members confine themselves more strictly to the subOpject-matter of the debate matters will be expedited. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.14 p.m.,61
