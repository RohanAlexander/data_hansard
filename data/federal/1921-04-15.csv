1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 11 a.m., and readprayers. POSITION OF THE MINISTRY. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",19
2,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Perth) [11.1] - I wish to make a personal explanation regarding the position whioh arose yesterday. I sat in my place all the afternoon awaiting an opportunity to speak on the important debate whioh had occupied the attention of the Hou6e during the preceding day, and was the firsff business set down, for yesterday. I thought, perhaps, that the honourable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) was ill-advised in interpolating another matter. Mr Jow. TT - Ha d I to tsk your consent to move the adjournment yesterday 1",19
3,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"The representation of Australia at the Imperial Conference is a matter of rruch more importance than that which the honourable member caused t be discussed yesterday. Towards the close of tl e discussin on his adjournment motion, a member of the press in the gallery to my immediate left bent over, and asked me for a statement of what had taken place at a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee, of which I am chairman, and I proceeded to give him certain facts. Whilst speaking to him, I was unconscious of what was taking place in the chamber, and misheard as a call of order to me what was a call for order after the Honse had divided. It was some little time before I realized that a division was being taken, and a tittle longer before I recognised its import. By that time it was too late for me to change my position. However, I regarded the proceedings as in the nature of a joke; certainly I did not take them seriously. The situation that has been created carries considerable possibilities for me. There are members of the Ministerial party who strongly resent my vote; but I am sure that the Prime Minister is grateful to me for having afforded him an opportunity to improve his position. For the moment I cannot make up my mind whether I am likely to be expelled from the party or to be offered a portfolio.",19
4,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I have been expecting a statement from a Minister, preferably the Prime Minister, regarding yesterday's vote. I ask what action the Government intends to take, in view of the fact that yesterday the business was taken out of their hands. Do Ministers intend to hang on to office? ADJOURNMENT.",20
5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.3] - I move That the House do now adjourn. In reply to the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor), let me say that my attention being distracted for a moment, I was unaware that the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) had concluded his remarks, and so did not rise as I had intended immediately he had resumed his seat. Honourable members understand fully the significance of what occurred. yesterday afternoon. I have been a member of the Parliament of New South Wales, and I have sat continuously as a member of this Parliament since its inception. My parliamentary experience covers a period of some twenty-seven years, but the vote of yesterday is to me without precedent. Members who have been in other Parliaments may have had a different experience. Let me remind honourable members of the circumstances. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) moved the adjournment of the House to call attention to a matter of urgent public importance, namely, the high oversea freights now ruling. Whatever our opinion may be of the matter brought before the House by the honourable member or of the speeches of himself and other honourable members, it can h{*rdly be contended that the Government is in any way responsible for high freights or that the motion was directed against the Government. It-was alleged to be a friendly motion. It was so far a friendly motion that the honourable gentleman himself asked me to be present in my place; and I paid him the compliment of being here and of preparing, as well as I could-seeing-that I did not know exactly what he was about to say-somethin g which bore directly on the matter to which he wished to direct the attention of the House and the country. I think he will agree with me that in anything I said there was no room for offence; and I certainly was under tha impression that, in anything he said, both in regard to the Government and to the party which I have the honour to lead, there was no reflection, let alone any intention of censure.",20
6,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,That is so.,20
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Ver y well. I followed the honourable gentleman, and having exhausted, and more than exhausted, the time allotted to me I went away. I returned to the chamber, and found, to my astonishment, that the motipn which had been moved by the honourable member for Grampians, to eall attentfon to a matter of urgent publio importance, was being used as a means of taking the business out of the hands of the Government. If the honourable member had moved a motion complaining of high freights, and had suggested some practicable means by which these could have been reduced, I would have voted with him; but the honourable gentleman merely wished to call attention to a matter of great importance to the Commonwealth, but in which neither the Government nor the Parliament could take any effective action. As far as I was able to do so, I supported him, explaining the position as well as I could, pointing out the limits imposed upon ship-owners as well as upon everybody else by inexorable circumstances. The honourable gentleman had, by ventilating the matter, done all that was possible, and, having done so, it was not his intention to prevent the House proceeding to discuss other matters of great public importance, one of which permits of no delay. When, therefore, a division was called for and it was proposed to adjourn the House, I had no alternative but to' vote as I did. The leader of the party to which the honourable member for Grampians is attached, and other ""honourable members with whom I discussed the matter subsequent to the division, have given mo their personal assurance that they had no intention of taking the business out of the hands of the Government. Interruption.",20
8,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,They have told me that some of them did not know what they Avere voting on.,21
9,Mr HILL,Unknown,I think you should name them. Interruption.,21
10,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," Order ! Will the right honourable the Prime Minister please resume his seat. The Prime Minister has already informed the House that he is suffering from a vocal disability. It is impossible for me to follow what he is saying while these numerous and concerted interjections are occurring. I ask honourable members, therefore, to restrain themselves, and permit the Prime Minister ro make his remarks without undue interruption.",21
11,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I ask for the forbearance of the House. I am not well, and am trying to do my best. I am? sorry that I cannot speak louder. I am endeavouring to put in some sort of chronological order the events which transpired in'relation to the matter underreview. I repeat that some of the members of the Country party assured me that they did not know what they were voting on, or, at all events, that they had no clear idea of the effects of their vote. I accept all these assurauoes, namely, that the motion was a friendly one, and was not intended as a reflection upon the Government, that the Country party did. not call for a division, that members of the Opposition did so, and that honourable members of the Country party thereupon felt bound to support the motion which had been moved by a member of their party, the honourable member for Grampians. Of course, had some of those honourable members been a little more experienced they would have known that nothing is more common Interruption.",21
12,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,If honourable members persist in interjecting and in making concerted interruptions I shall have to take a different course of action.,21
13,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"If honourable members will not give me a chance to speak, let them say so, and I will sit down. repeat that if some members of the Country party had had a little more experience they would have known that it is almost the invariable practice to negative a motion of the character in question, and not to support it. Such motions are not moved for the actual purpose of adjourning the House. They are an interruption of the ordinary programme of work set down on the business-paper for the day, in order to discuss some matter of urgent public business. I have myself often voted against motions which I have ' moved for the adjournment oii the House when a vote has been called for, having obtained by the discussion thereon all that I had sought. And this frequently happens. No one knows better than the honourable member for Grampians that no vote of this House could reduce freights. If the Government were able, by some act of theirs, to reduce freights, and he had said, in effect, by his motion, "" You must reduce freights,"" then a vote to ascertain the feeling of the House in regard to such a demand would have been quite proper. But such was not the case. The motion was moved in order to call attention-as I have said, and the honourable member for Grampians also has saidto a matter of grave importance, not only to the primary producer, but to the Commonwealth generally. These, then, are the facts: The motion was a friendly one. We are assured by several members of the Country party that they had no intention of embarrassing the Government; that they did not call for a division, but that, a division having been called for, those who were in the chamber felt bound to support the motion, while those who had been outside and came into take part in the division sat alongside their colleagues.. I think that fairly sets out the situation. Having said so much, I want to ask honourable members, How do these facts affect the situation ? It still remains true that the business had been taken out of the hands of the Government",21
14,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"And rightly so, too.",21
15,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Honourable members who have had any experience of parliamentary government know that that is the one thing which a Government cannot submit to. °,21
16,Mr WEST,Unknown,No respectable Government.,21
17,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have no option, therefore, this morning but to move the I adjournment of the House to enable the Government to consider the situation. Maj' I be permitted to say a word or two more ? It "" is, in my opinionand that opinion is supported the measured and deliberate utterances of the Opposition and Country party - imperativ e that Australia should be represented at the Imperial Conference. It would be a most unfortunate occurrence if , as in 1917, a domestic) crisis again prevented Australia from being represented. Perhaps we have more to lose now by the absence of a representative than we had even then. At any rate, we have too much to lose to take the risks of Australia not being represented. I think honourable members who wish their country well would consider it a calamity if . through anything failing short of that deliberate expression of lack of confidence in the Government which a vote of censure involves, the representation of Australia was made practically impossible. I am not going into the matter any further, excepting to point out what is very obvious. The sands of time are running out, and what has to be done must be done quickly. I ask any honourable member here whether, if he were in my place, he would be prepared to represent his country in London in view of the vote that was recorded",21
18,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I think the Government should resign on such a vote.,22
19,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Riskin g as he must every day the probability of an adverse vote.,22
20,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"If the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) is so ""cocky,"" why does he not now move the adjournment of the House?",22
21,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! Order! - Mr HUGHES - I was saying that I do not think any honourable member of this Chamber, if he were in my place, would be prepared to represent the Commonwealth in London and risk the probability of a vote such as was taken yesterday, not only involving humiliation upon himself, but rendering nugatory everything that had been done - o r that had to be done-to enable Australia to be effectively represented. I ask any honourable member to put himself in my place, and consider what he would do.",22
22,Mr WEST,Unknown,Most men would resign..,22
23,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) is again out of order.,22
24,Mr WEST,Unknown,I did not speak before.,22
25,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! by,22
26,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"When in Cairo, I inspected the Sphinx, and wondered why it had been worshipped by mankind throughout the ages. I know now: It never says a word. It is not merely an unwritten law, but an invariable practice, that no Government can carry on as if nothing had happened after an adverse vote had been recorded. There have been numerous instances where ""snatch"" votes have been taken; but in every such case that has been set right by carrying another motion. That has been the practice in every case so far as I know, and I can, of course, speak fro m a fairly lengthy experience. . I ask the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page), of any man in a responsible position, whether he would coiftinue to carry on as if nothing had happened when 12 or 13 honourable members, by allying themselves to the Opposition, had snatched the business out of the hands of the Government. The explanation is that pthey did not mean it . I accept the explanation without any reservations at all , that there was no such intention in the minds of the members of ttfe Country party. The position, after that explanation, unless and u n t i l something is done to set it right, still remains the same. I look around this chamber, and this Parliament, as I have a right to do, and consider the position of parties. It is perfectly clear that when a party which consists of 38 members is challenged by two sections, which allegedly have nothing in common and who do not collectively, and certainly not separately, possess the numbers to carry on, the Government must, in the very nature of the thing, if it is to hold office with dignity and with due regard to its position in this House and in the country, take but one course in view of the vote which was recorded yesterday. I want to make my position 1 quite clear. Not only do I not seek a crisis, but I am prepared to go as far as any man possibly can, with due regard to the dignity of the Government and of this party and the people it represents in the country^ to avoid a crisis. But the representative of Australia at the Conference in London must have behind him a majority of this House. In no other way can Australia be effectively, represented at all. Apart then from other considerations, while there remains any doubt as to whether this Government has control of the business of this House, any attempt it may make to represent Australia at the Conference in London must invite, not merely the criticism, but the censure of every other section in this House, and of the great majority of the people of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition asked a question, and I am sorry that he had to ask it .",22
27,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,- I was waiting for you to rise.,23
28,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am sorry; but. I have explained the matter. During my somewhat lengthy term of office I have appealed to the people on two occasions. The verdict of the people has been on each occasion clear and emphatic. people certainly did give this party a mandate, clear and unmistakable, to govern this Commonwealth on certain well-defined line3 ' If honourable members - would put party prejudice on one side, and seek to ascertain owhat is the desire of the people at this juncture, they would find that it is that Australia may be represented at this Conference. The Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) declared this in so. many words, and I entirely agree with him. Because of that,, the Government, though unable to ignore what took place yesterday, will seek an opportunity-and whether that opportunity is to be given depends entirely on the House'-of ascertaining what the vote of yesterday meant. If , as honourable members assure us, it is not to be regarded as a vote of censure on the Government, or an. attempt to take the business out of the hands of the Government, well, either by words or by action, that can be demonstrated. In the meantime, under the circumstances, I ""have no option but to move the motion"" That the House do now adjourn.""",23
29,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [11.34] - I am under no misapprehension as to what the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) means by his motion; and I am under no misapprehension as to what he expects to get out of it. He will put the ""acid test"" on members in the corner. ""'51  put on.",23
30,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It has been put on some. There are others who indignantly deny that they had been brought up to the ""bull ring,"" and say that they intend to give their whole-hearted support to the Government, and promise the Government immunity from any adverse vote whilst the Prime Minister is away. I make no apology for asking the question I did.",23
31,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"No apology is desired; I merely ask you to excuse the fact that, in consequence of my turning to my colleagues, I did not hear what was said.",23
32,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That is so. Mr. Speaker was going on with other business, and I took the only step I could to get a statement from some responsible Minister,' preferably the Prime Minister. I make no apology for the vote of yesterday, nor for the call for a division. Such The an occurrence is not, as the Prime Minister states, anything unusual, because we had a similar experience less than six months ago, on a Friday morning. The then Leader of the Country party (Mr MCWilliams) moved the adjournment of the House to consider the purchase of saw-mill and timber areas in Queensland; and the following is an extract from the Hansard report of what took place on that occasion:",23
33,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,You are going to insist on a vote? - Mr TUDOR - I certainly think there should be a vote.,23
34,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"After the speech, of the Prinie Minister (Mr Hughes), we ought to have a vote. I am willing that a vote shall be taken.",23
35,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Then , with the consent of the Government, I will move for an extension of time. I was ruled out of order, and the Government were so keen against the extension of time that there was an incident in connection with the division the Kk$ of which had never happened before. The Prime Minister then wanted to "" put the acid"" on as straight a man as ever sat in this Parliament-the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton)and he said to that honourable member, "" Charlton, if you vote for this I will not go on with the tribunal."" Every honourable member who was here on that Friday morning-the 10th September last-know s what took place. The Prime Minister knew then that, if the extension of time were carried, the Government would have to take similar action to that taken this morning.",23
36,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,That was quite a different thing- a motion for an extension of time is very different.,24
37,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Is it?,24
38,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The honourable member has been in Parliament a long time, though not so long as I have, and I ask him whether he has ever known anything like what took place yesterday?",24
39,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Yes .,24
40,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"When? ,",24
41,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,When you and I were members of the same Government.,24
42,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,When was that?,24
43,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"When Mr Kelly, the then member for Wentworth, on the suggestion, probably, of the late Mr Deakin, moved that the House adjourn, thus deliberately taking the business out of the hands of the Government. There were present on that occasion the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Groom), the honourable member for Richmond (Mr. Greene), the honourable member for Grey  for Herbert (Mr Bamford), and a few others.",24
44,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,That was an entirely different thing.,24
45,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The motion yesterday was for the adjournment of the House.,24
46,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,And so was the motion on the 10th September.,24
47,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Nothin g of the sort!,24
48,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Everythin g is entirely different that is not the.same, I suppose. I know that the motion for the adjournment of the House is a means of ' ' sudden death."" We are told that if any member of the Country party or any member following the Government, moves the adjournment of the House, it is to mean only so much "" hot air "" ; no vote is to be taken. Good care is taken to talk out such motions, as I myself have experienced' at the hands of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr.% Corser). I have endeavoured, on three occasions, to deal with the question of the fixing of the price of sugar, but the honourable member mentioned always took good eare that no vote was recorded; and a similar course will always be, taken by honourable members who are interested keenly in the fate of the Government or in the particular subject under discussion I may 'say that I cannot credit one statement that has been made. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler), who has had twenty years' parliamentary experience, has said that he did not know which side he was voting on in the division yesterday ",24
49,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"I did know, but I did not have an opportunity to get across.",24
50,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If the honourable member knew which side he was voting on, there are other members of the Country party who say that they themselves did not: and to me that is incredible. I can only say that if there are honourable members in that position, they should confess the fact to their constituents, and ask them to send others to represent them in Parliament. Earlier in my remarks I noted how few there are left of the members of the House of ten years ago, showing what an uncertain game politics is; and it is highly probable that ten years hence many more of us will be missing. The Government, apparently, are going to consider their position. The Prime Minister has told us that the sands of time are running out, and that he, or some other representative of Australia, should now'be on his way to the Imperial Conference. I understand from the newspapers that he has booked his berth for the 27th inst. Mi . HUGHES - I do not want the honourable member to take the newspapers as his bible. If he wants any information, I shall be glad to supply it.",24
51,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am not like the honourable gentleman, who, when he wished to expel the late member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Mahon), took the press reports of that member's utterances as his bible.",24
52,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I did not.,24
53,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,There is no man in this Parliament who has less to thank the preSs for than I have.,24
54,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"What have I to thank the press for? Can the honourable member tell me of one newspaper which supports me? If so, where is it?",24
55,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The whole lot of them support the Prime Minister at election times-certainl y the whole of the newspapers in this State. I recollect that when I visited Bendigo I saw special supplements issued with the newspapers there for the benefit of the right honourable gentleman"" supplements setting forth his doings and showing what he was and where he was. The latter, of coiirse, is a very difficult thing to determine in respect of political questions. The right honourable gentleman has told us that the sands of time are running out, and in order to expedite the transaction of business he has moved the adjournment of this House until Wednesday next. It is quite possible that the acid test has already been applied to certain honourable members of this Chamber,, so that we shall be no further forward on Wednesday next than we are today.",24
56,Mr CORSER,Unknown,The honourable member may be sent for before then.,25
57,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It would not be the first time that I have been sent for, though I have no doubt that it would be an awful calamity in the eyes of some honourable members opposite if an honourable member upon this side of the Chamber were sent for. But if my honourable friend who has interjected imagines that I have any anxiety in the direction indicated, he may disabuse his mind of the idea. If I am sent for, I shall certainly do my best in the circumstances, as I have always done. Doubtless the acid test has already been applied to certain honourable members who have affirmed that they voted yesterday in the way that they did by mistake. Let me quote from the Hansard proof of the speech delivered by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page). He taunted the Country party that they would not take a vote upon the question. Thereupon the h'moiable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) interjected",25
58,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member will not be in order in quoting the Hansard report of yesterday.,25
59,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Ver y well. The honourable member for South Sydney affirmed that the Country party would not take a vote upon the motion. The honourable member for Maranoa stated that he knew they would not, and thereupon the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), who was the Minister in charge of the House at the time, declared that if they did not call for a division upon it the Government would do so. He said that he was anxious to take a vote upon the question.",25
60,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,What question? Mr TUDOR.'-The . question of the motion for adjournment which was moved here yesterday.,25
61,Sir ROBEET BEST,Unknown,No .,25
62,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) was not here. He missed the division.,25
63,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,I did. I was outside the door of the chamber.,25
64,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It was the honourable member's duty to be inside the chamber door, and it is quite possible that the electors of Kooyong will want to know why he was not present when the division was taken. Of. course, the Treasurer is not at liberty to alter an interjection in another member's speech and if we are to attach any importance to his words, he made the interjection to. which I have referred I was not present when the honourable mem the motion, but the Secretary of the CouLtry party, Mr Gibson, the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), and other honourable members admit that they heard the Treasurer make the statement which is recorded in Hansard.",25
65,Mr WEST,Unknown,He said it all right. .,25
66,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If that was the attitude of tht> Government, and if they did intend to call for a division upon the motion, why do they now object to that course, having been followed?",25
67,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I give the honourable member my word that the statement as to the attitude of the Government is not true.,25
68,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The Treasurer was tha Minister in charge of the House at the time, ancl he certainly made the interjection to which I have directed attention.",25
69,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Surely I am at liberty to speak for the Government, and I say that the statement is net true. I. was told by the lionorable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) that the motion was ""to bs brought up for a definite purpose, and I prepared for it in order that I might help him, and help the object which he had ,in view. Nothing 'was further from the thought of the Government than to call for a division.",25
70,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The Prime Minister says it was not the intention of the Government to call for a division. But the Minister who was in charge of the House right up to the time that the vote was taken distinctly said that if the Country party did not. call for a division, the Goi n vernment would do so. The statement to be found in the Hansard report of speech of the honourable member for isters appear to think. Maranoa, and we can accept the Hansard report as an accurate one. I do not ask honourable members to accept my word for it. The Treasurer made the statement which is attributed to him in Hansard, yesterday, but long ago. and consequently the Government have no right this morning to kick up a row about the vote which was taken yesterenable day. Mr RICHARD .""FOSTER - The honourable member knows very well that the statement is ridiculous upon the face of it .",25
71,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,A member o'. the Country party said that they w o u l i see that the motion was talked out.,26
72,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,We have you.,26
73,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,W l u r e is the Treasurer ?,26
74,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) is out of order,26
75,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I have very little to add beyond saying that the interjection by the Treasurer puts an entirely different complexion upon the whole procedure -- f yesterday.,26
76,Mr CORSER,Unknown,That is if he made it .,26
77,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,There are several honourable members upon both sides of the chamber who heard him make it .,26
78,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Why , the Hansard report is the other way round.",26
79,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,There is not tha slightest doubt that the interjection was made and that it had reference to a division upon the motion for adjournment.,26
80,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Her e is the Treasurer Now let him speak for himself.,26
81,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"When I have concluded my remarks, he will be at liberty to do so. He was in charge of the House when the vote was taken, and he said that if the Country party did not call for a division upon the motion, he would.",26
82,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The Hansard record says exactly the opposite of that.,26
83,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"The honourable member referred to talking the motion out, not to calling for a division.",26
84,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"This motion certainly cannot be talked out, because every honourable member is at liberty to speakupon it for one hour and a quarter. bate, therefore, may last all day. dently the Government find themselves a difficult position. Some of i ' their alleged supporters are not so ; the keen upon supporting them, as M in Nobody knows this better than does the Prime Ministerand if it were not for the hatred which they have of one party in this House the - Government would have been shifted, not The Prime Minister cannot rely upon the support of an absolute majority of this Chamber to him to carry on the business of the country.",26
85,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Upon a personal explanation I desire to say that the Hansard report of what occurred yesterday serves only to remind me once again of how a littl e badinage may appear in cold print. Honourable members know perfectly well that the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page) was, as usual, making himself very vocal yester.day afternoon, and amongst other things ho taunted the Country party that their gun was not loaded and that nothing would come of the motion. According to the Hansard report, he said that the Country party would take good care that they did not get 'a division upon it , whereupon I am reported to have said that if the Country party did not take good care to have no division upon it we would do so.  Treasurer deny the accuracy of the report ?",26
86,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Certainl y not. Lt merely records a littl e badinage across the table. To attempt to erect that into a serious statement shows the straits to which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Tudor) is reduced.,26
87,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"We should get Hansard to insert alongside the interjection this explanation, ""This is intended as a joke.""",26
88,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Exactly. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr . James Page) will not deny that the whole thing was a joke.,26
89,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The Treasurer said that he would take care that there would be no division.,26
90,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And that is all The de- that the Hansard report says. Will the Evi- Leader of the Opposition tell me what he told the House during my absence?,26
91,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I have repeated to the House exactly what the Hansard report says, namely, that the Treasurer said ; that if the Country party did not call for a division he would take care that there was one.",27
92,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Having read the report in Hansard, I declare to the House that it contains not one word that justifies that statement. What - the Leader of the Opposition has said amounts to unmitigated misrepresentation. The report states that I would do my best to' prevent a division.",27
93,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Hear , hear!",27
94,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Does the Leader of the Opposition, after looking through the report, again persist in the statement he has made.",27
95,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I still say that, in my opinion, what I said is an accurate interpretation of the Treasurer's interjection.",27
96,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That we would see' that there was a division?,27

99,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"South Sydney) [11.52]. i - I hope the House will give very serious consideration io the matter that is now before it. By vote yesterday the House declared that it had lost confidence in the Government. The Prime Minister has now proposed the adjournment of the House; no doubt the Government will carry the motion, and will - then be quite safe. The Prime Minister has stated that no self-respecting Government could hold office after a vote had been recorded against them, but he and his Ministers must have a short memory. I remember that when they went to the country on the conscription question, the Prime Minister said that unless the referendum was carried, the Government would not continue to hold ofiice. Some Ministers stated that if the people rejected their proposal they would not retain office for twenty-five minutes. But when conscription was defeated what did this self-respecting Government do ? They resigned, but said: ""Please, Governor General, send for us again."" The Governor General asked the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) whom he should send for to form a Ministry, and the Prime Minister replied: ""Send for W. M . Hughes."" And the same self-respecting Government retained possession of the Treasury bench. Last night, when some newspaper reporters asked me what would happen as a result of yesterday's vote, I replied, ""There is not a traction 'engine in the country that could drag the Government off the Treasury bench."" What are the Government proposing now? The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) yesterday moved a motion in all sincerity; he pointed out the shipping freight anomalies as a result of which the producers were being bled. He stated that the Shipping Combine were earning big profits and fleecing the pro-, ducers, and that that was one of the reasons for high prices. What promise did the Government give to relieve the producers? They made no promise that they would try to bring about any reduction, and, accordingly, when the question was taken to a division honourable members of the Country party supported it. But I suppose the acid has been put on them this morning. Honourable members know that when a man purchases a piece of jewellery which is supposed to be 18 carat, and he doubts its genuineness, he tests it with acid. The Government are putting the acid on the Country party today, and if they do not stand the test Several honourable members interjecting,",27
100,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! This disorderly conduct cannot be permitted to continue. There is a perfect babel of sound, and it is impossible for any honourable member to address the House without being subjected to unseemly interruption by loud conversation or continuous interjections. I ask honourable members to support the Chair in trying to keep some semblance of order in the conduct of debate; otherwise, our proceedings will be reduced to a farce. I hope the honourable member for South Sydney will be allowed to continue in reasonable silence, and that he will address his remarks to the Chair instead of to other honourable members.",27
101,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"The acid has been put upon the 'Country party in order to ascertain whether they were sincere in the actiort they took yesterday. If they retreat from the position they took up they will prove that they are "" brummies,"" and the country will reject them. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has stated that individual members of the Country party came to him,, and said that they did not know what they were doing when they voted for the motion yesterday.",27
102,Mr STEWART,Unknown,He did not name them.,28
103,Mr EILEY,Unknown,"-He did not, and his statement is an insult to every member of the party.",28
104,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,It is not.,28
105,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Has not the honourable member for South Sydney voted many times without knowing what he was voting on?,28
106,Mr EILEY,Unknown,"The Treasurer must speak for himself. Wo doubt he has voted in ignorance on many occasions. The Prime Minister has tried to eulogize the Leader of the Country party, and has said that members of that party had told himthat they did not kuow that the motion was loaded, and that they were friendly to the Government.",28
107,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,He did not say that.,28
108,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Will individual members of the party say that they did not approach the Prime Minister last night? Will they follow the example of the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) ? The honourable member is like a jumping jack; at one moment he is against the Government and seeking an opportunity to defeat them, and then when the Government have been defeated he is the means by which the Government seek to show that honourable members did ' not understand the significance of their vote. I wonder what the people of Perth will say when they read the statement of the honourable member for Perth that when a division was taken he was talking to a journalist, and did not know what was happening. The division bells ring for three minutes;, the honourable member is an old parliamentarian, and an exChairman of Committees, and he must have understood the question. But new that he finds the vote has gone against the Government he is assisting to get them out of a tight corner.",28
109,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,You have known the same mistake a score of times in experience.,28
110,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I have not. The honorMinistry. able member cannot make me utter an untruth in that way. I never knew any case of that kind before. I trust that if politics in this country are going to 'have any honour, and if this Parliament is to command - any respect from the people, the Government will take the only proper course open to them. When a vote has been recorded against the Government, and they have been defeated, the most manly course for the Prime Minister to adopt is to tender his resignation to the Governor General, and let the Governor General exhaust the possibilities of the House. This the Government did not do. Instead, there was conference after conference, and interview after interview, and buttonholing, and getting members of the Country party into a corner. It has been said before that the Government had the Country party "" in the bag."" They may have some of the Country party "" in the bag,"" but I know members of that party who resent that sort # of thing. It will go out today that the Country party are not sincere on the question"" of economy, and that they want an opportunity to keep the Government in power. It has been said that the Government have been handfeeding them, but I believe there are men in the Country party who are above that sort of thing. I honestly believe that the true expression of opinion of this House is against the Government, and that it has lost confidence in the Government. .",28
111,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,Nothin g of the sort. The vote yesterday was not against the Government.,28
112,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"The honourable member ought to be keeping a lolly shop. I believe he is one of those who want to hold on to the Government, and keep them in office. *E want the Government to face the position and resign. There are surely enough capable men in the House to form another Ministry.",28
113,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"You do not want an election, do you ?",28
114,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I had a majority of 9,400, so that the prospect of an election does not affect me. The true duty of any self-respecting Government, when a of vote goes against them, is to advise the your Governor General to send for some other member of the House - to form a In this case, the Leader of the Opposition should' be firs't sent fer. of Look back to what the members of the Government said when the last referenmediately. dum on amendments of the Constitution was taken! They said they, would not hold office if the referendum was feated. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) was one of those who said that if the referendum was turned down he would not continue to govern the country for five minutes longer. But how did the Governmeut cringe and crawl and twist alpout in order to remain on the Treasury bench ? The fact is that, no matter the vote of the House may be, you canstanding not get this Government to relinquish serious reflection possible upon power. They have been too long there, honour of those gentlemen. and are too fond of the sweets of office. They are too full of intrigue to remove themselves fro m the Treasury bench. I is a disgrace to the country that we should have on the Treasury bench a Government who do not realise their responsibility as honourable men, and retire from office - when a vote is given against them.",28
115,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"Dalley) [12.8] -- I am rather astonished at two outstanding features of this matter. The first is the fact that the Government are still in office, and the second is that no explanation whatever is forthcoming from the Leader of the Corner party as to their action. It has been a well known practice of Parliament, ever since we have had responsible government, that the moment a vote is taken, which in any way takes the conduct of the business of the country out of the hands of the Government, the Government immediately resign. There is only one course dictated by honour, and that is the immediate resignation p f this Government; but what do we find? course, if members in the Corner^think so little of the honour of Parliament as to carry on loud conversations when a member is speaking, they should be told that before very long the people will wake up to the farce of the present parliamentary system, and give us some other system.",29
116,Mr WATT,Unknown,I am afraid I was responsible for that incident. I beg the honourable member's pardon.,29
117,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"The great outstanding fact, which must be recognised by all honourable men who form a Government, is that the moment the House takes the conduct of the business out of the hands of that Government, the only thing for Ministers to do is to resign i m The proper course for the Prime Minister to have taken yesterday was immediately to go to the GovernordeGeneral and tender his resignation, and not to indulge in intrigue, or endeavour by devious methods to hang on to office.. What does it matter to the country who is in office, as compared with the i m portance of the honour of our public life and the integrity of our public men? All the Prime Minister's talk today about what the members in the Corner not undertheir vote constitutes the most the I believe they did understand their vote. I give them credit for understanding it . I am t sure they knew sufficient of parliamentary procedure to know what the effect of their vote would be, and that they voted as they did yesterday, with their eyes open, to oust the present Government from the Treasury .bench.",29
118,Mr RTAIT,Unknown,Then why do they not speak for themselves?,29
119,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"I have commented on the remarkable silence of the members in the Corner. They sit there under the insults and taunts of the Prime Minister, and not a word of explanation comes from them. Will the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) now tell us if he meant his vote to be taken seriously or not? Did he know Avhat he was voting on? Did he know anything about the motion which he moved? I take his silence, and the silence of the Leader of his party, as indicating that the Corner party understood what they were doing Of perfectly well, and that they are prepared to accept the responsibilitiy for their action. Surely we are not going to insult their intelligence by imputing to them ignorance of their own business! I think they did know their own business, and that they realized that the continuance in office of the present occupants of the Treasury bench is against the best interests of the people of Australia generally, and especially against the interests of the country producer. I believe that is the motive that actuated the members of the Country party ih voting as they . did to oust the Government. If the Government had done the right thing they would be out of office now, and the Governor General would be asking the Leader of the Opposition to form an Administration. The proper procedure is for the Leader of the Opposition to be sent for and commissioned to form a Government. It would then be for the Leader of the Opposition to tender his advice to His Excellency as to what, in his opinion, should take place. If , as a result of that procedure, an appeal to the people is precipitated, then let us have an appeal to the people and let the people be given an opportunity of expressing their opinions upon the conduct of the present Government.",29
120,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"Hear , hear! You may get that quicker than you want.",30
121,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"I shall welcome an election far more than the honourable member for Illawarra does. There is no doubt about whether I shall come back. My majority is quite sufficient to insure that, but there is a big doubt whether the honourable member for Illawarra will come back. I can therefore quite understand his fear about a general election. I can imagine him holding up his hands in horror and saying to the Prime Minister, "" Eor God's sake, do not send us to the country, because if we go to the country Illawarra will be lost to our party and go back to the Australian Labour party."" There is no doubt that is the trouble, and undoubtedly there are a few other members behind the Prime Minister in a similar position. I wonder what the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs) feels like today. I wonder what he had to say yesterday to the Prime Minister in the party room. I will wager that he said something pretty straight and pretty appealing to the Prime Minister about the condition of affairs in Capricornia. I can imagine that he drew the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that the gentleman who is to be the next member for Capricornia was sitting in the public gallery yesterday. I refer to Mr Ford. I suppose that the honourable member for Capricornia said, "" Mr. Prime Minister, do any mortal thing you can, but for the Lord's sake do not send us to the country."" Such intrigues for the purpose of holding office are a disgrace to public life; and if the people were given an opportunity of expressing their opinion upon them they would show 'their resentment at such conduct. This Parliament should be above all such intrigues. I am prepared to allow any Government representing a majority of the people, and holding office in an honourable way, to continue without being hampered by anything of a paltry nature. But when we have a Government who throw honour overboard in order to hold on to office, the people should be given the earliest opportunity of displacing them. I ask honourable' members of the Corner party to stand as men to their own deliberate motion moved yesterday.",30
122,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,There is no necessity for the honourable member to ask us to be men.,30
123,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"Well , I am simply going upon the insinuations of the Prime Minister. He insinuated that he had been assured by the Leader of the Country party and many members of the party that they did not.know what they were doing, and, if given the opportunity, would reverse their action of yesterday. Honourable members must recollect that they are public men with great responsibilities. They are sent here by a number, of the people of Australia to stand firmly by the views to which they have givon expression. If honourable members of the Country party have any hope of making anything of their party, I warn them to consider the position they will occupy in relation to the great masses of the people if one day they vote in one direction and next day they vote in an opposite direction. If they go 'back on their vote of yesterday, and, as a result, they go to the country, I give them this word of warning, that they will be shattered as a party, because there is nothing the people resent more than they do inconsistency on the part of public men. Honourable members may laugh, but wo often laugh to stop ourselves from crying, and probably that is the position of the members of the Corner party. If they go back on their vote, they are doomed to failure in public life. The only means any party has of making itself successful lies in integrity of purpose; it must stand solidly by its platform and the principles it has. enunciated to the people. These are the only things which can make the Country party great. Hanging on to office or to a seat in Parliament"" by trickery will doom any party to failure in the end.",30
124,Mr CORSER,Unknown,I do not think that the honourable member wishes to see the Country party great ,31
125,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"I am merely, in all sincerity, giving them a word of warning and advice, which surely they will permit from one who has at heart the general welfare of the community. In any case, my remarks are offered in a better spirit than were those of the Prime Minister. If any honourable member insinuated concerning me one-half of what the Prime Minister insinuated concerning certain members of the Corner party, I would rise immediately to resent it, and strongly at that. If the Country party wish to have any standing in the community they must stand solidly to their principles and be consistent, and if they give a vote they must stand by it.",31
126,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,We will stand by it.,31
127,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"Presentl y the honourable member will be given an opportunity of standing by a vote, and I hope that he will do so. After yesterday's division it is regrettable that we have the spectacle of the Government still holding on to office, and the Prime Minister admitting that he is attempting to hang on by trickery and by intriguing with certain members of the Corner party, in an endeavour to get them to go back on their action. I hope that this will not be persisted in, and that we shall find that, any rate, the great bulk of the members of the Country party are above such intrigues, being honourable and straightforward men.",31
128,Mr RYAN,Unknown,West Sydney) [12.17] I am unable to apprehend the reason why the Prime Minister and his Government desire time to consider this situation. There was a very definite vote which took the business out of the hands of the Government yesterday afternoon by a majority of two. What need is there for consideration of the situation?,31
129,Mr CONSPDIITE,Unknown,"The Government ""want time for bridge-building.",31
130,Mr RYAN,Unknown,They want time to put the acid test on the Country party.,31
131,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,And they will stand the test.,31
132,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"I hope they do. But the main purpose for which I rise to speak is to say that it is due to honourable members generally that a responsible member of the Country party, after the statement made by the Prime Minister, and the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) should speak. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) laughs. I can quite understand his laugh. He is not laughing at me; he is laughing at our honourable friends in the Corner.",31
133,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,No .,31
134,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"Because now is the time and the only time for the Country party to make a statement to justify themselves in the eyes of the House and of the people. It will not do to come here on Wednesday next after there has been time for negotiations and then make a statement. The Prime Minister has said very definitely that the members of the Country party did not mean their action yesterday, and that there were several members of that party who did not know what they were voting on. He told us that the Leader of the party said that they did not mean it. I have a greatpersonal respect for the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), the leader of the party, and I put it to him nof as a warning or as advice, for it would be presumption on my part to offer either warning or advice to any honourable member, that' unless a statement is made from at the Country party today the people will form their own opinion upon the negotiations that may take place between today and when we meet on Wednesday 'next. The Country party eitlier meant their vote and the consequences of it or they did not.  from members of this party published todav.",31
135,Mr RYAN,Unknown,Where ? ,31
136,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"The place for parties to make statements to the country is in this House-in the place where they vote. And, after all, the statement which I read in the press today was to the effect that the Government were responsible for the situation yesterday, because they did not continue the debate. What does that mean? When we analyze the statement, it means that, because no member on the Government side rose in his place to talk the question out, members were* accidentally placid in the position of having to cast their vote in this House, This corroborates the statement made by the Prime Minister that they did not mean it. It is due to the dignity of Parliament, and due to 'the people of Australia, that we should know vhelhcr or not our friends in the corner meant the natural and probable consequences of their vote, and I trust-it is in their own interests that I am saying this-that they will make some statement one w a y or the other. If they did not mean anything by their. vote yesterday, we in this House, and the people outside, ought to know it. ' I have said time and again in this House, and on the public platform in the country, that our friends in the corner are nothing more nor less than , the tail of the Government party; that' it is' by reason of their support that the Government retain the reins of office. I have examined the division lists since this Parliament was constituted, and have found that in every crucial division the life of the Government has been saved by the votes of some of our honourable friends of the Country party. By aeoident, apparently, they voted yesterday afternoon against the Government. We have been told that they didnot know the gun was loaded, that it went off accidentally; and the - Prime Minister has now put them in a very humiliating position by saying that they had informed him they did not mean it.",31
137,Mr MOWILLIAMS,Unknown,Who said that ?,32
138,Mr EYAN,Unknown,The Prime Minister.,32
139,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"Well , if we do not become a great party, it will' not 'he for want of advice, at all events.",32
140,Mr EYAN,Unknown,"This is not advice. I am merely saying that the npuntry expects members of the Country party here and now to make a statement. If they fail to lake advantage of thiB opportunity, they must stand condemned and humiliated in the eyes of the .people; beaause in their own presence the Prime Minister said that their Leader had told him they did not mean to embarrass the Government, and also that some of them did not know what they were voting on. Do they now sit silent under the lash? If they remain silent, then all I can say is that they are not the men I take them for.",32
141,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,But some members of the Country party dissented from the Prime Minister's statement.,32
142,Mr KYAN,Unknown,"It is quite true, as the honourable member for Batman has interjected, that whilst the Prime Minister was speaking some members of the Country party interjected and individually denied his statement.",32
143,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,On e man only.,32
144,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"This matter is very serious. It is lamentable that this morning there should have been a suggestion that the members of an entire party in this House are sueh babes in the wood ' that they do not know what they are doing; that they are handling firearms, not knowing they are loaded, and have allowed them to .go off accidentally. I want now to. show the other side of the picture. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) undoubtedly gave this House to understand yesterday afternoon that if the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) did not call for a division on this motion the Government would.",32
145,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"That is quite inaccurate, as the records show.",32
146,Mr EYAN,Unknown,"Well , if the honourable member for Illawarra says that, I shall leave the issueto the judgment of any disinterested and impartial individual who cares to read the Hansard report. I am satisfied that he can come to no other conclusion than that the Treasurer clearly gave the House to understand that, in the event of the honourable member.for Grampiansnot calling for a division, he would.",32
147,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"But you know what a joker he - is always. . Mr EYAN - I am aware that the Treasurer has put the matter in that light, but is the business of this Parliament to be treated as a joke? It seems to me that when Ministers get into a difficulty their explanation'is that they were-joking and did. not mean it. And now we are told that the Countryparty did not know what they were doing. In order to be able further to humiliate the - Country party and to show them up in what he conceives to be their true light, the Prime Minister stresses the importance of his ""visit to the. Old Country as .the representative of. Australia .at the Imperial Conference. I do not want to trench at all upon : any ,subject that may be on the business paper.for"" thatConferencei all I want to say - is that, in my opinion, the majority of the'people of Australia would not be displeased' if the Prime Minister were not the representative of the Commonwealth at that important gathering, and the sooner the Prime Minister understands that the better. He is merely adopting a policy of gigantic bluff, and the way to meet him is to "" c all "" his bluff. I am sure you will find the people of Australia behind us in that attitude. When the - Prime Minister, with Sir Joseph Cook, represented this country at the Paris Con-. - ference we heard much about what he did for our White Australia policy, ""hut when we examine the situation we find that he really handed over control of this policy to the League of Nations, an assembly that is not'at all sympathetic with our ideals on that matter. . Mr HECTOR LAMOND - You are eonact, fusing what the Prime Minister did with what the Labour party wanted him",32
148,Mr RYAN,Unknown,Does the honourable member deny that the question of White Australia rests now with the League of ' Nations ?,33
149,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,Yes .,33
150,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"If the honourable member denies what I say,' then, it is useless to argue further with him. I declare, without fear of contradiction, that this portant question' has been handed over the. League of Nations. As proof of I point to the fact that one of the strongfor est objections by the United States America to joining the League of Nations ter's statement at all was that the question of immigrawould tion would be dealt with by the League. Therefore the United States of America representatives in ' Congress proposed to made' a reservation-and in this they are backed up . by. the people of the United States-in favour of immibe gration being regarded* as a domestic question. In the face of all - the evidence ns to what took place, and the made today. written documents of the Paris Conference, flip honourable member for Illawarra assurance. suggests that the question of a White Ausat all events,Such tralia has not been handed over to the tralia some clear League of Nations. I say it has; and I actual position is.conception repeat that the majority of' the people of Australia will not be disappointed if the Prime Minister is not our representative at the approaching Imperial Conference. I hope honourable members will not be influenced, in anything they may do at this juncture, by the fear of an election. They, perhaps, fear that they will be charged with sacrificing the interests of the Empire if they do not make it possible for the Prime Minister to go to London to represent us at the Imperial Conference.",33
151,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Has ' the honourable member any justification for the statements he has made as to what our party is going to do!,33
152,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"I have said nothing as to what the Country party are going to do. I have been pointing out that the Prime Minister is asking for the adjournment of the House, in order that the Governmentmay consider the situation. There is no need for an adjournment. The Prime Minister should be able at once to but in the course of his speech he has declared that the Country party did to do. not mean to do what they did.",33
153,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,That is not true.,33
154,Mr RYAN,Unknown,He has pointed out that they did not appreciate what would be the natural consequence of the vote they cast. He hae said that.,33
155,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,That is incorrect.,33
156,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has im-. made that statement, and' our honourable to friends of the Country party have rethis, mained silent. The honourable member Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) has, by of interjection, said that the Prime Minisis ' not true; but it not be much, more satisfactory to have a statement from the Leader of the party?

160,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"Barrier) [12.33] If yesterday's incident, which we are now discussing, has not contributed to the progress of the country, it has at least added to the gaiety of the population. Having heard the Prime Minister. (Mr Hughes) in the course of his explanation, smoothing the, Toad for the Country party",34
161,Mr STEWART,Unknown,So we are to get some more advice.,34
162,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"No ; not advice, but caustic comment. After noting the way in which the Prim© Minister has carefully smoothed the path for the Country party to gracefully slide down, while at the same time paying them the doubtful compliment that they, .like the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler), were absent in mind, but present in body, and did not know what was likely to be the consequences of their vote, I am anxiously waiting to hear the reply of that party: The Prime Min-. ister says that some of its members did not know for what they were voting. He makes that statement despite the fact that the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), who submitted the motion whichresulted in such disastrous consequences to the Government, was until recently the Deputy Leader of that party. The honourable member presumably was elected to that position because he was considered competent to judge what his party desired. We may, therefore, reasonably assume that he ond those associated with him knew perfectly well what they Were doing. I do not believe that they did not know. I think they knew what they were doing.",34
163,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"They knew very well on Mr Considine - And I think the Country party know what they intend to do. I am waiting to hear honourable members of that party make the announcement that as the result of - a decision arrived"" at by them, the position created by yesterday's vote will be maintained today In reviewing the circumstances associated with the incident ono is struck by the number of coincidences. One cannot help remarking, for instance, the phenomenal inactivity of the Governmout Whips, and also the phenomenal inactivity of the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Oook) who was leading the House at the time, and who is always soalert and anxious to see that adequate precautions are taken to properly safeguard the position of the Government. These facts almost lead one to helieve that the Government were not averse to the creation of the situation which actually arose. The statement made by the Prime Minister does not lead to any conclusion that would destroy the hypothesis that the Government welcomed the opportunity to place the Country party in a position in which they would have to give the Ministry an assurance of continued support. The Ministerial party we know full well have been decidedly restive in view of the fact that if they are not to be supported by the Country party their majority has Toached the vanishing stage. We are - therefore driven to one of two conclusions-eithe r that the Government were not unwilling that this - situation should be created in _ order that they might profit thereby or x that some of the'se who sit behind the Government, and who would not he averse to accepting a portfolio in a reconstructed Government in preference to going before their constituencies, had something to do with the little crisis. I do not know which of these assumptions is correct, but if we give the Country party credit, as I do, for being perfectly well aware of what they were doing, then that party must adhere to the position which they took up yesterday. If they do-if the whole of the Country party, and not merelythe members of it who are now present;-giv e a vote in-harmony with fhatgiveni by tbem yesterday, then the Government must be defeated. If , however/: as OTir former oceasions, some bers of the Country party are absent and umpairedf when the division is token, then the .Government will retain its majority, and the Country party will have saved its face. I have been in the ILouse. on previous, occasions when a similar situation has' arisen. ""We have heard of an honourable member of the Country party who when the bolls were ringing for an important division wag is coufereuce with Mr Speaker in an ante-room, and did not hoar them. We have heard of other honourable members of that party who were absent and unpaired when a division came along. The intriguing that has taken place on the opposite side of the House goes to show-and the honourable member for Perth is witness to the fact --that there is a disgruntled section in the Nationalist party who are not averse to the displacement of the Ministry, so long as the Nationalist party is not injured thereby. We know what happened in connection with the motion given notice of by the honourable member for  a premature death. It was aimed at the displacementof the Government, but unfortunately it was not proceeded with.",34

166,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for confirming my suspicious that there are honourable members on the other side willing to proceed in subtle ways to displace Ministers whom they are supposed to be supporting. According to reported 'utterances of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart), there are at least five members of the Nationalist party who are prepared to accept portfolios, and foineattempt made to put through a deal whereby five members of the Nationalist party and seven members of the Country party would divide the spoils of oface. When I consider these things I am led to the .conclusion that the.event of yesterday was not an unhappy accident, as some think, but was premeditated, of malice upon. aforethought. I believe that the continuous session yesterday evening of members mem- of the Country party and members of the Nationalist party was not without a purpose. Whatever may have taken plaoe at that meeting, I do not think that a diacHitiou of Parliament will result. That is about the only thin? upon which honourable muanbers are likely to be unanimous. Mr MAHONx - How is the honorabh member's party on that question 1",35
167,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"My party is soli! to put the Government out at the first available opportunity, and if the members of ths party to which the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) belongs are as solid on that, point, and as closely, devoted to duty, the Government may te removed from office. I know nothing of constitutional practice, but honourable members who possess knowledge on the subject have given us some crumbs -. - f coinfcrt by intimating that in the event oE the adverse voto against the Government being maintained the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) must be sent for and given an opportunity to carry on the business of the country.'",35

But when the oountry did turn down - their measures, although they resigned, they walked out tlirough one door and eam= back immediately through another. On this historic occasion the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) may be sent for. but should he not be sent for, and should the honourable member for was Yarra (Mc Tudor) be unable to' secure support for « Government, it is possible that the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) may be called into prescribe.",35

I paid a visit to His Excellency, and, while I am not anticipating an early Invitation, I can assure honourable members opposite that if they will consent to give me their support, I shall be prepared to give them eleven out of the twelve portfolios. The present situation, if not edifying, should be highly amusing to the country. The workers of Australia will take note of the intrigues that are resorted to by so-called statesmen in the effort to hang on. to office and to avoid, as on one occasion the late Mr. Alfred Deakin described it , ""being dragged screaming from the tart shop."" It appears to me that when the nossibilities of the situation have been exhausted we shall find ourselves in much the same position as before, with the possible exception that we may have a new Leader of the Nationalist party in the place of the present occupant of that position. There is a powerful section, the members of which wish to displace the present Prime Minister. Quarrels occur in the best regulated families, and we have had evidence from the honourable member for Perth that honourable members opposite are not a united, family.",36
172,Mr STEWART,Unknown,The honourable member would not call the Nationalist party a well regulated family.,36
173,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"No more thaii I would so describe the party to which the honourable member 'belongs. We have evidence that certain interests desire to displace the present Prime Minister in his leadership cf the Nationalist party. It may be that some dark horse is in the background, . and that we shall have a new Prime Minister as a result of this intriguing and political manoeuvring, but in. the meantime the country is treated to the very unedifying spectacle of intriguing, counter intriguing, and pit digging by honourable members opposite in order that the Government may still cling to office, and that a pretence to unity may be put up in order that the people may beguiled, and last, but not least,* that the exploiters may be represented at the Imperial Conference. The working classes in the present order of things will not be represented, no matter who goes. My vote will be given against the Government, and against, any who may succeed the present Ministers, if they follow the same lines of policy and voice the same interests. If the Country party listens to the blandishments of the Prime Minister, and allows w itself to be tricked",36
174,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,What about the blandishments of the Opposition?,36
175,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"I am not concerned with that. 1I have no desire and no reason to exercise any blandishments, and am rather amused at the spectacle with which we are now confronted. The Country party, like other parties, is trying to impress the electors that it is their members who are most concerned, first, with the interests of the primary producers, and, next, with those of. the great mass of the people.",36

179,Mr RTAST,Unknown,He handed the White Australia policy over to the League of Nations.,36
180,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"I have more than once had occasion to comment cn the failure of the party with which the honourable and learned member is associated to appreciate the importance of Australian representation at the Conference oj 1917. It was due to that party's action that the Prime Minister was prevented from presenting the White Australia policy to an ""Imperial Conference before the holding of the Peace Conference, and many of his subsequent difficulties were caused thereby. It was for purely personal reasons that he was prevented from attending the 1917 Conference.",36
181,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,We object to him attending any Conference as our .representative.,37
182,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"Persona l spite rather than political reasons kept him from attending the 191.7 Conference: but, notwithstanding the difficulties in the way of a full and effective presentation of the White Australia policy at the Peace Conference, due to the Labour party's want of recognition of the im portance of having Australia represented at the Imperial Conference in 1917, the Prime Minister, against odds that would have deterred a man of lesser calibre, wrested victory from those who were determined that he should not succeed, and from a majority who would have nothing to do with the White Australia policy. Whatever may be the verdict of posterity on his work at the great Peace Conference, those who consider that the White Australia policy is essential to the maintenance of the Commonwealth as a white man's country must acknowledge that he succeeded there, even beyond the expectation of his most ardent friends.",37
183,Mr RYAN,Unknown,He succeeded in handing the White Australia policy over to the League of Nations.,37
184,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"That statement is a singularly inaccurate one for a member of the legal profession to make. The mandate which the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D . Millen) was able, as the Australian representative, to bring back from the Geneva Conference, in spite of the assistance given to Japan by some of the members of this House, ancl the almost insuperable difficulties of his position there, permits this Parliament to apply to the new territories of the Pacific which we now control the same legislation as we have enacted,for the government of our own country. It is not necessary, as the honourable mem suggested, that we should pretend to a knowledge of what has taken placespn the secret conclaves of the Labour party, to know its attitude on this question. That party published officially throughout the Commonwealth the direction to those who heeded it on the other side of the world, that its policy regarding the Pacific possessions was that Australia should have no more voice in regard to them than belonged to any one of the representatives"" of the nations. To-day, the party wishes Australia to forget this official notification of policy. It cafi be easily understood that its members should wish the electors to forget their treachery to the White Australia principle at the time when that principle most needed the help of those who now profess to be its chief champions. For a member of a party, tainted as it is with treachery to the White Australia principle, to upbraid the Prime Minister for failure to defend that principle at the Peace Conference, is for him to make too great a demand on the intelligence of the Australian Democracy. Instead of the honourable member for West Sydney seeking to take from the Prime Minister the laurels that he won at the Peace Conference, in his fight for a White Australia policy, the honourable and learned member would have better served the interests of those who sent him here had he given the right honourable gentleman the fullest support, so that the victory already secured might not be jeopardized by the want of similar representation at the forthcoming Imperial Conference. It is humiliating that, at a time when the future of this Country is in the balance, and it is essential that Australia should present a united fron t in defence of her ideals, the selfish interests of political parties should be permitted to override the interests of the Commonwealth. I deplore the position brought about by yesterday's vote. It must, however, be viewed from the constitutional stand-point. My object in rising was fo denounce attacks on the Prime Minister based on the assertion that, at the Peace Conference, he failed in his duty to Australia in his attitude towards the White Australia policy. We did not secure all that we wanted, but we should have secured perhaps more than we did. had' the right honourable gentleman had behind him the national support that was given to the delegates of every other country. It is to be admitted with shame that, in this country alone, there was a section which reviled its representatives at the Peace Conference, and took every opportunity to weaken their influence with-those with whom they were dealing.

But, as we have said, we will not take any undue advantage of the absence cf the Prime Minister. We cannot be expected, however, to do the Prime Minister's whipping for him , and everything else in connection with the running of this House. We think, and have expressed the view, that Australia should be represented at the Imperial Conference. I have spoken in no uncertain terms regarding that; and the ideas of the Prime Minister, as he has expounded them here, have received the almost unanimous support of all parties in this Chamber. If the Government are not prepared to take the full responsibility of being represented at the Conference, it is time that a Government same into existence which would be prepared to accept complete responsibility, and would represent Australia there. The Prime Minister has quoted my views with respect to patching up party quarrels; but what is the right honourable gentleman now doing? He is flogging his Imperial mission for purely party advantage. The Prime Minister has taken the proper course today in asking for time in which to reconsider his position. He has been given a definite statement concerning our views, and I will vote for the adjournment for which the Prime Minister has asked, in order to enable him to give the required consideration to his position.",38
191,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Darling) [2.24] It is extremely interesting, in view of what the Leader of ' the Country - party say was (Dr Earle Page), has just said, to examine the position in which the Government now 'find themselves. They haves been defeated*; but, notwithstanding that, and the fact that we have had from the Leader of the Country party an assurance that every member of his party understood the significance ofayesterday's vote, and knew the seriousness of their step, and exactly what they were doing, we still see the Government clinging, limpet-like, to the Treasury bench. It should not take them twenty-four hours, or twenty-four minutes, to decide what course they should adopt. Personally, I think that the only honourable procedure is for the Government to immediately hand their resignations to the Governor General, and so let His ^Excellency send for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor), who would form a M nistry, and : endeavour to carry on. In ordinary circumstances, with ordinary people, such a course, no doubt, would have been pursued last night. But this is no ordinary Government. It is an extraordinary Government, consisting of a remarkable set of individuals, who, no matter what may be brought against them, no matter the position in which they may find themselves, still hold on. The question has been asked whether, if the were defeated by ten on a want of confidence vote, they even then hand in their We have had the spectacle of the Government going to the country and promising the people that if they did not receive a mandate they would refuse to carry on.

Almost every week a crisis occurs, in which the are threatened, but immediately whips are cracked intriguing underground engineering commence. This House has been one mass of not only in this, but in the last Parliament, to enable the Government to retain their seats, but not their honour, as that . has gone long ago. Of course, I am not speaking of the members of the Government individually, but of the ment as a Government. Last night the vote was on a clear-ciit issue, and the Government could not maintain their position and control the House. control of the business which it was their duty to perform, as a majority of this Chamber, in no mistakable language said, ""We are taking control."" circumstances, a Government without any intrigue or the sending of messengers hither and thither, have immediately sent in their resignations to the Governor General.

I am not willing to upon a campaign of slaughter; but prepared to do my duty even if it volves the necessity of an election. situation which has arisen in this ber illustrates the absurdity of party vernment. Here is government of people by the people and for the people. In theory a majority of the representanot tives of the people have dominated situation, and dictated a policy; but actual practice the people are controlled by a comparatively few men who hapNot pen to be members of the Cabinet. There is no freedom for those who happen to.'be in opposition, or those who behind the Government, who are tossed like corks in the stream of public life, are following the dictates of a man is a member of the Cabinet, and the grace of God, happens to be the Prime Minister at this moment.

He wishes, however, to be on the right side, and so he goes to the the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and says, be- "" Old man, do not worry; I do not mean to hurt you, but, by Christ! I must keep myself on top."" And so he submits his motion, deliberately compromising himin every way in regard to principles and conscience; he hypocritically moves a motion in which he does not believe; and, in order to keep himself in the public eye and establish himself in his own constiam tuency, he whispers to the Prime Minister, "" I want to occupy the time of the country for two hours;.but do not worry, I do not mean anything."" Honourable the members see the situation which arises. enter Those men in the Corner do not mean I am anything, and they wish to ignore any inresponsibility in regard to the Govern The ment. Every man who. honestly sits beChamhind the Government takes his fortunes goin his hand; for good or evil, he takes the the risk of the battle. He is on one side or the other; and, even if he canbelieve he is right, at least he the stands by the Government and shares in in its responsibility. But where do the members of the Country party stand? here, not there, not anywhere. What are they in public life? What do they stand for? Where is their manhood and sit sense of decency? The Prime Minister can come here ancl say to the honand orable member for Cowper (Dr Earle who Page), "" Y o u say that you and your who, by party do not mean anything; what in the name of God are you .here for ?"" What, I ask again, do the members of that party stand for? For the Government? No. Against the Government? For the Labour party? No. Against it? No. They stand for nothe thing-onl y for themselves. The Prime Minister can stand here and talk in the way he has to the representative of God what sort of party. They are a party without principles, without policy, without ideas, prepared to stand for nothing, and to desert everything; to support one thing one day and oppose it the next; to stand up or sit down as the exigencies of the moment demand. The Leader of this party can afford to be insulting to the Prime Minister of this country. What does the Prime Minister do? The Prime Minister says to this Leader, "" You deny responsibility, and say that you did not mean anything."" Does the Leader of the Country party stand up to reply? Does he answer the accusations of the Prime Minister? Not. at all; he accepts the imputation that he did not mean anything; he accepts this slander on his character, and, like a poor helpless creature, does not attempt any answer. All he does is to say, ""As we are the Country party, if a motion for the adjournment of the House is moved by one of us, I will support it."" The party reserve the right to turn round and vote against or for the Government as they please. What has the Prime Minister said, about other members of the party? The right honourable gentleman says to them, "" You come to me privately, and whisper to me that you did not know what you were voting for."" However, there is nothing in that. They are not the only men who vote and do not know what they are voting for. In the history of this Chamber members have walked in and voted for something-the y knew not what. I honestly admit, without mentioning names,, that there was, at least, one member, apart from the Country party, who did the same thing.",40

The Prime Minister seeks to score on that point, and says of those men in the Corner that some of them whispered to him that they did not know what they were voting for-that they never meant any harm, but that, of course, they wanted to appear well before the public and their constituents. The last thing they wished to do was to embarrass the Government or themselves. One would, at least, think that private conversations should be sacred.",41

No; they are deadly silent, and dare not answer. What sort t of animals are they who dare not resent an imputation of the kind? Why do they not stand up one by one and answer the Prime Minister? It is neither the Government nor the Opposition that is on its trial in the Government's estimation; it is that section in the Corner which claims to be free from the responsibilities of the Government, and also free from the extremism of the Opposition. What does the Government, do? I do not object to the attitude of the Prime Minister, inconvenient as it may be to myself and others. It is the ortly attitude that the right honourable gentleman could adopt towards a faction like this. It would be better for the future of the country if the Country party were to link up witli either one side or the other rather than maintain a position where nobody can trust them. Why, they cannot even trust each other! What honour is there in being the leader of such a party or faction?

208,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I knew it . As a result, the Country party unnecessarily occupied the time which was spent in discussing the motion for adjournment brought forward yesterday. Honourable members on this side of the Chamber were not the wasters of public time. It was the members of the Country party who occupied the time of Parliament in ' debating a motion which meant nothing, and in respect of which they have harmed themselves considerably in the eyes of the electors. Even if we had been as hypocritical as they themselves, the members of the Labour party were bound to vote against the Government. We had to do so, or to disappear from public l if e as its supporters. But gentlemen who occupy the position that is occupied by members of the Country party have neither the respect of any Government supporter nor of any member of the Opposition, nor of the daily press of this country, whether it be Labour or Liberal. They cannot command the respect of any large body of citizens, who hold definite opinions, either one way or the other. If they have a clear-cut policy which is for the good of the Commonwealth, they have a duty to the country and to themselves. duty is to seize the opportunities which come to them from the struggles of the two main factions, and to put their political fortunes to the test, believing that, if their policy is the best one, the country will support them. As a party, they can never have a political future if they continue to remain as indefinite in their attitude as they have been since rheir advent in this Chamber. Coming to the threat of a dissolution, I have always endeavoured to postpone, as far as possible, a general election. I would postpone it for all eternity. But, apart from personal inconvenience, it stands to reason that we, as a party, are hostile to this Governmeut; that we are hostile to its Prime Minister, and that we are naturally hostile to his going to EneJand, upon the ground that the policy which he has enunciated upon the floor of this Chamber is inimical to the best interests of Australia. The inference founded upon the - arguments of' the Treasurer himself (Sir Joseph Cook) is' that this country cannot bear a heavy burden in respect of naval expenditure. If the Old Country is loaded up with an enormous debt, if she is torn by internal dissension, and by international dissatisfaction with her previous allies; if it is in evitable that the revenues of this country must decline enormously within the next twelve months whilst our interest burden must increase, it is not the willingness either o t the Prime Minister ov the Treasurer which will dictate the future policy of this country in regard to our navai defence. What will dictate it is the state of its finances and the ability of the Commonwealth to bear the expenditure. The Prime Minister has asked why the Old Country should defend Australia.",42

216,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"I desire to say a few words, not merely in reply to the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey), but in reply to other honourable members upon the same side of the chamber. I in wish to thank them for the advice which of Australia. they have been giving us all the morning. They have been so busy in that direction that the members of the party with I am 'associated have not had an opportunity of even getting a word in. Now that we have a chance to do so, I thank them for the advice which they have given us. Frequently, when issues have arisen here, they have filled pages sard with statements to the effect that majority of members of the Country party have invariably saved the Government. We have had speeches from them in parties which my own party has Been sternly nounced in this connection. But yesterday a vote was taken upon a formal motion for adjournment, and the Government were defeated. Tet we still have speeches confor demnatory of the Country party by honora able members opposite! What did the honourable member for Bourke say? He said that the political policy of his party was to be "" agin the Government."" I r respective of whether the Government are right or wrong, its. policy is to pose them. That is the political creed honourable members opposite. They are against any motion which may emanate ing from the Ministerial side of the House, whether it be right or wrong. porters of the Government hold a somewhat similar political creed in respect the Opposition. They are opposed to any Australia ? motion which may come from that quarknown as ter, be it right or wrong. ° Mr RICHARD FOSTER - That is not true.",43
217,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"When pairs have been required what has been the experience of the. party in this corner of the memHouse? Frequently we have experienced difficulty in getting them. But there has been no such difficulty experienced either Labour members or Ministerial supporters. And it is not difficult for an individual member of this party to get a perpair. Why ? Because when an honourable member desires to go away, he says to the Whip, "" Get me a pair against the Labour party."" No matter what the memissue before the House may be, he desires to be paired agaiust the Opposition.",43

223,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"I do not know by whom. What is the reason for the presence of the Country party in this House ? of HanWe are regarded as intruders. Why? a Because we have spoilt the little twoparty game that has been played in this country for so long. Neither of the old likes a third eleven in the field. deWe are about as welcome to honourable members on this side of the House as we are to those on the Opposition side. It is quite true, as the honourable member Bourke (Mr Anstey) said, that it is case of "" the survival of the fittest""; we shall have to fight, and I am prepared to fight and stand to> my guns for the ideals of the people who sent me here- the organized farmers of Australia. The people of the out-back, the men and opwomen who are making the country what of it is, haye had experience of the rule of the Labour party, and, particularly durthe last few years, of rule by the party at present in power. And what was the The supresult of the last election?  of orable member mean the election in South",43
224,Mr STEWART,Unknown,The Country party in South Australia succeeded about as well as did the Labour party.,44
225,Mr TODOK,Unknown,"No ; we won sixteen seats, the Country party none.",44
226,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"That is soj but I am not referring now to State politics; I am dealing with the Federal Parliament, and I say that, in spite of experience of government by the Labour party and by that party which today calls itself National, which previously called itself Liberal, and which in the next few years will call itself God knows what, the people returned the Country party to this House. We are here, and, take it from me, we shall stay. With reference to the crisis that has arisen, the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) stated that certain members of the Country party went to him and said that they did not mean to vote as they did, or that they did not mean that vote to be interpreted as it has been. I do not know what they said, but I , at any rate, did not go to him. Furthermore, if I were Prime Minister, and any honourable members told me what members of our party aTe alleged to have said to the Leader of the Government, I would not have come here and'disclosed their statement on the floor of the House. I would not have put in a false position somebody who was probably sympathetically inclined towards me. If I spoke privately to the Leader of the Opposition or to almost any other member in the House, I would feel quite certain that my statement would not be repeated here, as the Prime Minister repeated statements made to him, not only to members of this House, but to the press and people. The action of the Prime Minister was deliberately unfair to the very people who, he claims, are sympathetic towards the Government.",44
227,Mr CHAHLTON,Unknown,"The honourable member does not know what the other honourable members said to him, or what use they told him to make of their statements.",44
228,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"They may haye said a great deal more or a great deal less; I do not know what they said. I have 0 only to say, speaking, not so much for the Country party, but rather for the neople who sent us here, particularly the organized farmers of Victoria, that the reason why we were returned to Parliament was the failure of both existing parties. And I make bold to say that for that same reason we shall stay here. We were returned upon a definite platform, which is stated in black and white. Candidates from both the old parties were pitted against us on the hustings, and the only results were a diminution of the numbers of both of them and an increase in the strength of the Country party. Yet honourable members have the .effrontery to sneer at a party which has won its position in this House in spite of the efforts of both of the other parties. I repeat that we are here to stay.",44
229,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Werriwa) [3.2] It seems to me that we are going through a stage when responsible government and parliamentary institutions are being placed on trial. We hear a lot from our opponents about honourable members on this side of the House desiring to destroy parliamentary government. If there is anything calculated to destroy parliamentary'institutions it is disgraceful procedure such as we witnessed yesterday and today. Nothing could tend more to bring parliamentary institutions and constitutional government into contempt with, the people than the-action of the Government in hanging on to office after this House has clearly told - them that it has lost confidence in them and their administration. I shall not say much in regard to the controversy or trial of wits between the Prime Minister and the Country party, or the insults and innuendoes that he has directed at them. If the honour of the Country party is concerned, that is their look out; the affairs of my own party are sufficient concern for me. I shall not worry whether the Country party loses or gains, or whether they support or oppose the Government. Whatever action they take must be their own responsibility, to which they, and not we, will have to stand up. I desire to refer briefly to the laboured reason which the Prime Minister gave for the undignified attitude of his Government in hanging on to office. ' He said that it was essential that Australia should be represented at the Imperial Conference'inferentially, by him. Australia could still be represented at that Conference even if the Government were to resign today, but not by the present Prime Minister. Apparently, he is of opinion that Australia cannot be adequately represented except by himself. The opinion of m}'self and the other members of the Labour party is that anybody could represent Australia at the Imperial Conference better than the Prime Minister. I believe that if the people outside could press their opinion they would support that view. The country is not looking with any great amount of anxiety to its representation by the Prime Minister at the Imperial Conference. I believe a great deal was said here today about his representation of Australia at other Conferences. The statement that he consented at a previous gathering to the White Austi'alia policy being handed over to the League of JTations has been contested, but I think that it is clear and beyond dispute that he did do so. If such a policy as that, a policy so vital to the interests of Australia, could be handed over by him to the League of Nations, we have no guarantee whatever, irrespective of the statements that the Prime Minister has made to the House, that other interests as vital, or nearly as vital to Australia, will be conserved by him.",44
230,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"- I ask the honourable member not to discuss that matter, which is involved in the Ministerial statement. Mr LAZZARJ.NI.-I merely alluded to it in connection with the Prime Minister's statement this morning that it was necessary for the Government to remain in office in order that he might go to Loudon to represent Australia at the Imperial Conference. The members of the Labour party, and our supporters outside, and I believe the majority of the people of Australia, would rather that Australia were represented in London by ahnost anybody else than by the Prime Minister.",45
231,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [3.8] The honourable meiuber for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), who said that the members of the Country party were refused pairs by members sitting on this side of the chamber, must realise, as an old. politician, how difficult it is to pair with a party when you do not know, from day to day, what attitude that party are going to take up on any question that is before the Chamber. No one knows which way the Country party are going to cast a vote. We do not know whether they will be for or against the Government, and consequently it is impossible for us to pair with them, even if we so desire. The honourable member stated clearly and candidly that he was against exthe Government carrying on the business of the country. If lie said anything at all, he said that the Government do not command his confidence. What I want 1 particularly to bring under the notice of the House is the statement of the honourable member's leader (Dr Earle Page). I was waiting this morning for the Leader of the Country party to rise in his place, and make some statement regarding the transactions of yesterday. In view of the lecture delivered to him by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) this morning, I think it was the honourable member's place to rise immediately, even .before the Leader of our party, with a view to clearing his party from the aspersions cast on them. Now that he has made a statement, I , for one, welcome it, because, if he has told the Prime Minister anything today, he has told him that, so far as the Countryparty are concerned, he will have no immunity from attack during his absence if he should go abroad. The Prime Minister made it clear here, on Friday, that he would not be justified in going abroad to the Imperial Conference unless he had some guarantee that, in his absence, the Government would be protected. The honourable member who leads the Country party said that he resented the statements bhat had been made concerning them hy the Prime Minister, bufc that they were not going to wet nurse the Government; that the Government had their own Whips, and their own. methods of conducting their business, and that his party were not going to be dragged behind the heels of the Government.",45
232,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"When you have gone that far, why not give all that tour Leader said?",45
233,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,What more would the honourable member like me to give?,45
234,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,That he would repeat the .promise he made the other day.,45
235,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Yes ; he said he ° would repeat the promise he made the other night, that, so far as he reasonably could, he would support the Government. The Prime Ministei*, however, says that unless he gets a definite promise from the House that nothing untoward will befall the Government during his absence, he does not think he should undertake the journey abroad. The Leader of the Country party said very clearly, and the House must not lose sight of the fact, that he was supporting the motion HOAV before the House because it was a motion for the adjournment of the House for the purpose of permitting the Government to further consider the position in * which they are placed. He did not say he was supporting the motion on the ground that, its object was to vindicate the Government. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), who is the Deputy Leader of the Country party, knows that that statement emanated from his Leader. The result is that the Government standv today where they stood last night when the motion for the adjournment of the House was carried-, irrespective of what may be the fate of the motion for ad journment which is now before the House. Even if this motion is carried, that will not clear the Government, in view of the statement deliberately made by the Leader cf the Country party.",45
236,Mr GKEGOET,Unknown,Nobod y suggested that it would.,46
237,Mr CHAELTON,Unknown,Evidently the honourable member wishes that it would.,46
238,Mr GHEGOKY,Unknown,"Oh , no.",46
239,Mr CHAELTON,Unknown,"All it means is' that the Government have to consider their position, and the Prime Minister has already made it clear to the House that he will not go abroad unless he has a definite understanding that his Government will be immune from defeat while he is away. In words which cannot in any way be misunderstood, the Leader of - the Country party now says, "" I am not going to give immunity to any Government."" In fact, he went so far as to say that he would not be in a position to do so. I take it that the Country party have their owu platform, and are tied down by certain rules and decisions of their own conference, and therefore their Leader cannot promise the Government immunity. If that is so, it brings us to a position which the House has to face. It is said that it is absolutely necessary for the Prime Minister to go abroad so that Australia may be represented at the Imperial Conference, and not remain unrepresented, as happened in 1917. The Prime Minister says that he cannot go unless he is assured of the stability of his Government in his absence. When the Leader of the Country party says he cannot give the Prime Minister the guarantee ithat he asks for, it puts the Prime Minister in this position: If he goes now, in face of that statement, without having an absolute majority on the floor of the House to carry on the affairs of the country, he is responsible for whatever happens in his absence. If he has not an absolute majority on the floor of the House, then he has not an absolute majority of the people of Australia behind him. The Leader of the Country party also pointed out very clearly to the Prime .Minister- I am trying to follow his statement, and he will correct me if : J am wrong-that , if the Prime Minister was not satisfied with his position, it did not follow that there should be' a dissolution and an appeal to the people, because, he said, the possibilities of the House were not exhausted. He added that there was nothing to prevent a Government being formed in this House that would carry on the affairs of the country. If that is the position at which we have arrived, - then the Government should act, and act promptly. They are in no better position than they were in last night. If they have not a majority, and if we want to be represented at the Imperial Conference, and the time is so shorr, the Government must allow the Governor General to exhaust the possibilities of the House for the formation of a Ministry to carry on the affairs of Australia. If a change of Government takes place, what is to prevent the incoming Government, if it is sufficiently strong, from appointing a man to go abroad to represent Australia at the Imperial Conference? There is the position as I see it, and we cannot escape it. According to the statement made by the Leader of the Country party, if the Government, on reconsidering their position, decide to continue in office, and if anything happens in the future, such as happened yesterday-whic h is quite likely, because, where parties are evenly divided, it is only necessary for one man to be away for the fate of the Government be settled-'the n they must take the retheir hands. sponsibility. -- While the position remains' as it is, in view of the statement of the Prime Minister last Friday, the Government have only one course open to them, if they have the interests of the people Australia at heart, and if they' wish have this country represented at the Im perial Conference. That course resign, and allow the possibilities of House to be exhausted. If my leader, the honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Tudor), cannot form a Government, or if his Government when formed are feated, the Governor General can still fall back on other resources. He can call upon the Leader of the Country party form a Ministry. No one can say that any honourable member chosen hy the Governor General cannot get a sufficient majority behind him. It is quite posit sible that a member may be found to who will . get a working majority which will enable him to carry on the business of the country while pertralia, mitting some one to adequately represent Australia at the Imperial But if anything is to be done, it must be done at once if whoever is to represent us in London is to leave in sufficient time to do so. If we dilly-dally for a week or two, probably until just before the Prime Minister leaves, we may have recurrence of what happened yesterday, and may find that the business of the House is taken out of the hands of the Government. In such circumstances, the' Government would be compelled to resign, and there would be no hope of Australia being represented at a Conference which means so much to its future interests. This motion has a definite purpose: give the Government time to reconsider their position, and nothing that may happen today can justify them in saying that they will go on next week.",46
240,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"The Governagainst ment did not adjourn the House yesterfor day, but they propose to do so today. - Mr Charlton - They did not Wimmera (Mr Stewart). adjourn the House yesterday, but they made it a crisis by declaring that the carrying of the motion had to taken the business of the House out of Thereupon,, they called a meeting to consider the situation, and as a result they come today to ask for a and vote to test their position. My friends in the corner say that they will vote for the motion in order to give the Government further time to consider their posiof tion; but they do not say that they are to in favour of the Government carrying - on, and they will not give the guarantee is to for which - the Prime Minister asks, the namely, immunity for the Ministry during his absence. The Prime Minister said, very definitely, that unless he got that guarantee of immunity he would denot think of going abroad to represent Australia at the Imperial Conference. If in this House the parties are equal into numbers, and if no party represents a majority of electors, the only thing to do is to exhaust the possibilities of the House. Then if we cannot find within a Government with a backing sufficient transact the business of the country, and also send a representative to the Im perial Conference to do justice to Auswe should go' to our masters at once and allow them to say who is to Conference. govern this country.  [3.19] - The deduction to he drawn from this debate is that every one outside the ranks of the Government is unanimous that the only decent thing the Governa ment can do is to resign. The Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) said it , and every honourable member of the Labour party who has spoken has said it. But I cannot see the consistency of the attitude adopted by the Leader of the Country party when he says that he and his party are prepared to vote for the motion which the Government have subto mitted today. To be consistent with the vote he and his party gave yesterday, when they voted with the Labour party, they ought to vote against the Government's motion today. Otherwise, they stand convicted of the charges levelled them by the honourable member Bourke (Mr Anstey), which so greatly perturbed the honourable member for The honourable member for Wimmera always becomes perturbed when an honourable member from this side reminds the Country party of the votes they have cast within the last eighteen months in this Parliament. The honourable member and others who vote with him may say what they like, hut the division lists as recorded in Hansard will show exactly where the Corner party have stood during the last eighteen months. Nine times out of tenin fact, every time the fate of the Government was at stake-som e number, great or small, of the Corner party was to be found coming to the rescue of Ministers; and no matter whether the honourable member for Wimmera speaks from now until this time, next year, he cannot wipe out the past record of his . party. says that the people of the country have become distrustful of the Labour party and of the 'National party, and have sent representatives of the Country party into Parliament., maintained them there, and even show a disposition to increase their ranks; but although it may be unpleasant the honourable member, I would draw his attention to the fact that the latest appeal to the country has had quite a contrary result. In the South Australian elections last week, the Country party was practically wiped out; and I venture to Bay that the reason for its obliteration was'the record in this House of the party that stands under the same banner. The honourable member claims that that, is a State,, and not a Federal concern; but, as a matter of.fact, on the last occasion on which there was an appeal in a .Federal way to the people of this country, namely, at Ballarat, the candidate of the Country party lost his deposit, and the candidate of the Labour party was returned by a substantial majority. The facts are all against the honourable member for Wimmera. The point I am endeavouring to make is that the decision of the Country party, apparently arrived at during the luncheon adjournment, to grant the Government this adjournment, is absolutely inconsistent with the vote they cast yesterday. It merely serves to show that they are willing to meet the Government in every possible way. The only way in which they can be consistent with their vote of yesterday is to vote .against the - Governments request for this adjourn[304] ment. In fact, the words of the Leader of the Country party bear me. out. He said that the only decent thing the Government could do was to resign; and, in view of his words, the only logical action hie party can take is to put the Government into the position of having to resign at the earliest opportunity.",47
241,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"They want time to climb down.  honourable member for West Sydney has said, the Country party are again coming to the rescue of the Government by showing them a way out of their difficulty, and announcing that they are prepared Se to vote with them again. The members of the party may say it in their own way; but if they are really serious when they declare, as they did this morning, that they do not intend to wet-nurse the Government., or stand as supporters of it, the only thing they can do is to vote against this motion. That is the only to thing they can do if they are going to he consistent. I do not wish to say much else except to remind honourable members that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) definitely said that certain members of the Country party 'had assured him that they did not know what they were doing yesterday, or they would have voted otherwise. At least one member of that party, the honourable membeT for Grampians >(Mr. Jowett) nodded assent to the Prime Minister's statement.",48

That has ibeen my contentwo tion all alongBut if, as he declares, had no such wish, how oan' he say now that he wanted his motion carried ?' cannot have it both ways. The stateproaching ment made by the Prime Minister this morning was a charge against certain members of the Country party.",49
249,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I did not nod assent that either.  not think it .was a charge against the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart) or the honourable member for, the Franklin (Mr MCWilliams), who at a conference recently in Sydney threatened that he would screw the neck of the Government. In this connection, I may remind the House that, because of his indiscretion on that occasion, the honourable member for Franklin (Mr. MCWilliams) can no longer claim to be the Leader of the Country party, for the simple reason that a majority of our honourable friends in the Cornea - wish to be regarded as a pro-Government partyHenot*, because of his injudicious utterances, the honourable' member for Franklin lost his job. In view of the damaging statement made by the Prime Minister today, no self-respecting party could have done other than accept the challenge. But inthey waited until the dinner adthat journment so that they could come to some kind of a decision. All this conthe firms me in the belief that the members so of the Country party are still trying to play into the hands of the Government by giving them the week-end' to consider the position instead of voting against this member. motion for adjournment. One of the principal reasons advanced by the Prime Minister in his attempt to bludgeon the Country party to vote for the motion is that he feels in duty bound to attend the Imperial Conference as the Gorepresentative of the Commonwealth. I have said on other occasions, and I wast it recorded again, that if I had my way the Prime Minister would neror go out of this country as a representative of the of Australia. I do not believe he represents the people. This is borne out by the very latest developments in this House, the Government being defoated by votes on a definite motion. Consehe quently, I do not believe that a majority of the people desire to have him as the He representative of Australia at the apConference, and so his argument should have no weight with any section in this House. The motion now under discussion should be treated on its merits. The position, as I soo it, is that to the Prime Minister asks for the adjournment in order that the Government may the position, and the Leader of the Country party, speaking, I presume, for the whole of his party, has told the Prime Minister that there is only one decent thing for the Government to do, and that is to resign. Therefore, to be consistent, members of the Country party should vote against the motion.",49
250,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Ballarat) [3.34] - I would have been surprised, after the vote yesterday, if the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) had tendered his resignation to the Governor General. Knowing the Prime Minister's career, and remembering the ex-Senator Ready scandal, as well as his declaration on the hustings that if conscription were not carried he would resign, I am not at all surprised that he submitted to defeat yesterday and still retains his position as Prime Minister. But this he ought to know from today's debate: that although he may have a majority today, he has no guarantee from the Country party .of immunity from attack during his absence. The Leader of the party (Dr Earle Page) made that declaration.",50
251,Mr STEWART,Unknown,And that stands.,50
252,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Well , with this declaration standing, the Prime Minister ought not to go to England as the representative of Australia. He was defeated on the floor of the House yesterday by a combination of two parties. That vote proved conclusively that he represents a minority of the' people. I would be delighted if , as a result of what happened yesterday, this Parliament had to face a dissolution, though personally I do not want another election. I have had quite enough recently, but I would rather have another election, if by that means we could prevent the Prime Minister from misrepresenting Australia at the Imperial Conference. We know the way in which he played with the White Australia policy at the last Imperial Conference; we do not forget the extent to which it was jeopardized by his action in allowing the control of the question to be taken from Australia and handed over to the League of Nations. In view of these facts, we object to' the Prime Minister going abroad as representative of Australia. We particularly object to his representing Australia at the forthcoming Conference, at which Australia will probably be asked to join with Great Britain in spending £15,000,000 or £20,000,000 a year on battleships, and also to agree to some form of conscription proposed by people who do not live in Australia. Our desire is that we shall be represented by some one who rightly understands Australian sentiment-by some one who appreciates our freedom, rather than some one who has been used to bowing and scraping to others in older countries. If this crisis does no more than demonstrate to the world that the Prime Minister no longer possesses the confidence of the people, and thereby frustrates his efforts to go abroad as the representative of the Commonwealth, it will have achieved some useful purpose. As to what the Country party may or may not say, I am not concerned. They are fairly intelligent men, and quite able to look after their own business.",50
253,Mr STEWART,Unknown,That is the first kind thing that has been said of us today.,50
254,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Some members of the Country party may at times be inconsistent, just as the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) was a little while ago. Gesticulating wildly, the honourable member said that the Labour party was always opposed to the Government, whereas in a speech made by him only last week he said, pointing to the Ministerial party, "" There is organized capital,"" and, pointing to the Labour party, "" There is organized labour. Both will be found voting side by side.'' To-. day he says that the Labour party is always opposed to the Government, irrespective of what its proposals may be; but the other day he said that the Labour party, in so far as the Tariff was concerned, would' be found voting with the Government, because it considered that the Tariff was for the benefit of the people.",50
255,Mr STEWART,Unknown,We are told that the Tariff is a non-party question.,50
256,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Wit h us it is a 1 question, hot of party, but of' principle. We fight for principle alone; we have our platform, and we stand for it and fight for it. We have been what Mr Deakin once described as "" the third eleven "" in this House. While in the past we have voted to put out a Government, and a week or two later have voted to put out another, we were actuated throughout by the one guiding principle. If the Country party think that by voting against the Government on one occasion, and submitting to the taunts and insults of the Prime Minister, and reversing their vote on the following day, they are likely to grow in the esteem of the people, I have nothing to say. It is entirely their own business. But my view is that such an attitude would do them no good. I am, therefore, exceedingly pleased that the Country party have taken up their present stand. There is room for only two parties in this House-the party which represents the workers, and the other party which represents the loafers.",50
257,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"On a point of order, I ask for a withdrawal of that offensive remark in which the honourable member suggests that our party represents the loafers of the country.",51
258,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) spoke in general terms as to there being room in the House for only two parties, and made no reference to any particular party in the House at present as representing the "" loafers.""",51

262,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Yes; _ otherwise there would be no representatives of the ""loafers"" in this Parliament. Unfortunately, owing to the introduction of side issues at a general election, many people vote against their best interests. I recognise that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) before Wednesday next will have arrived at a satisfactory solution of this problem. Knowing his capabilities as an underground engineer, I feel satisfied that before we meet on Wednesday next he will have obtained some form of assurance, on the strength of which he can proceed to England as the representative of Australia.",51
263,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I B the honourable member quite sure that we shall meet on Wednesday?,51
264,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I hope we shall not. I should like this crisis to be brought to a head at once. I should like the Prime Minister and his Cabinet to be defeated and another party given an opportunity to govern the country. I realise that it is essential to have a representative of Australia at the Imperial Conference in June next; and with the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) I take exception to the manner in which the Prime Minister has used that Conference for party political purpose's-purel y to strengthen his party and to keep his Government in power. I would remind the House that if a crisis occurs on Wednesday next, and results in the resignation of the present Prime Minister, there will be nothing to prevent either the Country party or the Labour party taking office and the new Prime Minister sailing in the near future for England. The new Prime Minister, whoever he might be, would be a better representative of Australia at the Imperial Conference than the present Leader of the Government.",51
265,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,"Calare) [3.42] - It is rather remarkable that the time of the House should be taken up in discussing a motion of this kind. In view of the vote which was given against the Government yesterday, it is a mere waste of time for the Prime Minister (Mr.. Hughes) to ask the House to agree to a. motion for adjournment in order that the Cabinet may have an opportunity to consider their position.",51
266,Mr RYAN,Unknown,The Prime Minister should have telegraphed his resignation to the Governor General last night.,51
267,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,"The only honourable course open to the Government was to resign at once. There is no occasion for the House to adjourn to enable the Government to consider what action they shall take. Their chief anxiety it seems to me is to arrive at ways and means of avoiding their removal from office. I have listened Tather attentively to thedebate today, and particularly to the speeches made by the Prime Minister and two honourable members of the Country party. It seems impossible for the-. Country party to justify their dec-isioni to vote for this motion for the adjournment of the House in order that the Government may have - time to consider their attitude, having regard' to - the way in which they voted against the Government yesterday. If the Country party meant anything hy the vote yesterdayand two honourable members of the party have said that they did-the n there is no reason why they should vote today to give the Government time to consider their position. If they do, they will never be able to explain their conflicting votes to the satisfaction of the people. The. attitude taken up by the Country party towards the Government is clearly set out in a leading article published in this'morning's issue of the Age, in which it is saidTPho action which led to the contemptible anti-climax came from Mr Jowett,. a member of the Country party who votes with the Government, and often candidly speaks in its favour. In this respect he differs from moat of the other members of his party, who roundly attack the Government, and even vote against it when it is safe, but are extraordinarily ful when there is a suggestion of danger. That is the attitude of the Country party. If there is any possibility of the Government being defeated, they take fine care to see that some members of the party will voto with the Government. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) was quite sincere when today he nodded assent to the suggestion of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) that, in submitting his motion yesterday, he had no intention of harming the' Government. The Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) admitted that it was not the intention of the members of the Country party to take a vote on the motion for adjournment yesterday, and that it was taken only because, the Government did not have a sufficient nnmber of their supporters put up to talk the motion out. To-day, he told lis that the members of the Country party were desirous of taking a vote on the question. If they were, how could the Leader, of that party, after a meeting of the party, whieb lasted for several hours,, make a statement to the representatives of the press that the fact that a vote on the motion' was taken was due to the fault of the Government in not having put up speakers to prevent it? I listened attentively to the speeeh of the [305] honourable member for Illawarra (Mr. Hector Lamond) today. He made one of his usual vicious attacks upon his opponents. Those who know the honourable member as I do know that he has always been particularly vicious in attacking an opponent.",51
268,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Did not the honourable member use the word "" betray ? """,52
269,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,"He did, and no one should be a better judge of a betrayer. I can remember a time when the honourable member was an opponent of the Labour party, and when no one was more bitter than he against that party. He aftorwards became a member of the Labour party, and when he was managing director of the Australian Worker there was no more bitter and vindictive critic of the capitalistic class than the honourable member was. He has changed liis political coat on many occasions, and today he has made a bitteT attack upon the Labour party, and has had the^audacarecity to say that the members of that party are not very much concerned about the ""White Australia policy. He has said that the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) did not accurately put the position when he insisted that the Prime Minister had handed over the question of a White Australia to the League of Nations. But the statement made by the honourable member for West Sydney is absolutely true in every particular, as every member of this House must know. The honourable member for Illawarra stated that he secured for us the right to make the same laws for the territory over which we have been given a Mandate as we have to make laws for* Australia itself. If the Prime Minister handed over to the League of Nations, as ""he did, the right to interfere with Australian domestic legislation in respect to the law dealing with immigration, that was certainly handing over to the League the right to deal with the White Australia policy. The League of Nations bas now the right to interfere with our immigration laws, and it has the same right to interfere with immigration legislation in respect of the mandated territories. The Prime Minister today used, as a political battle cry, the necessity that he should go to London to .represent Aousconfident that. the honourable member f «ralia:.at the Imperial. Conference.We S f t ? u * to t l u l ^ the Country S r t y f W o support of the Government. purpose is to throw the blame our shoulders, or upon the shoulders of t&e Obuntry party, if Australia is not re: presented at the Conference by him. say that, so far as honorablo members this side arc concerned, we consider the Prime Minister cannot adequately present the people of Australia at - the Imperial or any other Conference. Ho can only misrepresent Australia,, because he is cut ot touch with the people, does not represent Australian ideals sentiments. It is in the interests, not against the interests, of Australia that ho chould be prevented from attending the Imperial Conference. I shall, - personally, do my best on this and every ether occasion to prevent the Prime' Minister misrepresenting Australia on any question. Mr nECron LAMOND - What ideals can the Prime Minister not represent ?",52
270,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,"He cannot represent the ideals of the majority of the people Australia. The honourable member who interjects cannot represent any ideal all. He has never been able .to represent his own, because he has always changed from one to another. It seems to me cical to debate this question, because i the. members of the Country party meant anything by the vote which they recorded yesterday they must vote with us against party. the Government today. There is no 1 casion to give the Government consider the position. They should have already considered their position, and only honourable course open to them waa to have resigned last night.",53
271,Mr COESEE,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [3.51] There is unquestionably a very serious position confronting us. It is far serious than many honourable members seem to think. It behoves us to consider well what is expected of us at this when it is sc important that the Minister (Mr Hughes) should represent us at the Imperial Conference. I have great respect for many of party are the "" stink "" 1 - the members of the Country party, and I believe that .the majority of thom act .with common sense and justice. I-am o r Grampians (Mr jowett), who submitted the rnction for . adjournment yesterday, was, quite sincere wben he stated distinctly that he did not launch that motion in the' slightest degree against the upon Government or the Nationalist party.",53
272,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,That is so.,53
273,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"I think that the memI bers of the Country party were on sincere when, on the floor of this that House, they gave a pledge that they rewould not do anything which might prevent the Prime Minister taking up his duties in representing Australia overseas. I have confidence that at least the and majority of the members of that party or will honourably fulfil the, pledges they and have given in this House.",53
274,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [3.53] - I wish to address myself to the position of the .Farmers party in .this on House. I heard the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) claim that they wero returned in spite of the other political parties. As a matter of fact, they got here with the consent of the other parties. Wo might just as well understand their true position in this of House. The authorities of the Nationalist party said to the. electors, ""For God's at sake keep the Labour party out, and give the Country party's candidate your second votes."" At the same time' the farauthorities of the Labour party appealed f to Labour voters Ip keep out the so-called Nationalist candidates, and give their second votes to candidates of the Country oc- - Mr BLAKELEY - In other words, time to "" Throw your vote away.""",53
275,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Yes . The members the of the Country party in this House are representatives of the thrown-away votes. It puts me in mind of. the fact that the other day I suw some little children playing. One little girl was running along more the street at the head of a number of others, and when. 1 asked what game they were playing, she replied, "" We are playtime ing motors, and I am the stink."" She Prime was the cast-off of the others.",53
276,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,Does the honourable member ^noan to say that the Farmers,53
277,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"They are here to annoy both of our parties. They are quite justified in doing so. The members of the Nationalist party cannot complain, because they helped to placethem where they are, and we,, on. this Bide, cannot . complain, because we did the same thing. At some twenty-four meetings in the country districts I implored Labour electors to give, their second votes to Farmers candidates, and the Victorian members of the Farmers party owe their return to the second votes of Labour electors. The honourable member knows as well as I do that he holds a. seat to which the same man has never been returned twice; a constituency that is as ooy as a maiden. Government cannot complain; helped to elect the Country party. The Opposition cannot complain; it also helped to do so. The Country party annoys both of the others. But I am more cheerful today than I was last night. Then I anticipated a nasty flection ; now I think that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has arranged things satisfactorily, and I am satisfied.
