1,Mr KELLY,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"- I wish to ask you, Mr. Speaker, if you have made an inquiry in reference to the statements made in this Chamber last night about the editing of Hansard? If so, will you be good enough to give us the result of them ?",13
2,Mr SPEAKER,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"I deemed that the remarks uttered last night demanded an inquiry, because it seems to me to be of the first importance lhat the Hansard report should be absolutely reliable ns a correct record of what honourable members have said - I , therefore, asked the Principal Parliamentary Reporter to furnish such a statement as he might think proper upon the comments referred to, and he has given me the following report:Parliamentary Reporting Staff, Melbourne, 27th June, 1906. [Memorandum.] In attention to Mr Speaker's request for a report in reference to the statements made in the House of Representatives yesterday as tp proof alteration by honourable members,' I have the honour to state- 1. That Mr Toseph Cook made no alteration in the portion of the report of his speech referred to by . Mr Webster; and that the record is an exact transcript of the reporter's note find corresponds with the manuscript forwarded by him lo the Government Printer. 2. That an interjection by Mr Webster in the course of a .speech by Mr Kellv was omitted at Mr Webster's request and with Mr Kelly's concurrence, Mr. Webster stating llia'the had misapprehended the purport of the speaker's remarks. In my review of the proofs returned to me by honourable members, I am invariably careful to ascertain, in the. very short time available for such a purpose, that the rule against alteration of sense is not infringed. B. HARRY FKIENO, Principal Parliamentary Reporter. The Honourable the Speaker of the House of Kepresentatives.",13
3,Mr WEBSTER,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"I should like the shorthand notes of the remariks which were made on the evening referred to to be looked into, with a view to ascertaining whether the expression reported in the Argus was not really uttered. The Argus report of the occurrence is as follows :",13
4,Mr WEBSTER,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,Did you not sign the pledge as a member of the party?,13
5,Mr COOK,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"I did nol sign ""any pledge of any party at all. I object to the omission of those words from Hansard. I did not charge the honourable member with having struck them out, as the report of my remarks will show. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - The honourable member did make that charge against me.",13
6,Mr WEBSTER,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"I did not. I refer the honourable member to the report of what I said yesterday. I referred, first of all, to the editing of Hansard generally; not to its editing by any particular individual.",13
7,Mr SPEAKER,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,I presume that the honourable member is to be taken as making a personal explanation?,14
8,Mr WEBSTER,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"Yes . What I said was thisI desire to bring under your notice, Mr. Speaker, a matter which seems to require attention, and that is the editing of the speeches of honourable members before they are published in Hansard. Then 1 illustrated the point which I desired to make, namely, that certain essential remarks of an honourable member had - been omitted. I did not say that they had been struck out by the honourable member for Parramatta. I said that, instead of those remarks appearing in Hansard, the words .recorded there wereI have no recollection of having signed any pledge. I referred to this method of revision as being of a certain character, and, later on, I said I think that Hansard should be a true record of what is said by the members of this House; and whatever honourable members may do with regard lo altering the verbiage of their remarks, they should not be allowed to take out of the report essential matters that have been openly .stated and amplified in speeches in this House. That was a general observation.",14
9,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,And an impugning of the Hansard report.,14
10,Mr WEBSTER,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"That was a general observation covering my views as to what should be the nature of the Hansard record. It does not matter whether an honourable member who has spoken desires to alter his speech by the elimination of some essential statement, or whether the Hansard reporters, at their own discretion, decide to eliminate it , I object to either course. The Hansard record should contain the remarks uttered by honourable members on essential matters. With regard to mere matters of detail and. verbiage, there is room for the alteration which Mr. Speaker has indicated.",14
11,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,Who decide what is essential?,14
12,Mr WEBSTER,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"In this case I complain of the reply to an interjection which was essential being omitted. The honourable member for Parramatta has, time and again, charged honourable members on this side of the Chamber with many things appertaining to the caucus pledge, and I say that his remark was essential, since it affected his position, and it should therefore have appeared in Hansard as it was uttered.",14
13,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,I did not utter the remark which the honourable member attributes to me.,14
14,Mr WEBSTER,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,There are witnesses here who say that they heard the remark.,14
15,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,I say that I did not utter it .,14
16,Mr WATSON,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,Ge t the shorthand notes.,14
17,Mr WEBSTER,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"The Argus does not generally report in an incorrect manner honourable members on the Opposition side of the Chamber, and, therefore, I think that I can rely on the statement appearing in that journal as supporting my contention that the remark I speak of was deliberately uttered by the honourable member for Parramatta in reply to an interjection from me. I think I have justification for complaining of the. non-insertion of that particular remark in Hansard.",14
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,I rise to make a personal explanation in this matter. I repeat that I did not make use of the expression to which the honourable member refers.,14
19,Mr TUDOR,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,Then is the Argus wrong?,14
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,I do not know. Does the honourable member usually accept the Argus?,14
21,Mr TUDOR,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,I do not; but it backs up the Opposition generally.,14
22,Mr WEBSTER,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,Does the honourable member deny having signed the pledge?,14
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"I decline to have anything more to do with the honourable member in this House. My reply to his statements is that I hold in my hand the proof of my speech which was sent to me to correct, and that not a single alteration of any kind appears upon it.",14
24,Mr WEBSTER,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"I have not alleged that the honourable member made an alteration. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I have here, too, the reporter's proof, on which there is not a single alteration of any kind. is to Mr Webster - I did not allege that the honourable member altered the report.",14
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,I am also informed by the Principal Parliamentary Reporter that the report appearing in Hansard has been checked with the shorthandwriter's notes. What further proof does the honourable member require?,14
26,Mr WEBSTER,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"I say that the report is deficient. Mr. JOSEPH COOK,-Any man who keeps repeating that statement in the face of such proofs to the contrary must be named Webster. No one else would do it . Mr Webster.;-The report in Friday's Argus proves the correctness of what I say.",15
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"Ha d it not been for a certain allusion made by t'he honourable member last night, I should not have taken the slightest notice of his charge of editing Hansard, because such charges are always susceptible of proof by reference to the official records. But when he sought to drag in the name of Peter Close, of New South Wales, I thought it time to rebel against that sort of treatment. All I have to say to him is that I know nothing of Peter Close, though I fancy that he does. I had nothing to do with the appointment of the politicians who were supposed to be associated with Peter Close, though Ministers whom the honourable member supports had.",15
28,Mr SPEAKER,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"When I heard the name Peter Close used last night, I did not know who was .referred to ; but, as I have since gathered that the use of that name conveyed a very serious imputation, I shall in future disallow its use by any honourable member, and I must aslk the honourable member for Parramatta not to use it. I hope that the present difficulty will be ended by the honourable member bringing his remarks to a close as shortly as posMinister sible.",15
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"I claim that, having been associated with the name of a man like Peter Close, I have the right to reply. Every one who knows the circumstances knows the meaning of that association.",15
30,Mr SPEAKER,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"I did not know last night whatrfhe meaning was. Had I known, I should have required the remark to be withdrawn. It was such a remark as should not have been made by any one acquainted with the facts; but that, having been said, and this not being the occasion for a reply, the honourable member for Parramatta having replied last night, J cannot allow any further reference to the matter. This afternoon is not the time when a reply should, or can, be made.",15
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"I have no more to say, if you, sir, will not allow me to refer to that aspect of the matter.",15
32,Mr SPEAKER,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"The question is not whether I shall allow it, but whether the Standing Orders are to be obeyed. The honourable member made his reply last) night, and any further comment on what was said then would be a distinct violation, of the standing order, which says that a personal explanation may not be debated. FOREIGNINSURANCE COMPANIES.",15
33,Mr HUGHES,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister if his attention has been called to a report appearing in this morning's Age, as to the position of Australian and New Zealand policy-holders in American insurance companies. The matter is of sufficient importance to claim the immediate attention of the Government. The article points out that in Australia and New Zealand there are some 29,967 policyholders in foreign companies, paying annual premiums amounting to £ 4 6 0 , 0 0 0 , and insured for the sum of nearly £11,500,000 . The recent scandals in America have demonstrated that the security of these policy-holders has been grievously impaired', and that, a'lthough there may be sufficient assets here to cover the local liabilities, there is nothing to prevent the realization of those assets, and the transference of the proceeds to America.' I am informed that the attention of the Prime Minister was called to this matter last session, and I ask whether, in view of all thecircumstances, and the expressed intentionof the Government to introduce legislationin reference to this matter, the Prime will see the advisability of doing, so immediately.",15
34,Mr DEAKIN,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"L as t session, the honourable member for Herbert gave notice of a motion, which was not reached, but because* of it the Government placed' themselves in communication with the representatives of the foreign insurance companies doing business here, and obtained certain information from them as to their position. There was not so much known then of the disturbance in America, and the operations of the companies there. As was mentioned in thespeech df the Governor General, a Bill has been drafted.",15
35,Mr HUGHES,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,That Bill must have been drafted before the result of the American inquiry had been made known.,15
36,Mr DEAKIN,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"A new and moreextensive measure now awaits the sanction of the Cabinet, which I hope will be given next week. The companies with which I have been able to come into direct communication recently informed me that nochange has been made in the control of the local assets of which they gave us particulars last year, and I have been assured by one or two of the most representative companies that no measure providing adequate protection for. the policy-holders of Australia will meet with their opposition. I hope this is the case.",15
37,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,Is it possible for the Government to give the policyholders adequate protection? M-r. DEAKIN - I think so. There is no doubt that we can give it with the cooperation of the companies concerned. I trust that we can give a measure of it even without their co-operation. But I am encouraged to hope that we shall receive their assistance in making it abundantly plain that the policy-holders of Australia are adequately protected.,16
38,Mr CROUCH,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,Is the Prime Minister satisfied with the statements of their assets which were made last year?,16
39,Mr DEAKIN,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"I am by no means satisfied that their Australian assets cover all their possible lqcal liabilities, but from the statements it did not appear that their assets had been diminished since these inquiries were first instituted.",16
40,Mr HUGHES,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"Is the Prime Minister aware that the companies in question have entirely relinquished new business here, so that practically they have no incentive to remain ?",16
41,Mr DEAKIN,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"I am aware they have no incentive to remain in Australia except that which is offered by the premiums payable upon the existing policies, by the properties which they possess, and by the deposits which they have made under State law.",16
42,Mr HIGGINS,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether the Government have considered the advisability of making uniform laws not only as to life assurance, but also in regard to fire insurance, throughout Australia? I may mention that I had a Bill upon the business-paper last - session relating to this matter, but I should much prefer the question to be taken up by the Government. The adoption of that - course would be obviously better.",16
43,Mr DEAKIN,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"In reply to the honourable and learned member, I may say that it is the intention of the Government to' introduce such a Bill , but am unable to. hold out hope that it will be submitted during the present session.",16
44,Mr FRAZER,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,Will that measure relate both to' fire and life assurance?,16
45,Mr DEAKIN,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,We shall deal with life assurance first. TARIFF COMMISSION .,16
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"Las t week I sought to obtain some information regarding the work of the Tariff Commission in respect of metals and machinery from one or other of the members of that body who were present in the House. You, sir, then stated that if the chairman had been present, and I had addressed my question to him, you would have permitted him to answer it. I now desire to ask the chairman of the Commission if he would care to say whether that body proposes soOn to malee any report upon the question of metals and machinery, and whether he wili be good enough to make a statement to the House upon the matter?",16
47,Sir JOHN QUICK,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"The honourable member was good enough to give me notice of his question, and with the concurrence of Mr Speaker, I will answer it within the limits of my authority. The Commission will deal with the evidence relating to metals and machinery in five separate reports. The first will relate to agricultural implements generally, the second to stripper-harvesters, the third to .mining machinery, the fourth to metals and metal work generally, and the fifth to ship-building. The draft report in respect to agricultural' implements generally was circulated among members of the Commission on 12th June; that relating to stripper-harvesters was circulated yesterday, 26th June; and the draft reports in reference to mining machinery, metals, and metal-work generally, and ship-building are now in the hands of the typewriters, and will be circulated next week. The Commission will deal with these matters probably the week after next, but the precise date upon which the reports will be presented to the Governor General I cannot at present say. POSTAL ADMINISTRATION .",16
48,Mr JOHNSON,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"I wish to ask the Acting Postmaster-General whether he is in a position to reply to the question which I asked yesterday upon the subject of the use of the printed words, "" On His Majesty's Service,"" which appear upon the wrapper of a private publication? The Minister promised to give the desired information today, and I desire to know if he is prepared to do so now?",16
49,Mr EWING,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"I told the honourable member yesterday that I hoped to be in a position to give him the information which he seeks today. This morning, I found that the Department had taken immediate action, and had submitted the matter to which he refers to the Crown Solicitor, with a view to ascertaining exactly where the Department stood from a legal standpoint. Possibly, I shall have the papers relating to the matter in my possession tomorrow, and, as soon as they are available, I will make the fullest statement to the House, besides laying them upon the table of the Library for the information of honourable members.",17
50,Mr JOHNSON,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"I desire to know if , in the meantime, any further copies of the publication in question, bearing the inscription to which I have referred upon the wrapper, will be transmitted through the post ?",17
51,Mr EWING,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"I understand that they will not, but I do not desire to be absolutely bound by that statement. I have given instructions that the matter shall be dealt with as promptly as possible.",17
52,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,I wish to ask the Minister whether the reference to the Crown Solicitor will include his opinion as to the responsibility of the person using the words complained of upon the wrapper?,17
53,Mr EWING,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"Yes . It will deal with the point to which the honourable member refers. At this stage, I do not desire to make a full statement to the House. When I do so, I wish, to be fortified with all the information that the papers disclose, and at the present moment I am not quite in that position. NAVAL DEFENCE.",17
54,Mr KELLY,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"Referring to some quotations-the tenor of which was opposed to the Australian Naval Agreement-mad e during the course of the debate upon the Address-in-Reply by the honourable member for Barker-quotation s from an interview with Mr Bellairs, M.P., whom the Prime Minister has told the House he acknowledges as "" a very competent critic,"" I wish to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether he will give the same immediate consideration to such parts of that interview as the honourable member for Barker did not quote, as the latter asked for the extracts which he so carefully made. I especially desire to know whether the Minister will give his immediate consideration to the concluding paragraph of Mr Bellairs' statement, which readsI f theymeaning the Australiansare bent on experimenting let them experiment. It will do no harm for them to burn their fingers. The lesson would be a salutary one and awake them to the true significance of problems of naval defence.",17
55,Mr EWING,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,I think that notice should be given of such an abstruse question. I shall be glad to have notice of it given for tomorrow. GOVERNMENT HOUSES: SYDNEY AND MELBOURNE.,17
56,Mr MCDONALD,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"the Minister of Home Affairs, ufon notice*In view of the demand made by the Premier of Victoria for the sum of £3,000 a year rental for Government House, will the Government take the necessary steps to arrange for the Gcvernor-Genera.1 to reside in Sydney and save the expenses entailed by the upkeep of Government House, Melbourne ? Mr GROOM.^-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am pleased to be able, to inform the honourable member that an arrangement for the renewal of the existing agreement with the Victorian Government, under which no rent is payable for Government House, Melbourne, is practically concluded. ELECTORAL ACT.",17
57,Mr MAHON,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"the Minister of Home Affairs, ufon notice I. Referring to his answer to Mr Mahon's 1 question of 21st June, does he consider that section 89 of the Electoral Act 1902, which provides that(89) The date fixed for the return of the writ shall - not be more than 60 days after the issue of the writ, is annulled or superseded by section 168 of the same Act, which reads as follows :(168) Within twenty days before or after the day appointed for any election the person causing the writ to be issued may provide for extending the time for holding the election or for returning the writ, or meeting any difficulty which might otherwise interfere with the due course of the election; and any provision so made shall be valid and - sufficient : Provided that(i) Public notice shall be immediately given in the State or division in which the election is to be held of any extension of the time for holding the election; (ii) No polling day shall be postponed under this section at any time later than seveiv days before the time originally appointed. 2.. Does he contend that the extension of time mentioned in section 168 can be applied uniformly and simultaneously to all the writs issued for any general election, and that the section last aforesaid confers upon "" the person causing the writ to be issued"" power to fix for the return of all writs a date beyond the term of 60 days? 3. Have not the terms of section 168 been borrowed substantially from the Electoral Acts of South and Western Australia, where the remoteness of certain electorates compelled the adoption of exceptional and elastic provisions to meet unforeseen contingencies; and, if so, is not the intent of section 168 to meet individual cases in which, owing to some mischance, an election could not be held on the day appointed, O' the writ returned within the time fixed in the Proclamation? 4. Assuming that section 16S is applicable only as indicated in the last paragraph, do not the requirements of section 8q of the Electoral Act and of section 5 of the Constitution necessitate that a Parliament elected on any day in October next .shall meet before the end of the present year? Mf. GROOM - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow: 1. Section 89 of the Commonwealth Electoral Acts 1902-1905 is not annulled or superseded by Section 168, which renders practicable an extension of the time appointed under section 89 for the return of the writ. 2. The power conferred by section 168 to extend the time for the return of the writ may be applied unTformally and simultaneously to all the writs issued for any general election. 3. Similar provisions exist in the South Austialia and Western Australia Electoral The power of extension provided in section 16S is not limited to individual cases. [See answer to No. 2 above]. 4. No. POSTAL OFFICIALS.",17
58,Mr JOHNSON,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"the Acting Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Is it a fact that in the General Post Office, Sydney, General Division officers are employed in clerical positions, whilst officers who have passed their examinations for the Clerical Division are employed in General Division .work in the Mail Branch. If so, what is the reason for such an anomaly? 2. Is it a fact that clerical officers in the Mail Branch, who are engaged in work classified as belonging to the General Division, have lo submit to be represented on the Appeal Board by the General Division representative? 3. Does the practice of keeping clerical officers employed in General Division work militate against the advancement of such clerical officers to fill positions in the Clerical Division? 4. Is it a fact that numerous vacancies have occurred in the higher grades of the Department's service since the classification, affording opportunities for the promotion of officers from the 5th to the 4th grade, and that only one such officer has been so promoted in that period ?",18
59,Mr EWING,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows:Information required by the honourable member has to be obtained from Sydney. Instructions have been given to expedite. Replies will be furnished - as early as possible. EX-DRIVER FAY.,18
60,Mr KELLY,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, uponnotice1. Is it not a fact that ex-Driver Fay received injuries, while on duty, which have re. dered him a cripple for life? 2. Is it not a fact that last session the Covernment introduced a Bill to recompense . Colonel Price for injuries received on duty ? 3. Will, the Government extend the same consideration to a private soldier as they extended last session to Colonel Price, by giving Parliament an. opportunity of deciding whether his (Driver Fay's) special case merits special treatment ?",18
61,Mr EWING,ALTERATION OF HANSARD,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. Yes. 2. Y.es. 3. The Minister will bring forward the case of ex-Driver Fay for the consideration of the Cabinet at the earliest opportunity. PAPER. Sir JOHN FORREST laid upon the table the following paper :Transfers of amounts approved by the Governor General in Council under the Audit Act, Acts. financial year 1905-6 (dated 26th June). NA PRESERVATION BILL. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 26th June (vide page 742), on motion by Sir WILLIAM LYNEThat the Bill be now read a second lime. Upon which Mr Wilks had moved, by way of amendment That all the words after the word "" be "" beleft out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof, the words "" not further proceeded wilh until after the Tariff Commission has presented its report on metals and machinery.""",18
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Parramatta.) [ -55l- - I have already promised that 2 this debate, so far as its second reading stage is concerned, shall close this evening, ancl therefore I. feel no compunction in speaking, for the second time upon the general question before the House. I wish particularly this afternoon, to offer some reasons why there should be a little delay in con-, nexion with this most important measure. I desire to advance reasons why it should not be proceeded with until after we have received from the Tariff ' Commission, which is now sitting, its report upon the matters that are principally affected by this Bill .",18
63,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I do not think that the honourable member got a very satisfactory reply to the .question which he put to the Chairman of the Commission this afternoon.,19
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I think that the reply was eminently satisfactory from my point of - view, if not from that of the Minister. He is hurrying this Bill through the House, seemingly for the purpose of getting ahead of the Commission which is inquiring into these specific matters. The fact that the honourable gentleman has behind him a solid phalanx of members who will sit quiet and vote upon all occasions",19
65,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I thought that the honourable member would get angry.,19
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am not angry ; it is the Minister who is getting angry. He need not tell me that he is going to do nothing, because I know it before he makes the announcement. I know his attitude upon this question, and I know also that a little knowledge would be fatal to his political schemes. A long personal experience of him has taught me that there is nothing which is so fatal to him and his measures as the kind of knowledge which he is seeking to "" b u r k e "" just now.",19
67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I have passed the best measures to be found on the statutebooks in Australia.,19
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am sure that the Minister believes that he has. He has passed a lot of measures which he dares not bring into operation, because of the impossibility of administering, them.",19
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The member will learn all about that tomorrow or the next day.,19
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The information which we have gleaned today from the Chairman of the Tariff Commission evidences the necessity for hastening slowly with this very important proposal. Bill has been introduced primarily to deal with many of the matters upon which the Tariff Commission is upon the verge of' reporting.,19
71,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We have a Senate to prevent hasty legislation.,19
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"We have a Senate, I believe, that is dominated in the same way as is this Chamber, by the silent, solid vote of men who make up their minds out of the House, and then come into it and sit tight t ill measures are put through. That is what we have both in this Chamber and in the Senate.",19
73,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Did not the honourable member like that state of things in New South Wales for five years?,19
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"We did not have it for five years. To my way of thinking, nothing that has occurred in New South Wales or in* any part of Australia has ever presented a parallel to what we see here. The Labour Party, as I said last night, ought to be re-named the deaf and dumb party, so far as discussion in this House is concerned. Its members have abdicated their old-time functions. These great tribunes of - the people who were wont to make their voices heard in the Parliaments of the States have not a word to say upon these matters, which go to the very vitals of our industrial position. These matters do not appear to concern them. Their attitude was summed up the other day by their leader in this Chamber when he said that they do not object to the consideration of ,a little protection, so long as there are more important matters from their point of view in the Government programme. That appears to be the sum and substance of the whole matter. They are therefore in this position: that, so long as there are some planks of their platform on the Government programme, Ministers may play ducks and drakes with anything beside, no matter how important it may be to the country. That is why we find them sitting ^ in a solid phalanx, none of them saying a word. They simply sit tight, and see these measures put through, very often, I venture to say, honourable without knowing what is in them. ' So far from that lessening our obligation, it increases it . The people outside should know something about what is going on here, and if honourable members of the Labour Party, who are supposed to take the great working population of Australia This speciallv under their wing, will not condescend to enlighten them in any wav. there is all the more reason why we should do it .",19
75,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And the working men will not trust the honourable member.,19
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I do not know about that.,20
77,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I do.,20
78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable gentleman knows a lot. He has all his life been a good friend to the working bidden by the Standing Orders. men.,20
79,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I have.,20
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"When it suited the honourable member's purpose. This only a new-found zeal of the honourable gentleman for the working men. terest in the working men dates from the time when, by their votes, he was able get on the Treasury bench.",20
81,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does the honourable member think that that has anything to with the question?,20
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is in reply the week after next. to an interjection. Until the honourable gentleman saw a chance of getting over their backs on to the Treasury bench never heard of him doing anything but , opposing the interests of the working of Australia.",20
83,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is not rect.,20
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not desire to. go further into that matter now, because it really is not important. But the honourable gentleman sits opposite to me, and is continually interjecting. As circulated amongst them. usual, it is the man who lives in a glass house who throws stones-the man whose record will show that time and again i the history of Australia he has been posed to the interests of honourable bers in the Labour corner. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Never .",20
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,He has been bitterly opposed to them.,20
86,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,There is more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents over ninety and nine just men.,20
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Well , I can apwith preciate that sentiment; and' if the Minall ister of Trade and Customs admits that is now on the stool of repentence, all well.",20
88,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Not at all.,20
89,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Mr Reid said that honourable gentleman did more for us he would do in a thousand years.,20
90,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Thes e interjections, so began its inquiry. constantly repeated by honourable on both sides, seem to me for the most part and to be intended to irritate and annoy. They therefore provoke what may be called quarrelsome disputes between honourable members. The Standing Orders expressly provide that that sort of thing shall be prevented. Honourable members must know that, whether in speeches or interjections, taunting and irritating remarks are forThey must be prevented, and I ask hbnorable members on both sides to refrain from them. Mr. JOSEPH"" COOK - This afternoon is we had a statement from the Chairman of the Tariff Commission, that the subject H is inof harvesters has been specially under the consideration of the Commission, and that to we may expect a report the week after next on that subject by itself.",20
91,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No , the honourable and do learned member did not say that. He said it would be presented to the Commission",20
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member for Melbourne Ports is wrong. I we happen to knowfrom the Chairman of the Commission that he has already presented men the report to the Commission.,20
93,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Did the honourable cormembsr have a previous conference with the Chairman of the Commission ?,20
94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I believe that the members of the Tariff Commission have considered the question of harvesters, and that a special report on the subject has been We were told by the. Chairman of the Commission today that that report will be available, that i's n to say, it will be completed, so far as the opmembers of the Tariff Commission are conmemcerned, the week after next.",20
95,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I did not understand it so.,20
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That will be before this Bill gets through Committee, though we should proceed with its considerathan tion in Committee as early as we mav. Surely, therefore, we might as well proceed the Committee stage of this Bill , with the knowledge which this special investihe gation renders .available to us, as go is blundering on with the Bill in Committee without that knowledge ? The Government .T-e paying but a poor compliment to the the Commission in ignoring it as they do in than every way they can think of. They have done so ever since the Commission It would appear members to be the object of the Government of their newspaper supporters from the outset to make it appear to the people of Australia that the appointment of the Tariff Commission was neither more nor less than a farce. I think that some have gone so far as to definitely say so. That, of course, cannot be said of the Minister in charge of the Bill. opposed to the appointment of the Commission, but other members of the Government were not, and they gave it their approval and support. Surely the passing of this measure is not of such pressing importance as to outweigh and completely set aside all the information gained by the last twelve months of assiduous inquiry by this Commission, appointed under the hand and seal of the Governor General? I say that it is paying but a poor compliment to a Commission of the importance of the Tariff Commission, to proceed with fhis measure post-haste in the way Ministers are doing . at the present time. Everybody admits that this legislation is of a purely speculative and experimental character.",20
97,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No , they do not.",21
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable gentleman knows it.,21
99,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,No .,21
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne yesterday afternoon told us that it was a pure experiment. He said that all experience is against this Bill , so far as its anti-trust provisions are concerned. He expressed openly and candidly the doubt in his mind.that we should be able to suppress these trusts. He said that the more difficulties we put in their way, the more they will contrive to get round them'. The honourable and learned member doubted exceedingly whether we could do anything to suppress the trusts or curtail their operations. Then we have the honourable member for Bland 'declaring in his place, the other day, that he hadl no faith in this legislation-that , so fa r as he was concerned, he was blindly following the Government ini this matter, in the belief that this measure would not accomplish what it is intended to accomplish.",21
101,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,He did not say,21
102,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable gentleman said that, in his opinion, this legislation would not do what it was expected to do, that it would not regulate and control these trusts, and that there was nothing for it, in his view, but the ultimate nationalization of these huge corporations'. We were left to infer from what the honourable gentleman said that this is an experiment, or, rather, I should say, that he considers it a step in the process of socialization which the Labour Party are pursuing with respect to these combines and corporations. Here we have two of the He was - most! .prominent supporters of the Bill , speaking from the Government side, with every desire to aissist Ministers to push this legislation through, declaring that, in their opinion, it is useless for the purpose for which it has been introduced, namely, the repression of destructive monopolies. One of these honourable members saidi that we cannot do what is sought to be done by this Bill because of the very nature of the operations of these trusts and the extent of their ramifications. The other says that we cannot do it because they are part of Our social order, which must be changed, so as to bring these trusts entirely under the confrol and operation of the Government. Yet, despite all this speculative and experimental element iin this Bill , the Government will not wait for the knowledge which is available to them, and which might be made available to the House, before proceeding to place it on the statute-book of the country. Then the Prime Minister told us, the other night, that this is a Bill of first-rate importance. He said that trusts in the United States must be controlled by the people of that country, or they would soon control the United States-that trusts must be mastered, or they would master the country in which they existed. Surely a Bill of this kind, aiming at the very existence of our social order, at the control and regulation of most of the capital, as well as at the control of nearly all the industrial occupations of the country, is a matter in connection with which there should be no hurry, unless there be some over-shadowing menace in the industrial sky, presaging events which may speedily put an end to social order and the industrial life of the country. If that menace does exist, where is the evidence-of it? It should) be easily tabulated in figures, and presented to this House. Instead of that, we hear nothing so. from the Minister to show that there is any need for this legislation, or that any-: thing out of the ordinary is taking place. The Prime Minister, by way of interjection, last night asked the honourable member for Dalley what possible effect the report pf the Tariff Commission could have upon the measure now before honourable members. The honourable and learned gentleman made it very clear that, so far as the Government are concerned, they will have nothing to do with the Tariff Commission in this regard, and will not pay attention to what the Commission may say. All I have to say in reply to the Prime Minister on that point is that, while he will not have anything to do with the Tariff Commission so far as the passing of this Bill is concerned, the Minister in charge o i the measure has made just such use of the knowledge which has come to him from the labours of the Commission as suited! his purpose, and no more. gentleman referred to the Commission several times during his speech.",21
103,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Only once or twice.,22
104,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister had better be sure, as I shall refer to one of the occasions he alludes to. I say that the honourable gentleman in charge of the Bill does not hesitate to use any knowledge which may come to him through the medium of the Tariff Commission if it suits his purpose to do so. Yet the Prime Minister when asked to wait for the full text of the Commission's report, and the accompanying evidence, asks what possible effect it can have upon this matter. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Neithe r can it have the slighest effect.",22
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Ver y well, if it cannot affect the measure adversely",22
106,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It is not a question him. of the Tariff at all.,22
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Well , I thought it was. judging by the number of references to the Tariff in the honourable gentleman's speech. He made it appear that it was nothing else but a Tariff question. The honourable gentleman made it a Tariff matter in his speech in introducing the Bill , and said a great many things the Tariff. He particularly referred the question of stripper harvesters, and sisting dragged in the names of MCKay and the Massey-Harris and International HarI ask him-to withdraw. vester Companies. The honourable gentleman made very full use of these matters in moving the second reading of the Bill .",22
108,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member seems to have a brief for the In ternational Harvester Company and the Massey-Harris Company.,",22
109,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I do not know anv of them.,22
110,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Neithe r do I .,22
111,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The v have a brief for ihe other side, and not for the duties. A Royal Commission should be appointed. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I do not want any impudence from the honourable and scurrilous member.",22
112,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The conversation between the honourable and learned member for Werriwa and the Minister is quite out of place. I again remind the honourable and learned member for Werriwa that imputations upon honourable members, whether The honourable individually or collectively, are out of order. , Mr CONROY - The honourable gentleman knows that he made £ 1 5 0 a year from one company.",22
113,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable and learned member is telling an untruth.,22
114,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is true, and the honourable gentleman knows that it is.",22
115,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I ask the Minister to withdraw the statement he has made.,22
116,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable and learned member for Werriwa made an interjection which is absolutely contrary to fact. I cannot sit and listen to his interjections and insinuations. The honourable and learned member made an insinuation the other night which has not the slightest foundation.,22
117,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I will say it outside for the honourable gentleman if that will please,22
118,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I do not care where the honourable and learned member says it . I defy and challenge the honourable and learned member to prove what he has said here.,22
119,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister knows quite well that however he may regard the remarks of the honourable and learned memabout ber for Werriwa, which I prevented the to honourable and learned member from perin last evening, he is not in order in the statement he made just now, and which",22
120,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I withdraw.,22
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister said, in-reply to a statement from me, that I had a brief for certain harvester combinations.",22
122,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Insinuation s have been made against me which are quite unjustified. It takes me all I know to control myself when I hear them repeated.,22
123,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Hav e I made them? Why say such things of me?,22
124,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I did not refer to those who pay the honourable member.,22
125,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not know any of these people. not know Mr MCKay; I met him only once in the train. The Minister says that I have a brief for these companies. I reply that the Minister himself dragged all these matters into his speech, and made them the basis for asking the House to deal with this measure, and to deal with it now. What statements did the Minister make? First of all, he quoted clause trade in Australia. 14 of the Bill , which says that the measure has to do with all matters of trade and commerce, as they affect Australia from the outside; and therefore have to do exactly and precisely with what the Commission has been set to inquire into-that and nothing more. How else can the foreign trusts express themselves if not by means of the things which they send to Australia, if not by means of the trade and industry carried on between them and the buyers of their articles here? ter says that this Bill is to control foreign trusts. Very well then; it means that it is intended' to control the operations of foreign trusts; and those operations can only express themselves in the trade that goes on between them and Australia. That is the very thing that the Commission has been set to inquire into. It has been charged, for instance, with the duty of finding out how far harvestermakers here are being hit by foreign trusts, and by the competition which they set up. It has been set to inquire how far our agricultural implement-makers are affected by competition from oversea. Therefore this Bill purports to deal with a matter which the Commission has been specially set to inquire into. Yet the Government has endeavoured to rush it through in this post-haste fashion, before the Commission has had time to report, and' is seeking ;o give effect to the measure before the knowledge collected by the Commission can be made available. There is no fairness in doing that kind of thing. It is not fair to this House. It is not fair to the people outside who will be chiefly concerned. It is not fair to the farmers of Australia. It is not fair to the firms interested. It is not fair to Mr MCKay. It is not fair to anybody that this BiM should be rushed' through, and finally and completely dealt with, until the Royal Commission has had time to make its report. is an example of the unfairness, Mr Speaker. The Minister, during the course of his speech, referred to a I do statement which had ibeen made before the Tariff Commission on this question of the competition of outside companies with M.r. MCKay, and' he went on to quote a declaration, and to embody it in Hansard, which shows that some traveller must have said somewhere that these gentlemen, the American manufacturers, were going to try to drive Mr MCKay right out of the harvester I ask the Minister whether he thinks it is a fait treatment of this subject to quote something which has been said on behalf of Mr MCKay to that Commission, and not to wait for the other side to be put before this House? Is there any fair play in that conduct ?",23
126,Mr KENNEDY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The document quoted' was what was written by the head of the American firm to an agent of Mr MCKay.,23
127,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If such a document was written, is it not fair, before conThe Minisdemning the firm in question, to hear them ? Is not that the first principle of British justice ?",23
128,Mr KENNEDY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Bot h sides have been heard before the Commission.,23
129,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Exactly ; but both sides have not been heard here. The. Minister makes use of the statement of one of the parties, and is deliberately shutting out the possibility of the other side being heard.",23
130,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I made use of a statement made on oath.,23
131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,All statements before the Commission are made on oath.,23
132,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But this was a special statutory declaration.,23
133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It may be so, but no contrary statement has been made public by the Commission. Does the Minister think that the Commission could specialize its reports as it has done if it did not on all occasions hear the other side? This question of harvesters is receiving no scintilla of fair play in the way this Bill is being dragged before the House. It is quite true that the case on behalf of Mr .MCKay has been presented to us. But the Minister would not permit anything to be heard on the other side in ""this House. He deals with this Bill as if there were no other side to be heard. I want to secure fair play, And here and I therefore say that that is a reason why this Bill should not be rushed through in this way, until all the information available to the Commission. is placed in the possession of honourable members for use in this House. If the reports of the Com- good man. mission were here, other honourable members might have something to say in reply to statements made on behalf of the Government. But the Minister is taking a course which absolutely prevents that from being done. That is one great reason, as I think, why there ought to be no haste in connection with a Bill of this description. The Minister went on to tell us that he knew a great deal about this matter of harvesters. I do not know where he got his information from, but he knows what profits are made by the harvester companies; he knows what commissions are p a i d ; he knows what it costs to make the machines. He knows all the minutia? of the business. But, strange to say, Ke knows only one side, and that is the side of Mr MCKay. He, apparently, knows nothing about the other side. Mr MCKay's own case is . prejudiced by a Minister who will be so one-sided. It is not more fair to Mr MCKay than to others; because no one would expect any fair minded man to make up his own judgment on this matter from an ex parte statement such as that presented by the Minister of Trade and Customs in introducing this Bill . In the course of his speech, the Minister made allusions to the Tobacco Trust and the Oil Trust of America. That is a further reason why we should hear from the Royal Commission concerning these matters. Both oil and tobacco are peculiarly Tariff matters. of oil concerns nearly every man throughout the length and breadth of Australia, and particularly does it affect those people who are remotest from the great centres of population, and who are not enjoying the communal advantages of our town and suburban life. > A matter affecting them ought to be legislated upon with all the information available to us, so that we may know what experts on either side have said, and particularly so that we may know what the Commission has said. The Minister gave to everv ooint of his. speech what I might call a Tarifftwist; and, while he told us generally that this measure does not affect the Tariff, and has nothing to do with protection and free-trade, he made nothing more nor less than a protectionist appeal. His speech was that of a militant protectionist from beginning to end..",23
134,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is a good phrase"" militant protectionist.""",24
135,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Coine d by a,24
136,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It will be "" triumphant"" next.",24
137,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I hope, since the honourable member is quite certain of his cause being triumphant, that at least he will not shut out a little light upon this matter-that at least he will have his triumph in the full blaze of all the knowledge that is available. That is all we are asking for at the present time. Do not sneak this thing through in the dark. Do not sneak this thing through behind the backs of the people, and without the .knowledge which the people ought to have before them. That is the claim which we are setting up for a little delay. We say that the matters involved in this Bill are of first-class importance, although they are not so regarded by a section of this House; and that, therefore, the fullest possible knowledge that we can .gather from any and every quarter should be brought to bear in the final and satisfactory settlement of this issue. The Minister, when speaking with regard to harvesters., told the House in a fine burst of frankness and candour that he had been asked to take action under the Customs Act to keep out the harvesters of foreign trusts. I wonder who it was that approached him in that way. He saidAs honourable members know, the Customs Act gives the Minister great power, and I have been told by legal authorities that he has now The price sufficient power if he likes to exercise it, to prohibit the importation of harvesters or anj' other machinery. Then why this Bill, I wonder?",24
138,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not think that it was intended by Parliament that that power should be exercised, and I will not do it. I believe that technically I have the power, but that it was not intended.",24
139,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Minister says that he has. the technical power.,24
140,Mr LONSDALE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Was it Mr MCKay who suggested that?,24
141,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It was not Mr. MCKay who saw me. I never saw him more than once in my life.,24
142,Mr LONSDALE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Was it Mr MCKay's lawyer ?,24
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Then who was it?,24
144,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I am not going to say.,24
145,Mr LONSDALE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It was some one connected with him.,24
146,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It was no one connected with the business at all. I give the honourable member my word as to that.,25
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister said in the course of his speechI do not think that it was intended that the Minister should exercise that power; I shall decline to exercise it until I am clothed with the powers provided for in the Bill now before the House. Thereupon the honourable Corinella interjectedHas the honourable gentleman been asked to act under the section of the Customs Act to which he refers? Well, now, I think that as t'he Minister has told the House so much, he ought to tell the source whence this suggestion came. Who is it that has been approaching the Minister and trying to induce him to exercise this power?",25
148,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,No one business.,25
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That it all the more peculiar. If it is no one in the business, and no one interested in it, who on earth would try to induce him to introduce a Bill of this kind for the purpose of keeping these importations out of Australia? The matter only becomes the more mysterious from these interjections of the Minister. If it was not Mr. MCKay, if it was not any one in the business, who had the effrontery to approach the Minister to ask him to put into operation this plenary and absolute power which he declares that he possesses, I should like to know who it was.",25
150,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"What I say is that I think that, technically, I have the power, but that I think it was not intended that I should have it, and that I will not use it.",25
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is a pity that the honourable gentleman mentioned the matter, if he was not prepared to tell us who tried to "" pull his leg"" on the occasion referred to.",25
152,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I told the honour the able member a good deal.,25
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Speakin g of ' the the Standard Oil Trust, the Minister said except through the Customs, that, to a large extent, it was beyond our control, because it had been organized the United States. How do the operations of the Standard Oil Company have inmatter jurious effects upon Australia? The Minthe ister does not know, he could not tell All he has heard is that there is a company organized here with ^600,000 or ^700,000, which is going to make o i l .",25
154,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"This morning I received a letter saying that the capital is ^800,000 nominal.",25
155,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does the honourable member act in this way upon the statements of interested parties?,25
156,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is not the statement of interested parties, but a fact. member for Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I know that it is a fact.",25
157,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,1 think that the honourable member knows all about it .,25
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I know-in fact, every one knows that there is such a company; but I have yet to learn that the honourable gentleman is supposed to act in this way at uie instance of an interested party, and at the same time decline to taike any advice which an impartial Commission in the might give him.",25
159,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That company has makes never mentoned to me the subject of the Tariff or anything else. I saw the manager only once, and he was brought to me by another person.",25
160,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I suggest nothing wrong. The point I was going to make was that foreign trusts can only affect us by their exports to Australia. I hope that we are not setting up the idea that we can chase them out of America as well as Australia. I know that this Government, like the empirical political quacks that they are, have already taken a hand in the government of the whole world. For instance, they have had a try in the government of Ireland and Natal, and are proceeding to take a hand in the government of the United States. ' I suppose the.y are going to fix matters up over there.",25
161,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What has this to do with the Bill?,25
162,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"All this is in answer to the Minister's chief, who declared that we have nothing to do with inquiries of the Tariff Commission so far as this Bill is concerned. How can-, operations of foreign trusts affect us. exceptthrough the trading and industrial channelsin of the community? Anything which has; to do withimports or exports is, I hold, 'a. peculiarly within the province of Tariff Commission, and, therefore, weus. Ought to await their report before we- push this Bill through. Then, with re-gard to that Massey-Harris combine, the Minister makes this statementThe trust, which is at present trying to grasp our trade and destroy our manufactures, sent us agricultural machinery valued at upwards of £250,000. Ought not these trusts to be heard in their own defence, and by a properly constituted and impartial tribunal? We do not ask that they should come here before the bar of the House. We have set up a tribunal, and invited them to go there, where both sides may be heard. If these trusts are destroying our trade and Ijeating out of Australia these important industries of ours, the Minister, if he could prove that, would come here with an overwhelming and triumphant position, which, instead of being open to challenge, would point to a grave national emergency, calling at once for treatment at the hands of the whole Chamber. why does he not wait until he gets the report of the Tariff Commission? Why does he not wait until both sides of the question have been heard ? And when both parties to the issue have presented all the facts which are already within their knowledge and purview, then let us decide impartially between them here, as we have a right to do, and as we would the in a position to do. But no; one side only must be heard in justification of this Bill . is to be pushed through the House just when the impartial Tariff Commission is to present its report. A more outrageous proceeding could scarcely be imagined. But that is all of a piece with what this Government has been trying to do ever since they got into power. What I complain of is that the Minister of Trade and Customs quotes only so much of the information which the Tariff Commission has gathered as suits his purpose; that being a purely protective purpose, and not bearing specifically on the question of the repression of destructive monopolies. From another consideration there is no particular hurrv in this matter. All the information available to us in the public prints is of the rosiest possible character. For instance, we were told by the Premier of Victoria the other day that there never was such a tide of shining prosperity as exists just now in this State. Ever since he took office, he tells us that Providence has been smiling upon him, that even' industry is flourishing, that the revenue chest is full to overflowing, and' that his great trouble is to know what to do with his surplus. In corroboration of that statement, I should like to refer to a leaderette which appeared in the Age of Friday last, and which is most interesting reading. It contains some statements which I should like to place on record in Hansard, because they throw a very curious light upon the fierce fiscal propaganda which that newspaper is constantly waging with so much, effect, at any rate in Victoria. In one breath the Age tells us that unless we can get some relief from the Tariff Commission, the industrial 'life of Victoria is threatened' with collapse, with all the dire consequences of the evils which this Bill is designed to prevent. But on Friday last-in a burst of candour, and in connection with quite another matter-the Age throws a curious side-light on all these doleful and bale- 1 f u l prophecies which it has uttered so many times recently. Writing on Friday last, in reply to Messrs. Mann and Fleming, who But had alleged that "" there were nb fewer than 5,000 men in this city able and willing to work who cannot find employment ""- a deplorable condition of things, if true-the . Age goes on to sayThat is a most serious statement.. If it were capable of being .substantiated, the prosperity on which we have been priding ourselves of late would be proved a hollow sham, and we should then have occasion to doubt the accuracy of the statistics jecently published concerning our It expanding trade. The Customs returns show that for the first five ""months of this year our oversea agricultural exports have increased by 159,000, compared with the corresponding period of 1905. I suppose that this will be called dumping by the Minister. If so, it is dumping of the kind which the farmer of Victoria certainly is fond of. It means lhat he is prospering. His crops are growing, therefore he must purchase more machinery with which to reap and garner them. The wheat yield for the past season - has been estimated at 24,000,000 bushels-a n average of more than twelve bushels to the acre. Here I pause to make one comment only. When conducting his vigorous protectionist campaign in Sydney the other day, the Prime Minister referred to the great prosperity which had come over Australia just now, and, his "" eye in a fine frenzy rolling,"" said, "" if the Tariff, so far, has done all this for vou, what will an increase do for you?""",25
163,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Hear , hear! that is right.",26
164,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Is the honourable member so far lost in the fogs of economic doubt and prejudice as to really make the statement that because the skies are kindly and the rains descend' in plenitude, that is the result of protection ?",26
165,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,No ; my honourable friend is doing that.,27
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No ; that is the statement of the honourable member, because he is claiming all the credit of our good seasons for this protectionist Tariff.",27
167,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No ; it is the Age>article which is doing that, and the honourable member is misinterpreting it .",27
168,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The article proceeds as follows:- And at the same time, notwithstanding our steadily increasing populationI do not know where the population of V toria is steadily increasing.",27
169,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes , it is.",27

If the tide has turned in Victoria, I for one am delighted Tariff. to hear it And at the same time, notwithstanding steadily increasing population, our general imports from abroad have notably diminished. These figures testify that in every department our industrial life we are forging ahead. agriculturists are thriving, and our manufacturers, despite the handicaps they have at present lo fight in the shap.e of ineffective protecnot tion, foreign trust competition, and many lamentable holes in our tariff fence, are ginning to overtake and supply the wants the people with the products of Australian labour.

This is in the State which is supappointed' posed to be "" h it "" by this Tariff, and to matters. be clamouring; night and day for fiscal sures to prevent industrial collapse. Yet the Melbourne Age goes on to say that the manufactures of Australia, and particularly of Victoria, for that is the State of which the newspaper is speaking are beginning to overtake and supply the wants of the people with the products of Australian labour. All this means, if it means anything at all , that our labour market is in a flourishing condition. We shall perhaps hear tomorrow or a week hence of people starving for the want of a more effective TariffCrops do not plant nor gather themselves; neither do the boots we wear, and the various articles we use in our daily life, shape them-selves of their..owru volition. The newspaper article proceeds- . Yet, although we are now producing at a rateI ask attention to thisYet, although we are now producing at a rate in excess of all past precedent, we are asked to believe that we have more unemployed in the city today than ever. Public prosperity does not reveal itself only in statistics. It is quite apparent that we are a prosperous people. ln many parts of the country there is a call for unskilled labour, which halts to be satisfied. Almost all our trades are flourishing, and the demand for skilled workmen is at least equal to the available supply. This is a most important statement, as coming from the great protectionist panjandrum",27
171,Mr KENNEDY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It is not evidence of i c ruin from past legislation in Victoria. :,27
172,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is not evidence of ruin from the present so-called imperfect Tariff, as the honourable member very often called it in this Chamber. Mf. KENNEDY - I have never said so.",27
173,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We desire a better,27
174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In view of the our statements of the Premier of Victoria, and of this great protectionist newspaper, and of in view of Victorian statistics, which show Our a trade expanding to the extent of £2,000,000 in manufactures, we ought to have this prohibitive protection sprung upon us without inquiry, and withbeout the knowledge which the report of the of Tariff Commission will make available to us. That, I think, is a fair attitude to take up, whether a mari be a free-trader or A protectionist, in my judgment, should be the first to welcome report of the Commission, which was specially to inquire into Tariff But it seems as if the protecmeationists in this House, or some of them at any rate, only desired the Commission when they could not get anything more effective or more drastic, sudden and peremptory, at the hands of the Minister who presides over this important Department. All we are asking for at the present time is postponement, and I venture to say that one speech alone, which we heard in this House last Friday, is sufficient warranty for delaying the matter to some extent. I refer to the honourable member for Mernda, who, in the course of a two hours' address, presented, in my iudgment, an unanswerable argument for delay and further inquiry. First of all, the honourable member for Mernda went into the historicity of the question.",27
175,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Where did the honourable member get that word? Mr JOSE PH COOK - The Minister of Trade and Customs laughs at a common word. I shall be glad to substitute another, in order to accommodate the honourable gentleman if he does not understand the word "" historicity,"" and say that the honourable member for Mernda went into the history of this matter, and showed that there are conditions'operating as buttresses to those foreign trusts, which conditions could not operate in Australia for the simple reason that those buttresses in Australia are in the control and ownership of the people as a whole. If , therefore, the means of transportation in America supply the chief buttresses of the trusts, such results are not possible in Australia, because all our means of transportation were nationalized long ago. Moreover, the honourable membei* for Mernda, as a trader and manufacturer, spoke from the inside of this matter, and was able to present an argument showing that, so far as the Bill is concerned, we ought to wait for further enlightenment-for further knowledge such as the Tariff Commission can present to us. Tliere ought to be some reply from the Government bench to a speech of that kind from a man who owes the Government allegiance, who, while telling Ministers that he speaks in the most friendly way, at the same time delivered one of the most crushing indictments against a Government measure that has been heard for-many a long day within this Parliament. There were some attempts at interjection on the part of the Attorney-General when the honourable member for Mernda was speaking, but these did not in way affect the soliditv and force of the argument which was presented by that honourable member.",28
176,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And other honourable members.,28
177,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I am referring to the honourable member for Mernda because he declared himself to be a supporter of the Government. I am not singling the honourable member out as on this side of the House; because he took special pains to make it clear that he spoke in a friendly way and as a supporter of the Government. . Mr Wilks - And as a protectionist as well.,28
178,Mr TOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am not trving to emphasize the protectionist aspect of the matter. The protectionists in this House ought in my opinion to be the loudest in their demand for the production of the report of the Tariff Commission. If they believe that the report will be fair and impartial, surely they of all other people ought not to be impatient to rush a measure of this kind. Surely they can wait a fortnight for valuable evidence with which to buttress their case. I do not understand this red-hot haste on the part of the Government, and of some of their protectionist supporters, to rush this legislation before the Tariff Commission has had time to make its report. I ask again, is this matter more urgent than the Tariff report itself? Admittedly our industries are flourishing, and are not being menaced by foreign depredations.",28
179,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Does the honourable member say that our iron industries are flourishing ? Sir ' WILLIAM LYNE - No , they are not.",28
180,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,There are hundreds of men out of employment in those industries.,28
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"All I have to say is that, if our iron industries are not nourishing, the Tariff Commission will show that to be the case in a fortnight's time. If there are hundreds of men out of employment in the iron trades, we shalt have proof of the fact shortly from an authoritative quarter. The Tariff Commission has inquired all over Australia into the iron industry, and has collected and collated every fact' connected with its. operations. Therefore, if the honourable member for Melbourne Ports believes that there is a case for further dealing with the iron industry, he ought to be the very first to hail this knowledge, and wait itsadvent in this House, rather than rush themeasure through in its absence. by many Mr Mauger - I want this Bill, plus the highest Tariff I can get.",28
182,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I should imagine that the man who desires ultra-protection-wh o wants prohibitive protection, to put it plainly-o r the highest Tariff hecan get",28
183,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"We will not get that, of course.",28
184,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not know that the honourable member will not get it. If one may judge from the empty benches, and. the interest taken in the matter on the Government side of the Chamber. I am not sure that the honourable member will not get what he desires-indeed , I am perfectlys certainhe will get it-that is, if this Bill goes through unaltered.",28
185,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I hope so.,29
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"This means possible prohibitive protection, so far as the iron and many other trades are concerned. Therefore, I say that even honourable members who wish to prohibit trade outside, except in some matters concerning our primary products-wh o desire to put a wall entirely around Australia, so far as our manufacturing is concerned - surely ought to be the first to await the result of the inquiry of the Tariff Commission, seeing that on that Commission there are ultraprotectionists who will supply all the knowledge which protectionists require to enable them to proceed with fairness, security, and industry in their quest for prohibitive duties.",29
187,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,There are no ultra-protectionists on the Tariff Commission.,29
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I fancy there are one or two, judging from the reports of the evidence from time to time. At any rate, we have often been told, in this House and out of it , that the great outstanding need of Victoria at the present moment is a rectification of Tariff anomalies. Reports concerning these anomalies have already lain on the table of the House for three weeks, and vet no move has been made concerning them. There are other reports in course of presentation; but all the reports, it seemsi, are to be set aside for use at some future date. This is trifling with the people outside, who believe that the Government are in earnest in the matter, amd that, having the power. Ministers will deal with anomalies at the earliest possible moment. The Government have the power, and they have the reports, but instead of proceeding in a matter as to which they have knowledge, they insist on thrusting in front this Bill , which does not affect our industries at the momentwhich does not affect any industry that is supposed to be in a state of collapse because of inefficient and ineffective protection, but which has to do with some menace that mav arise at some future time to some of our industries. The Government are playing a politically dishonest part to the people, to whom they have preached on every platform that at the very earliest moment they will deal, and, if possible, rectifv Tariff anomalies. What is to be said of such conduct in the light of the pledges given by the members of the Government to their constituents at the last election? This is, after all, the Bill final tribunal to which all these matters must be referred. The Government and their supporters have a responsibility to their constituents, to whom they gave the solemn pledge at the last election that they would not in this Parliament - enter upon any drastic Tariff legislation. Fiscal peace was their election cry-""peac e for the trades that had already been so much upset by the Tariff.",29
189,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That was three years ago.,29
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Does a pledge become any the less a pledge because it is a year or so old ? May honourable members break pledges at the end of one or two years? The honourable member for Melbourne Ports, I know, laid djbwn that strange doctrine in the House last year, when he said that those promises were better broken. Nothing can absolve a Ministry, which controls the .situation, and the electoral machinery, from keeping their solemn pledge to the people of Australia at the last election that they would not indulge in the Tariff tinkering in which we now see them actively engaged. This is not so much a matter of the Tariff as a matter of public honestya matter of public pledge, and of public statement by those who are supposed to set an example to the rest of the people of Australia. What has happened during the last eighteen months? After telling the people that there would be a rest from Tariff interference the Government have ever since been actively engaged, both administratively and by indirect legislation, iri re-opening the matter. Their object is to get further power into' their own hands, to be twisted for fiscal purposes and ends. That is going behind the backs of the people, and sneaking in a Tariff.",29
191,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Who has been doing what the honourable member complains of ?,29
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable gentleman, for one. Ever since he has been in office he has been trying to twist its control for fiscal purposes, both by his administration and by the legislation which he has attempted to put through Parliament.",29
193,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I have not twisted the control of the Department, so far as administration is concerned, and the intraduction of legislation cannot properly be termed twisting.",29
194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member has dealt with many matters from the fiscal point of view, instead of impartially. If the Bill is passed into law, another Tariff will not be needed, because the Government will have a means of enforcing prohibitive protection.",30
195,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Yet the honourable labour. member is going to vote for the measure.,30
196,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"A m I ? The tection honourable member will know all about that competition when we come to deal with the Bill. As protectionist of the Tariff does not concern him, he need - not go to. the trouble of making interjecvides tions. The party to which he belongs tions, thinks so little of a prohibitive Tariff that true its members are"" never in the Chamber, and gives Object take not the slightest interest in this legislation. That is what comes of solidarity tion. a - of being tied down to certain planks of Parliament one a platform, and - caring nothing about anygaze, we are asked' thing else.",30
197,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The members of the Labour Party have a free hand in dealing with the fiscal question.,30
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"A free hand to hibition, let it alone, and ignore it.",30
199,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We shall not let alone.,30
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am at a loss decent to understand how the Prime Minister will be able to go back to his constituents after thi,g Bill becomes law, seeing that he defiday nitely pledged himself to a policy of fiscal night's time. peace, and the measure makes all further Tariff legislation unnecessary. I afraid, however, that he long ago learned to regard his electioneering pledges lightly. We have had too much evidence of that during the past eighteen months. Many the provisions of the Bill permit hibitive protection.",30

214,Mr FULLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I do not know about that.,30
215,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I assume that the Commissioners will deal with this matter in a business-like way, and I think that should be able to settle the harvester question within a week.

216,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Lang) [4.8] - I wish give a few reasons in support of the amendhas ment of the honourable member for Dalley, postponing the further consideration of the Bill until the reports of the Tariff Commission are before us. That Commisi sion was appointed to inquire into the allegations that Australian industries are being injured by foreign competition, and, up to the present time, its inquiry has cost the country something like £ 1 2 , 0 0 0. Does the Government intend that that money shall be wasted, as it will be wasted i deal with a measure whose raison d'etre is the allegations to which I have referred, before the evidence of the Commission availaible to us ? It is only by perusing reports of the Commission that we can ascertain the actual conditions of the in a profit -, dustries which we have been informed are languishing, particularly in Victoria. At the present time we have only statements of the manufacturers and their political representatives in this Chamber. But the object of the Commission was to obtain evidence from every available source, so that Parliament might be placed in . possession of reliable data upon which to form an opinion as to whether or not legislation was necesexport. sary to improve our industrial conditions. facts have been adduced to show that the proposed legislation is urgent, or to sublest I should be drawn into discussing stantiate the statements which have been made as to the existence of dumping. have heard a great deal about the injury flicted upon Australian industries by practice of dumping imported goods on this market, and selling them at prices lower than those charged for Australian made goods, and Ave are asked to believe one of the reasons actuating the Minister bringing forward legislation of this kind was the necessity for putting an end what he terms unfair competition. But, although he and other honourable members have alleged that dumping is largely resorted to in Australian markets, no instance of dumping has been brought forward to They have been challenged to bring forward such instances, but, up to the present time, we have not had before us a tittle of evidence as to the existence of dumping. We are asked to deal with the Bill as an urgent matter, whose consideration cannot be delayed for a week, or even for a day, because Australian industries are being destroyed by dumping, and yet, although the Minister has at his command all the sources of information to possessed by the Customs Department, he not been able to produce a tittle of evidence in support of the allegation that dumping exists. Therefore we are justified in believing that it does not exist. Even f it did exist, who would be injured by it? Certainly not those who would thereby be able to obtain goods more cheaply than they could otherwise obtain them. _ Dumping would certainly not injure the consumer of goods, whose interests the Bill professes to protect. If shiploads of goods were f we brought in and dumped upon our wharfs, and afterwards sold at ridiculously low prices, what harm would be done to those is who purchased the goods? Foreign manuthe facturers will not send their goods to this country unless by doing so they can make",31
217,Mr RONALD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is it not desirable to emthe interested ploy our own people?,31
218,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Our own people must be employed in some way or another in order to obtain the money necessary to pay for the goods which are imported, which would not be sent here if they could not be paid for. The goods which we import are paid for with the goods which we That, however, is an asNo pect of the subject with which I do not propose to deal further at the present time t the main question, and not the amendment. We But in my opinion, and in that of anyinbody who will take the trouble to think the for a moment, the practice of dumping to - eve n if it did exist-woul d confer, at any rate upon the poorer sections of the - community, a very decided advantage. If that it is to be prevented under a Bill of this in kind, a very great amount of hardship will be imposed upon this class of people, to who will thus be deprived of the opportunity of obtaining a great many things which, under the conditions that are alleged to exist at present, fhey will be able to secure. But, so far, no evidence of the existence of dumping has been furnished to this Chamber. The third reason why I object to proceeding with the discussion of the Bill at the present juncture is that popular opinion, so far as it has been ascertained by resolutions at meetings, and in other ways, is almost universally opposed .to the legislation which is contemplated.",31
219,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Where were the public meetings held?,32
220,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am speaking chiefly of organizations, and not of public meetings in the ordinary sense of the term. The opinion which has. been expressed by bodies representing those who are specially interested in the trade, industry, and commerce of the country is decidedly adverse to this measure. Indeed among the mercantile community generally, little short of consternation prevails in regard to it.. The only consolation, which these persons can find is based upon their profound belief that this Legislature could never do such a dastardly thing as to pass a measure of this character. They hold that it is impossible that an intelligent Legislature could carry it. That is the feeling which exists today- a feeling which has found expression in various resolutions by Chambers of Commerce, by Employers' Federations, and by other bodies both in this State and others. In this connection I pro-' pose to quote a resolution which was adopted by the Victorian Employers' Federation at a meeting which was held only a few nights ago. I propose to read the resolution which was passed by the Employers' Federation- a body which represents not only the emploj-ers, but the manufacturing, trading, transport, producing, and financial interests of Victoria. Honourable members must recognise that this organization is a thoroughly representative one, consisting as it does of persons who are engaged! in manufacture, and in financial operations. The resolution readsThat this Federation of Employers, representing the manufacturing, trading, and transport, producing, and nnancial interests of Victoria, protests against the passage of the Bill known as the Australian Preservation of Industries and Repression of Destructive Monopolies, on the ground that it mixes up two different questions, the preservation of Australian industries and the repression of destructive monopolies. In respect to the first title, we are as much interested in the maintenance of Australian industries-in fact more so-tha n any other organization in this community, and believe this is already provided for by the protectionist policy adopted by the Commonwealth. I should like to know what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has to say concerning that declaration by a body which is admittedly in a better position to express an opinion upon this subject, because of its own financial interests which are involved, than is any other body in Australia. The resolution continuesIn respect to the second title, the repression of destructive monopolies, we are as much earnestly opposed to the introduction of destructive monopolies, either from outside or in 0111 midst, as any other portion of the community, and even more so, as our interests lie against such combinations. We will strongly support any equitable measure brought in by Government-Stat e or Federal-whic h has their repression in view, but as business men we believe in the principle of "" live and let live,"" and are not prepared to unfairly handicap men in business, nor the producer or consumer, by supporting the clauses in the present Bill under the heading of "" prevention of dumping,"" for they are selfish and prejudicial to the best interests of the body politic, and appear to have been drawn by persons unacquainted wilh the details of business, and therefore unable to form a correct opinion of the outcome of sucb legislation. I am sorry that the Minister of Trade and Customs is not present to hear the opinion of this body regarding his fitness to deal with legislation of fhis character-a n opinion which, applies equally to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and other advocates of this pernicious measure. The resolution continuesWe, therefore, consider that the Bill should be placed in the hands of a Select Committee of the House, such committee to take the most exhaustive evidence on the whole matter, with a view to the Bill being dealt with on its merits as a non-party measure. That is the suggestion which emanates from a bodv of men in whose special interests this Bill is supposed to have been drawn. They affirm that it is a - destructive measure, that it is not necessary, and that, instead of benefiting them, it will inflict serious injury upon their trade. Tbey even go so far as to say that those who are responsible for its drafting cannot be conversant with the ordinary principles which govern trade and manufacture. They practically tell the Minister and those who support him that fhey are attempting to do something the nature Of which they do not understand, and with which they are not competent to deal. I thoroughly endorse that expression of opinion. I say that the less we as a Legislature interfere with the trading and manufacturing concerns of the community the better it will be for everybody. That is another reason why we should defer the consideration of this Bill . When we see an important and influential body like the Victorian Employers' Federation denouncing the measure, affirming that its pro-' visions are tyrannical and unjust, and that its operations will be productive only of disaster to the commercial and manufacturing interests, as well as to those of the community generally, I think we have a right to attach some weight to their expressions of opinion.  able member alluding?",32
221,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am speaking of the Victorian Employers' Federation, in whose special interests this Bill is supposed to be brought forward.  of progressive legislation that is introduced.",33
222,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I quite agree with the honourable member that there are occasions when bodies of employers howl without just cause. But there are other occasions when they have just reason to complain, and this is one of them.  ever read the fable of the boy and the wolf ?",33
223,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not hold a brief for the Employers' Federation, and, as a rule, I have very little sympathy with organizations of that character, because I know that, under ordinary circumstances, they are very well able to take care of themselves, and that, if there were not some Members of Parliament, at any rate, who keep a close watch upon their operations, their tendency would often be in-the direction of tyranny and oppression. I freely recognise that, and I do not think that anybody will accuse me of holding a brief for an organization of that kind. In fact, my sympathies are all in the other direction, and my natural instincts are in favour of equal justice to all classes of. community. But when legislation of this character is brought forward, ostensibly to afford relief to the very people who are said to be suffering from unjust competition, whose capital is alleged to be endangered, and whose profits, it is asserted, are being unduly interfered with, and when - theif organization repudiates such statements by practically declaring that there is no foundation whatever for them, that its members do not want this legislation, I hold that the 'main ground upon which the Minister has rested his case for the introduction of the Bill has been absolutely cut from under his feet. That is my only reason for making the quotation which I have made. Another reason that I would urge in support of the amendment is that only the most pressing necessity should induce Parliament to confer upon the Minister the powers which it is proposed to vest in him under this Bill . Honourable members who have read its provisions know very well the drastic powers which it will confer upon him. They must recognise that, in its present form, it would give him absolute control over the whole of the trading, commercial, and manufacturing interests of the CommonAvealth. That portion of the measure which relates to' dumping would , practically .confer upon him absolute power to prohibit the importation of any goods if it could be shown that their importation in any Avay prejudiced the sale of the locally-manufactured article. This could be done on the plea that such goods Avere entering into unfair competition with locally-manufactured goods. Everything then would depend on what the '.Minister would consider to be unfair competition. The qualities of the respective goods Would not Aveigh in the determination of the matter. We know perfectly Avell that all successful competition by imported goods AA'ould probably be deemed to be unfair competition, because it Would naturally prejudice the sale of locally manufactured goods. That is to say, that people Would purchase imported goods AA'hen they could get a better class of goods at the same or a loAver price than they would have to pay for locally-manufactured goods. There Would then be successful competition by the imported good's, and the Minister, seeing the effect that that must have upon local production, could declare it to be unfair competition, and at once proceed' to prohibit the importation of those goods. the The immense power of prohibition conferred under this Bill upon the Minister of Trade and Customs is a very dangerous poAver to relegate to any man, and affords another reason why Parliament should hesitate to pass it. A further reason Avhy I support the amendment is, that it is notorious that the people at Avhose instigation the Bill has been intro'duced are making immense profits from their operations under the existing Tariff. When speaking on the motion for the second reading of the Bill a few days ago, 1 showed that various trades which I enumerated, and which have been specially mentioned in this Chamber as included in the category of languishing industries, are really in a most flourishing condition at the present time - In support of that I quoted the figures of the Chief Statistician here, and also the opinions given in newspaper interviews by representatives of leading manufacturing firms in Victoria. This went to show that, so far from legislation of this character being needed to preserve the local industries from 1 destruction', and to protect them from alleged dumping, those industries, as a matter of fact, are in a better condition at the present time under the existing Tariff than they ever were under the'old Victorian Tariff. They, moreover, now get a wider market as a result of Inter-State free-trade. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports interjected just now to the effect that industries in the iron trade were suffering. It is quite true that for a certain period those industries did suffer in Victoria under the old Victorian Tariff. They went down in the period between 1890 and 1894, with each sue-, ceeding year a greater falling off, but since the Federal Tariff has been in operation those industries have wonderfullv revived, ancl. according to Mr Harrison Ord, .1 steadv improvement has taken place in all of them. To refresh the memories of honourable members on this point, I may perhaps be permitted to repeat a quotation given in a former speech, whjch will show that legislation of this character is not necessary, and that, at any rate, itought to be delaved until we have the report of the Tariff Commission before us, and are able to judge whether they have secured evidence which will substantiate the claims as to the necessity for, and urgency of, this legislation. I find the following statements made in connection with the operations of Thompson and Comoanv. a large engineering firm, whose works are at Castlemaine: One of the marked features of the trade since the financial crisis of 1893, which sealed the doom of the over-capitalized and badly managed concerns, has been the increase in number, both in Melbourne and country centres, of small, well-managed undertakings, and the remarkable rise of two or three of the larger enterprises in th: provinces, notably Messrs. Thompson and Co.'s engineering works at Castlemaine.",33
224,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"What is the honourable member quoting from? Mr.i JOHNSON - I am repeating a quotation which I have already given, but which apparently has escaped the attention of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports.",34
225,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,At what date was thac statement made ?,34
226,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,On the 8th November last.,34
227,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,To whom?,34
228,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,To an interviewer representing the Argus newspaper.,34
229,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Le t the honourable member interview their men, and hear what they say.",34
230,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"We are told that the trades are sinking; that the men whose capital is invested in these undertakings are suffering injury as the result of unlimited importations, and that it is to preserve to these mien the capital they have invested in these industries and prevent their profits from being diminished, that such legislation as that now before us is necessary. When we have these men themselves coming forward and saying that their industries are in a prosperous condition, that their profits are not being diminished, but, on the contrary, are on the increase, we have a right to consider their statements, and to put them forward as evidence in rebuttal of what is said by honourable members who desire to press forward this legislation with such unseemly haste.",34
231,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The statement quoted by the honourable member is that of the head of a free-trade firm, who pay is. per day less than other firms in the same line of business.",34
232,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am not prepared to accept any statement of that character coming from the honourable member as being absolutely correct, but there are other firms who have corroborated what Messrs. Thompson and Company have said. Perhaps the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will say that they are all free traders. Whether they are free-traders or not, they are men who are enjoying the benefits of the existing Federal Tariff, and whose industries are admittedly progressing better under that Tariff than they did under the old Victorian Tariff, which imposed higher duties. To proceed with the quotationand Messrs. A. Roberts ancl .Sons at Bendigo. It is like a whiff of wholesome country air to learn at first hand what these firms are doing. Messrs'. Thompson and Company have 300 hands engaged.",34
233,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Not now.,35
234,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"This statement was made last November, and I should be very much surprised to learn that there is any very serious diminution in the number of hands engaged By Messrs. Thompson and Company, whilst we know there has since been no alteration of the Tariff.",35
235,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Le t the honourable member ring them up and ask.,35
236,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I ' am not able to leave the Chamber at the present time 'to do what the honourable member suggests. The quotation proceedsMessrs. Thompson and Company have 300 hand,? engaged; they are working night and dav, and orders are coming in just as fast as they can be profitably dealt with. As affecting the alleged necessity for this measure,- that is a most damaging statement from one of the firms in whose special interest it is supposed to be designed. Thompson went on to sayWe specialize on mining machinery and pumps; but do other work as well. vears we have secured the tenders for the railway points and plates used 'throughout the State. At present nothing is being done in this line, but it will come again. In the meantime we have plenty of other work to engage our attention. We receive orders from all the olher States of the Commonwealth. Borneo and other Eastern countries send us orders. The Federal Tariff has not injured us. On the contrary the freeing of Inter-State trade fio m restrictions has been a gain. little faith in Tariff assistance. view we take is that if we cannot compete against all comers there will be no strength or stability in our trade. I am sorry that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is not now present to listen to this statement:Our enterprise began twenty-eight years ago with eight men in a little shantv. The works now cover five acres, and we still want room. We employ 300 persons, and we are kept full y employed year after year. Our trade is ing all the time. We have kept up to date in methods, tools, and appliances. track runs into the works. We generate the electricity for lighting; compressed air is used in working cranes, tools, ancl appliances all over the place. No detail which will cheapen production is overlooked.",35
237,Mr JLONSDALE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is wrong.,35
238,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes . Under the latest proposed legislation they will not be able to import these latest appliances, but will 'have to continue the use of obsolete machines, lest they be mulct under drastic regulations, framed by the Minister of Trade and Customs, under the measure proposed. Mr Thompson further saidOur men, too, grow up with the business, and give us no trouble. There is not the unrest and agitation which appear to exist in large centres, and this is a great gain, both to employers and employees, in important enterprises. It will' be seen from that statement, which isi borne out by similar statements made by the representatives of other large engineering firms, that, so far from these industries being in such a condition as to require that special legislatiqn should be passed in a desperate hurry for their relief, to prevent the diminution of the profits of those conducting them, or avert their entire destruction, they are in a most flourishing condition, are growing, and are increasingly prosperous every year. Another reason why I support the amendment is that the indecent haste displayed in trying to force this measure through before the Tariff Commission's reports are presented, indicates that the Minister in Mr. charge of the Bill fears that those reports will idisclose the fact that there is no necessity for such legislation. The honorFor many able gentleman's action in trying to force this legislation through with such indecent haste, and on an unwilling country, will give rise to the gravest suspicions that this measure, to further enrich men who are Even already reaping rich harvests from Tariff barriers that hamper competition, must have some other reason behind it that has We put not been disclosed, and perhaps will not The point of bear the light of day. The Minister cannot well complain if the public are inclined to take a very suspicious view of his action in the circumstances, because such a view would be justified by the fact that the honourable gentleman has not attempted to give any tangible reason for the introduction of such legislation. Still less has he attempted any justification for pushing it forward with undue growhaste in the face of all the objections urged against it , inside and outside of The railway the House, by representatives of the people, and by those who will be speciallv interfered with by the measure. My final objection to dealing with this Bill at the present time isi because of the disastrous effects that legislation of this kind will have upon the great masses of the community so far as it affects the purchasing power of their earnings. Anybody who has studied the Bill must realise that regulations framed under it would in the hands of a Minister who was so disposedand I make nq special reference to the present Minister of Trade and Customs in .this connection, but to any Minister who might have very strong leanings in a certain direction - entail immense hardships upon, that very section of the community which those honourable members who profess specially to represent labour should endeavour to protect. similar measure was introduced last session many of them opposed it, and did so rightly, because of the damaging effect it would have upon the poorei paid classes. But now we find them making a volte face for no apparent reason, and showing a disposition to swallow this legislation. The Bill will destroy the chance of working people obtaining bargains at the half-yearly sales for the purpose of clothing themselves and their families. Under this Bill, to hold such a periodical clearance sale, may be made an offence punishable by heavyfine or imprisonment. It is well known that at such sales prices are often reduced far below the ordinary market rates, and when they are so reduced the goods must necessarily come into competition! with others which are sold at normal prices. Therefore, I oppose this Bill because its operation will have a most injurious and disastrous effect upon the great wage-earning community, will materially lower the value of their wages, and will lessen their purchasing power by compelling them to pay a higher price for goods. This is one of the most iniquitous proposals that has ever been submitted to this or any other Parliament, and it is marvellous, to my mind, that indignation meetings have not been held from one end of the country to the other in. protest against it. I can but surmise that the reason why, that course has not heen taken is that the people have failed to grasp the true significance of the measure. Many of them, unfortunately, are even ignorant that legislation of the kind is being considered by the Federal Parliament. Even when one talks to men in business, and tells them about the provisions of this Bill , they do not believe that such' a thing can be proposed. They do not believe that any Minister or any Government would dare-that-is the word which many of them use-to introduce such legislation, or that Parliament would carry it into effect. And yet this Parliament is at the very moment asked to pass such legislation by the Government of the day. In the face of the evidence of public condemnation which, so far as we have been able to gather, has been manifested wherever the Bill has'been considered, I contend that it ought not to be proceeded with ar this stage. I , for one, shall therefore heartily support the amendment of the honourable member for Dalley.",35
239,Mr LONSDALE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"New England) When a [4.50] - I also support the amendment of the honourable member for Dalley, because I do not tliink that we ought to legislate upon this and kindred subjects until we have the fullest information placed before us. There is no need to legislate in a panic. The report of the Tariff Commission will soon be brought before us, and it is very much better to wait until we can study the evidence. The Minister himself, who is supposed to have looked up all the questions concerned with the Bill , exposed his want of knowledge-indeed , he showed his absolute i'gnorance of many matters about which he spoke. He spoke with an absolute recklessness as to whether his statements were true or false, on some important points. For instance, he referred to the Massey-Harris Company - as being an offshoot of the American Steel Trust. That statement. I challenge at once. The MasseyHarris Company is no off-shoot of the Steel Trust. If I am aslked for my authority for that statement, I can give it. I have no doubt that the allegation has been contradicted in the evidence Ijefore the Tariff Commission. That affords another reason why we should not proceed to legislate upon these false lines. How can we rely upon the statements made by the Minister in introducing this Bill , when we find, on testing some of the most important of them, that they are quite incorrect? The Minister also referred to the International Harvester Company as being in conjunction with the Steel Trust. Now, the International is an American Company, but it has always been in opposition to the Steel Trust. At the present time, it is erecting larger works at Chicago, for the express purpose of fighting the trust. It stands not as a part of the Steel Trust, but absolutely as a competing force. Yet, we are called upon to legislate because we.are told that the International Company is in alliance with the octopus Steel Trust of the United States ! I have gleaned some useful information on this subject from an American publication called The Farm Implement News, of which I happened to get a copy the other day. It contains an article which states that never on any occasion has the. International Harvester Company had any connection by agreement or otherwise with the Steel Trust, - but has always been in competition with it, and is at present extending its works for the express purpose of increasing its competition in other directions. We ought to have the evidence taken before the Tariff Commission in our hands before we legislate, in order that we may test the statements of the Minister from the sworn evidence of witnesses. Speaking with regard to sub-clause 2 of clause 14, under which persons are prevented from giving large commissibns to agents, the Minister quoted the wordsI f the person importing or selling the imported goods directly or indirectly gives to agents or to intermediaries disproportionately large reward or remuneration for selling or recommending the goodsThereupon the honourable member for Corinella interiectedDisproportionately with what? And the Minister repliedThat means beyond the ordinary tiade charges. It has been clearly and repeatedly exemplified in the case of the Massey-Harris Company and the International Harvester Company. It has been stated that in pushing the machines, commissions to the extent of some £26 and £30 have been given for selling single harvesters, which it. has been said only cost £40 each. That statement is not correct. I will not use a stronger term, because it would be unparliamentary, but I repeat that it is not correct. The chairman of the Tariff Commission was present, and interjectedThey amounted to 26 per cent, on the selling price. That statement. I also challenge. I venture to say that if the evidence taken by the Tariff Commission were before us, it could be proved from it that neither the statement of the Minister of Trade and Customs nor that of the Chairman of the Tariff Commission was accurate. We have no right to legislate on statements of this kind. The evidence will show that the 26 per cent, includes the whole of the distributing charges, and not merely the commission, which amounts to about £6 per machine. I will not sav that the statements I have quoted were made for the purpose of misleading the House, but still they were misleading, even if made honestly. Ought we, on the basis of such misleading remarks, Mr Lonsdale-. to pass legislation of this drastic character without waiting for the sworn evidence of witnesses to be placed before us? The statement of Mr Coxon was alluded to. He is, no doubt, an honourable man, a man .of the highest repute. No one questions that. He said, in his affidavit which was qubted, that he had 'been told by the International Harvester Company's agent .that the company meant to crush out ' Mr MCKay and the other local makers. But what commercial traveller does not make statements of that kind? What traveller does not talk about his firm crushing out its rivals? Even if a representative of the International Company did make such a statement, are we going to legislate upon such a basis ? Is all the legislative machinery of this. Parliament to be put in force upon the statement of a commercial traveller in pushing his business? Just imagine that this Parliament, which we were assured' was going to attain to a higher plane than the Sta,te Parliaments have done-whic h was to lift the public life of this country into a nobler and serener atmosphere-shoul d be considering a Bill introduced simply in the interests of one or two firms? Are we, who are supposed to occupy these high and noble positions, to pass laws in the interests of a couple of manufacturers? If local firms are being injured by the importations of harvesters and other machinery, if the price is being kept down by them, then, of necessity* that injury is a benefit to the great bulk of the community. But the local manufacturers are not being injured. I have looked atpart of the evidence which has been issued to us by the Tariff Commission, and I give an absolute denial to the Minister's statement that the local manufacturers are being injured by foreign companies. I am not here to advocate any man's business. It is an outrage that any one should come here to try to bolster up or protect any business. Our duty is to safeguard the interests of the people as a whole. We are not sent here to seek to advance the interests of individual concerns or individual men. But the Minister is doing that. He stands here and makes statements, some being correct and others misleading, and I challenge him to give any proof which will be taken in a court of law that the local manufacturers of ""harvesters are being ruined by importations. According to the evidence which has been issued to us, these gentlemen have refused to let the Tariff Commission know, either confidentially or otherwise, what, their profits are. They have admitted, however, that they are doing better than they did before the Tariff was altered. They 'have admitted that their business has not gone back. That admission is quite enough to satisfy us that they are doing better than they did previously. If we examine the figures to whioh they have sworn, we must come to the conclusion that they are making a profit of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 a year. This is a sample of the strangled industries which the House is called upon to help by passing a Bill of this character. called upon to help men vvho are filling their pockets at the expense of the farmers, who are standing for high prices, who are not seeking to use the positions they have for the benefit of themselves and others, but who are seeking to destroy the competition which, stands between them and the crushing of the farmers to the fullest extent possible. We should receive the report of the evidence takeni by the Tariff Commission before we move one step in the direction advocated by the Minister. If the House is true to its dignity and power, it will tell Ministers that until that information is available it will not deal with the 'Bill. At the present time, in the shape of duty and importing charges, there is a difference of £ 2 0 per machine in favour of the local manufacturers. is enough protection for any business to have ! It is an absurdity to suggest that they cannot compete with outside manufacturers when they enjoy that large measure of protection. Right through, all this cry about injured industries has been simply absurd. Should we not have, before us the report of the Tariff Commission, so that we may learn whether dumping is an injury, and, if so, under what circumstances it is-in fact, whether there is any dumping done in the proper sense of the term? We may have a degree of dumping which reduces the price of an article, but which increases employment in the country where the dumping is done. know whether the Tariff Commission has taken up that aspect of the question, but, if not, it ought to deal with that and all other aspects of the subject. In the days when sugar was dumped into Great Britain at a cheap rate, and when there was am idea throughout the Kingdbm that the refining industry was being injured thereby, what happened? A Select [26] Committee was appointed to inquire into the matter, and they discovered' that the refineries were injured by the dumping. According to this Bill, cheap sugar should not be allowed to come in, because it would put men out of employment. But vvhat further happened in England? Not only were the great mass of the people benefited by the reduction in price, but in all the industries vvhich needed sugar as a basis, such as the confectionery, jam-making, and biscuit industries, three men went into employment for every one man who was put out of the refineries. Under the provisions of We 'are this Bill , however, that could not occur. We are practically asked to look after one industry, and let the other three suffer. There are circumstances when dumping, as it is called, is of the greatest advantage to the community. We cannot possibly deal-with this question on fair lines until we are in possession of the report of the Tariff Commission, and can learn the extent to which dumping has gone on, and whether it is an evil or not. My opinion is that no dumping is an evil. I should like people .to dump into my back yard everything I want. I certainly would not look upon the dumping as an evil. I really cannot understand men talking as they do about dumping.",36
240,Mr FRAZER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It would not matter about the honourable member's neighbours starvSurely that ing.,38
241,Mr LONSDALE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"My neighbours would not starve. The interjection shows how much the honourable member understands the economics of the question. We cannot get things for nothing. If people got things for nothing, they would' not want to work. We all try to do as little work as possible. Nobody wants to work any more than is necessary. I do not know a man in the community who does. If we could get all the comforts we needed without working, we should be quite prepared to accept the position. And if we want an article from another country, we I do not must employ our labour in producing the article which we are best able to produce, and exchanging it for the article we want. If one can ibuv a pair of trousers for the proceeds of half-a-dav's work, that is better than having to give the proceeds of a full day's work. When Mr Chamberlain succeeded in getting the Sugar Convention denounced, the price of sugar in England was raised. That mav have helped the sugar planters in the West .Indies, and the refiners of England. But what happened? There was an outcry that the confectionery and every other industry of that kind, had been injured, and that a large number of persons had been thrown out of employment because of the increase in the price of sugar. Under the provisions of this Bill, however, if an article came here at an increased price, it would not be touched; whereas in England the increase in the price of sugar put more men out of employment than did the reduction. If we are to legislate on the subject of trusts, let us legislate as men, and notbecause we have a sort of hatred against capital. If large aggregations of capital are injuring the communitv as a whole, then let us seek to regulate and control them, but let us.legislate in a proper spirit, and in the light of all the information which is available to us. From an address delivered by Mr Dos Passos before the Industrial Commission at Washington, I desire to quote a few extracts concerning the regulation of commercial trusts. In-his, address he quotes the following passage from Buckle: Every European Government which has legislated much respecting the loss of trade, has acted as if its main object were to suppress the trade and ruinthe traders. Instead of leaving the natural industry to take its own course, it has been troubled'by an interminable series of regulations, all intended for its good, and all inflicting serious harm. By their laws againlst usury they have increased usury. After reading that extract from Buckle, Mr Dos Passos addressed the Commission in these termsNot that I wish to see you go out of existence ; I would continue you and your successors for ever. A commission of inquiry is the instrumentality that stands between extravagant and demagogic demands, and good sensible business judgment and. the true interests of the people; it is the tribunal through which every question of currency or Inter-State commerce and other great public subjects should pass. Conclusions filtered through such a source must be based upon facts, and not speculations; and when laws are framed after such study, the people will not see any Sherman Anti-Trust Acts, or multitudes of other laws, unexecuted upon the statute books, and which make the law a byword and a reproach. The inability of courts to carry out such statutes, and give them effect, is because they are not based onl any reasonable or sensible principle of legislation. Nobody can read the speech of the Minister of Trade and Customs in moving the second reading of this Bill without realizing how much that statement applies to his assertions. His speech conMr Lonsdale. tains nothing which is reasonable or wise. It is marked by recklessness from begining to end. It contains scarcely any statement which cannot be challenged. Before we proceed with this measure, therefore, we should have the report of the Tariff Commission. Mr Dos Passos goes on to point out in his address how utterly futile in many cases is legislation directed against trusts. He says' The most notable example, however, of this species of legislation is to be found in this country, and it grew out of speculations in gold, which caused an enormous agitation and excitement in. Wall-street, as you, gentlemen, can remember from history, perhaps some of you personally. The effect and influence of the speculation in gold, it was thought, was so detrimental to the interests of this country, that Congress was invoked to pass a statute to prevent it, and it promptly did it ; it passed a law in 1864, in June of that year, which you will find, in the United States statutes, by which it was made a crime for persons to sell and deal in gold unless they were the owners of the coin. Now, what was the effect of that statute? So absolutely ineffectual, futile, and absurd was the legislation, that gold went up thirty points the next day, and fifteen days afterwards, by the same Congress, the .Act was repealed because it was regarded as being absolutely detrimental to the interests of the country. That is just the sort of panic legislation which the Government have introduced, and their reason is the great ruin which it is supposed will overtake us because of the reduction in the price of harvesters to farmers. The Government desire to keep prices up, and still further enrich certain rich manufacturers. It was, I believe, the Attorney-General who, a year ago, pleaded with the House, in the interests of poor people, who otherwise would not be able to satisfy their needs and obtain a Christmas dinner, to pass a measure of this kind before we separated. . But the fact is that we have at present everywhere in the Commonwealth greater prosperitv than we then had. Had we passed the Bill as we were asked to do, it doubtless would have been declared to be the cause of the prosperity. I regret that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is not within the Chamber, - because I wish to refer to the statement made by him, when the honourable member for Lang was speaking, that Messrsi. Thompson and Company are a free-trade firm, who pay their men a shilling a day less than is paid to the employees of other firms in the same line of business. I wish to tell the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that it is my intention to communicate on the matter with Messrs. Thompson and Company, because, in my opinion, a statement of fhat kind, if it be a slander, should not be allowed to go unchallenged in this House. I have heard extraordinary statements before from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and have challenged, and successfully challenged, them; and it is well that legislation of this kind should not be based on allegations which cannot be substantiated. The Minister of Trade and Customs, it will be remembered, has declared that he never interviewed any manufacturers in regard to the duties and the kind of legislation with, which we are now dealing. I interjected across the table that there had evidently been some statements made to the Minister in regard to duties; but the honourable gentleman declared that that was not so. When introducing the Bill, and speaking of the competition between the Standard Oil Company and an oil company in Australia, the Minister of Trade and Customs said that in New South WalesA company with a very large capital- I think that the nominal capital amounts to ^600,000 or ^700,000the Minister has since stated that the capital is £800,000is building a railway from near Clarence Siding to shale deposits some miles distant, at a cost of j£8o,ooo. The manager told me that, if the company were protected, he bad not the slightest doubt as to the success of their venture, as tliey have enough shale to last them for any reasonable time. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the Minister was approached, and that he has been approached from all directions by raen who want this kind of Bill. It is t the intention of the Minister to prevent the Standard Oil Trust from competing with shale oil manufacturers in Australia, 1 and doubtless he will call the competition unfair, because the American company hap* pens to possess natural oil wells. In the interests of that great bulk of the community who use kerosene, such a power ought not to be given into the hands of any Minister. No man should be in a position to prevent, at his own sweet will, the importation of commodities. The fact is, this Bill* is introduced for protective purposes entirely; and before we take one step further with a measure which is fraught with such important consequences, [26]- 2 and which enables a Minister to a large extent to prevent importation, we should have the clearest evidence, even though the report of the Tariff Commission does not arrive this session, as to the evils which are said to exist, but which, in my opinion, do not exist. I shall vote for the amendment; and if we cannot have evidence of the kind I have indicated before us, I shall, at any rate, endeavour to make the measure mucli less drastic than it is in its present form.",38
242,Mr R EDWARDS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Oxley) [5.23] Owing to the state of my health, I had decided not to speak on fhis Bill. I desire, however, to express regret that the Minister of Trade and Customs should have introduced, the measure before receiving the report of the Tariff Commission, which has visited every State, and taken evidence in many places-evidenc e which no doubt will be of great value when the question of the Tariff is before us. It is to be regretted, as I say, that the Minister is not prepared to' withdraw the Bill until we have the report of the Commission, especially in view of the statement made by the Chairman of the Commission this afternoon, when he gave us to understand that in three weeks, at the latest, that report will be laid on. the table of the House. Some very excellent speeches have been made both for and against the Bill, and some of the most excellent of the latter class have come from supporters of the Government. I am utterly opposed to this drastic measure, as one likely to interfere with the freedom of trade, commerce, and manufacturing within the Commonwealth. That is a very serious charge to make; but the .Bill is certainly not a measure for the preservation of Australian industries. The title of the Bill is not correct, and should be amended, seeing that the effect of the measure is more likely to be to destroy industries, and to drive capital from Australia. With such an Act on our statute-book, along with other restrictive legislation already passed by this Parliament, no man of. capital would dream of investing with the object of establishing new industries in Australia. It has been said over and over again by honourable members on the other side of the House that this Biil is in the best interests of the working people generally. My own opinion is that the working people will be the greatest sufferers under such legislation, seeing that it is bound to bring about less work and lower wages. Yet the great want of the country is more work for people who are willing to work. We are told by those who are supposed to know that there are no fewer than 5,000 adult working men unable to obtain work in Melbourne, and no doubt large numbers are out of employment in other Australian cities. Yet we do not find the Government introducing any legislation which might tend to increase employment. This is a matter which deserves the consideration of the Government very much in preference to measures of the kind before us. The Bill proposes to place immense power in the hands of the Minister of Trade and Customs. It is made an act of dishonesty for a business man to compete with imported goods, while a man may sell goods made in Australia at as IOAV a price as he likes. It is not right that such power and responsibility should be placed in the hands of any Minister. I do not mean to say for one moment that we cannot trust our Minister of Trade and Customs, but it is a mistake to confer such power by the Bill. As I have said, the present Minister is not likely to be tempted to do anything wrong, but the power is there, and we mav not have the present Minister in Office for all time. If the Bill were intended to deal with trusts only, it could be understood; because, no doubt, there is, and has been, a great deal of evil in connection with monopolies. But the present Bill is so framed as to' affect individual traders, and it is a very serious matter when the freedom of the subject is taken away-when a Bill is passed which so affects individual traders that they are not able to carry on business as ""they have hitherto done. The public will suffer from such legislation, because of the higher price which must be demanded for commodities if business men are to make their enterprises pay. If the Bill be passed, every business man. I imagine, will go about in fear and trembling of the Minister of Trade and Customs. Traps will be laid for business men, and they will always be getting into difficulties. One or two honourable members have mentioned this afternoon that it would not be possible for dealers in softtroods to hold the ha.lf-vea.rlv sales to which the nublic have become accustomed, and there will consequently be no bargains to be had. which will be a serious loss to manv housewives. In miv opinion, it is a very unfortunate thing flat this Bill has been introduced to interMr R. Edwards. fere with the business concerns of the people of the Commonwealth. It will not permit any person to buy cheaply in foreign markets, and to sell at low rates in this market the goods so purchased, because that would be regarded as unfair competition The Brisbane Daily Mail says that the definition of unfair competition contained in the Bill is little short of ridiculous. Competition is to be deemed unfair, if imported goods are being sold under circumstances that will probablv lead to either the withdrawal of Australian goods from the market, or their sale at a loss, unless produced at a lower remuneration; if the means adopted by the seller are "" in the opinion of the tribunal, unfair""; if the importer or seller is a commercial trust; if the competition would probably or does result in lower remuneration for labour; if it disorganizes Australian industry, or throws the workers out of employment; if the imported goods have been purchased in the country of production at a price lower than the ordinary cost of production or market price in that country ; if the goods are sold at a price which does not allow the importer a fair net profit; or if the importer or seller of imported goods gives to agents or intermediaries a disproportionately large reward or commission for selling or recommending the goods. My principal reason for rising was to place before the House a telegram which I received late last night. It was sent by an influential organization, the Associated Softgoods Warehousemen of Queensland, and is as follows:At a meeting of the Softgoods Warehousemen's Association held yesterday, jt was resolved to wire you as follows, that the Softgoods Warehousemen's Association of Queensland, whilst ini accord with legislation suppressing harmful trusts, both Australian and foreign, so far as they affect Australiarf industries, strongly object to such interference with trade as is provided for in the Bill entitled an Act for the Preservation of the Australian Industries, and for the Repression of Destructive Monopolies, considering the provisions of such Bill , as presented to Parliament, most inimical to merchants, workers, and consumers, particularly the latter, and further, consider that if the Bill is to become law it should be so altered as to provide safeguards against Inter-State as well as foreign: dumping, and also alterations should be made in the proposed judicial conditions, especially with respect to the powers conferred on the Minister and Comptroller-General by vesting jurisdiction in the Federal Court alone. GEO. S. HUTTON, Secretary Associated' Softgoods Warehousemen of Queensland. ! propose to support the amendment, urging, as other honourable members 'have done, the postponement of the consideration of the Bill until we have received the reports - of the Royal Commission on the Tariff. The delay which is asked for will be but short, and, in my opinion, those who are making the request for a postponement are asking only for what is fair and reasonable.",40
243,Mr CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Wilmot) [5.35] - A careful perusal of the Bill shows me that it is intended to achieve two objects-to prevent foreign competition with Australian manufacturers, and to prevent persons engaged in trade from injuring the Australian public. The second object ought to be considered the more important one; but it has been largely lost sight of by the Minister in his efforts to protect Australian manufacturers from the competition of foreigners. As a matter of fact, almost all those engaged in business in Australia from time to time enter into combines, which-, if the visions of the Bill were strictly enforced, would be illegal. Therefore, if the Bill is administered as the Minister apparently intends to administer it, injury will be done to Australian traders. For instance, the flour-millers periodically hold meetings, and enter into agreements to control and regulate the prices of flour. If these arrangements were prohibited, as the result of the passing of the. measure, while the buyers of flour might benefit in some cases by ithe lowering of prices, the farmers would! suffer, because flour-millers, not knowing what their competitors would give for wheat, would buy at as low a figure as fhey could, in order to protectthemselves against competition. Then, again, the banks periodically enter into agreements as to the rates to be paid for money deposited with them, and to be charged for money lent by them. A dying Parliament such as this is-becaus e we have now, only a few months of existence-shoul d not legislate on a subject of thisi kind, because the views of the electors are not known in regard to the matter. tainly, I have heard no demand from persons engaged in trade for such legislation as is proposed. Most of the clauses of the measure deal with foreign competition.. It seems to be generally admitted that the Government have been forced to introduce the Bill at the instigation of protectionists, and notably of Mr MCKay, a manufacturer of harvesters. The State, a constituency of which I represent, is not interested in this matter, because harvesters are not used there. . Therefore, I can take an unprejudiced view. It seems to me that we should hesitate before legislating at the instigation of a man who desires to prohibit foreign competition in order that he may obtain asi high a price as he can get for . his implements. The Minister of Trade and Customs, when moving the 6acond reading, referred to other combines. He spoke, for instance, of the Aus ' tralian shipping .combine, whioh may to some extent injure a section of the public, though, so far, there has been no demand for legislation to put an end to it. He also spoke of dealing with the Standard Oil Trust. In my opinion, however, it is absolutely impossible to legislate against the operations of that combine, because it has really no competitors producing oil of a quality equal to that sent here by it. We know that Russian oil is imported into pro- Australia, but it is not of a quality equal to that of the oil sent here by the Standard Oil Trust, being serviceable only for use in .connection with machinery. The Minister, however, told us that if it were possible to carry into effect the protection which he desires, a company would commence on a large scale to manufacture oil for lighting purposes from the extensive deposits of shale wihich exist in New South Wales. The honourable gentleman has been a Minister, except for a very short interval, ever since the first Federal Parliament was elected. He was a member of the Ministry which introduced the present Tariff, and allowed kerosene to be imported duty free. Why was he not prepared to give an opportunity to the shale company of which he speaks by imposing a duty of 3d. or 4d. a gallon upon oil, such as had been in force in most of the States? Or why does he not wait until the Tariff Commission's reports have been received, and then ask for such a duty ? As a matter of fact, he is simply humbugging us. The one object in his mind is to benefit the local manuCer- facturers of harvesters. We were told last session that the International Harvester Trust is ruining the Australian manufacturers of harvesters, and the object of the Minister in introducing the Bill is to protect the latter, to the injury of the users of harvesters throughout the Commonwealth. He has not the slightest intention of taking action against the Standard Oil combine, or against any other similar combination. That, at all events, is the logical deduction from his speech and his past actions. Part III. of the Bill deals with dumping, which, as I understand it, is the importation of goods in large quantities to be sold at low rates, to the injury of competitors. Dumping, however, is of great advantage to the community, in enabling purchasers to obtain their requirements in certain lines very much 'more cheaply than they buy them under ordinary circumstances. This House should not lose sight of the fact that there is more than one oompany in the world tioing business with Australia, and that whilst dumping operations might disastrously affect some local competitors, it would, undoubtedly, confer a benefit upon the consumers generally. Further, is more than one competitor in any given product, and ""if dumping were continued for any considerable period, the community as a whole would reap the benefit. can be no question of that. It is not unreasonable to say that at no - period in Australian history have we found the practice of dumping; injurious to the great majority of the people. I do think that we should hesitate before we assent to a Bill which - will have the effect of preventing in the future. During, the course of this debate, we have been repeatedly told that the operations of trusts are injurious to any community. It is a very curious circumstance that the principal trusts in the world are to be found in the greatest protective country in the world, namely, Seeing that these combinations are usually called into existence in protectionist countries, surely that should be an inducement to us-should we be called upon to reopen the Tariff-to reduce the duties at present operating as much as possible. also told the other night that in America some fifty-two Acts had been passed by various State Legislatures, for the purpose of dealing with trusts. But, despite all this legislation, there are more trusts in the United States today than there were prior to its enactment. Is not that very significant? All the restrictive legislation that has been passed there has been powerless to prevent the formation of trusts in America. The largest combinations in the world are to be found there. In this connection, I might instance the Standard Oil Trust, which is controlled by Mr Rockefeller, and the Meat Trust, which is controlled by MT. Armour. Those gigantic Mr Cameron. combinations are flourishing now quite as much as they did before the anti-trust Billswere passed into law. Under the circumstances, I earnestly implore honourable members to pause before they assent to theproposals of the Government. In the course of a very few months, the electorsof Australia will be afforded an opportunity of reviewing our work, and of approving, or otherwise, of the various measures which, have been submitted for our consideration. could I therefore appeal to honourable membersnot to place upon the statute-book what, to my mind, is a hasty and ill-conceived measure, and one which will not benefit the public, though it may be to the advantage of particular individuals.",42
244,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Wentworth) [5.50] - I there feel a certain amount of diffidence in approaching this question, as I have already dealt with the second portion of the Bill,, upon the motion for its second reading. There But since I last addressed myself to it , the honourable member for Dalley has taken up an attitude in regard to the measure which materially assists my position. When I discussed the Bill previously, I endeavoured 1 to draw the attention of honourable members to its extraordinary vague wording, and to dumping the curious want of clear definition of the terms used throughout it. I pointed out that although there were constant referencesin the measure to "" monopolies,"" nobody seemed to be absolutely sure what was intended to be conveyed by that term I showed that the combination which we have America. always regarded in Australia as an absolute monopoly- I refer to the tobacco monopoly - ha d been reported upon by a Royal Commission, composed chiefly of members of the Labour Party, in the following terms - as will be seen by reference tb page 8 of We were its report:We find that the Combine is a partial, but not a complete, monopoly. I ask members of the Labour Party whether they do not think that we should pause before passing a measure which isdesigned to deal with certain evils, but which we do not know will actually touch the abuses that we desire to regulate? I have already shown how vague and unmeaning, from my point of view, is thephrase "" restraint of trade,"" the arrangement of the terms "" producers, workers, and consumers,"" and also the phrase "" to the detriment of the public."" I now propose to advance additional reasons of a similar nature, which I hope will induce the Government to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Dalley. The Ministry are asking us to pass this measure - hastily.'",43
245,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It is panic legislation.,44
246,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is panic legislation, seeing that the House is actually unaware - of the meaning of the Bill in es.sential particulars. The criticisms which have been levelled against it from all sides of the House have been - of the strongest. The criticism of honourable members who are allegedly supporting .the Government clearly shows how badly - drawn the measure is, and how necessary it is> to radically amend it. Doubtless the Government will say: "" All this is true. The Bill does require amendment. Let us therefore hasten into Committee, where it can be amended."" My reply is that there has never been a Bill presented to any Parliament in Australia which has been .so carefully drafted with a view to resisting the possibility of amendments as bas this measure.",44
247,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It has been done designedly. It is the clever draftsmanship - of the Attorney-General.,44
248,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If that be so, I say that his clever draftsmanship is not in the best interests of this Assembly. When we get into Committee, and seek to embody in the Bill amendments which I think the House will endorse, we shall find it - almost impossible to give effect to them. The Attornev-General knows what curious shades of difference there are between the various clauses of the Bill, and how many - consequential amendments will be rendered necessary to give effect to any material alteration. The honourable and learned - gentleman no doubt thoroughly recognises the truth of what I am saying. He has probablv addressed himself to the. arrangement of the measure with all the legal - acumen and skill that he is known to pos-sess, with a view to rendering its amendment almost impossible. From the happy and conscious smile upon his face, I believe that my statement is accurate. Recognising that the Bill is deficient in all these particulars, and having regard to the very keen criticism to which it has been - subjected by all sections of the House, I hold that it is not right for us to go into Committee with undue haste, and that we - should refer the Bill back to the Ministry, with a request that they should present us with a measure which will be more reasonable and less destructive in its incidence. I wish now to ask the Government-and I see a very talented member of it occupying a seat at the table-wha t is the exact meaning of the word "" public'' in the phrase "" to the detriment of the public "" ? Does it mean the trade, or does it mean the consumer? It is only fair that I should receive a reply to such a simple question. Honourable members are invariably treated with courtesy by some Ministers, including the Minister of Home Affairs, and therefore I ask him what is the meaning of the phrase "" to the ""detriment of the public "" ? Does it mean to the detriment of the trade, or to the detriment of the consumer generally ? Seeing that the Minister refuses to vouchsafe a reply, I suppose that I must supply the answer myself. It must be obvious to honourable members that to read "" the public"" as ""the trade"" in this connection would mean relying entirely upon trade competitors as to when these provisions would be enforced. Therefore, I take it that the word ""public"" must mean the great Australian public, which constitutes the consumers.",44
249,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It means the great Australian ""bite,"" then.",44
250,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"My honourable friend is right. If restraint, of trade to the detriment of the public means restraint of trade to the detriment of the consumer, I think that all legitimate profits! will be covered by the phrase ""restraint of trade,"" because every shilling that a trader adds to the cost price of any article is to the detriment of the consumer. If every shilling that the trader adds to the cost of an article is to the detriment of the consumer, it must be "" in restraint of trade."" Therefore, I say that this phrase, as used in this Bill, covers any legitimate profit, however small and reasonable it may be. Knowing that this phrase may have this meaning, it will be admitted that it is so vaguely drawn, that I am justified in asking the Ministry to accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Dalley, and take the measure back for further consideration. We shall be told, in answer to what I have just putbefore honourable members, that 1 there must be an agreement between persons to fix profits before any question of illegality can arise. This means practically that bankers will be unable to arrange the rates of overdrafts, exchange, and discount. These are points I wish to commend to the earnest consideration of the House. B i ll as it stands at present, will undoubtedly prevent bankers from arranging rrates of overdrafts, discount, and exchange. There can be no doubt that a bank is a commercial trust according to this Bill , which provides that a""Commercial Trust"" includes a combination . . . . whose voting power or determinations are controlled or controllable by creation of a Board of Management or its equivalent. A bank, therefore, is a commerical trust, and its operations may extend beyond the boundaries of any one State. a bank will, in future, if this Bill is passed in its present form, be prevented from arranging rates of overdraft, exchange, or discount. That is a serious position for honourable members to face The House should pause before it hastily passes any measure of such far-reaching I direct the attention of honourable members to another point. Suppose two people acting fin conjunction, have bought any goods at a high price, and find immediately after purchasing that the market for them is falling. These people will form a commercial trust under the interpretation clause of this Bill, because they are bound by an agreement, and they will be unable to hold on to the goods they have. purchased in anticipation of the market for them becoming favourable again. They will have to sell at once, because, if they hold, their action will be considered a restraint of trade. For them to hold on in the hope of profitable selling means to prevent - somebody else from cheap buying, which is an obvious restraint of trade under this Bill as it stands. I therefore again suggest the necessity for referring the Bill back to the Government. I ask honourable members to consider t'he position in which that great newspaper, the Melbourne Age-the cond newspaper in the city of Melbourne - which isi doing all it can to secure the hasty passage of this measure, will be placed if the Bill is passed as; it stands. The Age proprietary is undoubtedly a commercial trust. The Age advertises that it has a circulation in all the States, and it is therefore an Inter-State concern. almost everv issue it deliberately does all it can to discredit the sale of the rival newspaper in this city. Is the Melbourne Age, with its extravagant statements of its own circulation, and misleading statements of its rival's powers, not to come under the provisions of this Bill? Mr Kelly. The Age is successful in injuring the business of its great rival, that is surely a iestraint of trade.",44
251,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does the honourable member suggest that that question is affected by the Tariff Commission's report ?,45
252,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I say that this consideration is one which should induce the Government to take the Bill back if for ever the so short a time, with a view to its being re-drafted in order to prevent such a possibility as I have suggested arising.",45
253,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Does that touch the Therefore, report of the Tariff Commission ?",45
254,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do.not wish to provoke or to evade a ruling by you, sir, but my point is that this measure has obviously been so hurriedly and vaguely drawn that its amendment in Committee will be practically impossible, and I am suggesting importance. additional reasons why it should be withdrawn from our consideration at the present time, with a view to its re-introduction in a better form. I shall not labour the question as to what might happen in the newspaper trade. There is not the slightest doubt that the design of every trader in any industry is to secure profit for himself, and he can only secure his profit from some other trader. Curiously enough, under this Bill , any trader outside of Australia, when guilty of entering into competition with an Australian trader, is guilty of unfair competition, because his action is bound to interfere with some Australian industry. In the following cases, trade is ipso facto u n fair : - In .the first place, when the trader is a commercial trust, and I have shown that a firm can be a commercial trust. In the second case, when, as a result of its competition, there will be a probability of a lower remuneration to labour. In the third place, se- when its competition will lead to the throwing of workers out of employment in an Australian industry. In all these cases competition is bound to produce these results to a greater or less degree. I asked the House on a previous Occasion to seriously consider that question, but some honourable members do not consider these In questions in the House if , indeed, they consider them anywhere. I suggest these considerations as reasons why the Bill should be withdrawn for the present. Another reason why the Bill should be withdrawn, and radically amended before it is again submitted, is that it contains a subversion of If the the principle of trial by jury. Trial by jury was introduced to insure a man getting a fair trial from his fellows-thos e who understand his mode of life and can sympathize with him in every way. trial by jury under this Bill is trial, not by those iri sympathy with the defendant, - but by those whose trade interests, and whose very means of livelihood, must make them anxious to secure his punishment. That, I take it, is a subversion of the principle of trial by jury. On the question of a lower remuneration of labour, I suggest to the Government that it must involve less pay for the same work, or more work for the same pay. If it means less pay for the same work, shearing machines are obviously unfair, and any one who employs them is guilty of unfair competition, since their use enables more sheep to be shorn in a day than could be shorn without their use.",45
255,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I am afraid the honourable member is not referring to the amendment.,46
256,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am giving reasons why the Government should take the Bill back and reconsider its provisions. I do not wish to labour the point, as I can see the difficulties of the position, but, similarly, I suggest that the use of monolines and linotypes involves unfair competition, and it is clear that the Bill, as it stands, would have such far-reaching effects that the Government might well withdraw it before it is too late. Every invention discovered ancl applied must necessarily throw workers out of employment. That is something which the Government have obviously not taken into consideration. Every invention discovered displaces labour in some form or another, and in so far as it does it is unfair competition. It is clear that the scope of this 'Bill is far wider than the framers of it originally intended. In this connection I say that the successful countries of the world are those in which the inventive genius of mankind has received the greatest encouragement. If , by any action taken in this House, we do anything, to destroy the inventive genius of the Australian people, we shall hamper and restrict Australian progress, and finally ruin the country. I do not think that it is too much to ask the Government to withdraw a measure which they have once submitted to this House. This Government has often taken that course in the past. I am aware that other Governments have found some difficulty in so doing, but it is within the recollection of all of us that this Government withdrew, on half-a-dozen occasions, whole sets of amendments, which were in themselves almost complete Bills, dealing But 'with the question of union labour. They have framed amendment after amendment, and have withdrawni them and substituted for them other amendments as far-reaching as an, ordinary Bill . I do say that a Government which has shown such facility in this direction, and which has earned such a reputation for never knowing its own mind, should have no objection to withdraw this measure for two or three weeks, in order that it might be re-introduced in a more complete form. I propose, in conclusion, to say a few words on Part III . , as every one knows it purports to deal with the alleged evil of dumping. I use the word "" all e g e d "" advisedly. Before we are asked to take up public time in the con- sideration of a measure, it is obviously the duty of the Minister in charge of it to show cause for it. I say, without fear of contradiction, that, so far, no cause has been shown for passing Part III . of this Bill . Such cause might be waiting for us in the reports) of the Tariff Commission referred to in the amendment. The Minister has not been able to show any cause, the few statements the honourable gentleman made in this connection having since been proved conclusively to be absolutely without foundation. There may or there may not be a cause for the introduction of Part III . of this Bill in the Tariff Commission's reports, but I believe that the evidence awaiting us in those reports will show that there is no cause for the passing of a measure of this character. The Tariff Commission's report on agricultural implements has been circulated amongst the members of the Commission since 12th June. Its report on harvesters, which we were led to believe last session formed the absolute crux of an important part of fhis Bill , was circulated amongst the members of the Commission only yesterday. It is well known that until the Commission corporately considers its proposals, it is impossible for any of its members to divulge any portion of the reports. So that until a report is approved as a whole, this House is absolutely debarred from any opportunity of participating in a knowledge of the evidence which the Commission has secured. To proceed with the Bill without these reports is tantamount to saving that the Government and the Minister of Trade and Customs regard the Commission as futile, and its proceedings as a farce. Does the Minister regard the work of the Commission as of so little worth, that he is not prepared to wait a day or two in order that the House may be in possession of the evidence acquired ?",46
257,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is a very important Commission, but this Bill has nothing to do with ft.",47
258,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Minister has told the House on many occasions that this Bill is intended to settle the harvester difficulty. But now he attempts to make us believe that the report of the Commission has nothing to do with the business before us. What has the Tariff Commission to do? Has it not to make recommendations to Parliament as to the incidence and working of the Tariff ?,47
259,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,f t is to give us a good Tariff to discuss.,47
260,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I understand that the work of the Tariff Commission is not to give us a Tariff, but to make recommendations.",47
261,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I that it will be a nice Tariff.,47
262,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister surely does not mean that the Commission is going to frame a T a r if f ' for us. evidence upon which we are to judge of the fitness of its recommendations. It is in the collecting of the evidence, and in boiling that evidence down in its reports, that the work of the Commission will be of such inestimable value to Parliament. To say that the-evidence collected has nothing to do with this Bill , which aims at the very root of Customs administration",47
263,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,No ; this Bill nothing to do with the Tariff.,47
264,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Evidenc e has been taken on the very point whether or not additional relief is to be afforded to the harvester industry of Australia. The Minister himself has quoted from part of the evidence given before the Commission. One side of the evidence is at least quite as biased as the other. Should not a deliberative Assembly have both sides before it when it gives its verdict? As the Minister himself has endeavoured to gain supporters for his Bill by quoting one side of the evidence, the least he can do is to give us an opportunity of judging for ourselves the whole of it. The Minister declared in his speech, on the authoritv of some over-keen traveller, that the intention of the American manufacturers of harvesters was to break 'down the Australian industry. The Tariff Commission has considered that very point. We ought to have a chance to become seized of the evidence with respect to it . The central idea of the clauses of the Bill under consideration, which I hope the Minister will withdraw from our consideration for the time being, is to restrain unfair competition. But, curiously enough, under the second sub-clause' of clause 14, the onus of proving whether or not an industry is being unfairly conducted is thrown upon the defendant. The Government mav think that the occasion merits such a departure from British traditions of justice, but before asking the House to decide that soserious a condition of affairs has arisen as to justify that proceeding, an opportunity should be given to us to judge for ourselves..",47
265,Mr FRAZER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,On e excuse is as goodas another.,47
266,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I dare say that the honourable member thinks so, but nothing can excuse him from making disorderly interjections. Under this Bill a trader is proved have no doubt to be guilty if he and another agree to sell goods together. There is one point that I do not think has been sufficiently dealt with, and I propose to touch upon it. A trader It has collected is presumed to be guilty if a disproportionately large selling commission is paid, to his agents. It is well known that commissions vary in their relative value without there being necessarily any dishonest purpose. How would this position affect commercial travellers? The keenest traveller surely should get the best reward. If we pass this proposal we shall reduceto a dead level a whole class of our has fellow citizens. No man who is keen will have an opportunity of getting a better reward than another. If that idea fits in with the socialistic or communistic principles of some of the supporters of thisBill , I do not think that it fits in with the general sense of justice of this community. The penalty for doing a number of things under this Bill which are done every day in the most legitimate way, and for the good of the consumers of this country, is an absolute prohibition of the importation of these goods. And bow are these anti-dumping clauses to be put into operation? Who is to decide when the prohibition of goods is to take place? Is this House to decide it? I suggest that the Bill entails an abrogation of our own powers which we should be loth to sanction until the Minister shows cause for so doing. Is Parliament to decide when an article may be completely shut out of the Australian market, when goods may be refused to be imported, and when bargains may not be allowed to be secured by the Australian consumer? If so, is Parliament to decide these things in the open light of day, when the public can read our debates, and know the reasons which prompted our conclusions,. or is the Minister to decide them ? Is it wise to delegate to a single man the determination of questions of such far-reaching importance? thousands of pounds per annum may be concerned in any particular line of trade. To put the existence of trade of such value at the discretion of any one man is merely to offer an inducement for corruption. f do not for a moment suggest that the present Minister cannot be trusted in this regard. But I do say that to put discretionary powers of such anextraordinary nature absolutely at the command of any one man, whoever he may be, is only to offer an inducement for the most widespread corruption.",47
267,Unknown,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.30 p.m.,48
268,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Before the dinner adjournment I was urging, as a reason why the Government should withdraw this measure from our consideration for the time being, wirJhj a view to its re-submission later on, the enormous discretionary powers ister. which the Minister of Trade and Customs would enjoy if it were passed in like its present form.",48
269,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No , I would have accepted. no power at all.",48
270,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"TJnde r the Bill the Minproposed. ister alone would have the discretion as to starting proceedings against an importing firm. Furthermore, he alone would deal out penalties under a verdict which would proposed. be awarded by trade rivals of the importer.",48
271,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,No .,48
272,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Then how far am wrong ?,48
273,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I have said that on that particular point the Bill will amended.,48
274,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Her e is a direction in which the Minister is prepared the Bill . He is now willing to put a Judge in the place of the trade rivals.,48
275,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,As I wanted to Minister? do at first.,48
276,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Which ! the honourable gentleman wanted to do at first, but - for some too obvious, reason, to do. I would suggest to the Minister, now that he has seen the necessity for amending his Bill in a very vital direction, that this is an additional reason why he should take the whole measure into consideration. He has seen the faulty nature of the Bill in one important regard, and he should, therefore, look over the * whole measure, and not merely one part of it. I think he told us that the Judge was to decide whether or not the comHundreds of petition was having the effect complained of, but will he tell us whether the Judge's powers are to be 'exactly similar to those of the Board, or whether he will have the additional power of saying what penalty he thinks will meet the case?",48
277,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Judge will have the power if honourable members carry out what I want,",48
278,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Judge will decide what is to be done; in other words, he will decide, not only that unfair competition of the kind complained of has been in operation, but that certain regulations will suffice, or, if absolutely essential, the article shall cease to be imported?",48
279,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Yes .,48
280,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If that is so, I think that a very important amendment in principle has been already accepted by the Min",48

286,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I will not quibble about words. It is going to be proposed on the suggestion of other members. I I think it is a very important amendment on the principle of the Bill , and one which will effect a considerable safeguard. be But still the Minister will have the sole power of initiating proceedings.",48
287,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No , the Compto amend troller-General.",48
288,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is he not virtually the He could not very well go against the views of the Minister.,48
289,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But the Minister which could act upon the advice of the Comphe was unable troller-General.,48
290,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"E x a c t l y ; but the Minister could refuse to take the Comptroller General's advice as to whether action should be taken or not. I do not think that he will deny that. Even that, I submit, is an enormous power to give, because under t'he Bill as it is drafted, any importing firm - which is ipso facto an importing trust, has thrown upon it the onus of proving whether or not the competition will throw Australian workers out of employment. If the Judge takes the strict reading of the Act he will find that any competition from abroad must affect employment here, since all competition does. I take it that the importing firm is in this happy position, that if the Minister actually starts proceedings, as it will be in his sole discretion to do, the Judge will have no option but to decide that the importing firm is guilty of unfair competition within the meaning of the Act.",49
291,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Oh no; the Judge can say that it is not. He can give his decision just as he likes.,49
292,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Oh , yes, but the B i ll is so drafted that the defendant will have to prove that his competition with local industry is not affecting employment, or will not probably affect employment. In such a case it is obvious that the Judge will have only one course open to him. must decide that the importer's competition is affecting local employment. If he is in - any way a reasonable man he must see that it must affect employment. He has a direction in the Bill as to what he i's to do. In such a case the importer's sole consideration must be inevitably to try to stop the proceedings from being started, and the sole person who will have the discretion as to starting proceedings will be the Minister of Trade and Customs. In such a case the victim, being in the toils, must do his level best to insure the goodwill of the Minister of the day.",49
293,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am afraid that the honourable member is again disregarding the amendment, which, has to do with the report of the Tariff Commission on metals and machinery.",49
294,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am trying to show reasons why the Government should take the Bill again into complete consideration. The Tariff Commission's report on metals and machinery will probably be presented to us in about a fortnight. fortnight's consideration in Cabinet would be sufficient to enable the Government to redraft the measure without retaining these objectionable provisions, and I am urging the Government to accept the amendment in order to give themselves that opportunity. The Minister will see that to put in such a position a merchant with money behind him would be to put a premium upon corruption, and, although we, in this House,, believe that the Minister of the day would justify our confidence in him, still I think we must all recognise that it would not be wise to introduce in the Commonwealth a system which must eventually lead to a state of corruption such as would turn Tammany Hall green with envy. The discretionary powers of Lands Ministers in another State have led to very great abuses. We must not take into consideration the personal equation, the personal integrity, of the Minister of the day in considering a measure of this kind. We must consider the eventual result of putting' any such premium upon corruption as is here proposed to be done. Therefore I submit that the Government ought willingly to reconsider the whole measure, with a view to seeing if it could not be completely remodelled in this regard. I cannot see what evil there is irt a country getting its goods as cheaply as possible. I think that in the case of arHe ticles of consumption a country, like an individual, should make the best bargain it can. But if the House is determined to prevent the evil of dumping, there are other measures which could be adopted, avoiding this enormous use of discretionary power on the part of the Minister. I hope that, after the Government have accepted the amendment, as I feel sure they will , they will introduce a Bill framed on the lines of the Canadian Anti-Dumping Act, which is very simple in its object. In Canada the House of Commons decides what is to be done in all cases of proved dumping, and the Minister, as servant of the House, carries out its orders. Section 19 of the Act reads as follows: Whenever it appears to the satisfaction of the Minister of Customs, or' of any officer of Customs authorised to collect Customs dues, that the export price, or the actual selling price, to the importer in Canada, of any imported dutiablearticles of a class or kind made or produced in Canada, is less than the fair market value thereof, as determined according to the basis of value foT duty, provided in the Customs Act in respect of imported goods subject to an I believe that a ad valorem duty, such articles shall, in addition to the duty otherwise established, be subject to a special duty of Customs equal to the difference between such fair market and such Selling price.",49
295,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I would remind the honourable member that the question before the Chair is that certain words be omitted from the motion with a view to insert in lieu thereof these wordsnot further proceeded with until after the Tariff Commission has presented its report on metals and machinery. The honourable member is now arguing, not that the consideration of the Bill be postponed for a time) in order that the Tariff Commission's report may be considered, but that the Bill should be withdrawn, and a new Bill containing certain amendments which he suggests substituted there for. That is quite a different question from that suggested in the amendment, which I again ask him to discuss.",50
296,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Perhaps , sir, I was infringing the Standing Orders; but my desire was to point out to the Government how much better a measure might result if this Bill were postponed and reconsidered. I have indicated my view in regard to the method which should be adopted, and suggested the greatdifficulty there will be in inserting the necessary amendments in the Bill in Committee. If I find that it cannot be surrounded with safeguards at that stage, I shall feel bound to record mv vote against its third reading. ' Mr HENRY WILLIS [7.44] - During my remarks last evening, I had occasion to refer to the report of the Tariff Commission on metals and machinery, which was likely to be presented at an early date, and also to the injury which would be done to the manufacturing community by the introduction of this Bill . I find that today a deputation waited on the Minister and advised what I stated here last night. I was loath, however, to speak to the amendment of the honourable member for Dalley until I had read the report of the - proceedings in connection with the deputation, which was composed of employers, manufacturers, and traders.",50
297,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What ! Traitors ?,50
298,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is what the deputation made out the position to be, namely, that under the Bill a trader is regarded as a traitor. Indeed, the deputation went so far as to say that at the 'Customs House traders are regarded as rogues and criminals. I am surprised to find a Minister so ready to turn the word "" trader "" into "" traitor."" value Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I thought the honourable member used the word "" traitor.""",50
299,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I usually speak rather distinctly, and I am deliberate enough.",50
300,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And I am not deaf.,50
301,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"So far from being deaf, the Minister is, I think, rather keen. But he had it on his mind that the deputation was composed' of rogues, criminals, and traitors, because he was inclined to take them to task for the reason that they regard this measure as panic legislation. In fact, the Minister was irritated.",50
302,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I was not.,50
303,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It seems to me, from reading the newspaper report, that the Minister was irritated by the protestations of the men of business, who waited upon him as the friends of the policy which he advocates.",50
304,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is a short report in the newspapers. The deputation was friendly all the time.,50
305,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It was, indeed; and it advised the Minister not to push on with this panic legislation, which would have the effect, as I pointed out in my speech last night, of injuring the manufacture of boots and shoes in our midst. In that speech I dealt afc some length (Robertson) with this particular industry; and from the newspaper report I see that Mr Harkness, a member of the, deputation, pointed out that it is impossible for the manufacturer' of boots and shoes to continue in the trade unless he deals with the trust in America, which is able to supply more advantageously than can any other firm the wares that he requires.",50
306,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member will not talk like that when I read a part of the agreement.,50
307,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Minister knows that that was a statement made by a member of the deputation.,50
308,Sir WILLIAM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"LYNE - Yes ; but when I read a part of the agreement, which I intend to do, the honourable member will not talk in that way.",50
309,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"All I am concerned with is the statement made by a competent authority, one of the prominent men representative of the trade of Melbourne and suburbs. Indeed, I think the deputation went so far as to declare that they represented everv part of the Commonwealth. They told the Minister that this is panic legislation, and asked him to have it investigated by a Select Committee. They stated, too, that they would be prepared to satisfy such a Committee that their industries would be ruined under the provisions of the Bill the Minister is endeavouring to force on Parliament. There has not been one request for this measure at this particular moment; and all that is asked now is that it shall be held in abeyance until the Tariff Commission has furnished a report which it is believed will substantiate all that was said by the deputation who met the Minister in friendly interview today. This representative deputation contended that to call this an Anti-Trust Bill is to present a bitter pill with a sugar coating-that it is nothing of the kind. In their opinion it will reduce the honest trader to ruin, and cause him to be regarded at the Customs House as a rogue and vagabond, or, as the Minister says, a "" traitor."" Another member of the deputation, Mr Knowles, who is a soft goods merchant dealing in imported goods, declared that he is afraid to go abroad to purchase at a low rate, because if he returns and sells goods at a figure below that at which they are ordinarily sold, he will be liable to imprisonment under the Bill.  Melbourne Ports says that the honourable member is talking ""tommy-rof.""",50
310,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member for - Melbourne Ports would not dare tell the gentlemen who met the Minister today that they talked "" tommy-rot.""",51
311,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes , I would.",51
312,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member for Melbourne Forts, who is a member of the Protectionist Association, would not dare to use such an expression in the face of that deputation, which was composed of men of substance, who have their all embarked in industrial manufactures, and who, in the aggregate, have tens of thousands of employees.",51
313,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And they are the who keep the Protectionists' Association going.,51
314,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"They are, I believe, members of the Protectionist Association. These men say that this panic legislation will have the effect of injuring their business, crippling commerce, and throwing men out of employment. In all probability many of them have already made similar statements to the Tariff Commission, which has been sitting so long and taking evidence in all quarters. The deputation merely asked the Minister to do what we, as members of Parliament, now request, namely, to withhold the passing of the measure until we have considered the evidence taken by the Tariff Commission. That Commission consists of reputable gentlemen representing each party hi the House, who have devoted their time for over a year to taking evidence from one end of Australia to the other. The Commission has not hesitated to interview anybody who could furnish valuable information, and the honourable member for Bendigo, who is Chairman of the Commission, stated this afternoon that several of the reports on metals and machinery are ready for presentation - that one or two others are in the hands of the typewriters, and that in the course of a few days, the evidence will be placed before Parliament. The deputation said to the Minister, "" Take our suggestion as one coming from friends; we are manufacturers' representative of the whole Commonwealth, and we say that this is panic legislation which will injure industries, jeoparize every honest trader, and throw men out of employment."" Mr Haigh, another member of the deputation, said that traders are afraid to go to the Customs House, because theiy aire looked upon suspiciously-.that everv act of an honest merchant today is regarded as the act of an undesirable citizen, who is seeking to rob his neighours and the Customs, and who has no interest in the welfare of his country-wh o is a traitor to his country, as the Minister himself stated, when I used the word ""trader.""",51
315,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member knows 1 never did anything of the kind ; T merely asked the honourable member if he useti the word "" traitor."" ",51
316,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Of course, if the Minister says that he withdrew the remark men Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I did not make any remark.",51
317,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I will not take second place to any man in the House. If I use the word "" trader,"" I mean ""trader,"" and not ""traitor."" The latter word was in the mind of the Minister, and men who have put their money into Australian industries are treated as traitors. These are men who employ tens of thousands in every department of manufacture, and who are prepared to compete with all parts of the world; and they asked the Minister not to proceed with this panic legislation, which causes them to be treated as rogues and vagabonds at the Customs House. The representations of the deputation were not without their effect.on the Minister, because, in his parting salute, he said he would call for a report as to whether industries are being injured - a report as' to whether",51
318,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is the honourable member sure?,52
319,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I made a note from the press report. The Minister that he would have further information amendment. brought before bim. Was the Minister humbugging the deputation? Is the Minthank ister going, to rush forward at railway speed and have a report when the Bill has passed into law?",52
320,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member is humbugging his constituents.,52
321,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I protest trifling against this class of legislation. I do not know that I should have been on my feet now had I not found that the gentlemen the who composed this deputation confirm every for a report. Statement I made as to the likely ruin to industries under the provisions of this Bill. I treated in detail the question of the raw material required in the manufacure of boots and' shoes, and of leather itself, our midst; one industry depends on another. The Minister is laughing up his sleeve, simply because he thinks he may "" gull "" a few people in his electorate being able to state that he has passed legislation which bears the name of "" trust.""",52
322,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The attitude of the Minister of Trade and Customs is not the question under discussion at the present time.,52
323,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"W it h all demission ference to you, sir, I am now dealing with the amendment, which declares that the cuss Bill should be withdrawn until we have report of the Tariff Commission on metals and machinery, and I am showing that, at an outside deputation, evidence was brought forward that, according to the press 'port, convinced the Minister that it was necessary he should have that information.",52
324,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,If the honourable member discusses that phase of the question he will be in order.,52
325,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister of Trade and Customs took the deputation into his confidence, and said that it was his intention to amend the Bill so as to have a jury of several citizens to sit witli the Judge.",52
326,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member will see that the question of whether there shall be a Judge or Judge and jury, has no relation whatever to the question of postponing the Bill until the presentation of the report of the Tariff Commission on metals and machinery. It is not expected that the Tariff Commission will deal with that phase of the question. The honourable said member will please confine himself to the",52
327,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I have to you, Mr Speaker. I am glad to be called to order, because it is in that way been I have been made an authority on the Standing Orders. I do not wish to labour that part of the Minister's reply, but I must say that the honourable gentleman is with this Parliament. He has admitted that there is necessity, because of the grave representations made to him by deputation, for calling on his officers",52
328,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I never said anything of the kind.,52
329,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Minister in is reported in the press to have done so.,52
330,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I do not think so.,52
331,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"What is more, by the Minister denies having lectured those gentlemen because they represented that the antiBill would do injury to their industries. However, we have the evidence of the press report as to what the Minister did say. Whether that report be correct or not, the Minister is trifling with this Parliament and the country in forcing on the - Bill' at a time when the' Chairman of the Tariff Comhas in view the completion of reports which will enable Parliament to disthe Bill on its merits. If it be shown the by the reports of the Tariff Commission that drastic legislation such as this is necessary in the interests of manufacturer, producer, and consumer, then Parliament will deal rewith the measure in that light - But the Minister takes to himself some credit for having brought forward a Bill more drastic than any similar legislation! in the world - a Bill which goes to the length of prohibiting the importation from abroad of goods coming into competition with local manufactures. The Minister's duty to the country is to withdraw the measure, in order to give the representatives of the people an opportunity to prime themselves with the information which will be supplied by the Tariff Commission's reports, so that we may legislate in the interests of all concerned, and the Commonwealth may progress under wise and good laws. I hope that the honourable gentleman will carry out the promise which he made to the deputation which waited upon him today. gather from the answer gave to that deputation is his intention to move ments on the lines suggested by me last night, whereby certain trusts will come under the operation of Part II . of the Bill , and other trusts under"" the operation of Part III . , the dumping clauses being entirely abandoned.",52
332,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Wannon) [8.2] I regard the amendment as strictly relevant, and one which those who desire information on the whole subject dealt with by the Bill should support. The Royal Commission on the Tariff has been sitting for eighteen months. I do not grudge the expenditure of the large sum ofi money which this inquiry has entailed, but I think that we should not legislate on this matter until we have at our disposal the information which has been gathered for us. Minister, in his second-reading speech, dealt with some of the matters coming before the Tariff Commission, _and quoted the evidence of those interested in one side of the case. He made no attempt to give the evidence of those on the other side. Although evidence, both pro and con., has been taken by the Commission, we are asked to legislate entirely upon the evidence of one set of witnesses.",53
333,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The course which the Government are taking is a slap in the face to the Tariff Commission.,53
334,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The members of that Commission, having devoted timeand trouble to its inquiries, and, no doubt, having been out to considerable loss and inconvenience in attending its sittings, it seems extraordinary that we should be asked to consider this Bill before we are in possession of the valuable evidence which its reDorfs will shortly give to us. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo informed the House this afternoon that the Commission's reports on the effect of the Tariff on the industry which has clamoured most for legislation such as has been introduced, will be laid before Parliament within a very short space of time. Why, then, should not the further consideration of the Bill be postponed until we haw those reports in our possession, and know what evidence has been given on both sides of the question. As I have pointed out, the Minister asked us to act on evidence coming wholly from one side, and dealing with one indusI try only. Although he interjected a few which he nights ago that he has other evidence to that it show that Par't III . of the Bill is necesamend- sary, that evidence has not been placed before us. Therefore, it is highly desirable that we should postpone the consideration of the measure until we get it . The least we can clo, in decency, is to pay some attention to the work of the members of the Tariff Commission. By negativing the amendment, we shall be branding the Commission as inefficient, and its work as useless. Although I do not promise to vote for every recommendation that the Commission may make, its conclusions, and the evidence which it has taken, will be worthy of the most serious consideration, and will be much more informing than the ex parte 1 statements of the Minister.

335,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Hindmarsh) [8.14]. - Wit h the accuracy for which the members of the Opposition are notorious when referring to the Labour Party, we have been twitted with, being gagged in regard to this measure; but I , for ""one, intend to say something about its provisions, and, in doing so, I shall be only following my leader and other members of the party who have already spoken on the second reading.",54
336,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,To which cloes the honourable member refer?,54
337,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I have only one leader in this House-the leader of the Labour Party. If a justification were required for the introduction of this measure, i.t has been furnished! by some of the members of the Opposition. The deputy leader of the Opposition, and a number of his followers, have said that they are prepared to vote for the second reading. If the Bill were a bad one, it would be their duty t'o oppose it at every stage. Further evidence as to the need for the Bill was furnished by the speech of the honourable member for Mernda. That speech was a remarkable one, and set up a standard of commercial morality which, I think, would not receive the support of the House., The honourable member, speaking of monopolies, said that, if an individual, engaged in business in a small way, made a profit of 6 per cent., and a large corporation, by adopting different methods, was able to make a profit twelve times as large-that is, a profit of 72 per cent - the public would not necessarily be robbed thereby.",54
338,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,He said thai such a concern might be supplying the communey-General NOES. nity with cheaper goods than the concern which was making the smaller profit.,54
339,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Exactly , notwithstanding that the larger concern was making twelve times the amount of profit that was being derived by the smaller one. All I have to say is that, if the honourable member set up business in South Australia as a money-lender, and charged such an enormous rate of interest, he would be taken before the Court and a large amount PAIRS. of the extortionate charge would be remitted. I am glad to say that in South Australia an Act of that character is in force.",54
340,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member is misrepresenting the honourable member for Mernda.,54
341,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am taking the position precisely as he put it, only that the honourable member for Mernda-as has been interjected by the deputy leader of the Opposition-tol d us that the larger concern might be giving the public as cheap an article, if not cheaper, than the concern which was making the smaller profit. If that were sio, it would show that the smaller man was incompetent to carry on his business, or that his machinery was out of date. But in any case a profit of twelve times leader 6 per icent. would be an extortionate one.",54
342,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member for Mernda said it might happen that a firm would make that amount of profit, but he did not say that he approved of it .",54
343,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"He did not denounce the making of such a profit, and if he did notapprove of it , it would have been just as well if he had not mentioned it. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has said that this is not a Bill which will prevent the establishment of monopolies. If it is not, it is, as I interjected, "" sham legislation.""",54
344,Mr LIDDELL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does the honourable member think that the Bill will ever be operative ?,54
345,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I will come to that point presently. I think that there is some warrant for the statement of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, because the Attorney-General interjected that an offender must "" wilfullv "" act to the detriment of the public.",54
346,Mr CONROY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Mus t "" wilfully "" contract.",54
347,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No . The Attorinterjected that it must be proved that an offender has "" wilfully "" acted to the detriment of the public before he is liable to any penalty. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, in reply, stated that he did not think it would be necessary to prove that an offender had "" wilfully"" acted to the detriment of the public to enable him to be brought under the provisions of this Bill.",54
348,Mr HIGGINS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I said that, under the measure as it is at present drawn, one need not prove that an offender intended to damage the public.",55
349,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable and learned member is reported to have said that, as the Bill stands, there is no necessity to prove wilful intention.",55
350,Mr HIGGINS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is correct.,55
351,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That view seems to me to be entirely at variance with the statement of the Attorney-General.,55
352,Mr HIGGINS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But the Attorney-General assured me that if there were the least, doubt about the matter he would make it perfectly clear.",55
353,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If there is any doubt about it, I hope that honourable members will assist me to eliminate the word "" wilfully."" Nearly all our industrial legis- lation contains the word "" wilfully,"" just asin the provisions of the Constitution relating to the Murray waters the word "" reasonable"" is employed, and just as in the Employers' Liability Act we find the phrase ""serious and wilful neglect."" All these phrases mean endless litigation. Within fourteen years after the Employers'' Liability Act of 1881 was passed there were no less than 1,762 actions tried in Scotland alone, in which £363,000 was claimed, but only £17,500 was awarded. That seems an extraordinary amount of litigation for a very small result. I believe that the same sort of thing will occur under this Bill if we retain the word "" w i l full y "" and such words as "" with the design of injuring an Australian industry."" If honourable members will look at clause n they will see it provides thatAny person who is injured in his person or property by any other person, by reason of any act or thing done by that other person in contravention of this part of this Act, may, in any competent Court, exercising Federal jurisdiction, sue for and recover treble damages for jury. That provision seems to me to offer a special inducement to manufacturers and other business people who feel that they have been injured in their industry to go to law, in the hope that they may recover treble damages. If the figures that I have quoted can be regarded as any indication of what lawsuits will cost, the less litigation that our manufacturers indulge in the better it will be for their pockets. In the cases I have mentioned both the employers and the unfortunate employees were losers.",55
354,Mr HIGGINS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member would not put a man in gaol for making an agreement which he thought would injure nobody ?,55
355,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I will deal with that point presently. It has been said that the Labour Party should oppose this Bill, because they favour the nationalization of monopolies.",55
356,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,They say that this BiV will be ineffective.,55
357,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The deputy leader of the Opposition said that he could not understand why the Labour Party supported the measure, seeing that its members favoured the nationalization of monopolies. But the honourable member knows perfectly well that, at the present moment, there is no power under our Constitution to nationalize monopolies.",55
358,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Why do not the members of the Labour Party tell the public that when they are advocating nationalization? Not a single member of that party has told the public that.,55
359,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It has been made perfectly clear to the people that we intend to seek' that power.,55
360,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Our complaint is that the Government are helping the Labour Party to make out a case for nationalization.,55
361,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not think so. I believe that the Government are satisfied that the Bill will accomplish more than I think it will. Under the circumstances, I am prepared to give it a trial.",55
362,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,M V remark was a general one. I was referring to the Commissions which the Government have appointed from time fo time to inquire into the feasibilitv of nationalization.,55
363,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Le t us suppose that we had the power under the Constithe in- tution to nationalize anv monopoly. Because we have not the numbers is surely no reason why we should not seek to regulate monopolies until we secure the numbers.,55
364,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If we regulate a trust and restore normal competition, we shall make that trust stronger, and not weaker.",56
365,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The stronger we make a trust the sooner it will be nationalized. That is the view of myself and my colleagues. Some honourable members declare that they desire to amend the Bill in Committee, but we know perfectly well that members of the Opposition will, if possible, amend it in the direction of destroying it.",56
366,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does the honourable member think that he will recognise it when it emerges from Committee.,56
367,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Not if the honourable member has his way. I do not think that the Bill will achieve its purpose for several reasons. We have only to look at the working of the Sherman Act in America, where it has been in. operation for sixteen years, to realise that.",56
368,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Where members of the party to which the honourable member belongs?,56
369,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The party are quite satisfied, I suppose, that I am voicing their views. Although the Sherman Act has been in existence for sixteen years, there are more monopolies in America today than there were when it became law. As has been pointed out by the Minister, and by the Attorney-General, the measure before the House does not go as far as does the Sherman Act. That Act itself was found to be so weak in operation that it had to be followed by the Wilson Act.",56
370,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,In some respects the Minister says that this Bill goes further than does the Sherman Act.,56
371,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In some respects it does. The Sherman Act does not deal with some of the matters which are dealt with in the measure under consideration. As the Sherman Act was ineffective, it was in 1904 followed by the Wilson Act, which is certainly a much more drastic measure in some respects. It provides thatEvery combination, conspiracy, trust, agreement, or contract is hereby declared to be contrary to public policy, illegal, and void, when the same is made by or between two or more persons or corporations . . . . in restraint of lawful trade. Then it is different from the Bill before us in that it not only imposes a monetary penalty upon ,an offender not exceeding $5,000, but it provides that ""the offender shall be imprisoned"". The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne wished to know whether I was in favour of imprisoning offenders under this Bill. Most decidedly I am, for the reason that we imprison a man who breaks the law upon a small scale. Why should we differentiate between one law-breaker and another, especially as the Bill provides that an offender must wilfully break the law? Surely we should not extend consideration to a wilful law-breaker. Only the other day I heard the late lamented"" Mr Seddon say that there was only one cure for these offendersj and that was gaol. There is only one cure for them. What is the use of fining a corporation $5,000 or $15,000 if it is making a profit of $1,000,000 a year? It could well afford to pay treble, or even ten times the amount of the fine. But if we put the individuals concerned in the dock",56
372,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Unde r the are the Wilson Act the honourable member would be in the dock himself.,56
373,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Upon what ground ?,56
374,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,For increasing the market price of imported articles.,56
375,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not see that the Bill will do that. The Ministry claim that it will prevent the dumping of undervalued goods, and in that way alone it may increase prices. That, however, will be a benefit to the community. I would point out to the honourable member for North Sydney that if he were engaged in an industry in which goods were being dumped, and if, as a result, he was thrown out of employment, he would not consider that a benefit had been conferred upon him even if he could purchase those goods at half their former price, because he would not have the money to buy them. I think it is only fair that offenders under this Bill should be placed in the dock. It has been asserted by certain honourable members that some, trusts are beneficent. They have twitted the Minister with being unable to show that there are any injurious trusts in Australia at the present time. Before I conclude mv remarks, I think I shall be able to mention one, at any rate, and I may refer to two or three. The honourable member (for North Sydney, amongst others, stated that the operations of certain trusts were beneficent, but he took very good care not to bring any such combinations under the notice of the House. The Bill deals only with corporations or individuals that are doing injury to the community.",56
376,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The word ""destructive"" is used to show that ",57
377,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is so, and if the operations! of a trust are beneficent it will not be affected by this measure. I am afraid, however, that we have to take some of these beneficent trusts on trust. I wish to say that experience in every part of the world has shown that, whilst the operations of a combination may appear to be beneficent, as soon as it has grown into a monopoly the consumer is fleeced. We have had scores of instances in support of this statement quoted during this debate. We have had a fair discussion upon the measure, and it is right that a Bill of such far-reaching effect should be properly discussed, and that when it gets into Committee we should do all that we can to make it not only a just, but a workable, measure. I say now that I do not think it is a workable measure as it stands. It has been said that under this Bill very large powers are intrusted to the Minister, and powers which might be abused. I do not think there is much danger on that score. I have always voted against giving the Minister administering an Act more power than can possibly be helped, because I believe that we should embody everything we can in a measure when we are passing it. But I remind honourable members that the Minister of Trade and Customs is not being given in this Bill any greater powers than have already been given him under the Customs Act.",57
378,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,He is being given greater powers than are given to the Minister under the Canadian Act.,57
379,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,This Bill gives him no greater powers than he is given under the Customs Act.,57
380,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister says that it does. The honourable gentleman is not sure of his powers under the Customs Act, and he wishes to make sure of his position under this Bill.",57
381,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I think the honourable and learned member for Parkes will admit that the power of the Minister under the Customs Act is not limited.,57
382,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I am Minister's own admission.,57
383,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister, like myself, is a layman, and on such a point I prefer to take the opinion of those versed in the law. I have heard the statement made over and over again that full power is given to the Minister under the Customs Act* t'o prohibit the importation of any goods he pleases.",57
384,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does the honourable member think that the Minister of Trade and Customs understands the Act which he is called upon to administer?,57
385,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Undoubtedly , the honourable gentleman understands it , and so well that 1 say there is very little danger in giving him the powers proposed under this Bill . If there were any danger that the powers given to the Minister under this Bill would be abused, I am satisfied that the powers with which he is intrusted under the Customs Act would have been abused before now, especially in view of the low Tariff we have, and the injury which I hold it has worked to many of our industries. Unfortunately, my experience, like that of other honourable members, has been not that the administration has been too strong, but, unfortunately, that, as a rule, it has been too weak. The Minister intrusted with the administration of an Act is very careful not to exceed his powers, because he knows that he can be brought to book by Parliament, and may have to make way for some one else. The honourable member for Grampians said that he thought a handful of people should not require such a drastic measure as this. I entirely agree with the honourable member, but the fact remains that such drastic measures are necessary, and as they have become necessary we should pass them. They are necessary from the very fact that we are but a handful of people. It will be admitted that the resources of Australia are unbounded, and in a country of illimitable resources we should be able to find employment for a mere handful of people. Unfortunately, at the present time we are not able to do so. In almost every department of industry we have unemployed. We have skilled mechanics going about idle, not by the score, but by the hundred.",57
386,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,H as the honourable member seen that his friend the Age says that times are booming?,57
387,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I quite endorse taking the what the Age said, and that but still further proves the necessity for this measure. If when times are booming thousands are looking for employment, and cannot find it, it is our duty to do what we can to preserve our industries, in order to provide work for our people. It has been said that no proof has been given of the existence of a monopoly in Australia, but the shipping combine has been repeatedly referred to. I have hadt no proof brought before me that the shipping combine is not looked upon by every section of the community, not only as a monopoly, but as a monopoly of a very injurious character.",57
388,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It is supported by the seamen.,58
389,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It does not matter whether it is supported by the seamen or not. Unfortunately, in many cases, as we have seen in connection with the tobacco industry, the men employed in an industry are afraid to express their views, because, if they did, they would render themselves liable to dismissal, and might also find difficulty in getting another situation.",58
390,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The seamen's organization supports the shipping combine.,58
391,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That may be so, but it is not proof that the shipping combine is not a monopoly. The seamen may honestly think that it is not a monopoly, but we have a better opportunity of studying these questions, and are likely to know more about the matter than is the ordinary seaman, who has about the hardest life of any workman I know. It is also asserted by some honourable members that the tobacco industry is not a monopoly. It is not in the exact sense of the word, but we have had a Royal Commission appointed to inquire into this industry. Its members are more thoroughly acquainted with the whole of the ramifications of the industry than we can claim to be, and yet the majority of the members of that Commission came to the conclusion! that the tobacco industry in Australia is a monopoly.",58
392,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"They say it is a partial, but not a complete, monopoly.",58
393,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"They say it is a monopoly, and that it ought to be nationalized.",58
394,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,They said that before they had inquired.,58
395,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then, their inquiry only confirmed them in their belief that what they first asserted was correct. Does the honourable and learned member for Wannon mean to suggest that the members of the Tobacco Monopoly Commission were prejudiced in any way?",58
396,Mr ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I say that the evidence they obtained does not bear out their report.,58
397,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member for Wentworth has supplied me with a copy of their report, in which I find that they sayWe find that the combine is a partial, but not a complete, monopoly. Exactly; and this Bill is designed to deal with partial monopolies, and prevent them from becoming complete. The honourable member for Wentworth has only furnished me with additional evidence of the necessity for placing this Bill upon the statute book.",58
398,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Commission say that it is not a complete monopoly.,58
399,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Unfortunately, this partial monopoly has obtained such an extraordinary hold of the industry that it is most unfortunate that the measure now proposed was not placed on the statute book many years ago. I shall quote what, an eminent American writer has to say about the International Harvester Trust, which, no doubt, some honourable members will also say is not a monopoly. I shall show honourable members on the Opposition side of the House the kind of combines they are supporting and doing all in their power to give free play to in Australia.",58
400,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No , fair play.",58
401,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member may call it any kind of play he has a mind to, but, judging by the opinions to which, he has given expression on many other questions, I doubt whether he is a good judge of fair play. Honourable members probably will know something of the history of the International Harvester Company, and I shall, therefore, quote only a portion of an article by Mr Alfred Henry Lewis in the Cosmopolitan for April, 1905. Mr Lewis's article is headed: "" A Trust in Agricultural Implements-The Opportunity of the Newly-formed Trust and its Far-reaching Influences,"" and, amongst other things, he saysThere were, perhaps, ten American concerns engaged in the manufacture and sale of farm tools and machinery when the Harvester Trust was formed, and of these the Deering, the MCCormick, the Millwaukee, the Piano,"" and the Champion companies were included therein. The list carried the largest plants in the countiy. There have been added to it since the ""Minnie,"" the Aultman and Miller, and the D . M. Osborne companies. I may say that the Osborne Company was forced into the combine. As now framed the Harvester Trust controls over nine-tenths of the farm implement trade, and by methods of extortion, constriction, and law breaking, so dominates the market situation as to compel what opposition is struggling against it to do business at a loss. This is the company which is doing so much to destroy an important industry in Australia, and which will do a great deal more if its operations are not checked. To confirm what is stated here by Mr Lewis in regard to the control by this trust of nine-tenths of the world's trade in agricultural implements, I may say that the International Harvester Company issued a circular, which I am sorry I have not with' me at the present moment, in which they claim to have 90 per cent, of the world's trade, and there can be no doubt that they will not be satisfied until they get a good deal more.",58
402,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is the honourable member not aware that the bulk of the harvesters imported into Australia are those of the Massey-Harris Company ?,59
403,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If that be so we must deal with the Massey-Harris Company in precisely the same way as with the International Harvester Company. I have nothing specially against the Massey-Harris Company or International Harvester Company, as compared with other companies, but I hold that any corporation or trust whose operations afflict our industries should be dealt with. Mr Lewis, in his article, made reference to the profits that have been made by this extraordinary combination, which has a good many of the American banks and unlimited capital at its back. He saysIt is not too much to say that now in the year of its existence the Harvester Trust those $100,000,000 pockets a yearly profit of over $40,000,000, eighty per cent, of which be counted as merest rapine. That is the opinion of Mr Lewis. We all know how the trust bought up the railPresident, ways. A great deal was made during this debate of the fact that the railways of sion stated thatAustralia, being owned by the States, could not be used for the purpose for which railthe ways have been used in America, where to they are privately owned, of securing reof bates to private companies. That is quite true, but the shipping combine could assist these trusts to a great extent if they isHarvester pleased, and does so at present. load of merchandise, Dealing with the Bill, and in connection railroad with the question of litigation, I should like to point out that powerful combinations like these can employ the very best lawyers, and it is a very poor lawyer that cannot see his way through an Act of Parliament.",59
404,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member is working for the lawyers in supporting this Bill.,59
405,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I am quite aware that fhis measure will be beneficial to the lawyers. If I were a lawyer it would make my eyes glisten to see a Bill like this. The small man is always handicapped in going to law. I speak from personal experience. Justice can only be obtained if it is bought. Mr Lewis goes on to say,59
406,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Who is this Lewis?,59
407,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"He is a gentleman who could give the honourable member for Dallev a few points on a matter with which he is thoroughly familiar. He goes on, to sayI f such as the harvester trust were limited to lawful methods, and confined in their dollai hunting to what honest rules of the chase are set forth in the public statutes, not a bit of harm would come from them. It is only when they become criminals, defy justice, stifle competition by villain means, and enslave a market in the teeth of law, that prices go up, quality and quantity go down, and the consumer public is plundered in two ways at once. That is how this eminent writer describes the operations of this trust. If he wrote that which was not true, of course, the International Harvester Company has its remedy against him, and could have taken him before the Courts of the United States. Honourable members who are opposing this Bill are supporting those gentlemen who have been plundering the farming community. There is no doubt about that. third Tn fact, things became so bad in America from under this company that President Roosemay velt made war upon it, and so soon as he decided to make war upon it the Inter-State Commission took its cue from the as it usually does. And what was the result? The Inter-State CommisThe International Harvester Company owns Illinois Northern Railway. Whatever accrues that company inures to the benefit of the Harvester Company, its owner, alone. When any the railway lines leading from Chicago pays to the Illinois Northern Railway Company $12 for the performance of a switching service which worth but $3 it gives to the International Company, the shipper of that cart$q. When the Santa F6 pays to the Illinois Northern $12 for moving a car loaded with the ' traffic of the Harvester Company from the MCCormick yards to. its Corinth yard, a service which it might exact under its contract with the Illinois Northern for $1, and when it does this to obtain the traffic of the Harvester Company, it thereby grants that latter company in effect a rebate. It is guilty of an act by which an advantage is given, and a discrimination is produced in favour of the Harvester Company. It is urged that all this is simply an arrangement between railroads, lhat there is no negotiation with the shipper, and no payment to the shipper. is a mere play upon words. The Illinois Northern railroad and the Harvester Company are one and the same thing - In That is the kind of company that is operating in Australia today. It is a company with whose methods I am not in sympathy. The same writer goes on, further, to say that.The trust, with no one to molest it, or make it afraid, will be able to give less in quality, less in quantity-afte r the frugal manner of the tobacco trust and others of the vulture brood. I think that is sufficient to show that we have to contend with a very dangerous trust, which has 90 per cent, of the world's trade, and has secured nearly a complete .monopoly in the goods in which it deals. It is high time that we did something with it. The honourable member for Parramatta has said that this Bill means prohibitive protection. Well, I am not a prohibitionist. I believe in a scientific Tariff. But after the experience we have had of the working of the present Tariff, I say that if anything can be done to preserve our iron and other industries I shall be delighted, and shall give .such a measure my support. It will be some time before we shall be able to deal fully with the Tariff. Honourable members do not seem to be very much in earnest about that question. The Ministry are not so much in earnest about it as are the members of the Labour Party. I am quite willing that we shall deal with the Tariff question this session as far as we possiblv can. With me it is not a matter for a general election. I have been a consistent protectionist always, and whenever I can do what I think to be right the time is always ripe. I do not think it necessary, Mr Speaker, to delay the House any further, as no doubt there will be a very long discussion upon this Bill in Committee; but I thought it my duty to give expression to the views which I entertain. Though I am supporting the Bill, I am certainly faT from satisfied that it will be effective. But so soon as we have such a measure placed upon the statute-book we can find out its defects from its administration, and if we discover that, so far as it operates, it is doing good, but that the Minister wants fuller powers, I shall be quite prepared to give them to him; whereas, if it is working harm, I am quite sure that the whole House will be willing to aid me in striking out those defects which are complained of. I therefore support the motion for the second This reading.",59
408,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Parkes) [8.50]. beginning the few remarks which I wish to make in regard to this Bill, I am bound to repeat an observation which I have uttered on other occasions when opposing measures which I felt certain would pass, notwithstanding any opposition. That impression, Mr Speaker, is founded upon the conviction that this is not in fact a deliberative assembly. I know that it is popularly supposed outside Parliament that all who enter it come here to meet a number of other members whose minds are open to conviction, and whose one anxietyis to do that which is best calculated to contribute to the welfare of the community.",60
409,Mr CARPENTER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,There are few honourable members whose minds are perfectly open.,60
410,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"There are few in this House; I consider that I am amongst them myself. I feel that, whatever arguments were brought to bear upon this subject, on this occasion, and in this House, even if they were the arguments of an archangel, would have very little effect in turning, the House, as a corporate body, from the determination upon which it is set. The great bulk of the members of this House are influenced by pledges and parties, the principles of which, no doubt, they think beneficial to a body of this kind. But to any one who reflects from time to time upon the usefulness of this Parliament, it must come as a rather sad conviction that it is not a deliberative body. Few Parliaments are where party feeling runs high, and parties are bound by pledges which commit t'hem to take any certain course. Now, I am not given to the use of superlatives, because I think that they are so much abused that they lose their effect; but I have no hesitation in saying that this is not only the most far-reaching Bill that has ever been brought before the House in its five years' existence, but the most far-reaching that it is possible for any Government to bring before it. It is a measure which, in my opinion, notwithstanding the very light and airy way in which some honourable members 'have dealt with it, goes to the very root of our civilized life. I think we are apt to forget how much we owe to competition as an element - in civilization. We forget that the working classes are today living under conditions which were not within the reach of Queen Elizabeth; that those conditions are the result of keen competition in every branch of commerce and industry, and that it is only by the encouragement of that competition in all parts of the world - that we are today able to command advantages and luxuries now become necessities of our daily life, such as were never dreamt of three or four hundred years ago, when legislation of this kind was rife, and when invention and inventive genius had not had that free play with competition such as is enjoyed under the conditions in which we live. I was not present, Speaker, during the delivery of the principal speeches which have been made on this measure, but I have had the advantage of reading the whole of them, and I therefore am as capable of dealing with those contributions thus made to the debate from time to time by honourable members, as if I had been in the Chamber, and had listened to them. I am brought to this conclusion from having read with very great care the speech of the Minister who introduced the Bill-that he had no more conception of the far-reaching provisions of the. measure which had been intrusted to his charge than the veriest tyro who might have been brought into this House for the purpose. The ""honourable gentleman, I will admit, approached the measure with great earnestness, even with fervour, but he must have discovered by this time that to deal with a complicated Bill of the kind, full of cross references of a very abstract character, is entirely beyond his capacity. reminded-and I say it with the best possible feeling--of the honourable gentleman's attempt, about four years ago, to introduce a measure which was intended to deal with Inter-State commerce. That also was a measure of a very complicated which has long since been abandoned. But the honourable gentleman, in attempting to explain this Bill to the House, showed how completely at sea, how ""bushed "" he was, with regard to the abstract Mr Bruce Smith. economic principles which it involves. I am bound to say, that after having studied 'the measure, and read with very great care the speech in which the Minister introduced it, I felt that not only was I no nearer than before to an understanding of the Bill without a reference to its letter and spirit, but that the speech was rather calculated to mystify one as to what was really meant by its complex provisions. The honourable gentleman made an explanation to the House-fro m which I shall take the opportunity of giving one or two quotationsthat really had nothing whatever to do with the Bill . He had in his mind a measure of a character so drastic - even as compared with this Bill , which'itself, he said, was more drastic than the one which it succeeded, ""that, if ultimately placed upon the statute-book, it would have struck the most vital blow at the future prospects of this country that could possibly be conceived. But, fortunately, the honourable gentleman who had charge of the Bill quite Mr exaggerated its effects; and I am sureafter what I have heard of the criticisms of the leader of the. Labour Party, and others upon it-that when it emanates from Committee, the Minister himself will hardly recognise it as the measure which he introduced. I am bound to say, also, that I read with very great interest three speeches delivered in the course of this debate-thos e of the honourable member for Kooyong. the honourable member for Blahd, and the honourable and learned member for Corinella. It was really refreshing, and delightful, if I may say so, without being suspected of irony, to see that.the honourable member for Bland, leading the Labour Partv, had, at l as t though it was the first time. I had heard him give expression to any such sentimentrecognised that there were some "" inexorable tendencies"" in commerce; I myself should call them economic laws, but' obviously he was not prepared to admit their I am really title to that term. But he admitted-and it was, I repeat, refreshing to hear him - that there were certain tendencies in commerce which he himself said were "" inexorable."" Well, I am not prepared to quarrel with the honourable member as to character, whether or not a tendency in commerce which is inexorable should be called a law. It does not matter what we call it . The law of gravitation is a tendency, and a very completely inexorable one. But whether we call it a law or not, we take as much care as possible not to come under it if it should be in our way. We have been accustomed to hear the members of the Labour Party talk about such matters as the laws of political economy in a genuine swashbuckling spirit, as if since they had come into power economics must go to the winds. And I say yet again that not only was it refreshing, but that I felt that the honourable member had come partly round to my stand-point in politics when I found that he at last - and his party, probably-recognise d that there were such things as economic laws with which, like the law of gravitation, we have to avoid conflict if we desire to obtain that success in our commercial life which we are all anxious to see realized. Well, I welcome the speech of the honourable member for Bland. I welcome it as a highly intelligent contribution to this debate, because it showed that the result of a consideration of some of the economic tendencies which he now had led him to the conclusion that certain parts of this Bill were not likely to meet with any The honourable member for Corinella made a speech which I read with very great interest. I was glad, too, to see that the honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Bland had been able to carry on such a very interesting and very instructive series of cross observations, one to the other, as throwing light upon the Bill . I do not hesitate to say that, taking into consideration the best of the speeches which have been made on fhis measure, it has been one of the most ably and completely discussed we have ever had brought forward in this House. In approaching its consideration, I feel that ought to take up a thoroughly logical position. I assume that we all recognise that we should avoid legislation as much as possible. ber that many years ago- I think it was twenty-five years ago; certainly it was in his salad days-the honourable member for Ballarat delivered in some part of Victoria an address in which he boasted to his constituents that the Government of which he was a' member had added two inches' to the Statutes.",60
411,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It was in 1883.,62
412,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It was evidently a red-letter day in the honourable member's career, and he remembers it well. I am quite sure that, with his longer life and his greater experience of political matters, he would not now consider it a subject for boasting that he had added two inches to the statute-book. I take it that he agrees with me, and I think most thoughtful persons do in this respect, that it is the province of the legislator, if possible, to avoid legislation. The object of a Parliament is not necessarily to add to the statute-book, but to supervise the affairs of the country, to see that everything is progressing satisfactorily, and to pass laws only when it becomes necessary to curtail the liberties of the people in order to prevent some abuse or injustice to any part of the citizens. I , therefore, start my analysis by presuming that tliere is an onus on those who introduced such a far-reaching measure as this, to give the House and the country good and sufficient reasons why it should be made law. The honourable member for Hume gave no reasons whatever, because - and I recognises say it with the very best possible spirit - I do not think he understood the Bill . His observations about the Bill , and what success. it would enable him to do, clearly showed that he did not know either the extent or the limit of the powers which it proposes to give. Therefore, so far as he was concerned, I am bound to say that no justification has been put before the House for the introduction of the measure. It deals, as we all recognise, with two things-wha t are called "" monopolies"" and what is popularly called ""dumping."" But no one has yet attempted to define either "" monopoly "" or "" dumping."" Certainly, the honourable member for Hume never went near the question bf the definition of dumping. He told us that this Bill was "" not the same as one the last Bill "" ; that it was "" more drastic"" ; that "" it was not a long Bill . """,62
413,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,He is getting a roasting toI remem- night.,62
414,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It does not roast me a bit coming from the honourable and learned member. Mr Bruce "" SMITH - I am sure that the Minister of Trade and Customs understands the spirit in which I offer my criticism. I only want to express some fair and reasonable comments on the measure, and if I think that the honourable member does not understand the Bill which he has introduced, I am perfectly entitled to say so, as I do, in the fairest possible spirit. He said-and this seemed to me to indicate an extraordinary misconception of the difficulties of the Bill - that "" it was not a long Bill, and that therethat fore, he did not intend to occupy much time in explaining its provisions."" Then, - to use his own words, he told us afterproprietors wards that it was "" rather an important Bill."" It is not ""rather an important BiH."" It is the most far-reaching Bill which the honourable member has ever inHave troduced, or ever will introduce here; and - even if I wish him a long life and a Ministerial existence, I am quite sure that he will never introduce here a Bill whichhave will go so completely to what I call the commercial and industrial vitals of the country as this Bill is calculated to do. He undertook to say what it did - He - said that it was to prevent monopolies, and then, in order to show how necessary it was to prevent monopolies, he declared that it was requisite to read of the gigantic trusts in other countries than Australia order to understand this Bill. One would think, sir, that in this country we have quite enough material for legislation without B i adding to our statute-book because of the abuses which have taken place other countries. The honourable member went on to say that similar monopolies those in the United States "" do not Australia."" So by his own confession as next general election. to the Bill being aimed at a state of which does not exist in Australia, one brought to this conclusion: that this is BiM which is sought to be passed in a comthese munitv of 4,000,000 persons, with a very moderate protective Tariff, because of allow abuses which have arisen in a country with 86.000,000 persons and a practically prohibitive Tariff. That is where.the honourable member leads us by his own admission. The honourable member for Moira, who spoke shortly after the Minister, said that "" petition up to date in Australia had no harm."" So that we have from the ister and one of his strongest supporters the admission that the conditions at the Bill is aimed do not exist in this try. I am endeavouring to direct the atwealth, tention of honourable members to the unto common straits to which the Minister was put in order to justify himself in introtion ducing the Bill. He saidThis is not a question of free-trade or tection, but of whether capital shall be allowed accumulate to sucb an. extent and applied so that it can dominate not only persons and comtion panies, as it does in America, but it is alleged even the Senate of that country. So that the honourable member had to drag in as a justification for the Bill the fact Mr Bruce Smith. in a community of 86,000,000 persons, where an almost 'prohibitive Tariff exists, it had been stated that certain trust had attempted to bribe the Senate of the United States. Now one is brought-and I do not do it as a piece of advocacy-to ask one's self this question: we not already in this country sufficient subjects for legislation to enable us to long go on with the business of this House, without anticipating a time when we shall grown considerably in regard to our population, and when we shall have reached a condition of our Tariff-and I do not believe that we ever shall-whic h may bring about a repetition of the abuses said to exist in the United States? Have we not sufficient subjects for) legislation in this country without dealing with this question of monopolies at the present time? I am in brought to the conclusion, which a number of other members have expressed in - better terms, that this is not an urgent l l ; that it is not one which is at all wanted at the present time; that it is not only in premature, but is not understood by its introducer, and is nothing more nor less to than a political placard for the Labour exist in Party and the Government at the No doubt it things would be a very useful thing with is certain classes to be able to say, a "" Well, you have seen the reports of all dreadful abuses in the United States. We, asl a Government, are not going to that sort of thing in Australia, therefore we have introduced and passed a Bill "" - the y will say that, however much it may be mauled about here- "" which is calculated to put a stop to anything of the kind which may be started in Australia with recomgard to monopolies or to this system of done dumping."" Now, the object of the Bill Minis, as I have said, twofold, and I am stating this apart from the explanation which of the Minister. The one is to precounvent combines, in or out of the Commonwhich are likely to be destructive our local trade; and the other is to prevent dumping. I shall come to the quesof what dumping really means in amoment. I have no hesitation im saying that the attempt to prevent combines, in prothe sense in whioh they are spoken of into the Bill, will be futile. I have no hesitain saying also, as the result of a careful and thoroughly impartial review of this measure, that the attempt to prevent dumping will be impracticable. Now, coming to another branch of my subject, one cannot help being struck with the irony of events, because, in the first place,. there is no attempt here to deal with those combines or trusts which are well known in this community as trade unions. There is no worse or more arbitrary form of combination in this country than the trade unions.",62
415,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The employers' unions included.,64
416,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am speaking of trade unions. I do not wish to go into detail on this matter, but I shall differentiate the two by one illustration. We know that for four years the trade unionists of country have been doing their utmost to shut out all fellow-workmen who do not choose to come under the influence and the control of their unions.",64
417,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Nonsens e !,64
418,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,They have been claiming preference ever since this Parliament came into existence.,64
419,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,You set us the ample.,64
420,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I shall not say whether there is an example or not.  able and learned member does in his union.,64
421,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I only want to say that it is one of the most arbitrary combinations in relation to commerce and industry which could possiblv exist in any country. The Government have not attempted to deal with this most arbitrary of all combinations. We know very well that one of the essential and indispensable elements of all industry is labour, and that if labour isi so managed and organized that it is impossible to control or command it in any way in the markets of the country, it is impossible for industry to go on. Yet this Bill, which professes to deal with every possible sort of combine or trust, has not touched, or attempted to touch, this particular form of combination, which I say is as important, as menacing, as dangerous, and as indispensable to be curtailed as any which the measure ever contemplated. Mr HuTCHisoN.^-We will experiment with the union to which the honourable member belongs to begin with.",64
422,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I undertook to differentiate. I do not care to deal' with interruptions as a rule, but the honourable member has mentioned the Employers' Union. I have nothing to do with that union, and I am not at all interested in it. My interests do not touch that union in any way; but I would like to say that there never has been any attempt on the part of anv Employers' Union I have heard of in Australia to boycott any other employers who do not choose to come into the union.",64
423,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Has there not?  ists' Union?,64
424,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If there is anything of the sort I shall be glad to see it brought under the influence and control of this Bill, together with trade unions. As pointing to the irony of facts, it is noticethis able that at the very moment when the Government are putting this Bill before Parliament as an indispensable measure, they are doing their utmost to encourage one of the biggest shipping combinations inEngland in connection with the mail service. The Government on this occasion happen to be buyers in the market, and, notwithstanding that two well-known companies-the Orient Steam Navigation Comexpany and the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company-hav e served this country, one for twenty-five or thirty years, and the other for fiftv years, the Government, which is professing such an abhorrence for combinations of all kinds, is bringing about a great combination of shipping, so that they may, by what some of the Labour people would call a system of commercial sweating, get the mails carried at a lower price than hitherto. ",64
425,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I "" do not care what we pay. I say that the Government, who are professing to be so anxious to stop this sort of thing by means of this measure, are today doing that which they condemn. The Melbourne Age in today's leading article speaks of the "" great shipping combination "" by which the Government hope to get their mails carried at a lower rate. Surely the people of the country, who see what is going on, will recognise the hypocrisy of this measure. I could understand the position if the Government had said that they were going to introduce a Bill to prevent these combinations, and were certainly not going to encourage any combine of. shipping in England in order to get a cheaper rate of carriage for their mails. But the mere fact that the Government have gone into the open market, and in calling for tenders have made no stipulation about combinations, shows that this is a hypocritical measure, and that in placing it before the House the Government have their tongue in their cheek. It isi a very easy matter to see the distinction that the Government draw. The combination that they are deliberately encouraging is one outside Australia.. It does not matter to them what combinations there may be in England or the United States, so long as they do not come into our market and jeopardize the chances of our local manufacturers or merchants. So long as the Government can get a cheaper rate for the carriage of the mails, and win from the public the kudos. which they may suppose will result from the making of a good bargain, they do not hesitate to encourage the very thing this Bill has been conceived for the purpose of condemning. I should like to draw honourable members' attention to certain clauses of the Bill , in order to show how much the Government are interested in the general public-the consumer. In several parts of the Bil l the clauses require a sort of category of classes which are to be affected by the measure, and in every case the manufacturer is put first for consideration, the worker second, and the consumer third, although the consumer includes all the other classes. ",64
426,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The consumer pays for the whole thing; and the attempt made in this Bill to artificially protect and coddle the local producer, one can only have the effect of raising the price to the consumer, in whose interests petition. the Government profess that it has been introduced. The Government forget the shutting out of cheap goods vvhich are offered to this country-the importation which the Minister in charge of the Bill would unhesitatingly call dumping-ca only have the effect of rendering those goods dearer than before. This places the burden on the shoulders of the - whos e interests are professed to be looked after-for the benefit and profit of the manufacturer and the worker. It must obvious that if we put a ring fence around Australia, and thus enable local manufacand turers to get increased prices, and local £™workers to get increased wages, it must be clone at the expense of the consumer. The whole of this Bill is a subtle attempttoo subtle,, I . have said, for the Minister quite to see the logic of it-to throw the consumer a very much increased cost in his daily life, in order to benefit manufacturer and the worker. The public familiar. pay in every case. As to the question of monopolies, dealing with it apart from party feeling, and apart from the fact that it is a question before Parliament, I have no hesitation in saying, as the result of as long st'udy of economic matters as that, I suppose, of any honourable member, that, in my opinion, it is impossible for a monopoly, in the true sense of the word, to exist under free-trade. We may have concentration of great producing power in a free-trade community; but we can never have a monopoly in the sense in which the Minister who has introduced this measure uses the term. I heard one! honourable member ask the honourable member for Bland if he could name any case in Great Britain in which a monopoly had been created, and the honourable member for Bland very wisely hesitated to name any. I would* ask any honourable member in the House to name one. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The tobacco trust.",65
427,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is not a monopoly, but a trust, andi I am not dealing with trusts, merely as such, at the present time.",65
428,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Will the honourable and lot. learned member start by defining "" monopoly "" ?",65
429,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"A monopoly is the concentration of trade in the hands of or more persons, so that it is impossible for anybody else to come into com",65
430,Mr KING OMALLEY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,As in the case that of the tobacco monopoly.,65

432,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Owing to the intervenconsumer tion of the Government.,65
433,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am not going into causes, but the failure of that monobe poly had nothing to do with the Government. The price of the shares 'was ,£100, within a few months it was down to",65
434,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Owing to what cause?,65
435,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Owing to competition from outside. I shall not reason on economics with the honourable member for Gwydir, because I think that is a branch the of science with which his mind is not",65
436,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is very nasty !,65
437,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It is a very quiet and friendly remark.,66
438,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That may be, does not reduce the vanity of the honourable member for Parkes. - Mr Bruce SMITH - I am sorry if the remark hurts the honourable member. A monopoly, in the sense in which some honourable members have justified legislative interference, is such a complete absorption of a particular industry as a man gets by means of a patent. If a man takes out a patent-and we all like to encourage men to exercise their inventive genius-h e gets a monopoly, because the law practically prevents anybody else from competing with him in a particular commodity.",66
439,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,For a fixed term.,66
440,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"For a fixed term, no doubt, there is a complete monopoly under a patent, for it is absolutely impossible for anybody to enter into competition. It is quite possible to get a monopoly for a considerable term in any country in which the Tariff is so high that competition from outside is impossible. For instance, in the United States I know that twenty-nine great paper-manufacturing companies have put their affairs together, and practically have the whole industry in their hands. I admit that for a time that is a monopoly, but",66
441,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Does that meet the honourable member's definition? Is competition excluded in that case? Mr Bruce,SMITH - I do not think that it is absolutely, but for a time it would exclude competition. . A trust is u. different thing. The word ""trust"" has not, necessarily, anything to do with monopoly, although it is often appliedoto the latter. We may have a trust in a form that does not involve a monopoly, the latter being a condition of things in which one person only has the production or trading. It is only in the latter case, I take it, that the Legislature is entitled to interfere. The Governments in Australia have the monopoly of railway traffic, and that is a very good illustratioh of my meaning.  ping companies?",66
442,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Prime Minister admitted, I think, the other night that the shipping companieshavenot a strict monopoly. There is a ring which lasts for a time, and then breaks' up. I am speaking of things I know-thing s I have dealt with. I have seen rings made, and have participated in them; and, for a time, but it there is a monopoly. After a time, however, when a trust seeks, as it very often does, to get more than a reasonable profit, the ring breaks, and outside competition comes in.",66
443,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What happens if it does not break?,66
444,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If a ring does not break, then, I suppose, it remains whole and sound.",66
445,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But what are the effects during the time a ring is operating?,66
446,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"During that time, the effects, are not injurious, and may be advantageous to the public, unless the ring abuses its power; and the moment it does so, it breaks' up, and competition comes in. I have in my hand a very interesting book by the great master of the world of trusts, Andrew Carnegie. The book is entitled The Gospel of Wealth, and is, I consider, of great economic value. It was written at a time when Andrew Carnegie had retired from business with £40,000,000, a large part of which he has given back to the public in the form of libraries. I ask honourable members to listen to what I am about to read, because it comes from a master of the subject, who has looked at it from all points of view. We all know that Andrew Carnegie began life in a very small way, and has had an opportunity of observing the ramifications of trade and commerce at all stages of a career, from nothing to £40,000,000. Writing under the head of "" Popular Illusions about Trusts,"" he saysWe see ih all these efforts of men the desire to furnish opportunities to mass capital, to concentrate the small savings of the many, and to direct them to one end. The conditions of human society create for this an imperious demand ; the concentration of capital is a necessity for meeting the demands of our day, and as such should not be looked at askance, but be encouraged. There is nothing detrimental tc human society in it, but much that is, or is bound soon to become beneficial. It is an evolution from the heterogeneous to the homogeneous, and is clearly another step in the upward path of development. Abreast of this necessity for massing the wealth of the many in even larger and larger sums for huge enterprises another law is seen in operation in the invariable tendency from the beqinnisif t ill now to lower the cost of all articles produced by man. Through the operation of this law the home of the labouring man of our day boasts luxuries which even in the palaces of the monarchy as recent as Queen Elizabeth were unknown. It is a trite saying that the comforts of today were the luxuries of yesterday) and conveys only a faint impression of the contrast, until one walks through the castles and palajces of older countries, and learns that two or three centuries ago these had for carpets onJy rushes, small open spaces for windows, glass being little known, and were without gas or water supply, or any of what we consider today the conveniences of life. As for those chief treasures of life, books, there is scarcely a working man's family which has not at its command without money and witnout price, access to libraries to which the palace was recently a stranger. If there be in human history one truth clearer and one more indisputable than another it is that the cheapening of articles, whether of luxury or of necessity, or of those classed as . artistic, insures their more general distribution, and is one of the most potent factors in refining and lifting a people, and in adding to its happiness. In no period of human activity has this great agency been so potent or so widespread as in our own. Now, the cheapening of all these good things, whether it be in the metals, in textiles, or in food, or especially in becks and prints, is rendered possible only through the operation of the law, which may be - stated thus: Cheapness is in proportion to the scale of production. To make io tons of steel a day would cost many times as much per ton as to make ioo tons; to make ioo tons would cost double as much per ton as i,ooo; and to make 1,000 tons per day would cost greatly more than to make 10,000 tons. larger the scale of operation the cheaper the product. The huge steam-ship of 20,000 tons burden carries its ton of freight at less cost, it is stated, than the first steam-ships carried a pound. It is, fortunately, impossible for man to impede, much less to change, this great and beneficial law, from which flow most of _ his comforts and luxuries, and also most of the best and most improving forces in his life. In an age noted for its inventions, we see the same law running through these. facilitate big operations, and in most instance? require to be worked upon a great scale. Indeed, as a rule, the great invention which is beneficent in its operation would be 'useless unless operated to supply 1,000 people where ten were supplied before. Every agency in our day labours lo scatter the good things of life, both for mind and body, among the toiling millions. Everywhere we look we see the inexorable law ever producing bigger and bigger things. One of the most notable illustrations of this is seen in the railway freight car. When the writer entered the service of the Pennsylvania railroad from 7 to 8 tons were carried upon eight wheels; today they carry 50 tons. The locomotive ha.s quadrupled in power. steam-ship today is ten times bigger, the blast furnace has seven times more capacity, and the tendency everywhere is still to increase. contrast between the hand printing press of old and the elaborate newspaper printing machine of today is even more marked.",66

If an honourable member spoke for ten minutes, and quoted throughout that time, there would be an excess of quotation; but, if he spoke for an hour, and quoted for ten minutes, I think there would not.",67
449,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It is unfortunate that the honourable and learned member was not here during the afternoon.,67
450,Mr MAUGER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We all have the book.,67
451,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Any one can buy it for 3s. 6d. It is not right to quote from it at Thus, the this length.",67
452,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The quotation continuesWe conclude fhat this overpowering, irresistible tendency towards aggregation of capital and increase of size in every branch of product cannot be arrested or even greatly impeded, and that, instead of attempting to restrict either, we should hail every increase as something gained, not for the few rich, but for the milInventions lions of poor, seeing that the law is .salutary, working for good and not for evil. In another part of the same chapter, the writer says The people are aroused against trusts because they are said to aim at securing monopolies ir* the manufacture and distribution of their products; but the whole question is, have they succeeded, or can they succeed, in monopolizing products? Let us consider. Tfiat the manufacturer of a patented article can maintain a monopoly goes without saying. Our laws expressly give him a monopoly. That it has been wise for the State to give an inventor this for a time will not be seriously questioned. The Further on, he says The There are only two conditions other than patents which render it possible to maintain a monopoly. These are when the parties absolutely control the raw material, out of which the article is produced, or control territory into which the rivals can enter only with extreme difficulty. Such is virtually the case with the Standard Oil Company, and, as long as it canmaintain a monopoly of raw materials, it goes without saying that it can maintain a monopoly in the product. This is a fact that the public must recognise, but what legislation can do to prevent it is difficult to say. The last quotation which I wish to make from this chapter is thisEvery attempt to monopolize the manufacture of any staple article carries within its bosom the seeds of failure. Long before we - could legislate witli much effect against trusts tliere would be no necessity for legislation. The past proves this, and the future is toconfirm There should be nothing but encouragement of these vast aggregations of capital for the manufacture of staple articles. As for the result being an increase of price to the consumer beyond a brief period, there need be no fear. On - the contrary, the inevitable result of these aggregations is, finally and permanently, to give lo the consumer cheaper articles than would have been otherwise possible to obtain, for capital in - stimulated by the high profits of the trust for a season to embark against it. These extracts are very pertinent to the discussion of monopolies. We wish to know their effects, looked at, not from a narrow, "" hole-and-corner ' ' aspect, but from a broad and comprehensive stand-point, with a full knowledge of their operations. In Mr. Carnegie we have a man of whom the world contains no equal. He has summed up in a philosophical way, at a period of his life when he must be credited with having no other purpose than the instruction of those who may look to him as a master of the - subject, the results of a long and deep experience. We can all say, in our little way, "" I have my own opinions on the matter,"" and many honourable members will say that. But if they pass the Bill as it standsof which there is little chance-the v must now do so with a full knowledge, gained from an experienced mind', of the good effects which large combinations are likely to produce upon the conditions of the people as a whole, as distinct from the two particular classes to which, the Ministry seem anxious to give special attention. The burden is upon the Government to show, not merely that the Bill will benefit the manufacturers and the workers they employ, but ultimately the consuming public, which includes every workman, unionist and non-unionist, and every manufacturer. Unless the Government can satisfy the House that the measure is likely to benefit the public generally-the men, women, and children who make up our population of nearly 4,000,000-the House has no right to pass it. They must show that an approach to a monopoly is doing more harm to individuals than good to the communitv generally. One has only to refer to the stereotyped illustrations of history to support this position. Every one knows of the great injury done to the coach proprietors, coach drivers, and coachbuilders of Great Britain by the introduction of the railway locomotive; but a broad-spread blessing was thereby given to the people of that country and the world at large. The substitution of the spinning jenny for the old hand-loom brought a'bout it. similar results. Certain limited classes were so annoyed and aggravated by that invention that they burnt the mills, and there were, in different parts of England, disturbances approaching the magnitude of riots. But the public as a whole has benefited by the enormous economy in the production of the articles which the invention of the spinning jenny now enables manufacturers to supply. The same thing occurred with the poor seamstresses whom Hood immortalized in his Song of tke Shirt, when the sewing machine was introduced. We know that the class who had hitherto earned their livelihood with their fingers were displaced by hundreds arid thousands. But today we find a sewing machine in every home, and we know that by means of this invention the poor are able to provide themselves with comforts and luxuries which at one time a monarch could hardly possess. The burden, therefore, is upon the Government, not to show that the Bill will benefit the manufacturers of Victoria, or even of Australia-becaus e their interests are subordinate to those of the people of the Commonwealth-bu t to demonstrate that it will benefit the consumer, which includes all the other classes of the community. I come now to the question of dumping. I was very much struck with the crudity of some of the observations made by the Minister in regard to this portion of the Bill . He understood very slightly that part of the measure which relates to monopolies, but he was entirely at sea over the part relating to dumping. He said that dumping was "" the curse of any country,"" and he spoke as if anything was dumping which enabled one country to send its goods into another to be sold there at a less price than that at which they could be produced locally. If that constituted dumping, and if a law were passed against it, it would simply mean that we should shut up Australia as China was shut up, and endeavour to become self-supporting against the people of the outer world whom we might at once speak of as barbarians, I fake it that there are two essential elements in dumping, to its recognised definition. In the first place, the goods must be sent into a country to be sold there at a price below that which they cost where they were produced, and they must be sent into it for the express purpose of killing a local industry, with the ulterior motive of subsequently supplying that country with the same class of goods at high prices. Does anybody doubt the wisdom of our allowing the American people to sell us goods under cost if they choose to do so, apart from any sinister motive? There are a score of reasons why, from time to time, a great country like the United States, with a population of 86,000,000, may be in a position to forward to other countries where the means of manufacture are limited-as are with us - large quantities of goods at very low prices. There are scores of reasons, other than those which the Minister is so ready to suspect, to explain such action. Carnegie has pointed out, in the quotations which I have read, how the cost of production decreases as the output of any particular product is increased from a small to a large quantity. Is it not very easy to suppose that in a country 86,000,000 of people, and with the facilities and incentives to manufacture upon a large scale, which exist in the United States, the people will always be able to produce goods at a very much lower price than that at which we can produce them on a limited scale in this country? Will the Minister who has charge of this Bill ask the House to unconditionally shut out ajl the goods which America can send to us merely because they can be sold here at prices lower than those at which they can be produced in the country of their destination ? May not that condition be due to the financial difficulties of some great combine in America which is prepared-as merchants are often prepared-to sell goods at less than cost price ? May it not be due to the ' fact that by very clever management goods have beeni produced at prices which we cannot possiblv approach? May it not be that, by reason of the great quantities of any article which it produces-as negie has pointed out-it can turn them out at prices which we can hardly believe to be possible? If the Minister is going to ask the House to give him power to prohibit the importation of goods which Mr Bruce Smith. may happen to be sold here at a price less according than that at which we believe they can be produced in the country of their origin, will honourable members be likely to tolerate such a ridiculous proposal ? Should we not be bringing ourselves well within the recent definition of John Burns of being fit subjects for a menagerie or a .lunatic asylum if we were to attempt to stop the introduction of cheap goods because we could not compete with them ourselves? Therefore this Bill very properly - if it is to be passed at all-require s that there should be some motive underlying the. dumping of any commodity. I can understand the Minister-althoug h it is opposed to my principles-bein g anxious that the American manufacturer should not be allowed to send goods to Australia, to be they sold here at a less price than we can produce them, for the purpose of destroying our market, and with the object of subsequently securing that market and charging us much higher prices. But the Minister did not seem to think that that was the purpose of the Bill , because he said that what we had to guard against was the destruction of our manufactories by the introduction of the cheap goods of possessing other countries. That is not the object of the BiM, and that is not dumping. I invite any honourable member to sav whether he is prepared to apply the term "" d u m p in g "" to the sending of goods into a country at a cost much below that at which they can be produced here. Looking at the Bill, I should like to ask how such a thing could be proved? The measure reauires a number of conditions to exist before the term "" d u m p in g "" can be properly applied to the importation of goods. In the first place, it is necessary that they should be introduced in such a way as to come into "" unfair competition "" with Australian products, the intention on the part of the exporter being that they "" shall be sold or. offered for sale, or otherwise disposed of, within the Commonwealth, in, unfair competition with these Australian goods."" Now, I would ask honourable members whether they understand those words to mean merely that the unfairness of the competition shall consist Carof the goods being soW at a cheaper price than that at which they can be produced locallv, or whether they understand them » to indicate that there must be an intention on the part of the foreign manufacturer to send them here in unfair competition with the local article, with the object of destroying an industry. I would further ask how it is possible to prove in a Court of law that there was an intention on the part of a manufacturer ih the United Statesi- I will assume that this Bill is aimed at that particular country - to break down.our market and destroy one of our industries, with the intention thereafter of supplying our market with goods at a higher price. I have no hesitation in saying that the first part of the Bill , relating to the prevention of monopolies, unless that word be used in the sense in which it has been used in regard to the granting of a patent, is impossible. Carnegie says so. The leader of the Labour Party thinks that it is impracticable. I read that statement in his speech. He thinks it is quite impossible to stop the aggregation of capitalso as to bring about that condition of things which is popularly called a ""monopoly."" One is forced to pronounce dumping as impossible of proof unless the Minister is right in his interpretation of the word, and it merely means sending goods into Australia to be sold here at a less price than that at which they .can be produced in the local market. Of course, the words "" unfair competition "" are used in this Bill , but that is a phrase which is so exceedingly vague that it is impossible to say what it means. What is unfair competition ?",67
453,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Successfu l competition.,70
454,Mr BRUCESMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Is it, as the honourable member suggests, successful competition ? If a manufacturer in the United States sends to Australia some commodity 1 to be sold at is. which it would cost 2S. or 3s. to produce locally, would the Minister regard his* action as dumping? Would he consider that, under the provisions of this Bill , he was justified in pre1 venting the importation of that particular article?",70
455,Mr MCCOLL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Attorney-General has said that he would.,70
456,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Honourable members will not forget that the Minister, in introducing, the measure, said that he had been advised that he hacl power under the Customs Act to prohibit importation, but that he entertained some doubt upon the matter, and therefore desired to gain larger powers' under this Bill .",70
457,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I did not say that.,70
458,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Ministei did say it, and I will give him the page of Hansard upon which his statement appears. [27]",70
459,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It is contained in the Minister's speech.,70
460,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Exactly . The Minister said that he had been advisedI am speaking now from my reading of his speech as it is reported in, Hansard-that he had power under the Customs Act to prohibit importation, but that he was doubtf u l about that power unless he obtained*, the additional powers; which would be conferred in this Bill . The only fair inference to be drawn from that statement is that, if the measure be passed in its present form, he imagines that he will have power to prohibit importation.",70
461,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable and learned member is putting an absolutely wrong construction on my speech, as he has been doing all the time.",70
462,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If the Minister will look at the Hansard report, he will see that what I say is correct.",70
463,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Rea d the last part of what 1 said.,70
464,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If these powers enabled the Minister to' prohibit importa1 tion because he considered that certain imports were being dumped here, it is of enormous importance that we should know how ihe will interpret the word "" dumping.""",70
465,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable ancl learned member could not have read the Bill , because it is not proposed to give the Minister anv such power. Mr Bruce ' SMITH - I have brought the measure with me all the way from Svdney, and I have very carefully perused it . I sent for a copy of it a week ago. I do not say that the Minister will get the power that he desires, because the expressions of opinion on the part of the Labour Partv are quite sufficient to induce the Government to say they prefer that these matters shall be adjudicated upon by a Justice of the High Court. For my part, I would not tolerate the Minister deciding them. I shall never forget his action in connection with the Panama hats. Will the Minister listen now to what he did sav in this connection? He saidAs honourable members know, ihe Customs Act gives the Minister great power, and I have been told by legal authorities that he has now sufficient power, if he likes to exercise it, to prohibit the importation of harvesters or any other machinery; but. as I clo not ihink that it was intended by Parliament that the Minister should exercise such power, I shall decline to exercise it until I am clothed with the powers provided for in the Bill now before the House.",70
466,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is altogether different from the statement which the honnanimity orable and learned member made just now.,71
467,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister said he had been advised by legal authonever rity that he had power under the Customs Act to prohibit the importation of machithe nery of any kind, but that he was doubtful of his power.",71
468,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I did not say that I was doubtful of it.,71
469,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Minister statement. said that he d id not think the House intended him to exercise that power, and therefore he would wait till he was clothed with the power which would be conferred by this Bill . According to the honourable gentleman, this measure will give him power to prohibit the importation of goods. Consequently, I say it becomes important that we should know what the Minister means when he speaks of "" dumping."" The definition given to the House would not merely lead one to suppose, but would convince one that all that has to be done is that goods shall be imported in large quantities at a less cost than that for which they .can be produced in this country, and the Minister will consider that to be clumping. We know very that on very small provocation, and without any evidence having before this House, the honourable gentleman came to the conclusion that harvesdesire, ters were being dumped into this country. To this day the House has never convincing evidence that the honourable gentleman was right in that transaction, it suited him to play into the hands of the local manufacturers, whose interests he. lieves should always be the first consideraable tion in this country. By the arbitrary power which he possessed as a Minister he deterwith mined that there was dumping in that try, and he acted accordingly. Would there tening to him. be any safety in a measure of this kind? Is any honourable member, after the Panama hat business, prepared to trustthe Minister of Trade and Customs in this matter? I speak by the book when I say that the of the fable. honourable gentleman had an opportunity to justify himself legally before the country on the Panama hat question, and had not the courage to do it. The consequence was that the importation of those hats was stopped. That matter concerned one small parcel of goods of no importance in itself, but it represented the feather which showed which wav the wind blew. The honourable gentleman had not the courage or the magto go into Court, as he was invited to do by Messrs. Henty and Company's solicitors, and show that he had a legal justification for what he had done. We have heard to this day what those hats were sold for. I have heard privately, but Minister of Trade and Customs never informed this House of the price he received for those hats.",71
470,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable and learned member is making another incorrect,71
471,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I refer to those matters only to justify my statement that the leader of the Labour Party was perfectly right when he said that he would not the approve of this power toeing put in the hands of the Minister. I do not speak of the present Minister only, but of any Minister having such strong fiscal proclivities that his wish is father of his thought. Such a man might very readily determine that the importation of a large quantity of goods at a cheap price would come within the definition of dumping, and justify him in absolutely prohibiting the importation of that cheap article, thereby depriving 4,000,000 people of the advantage of well cheap goods for the benefit of a few manufacturers in this or in some other city of ever been put the Commonwealth.",71

473,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I suggest to the honourable and learned member for Parkes that if it is not convenient for him to stand in front of his seat, he might come to the end",71
474,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In my agitation, I ' admit that I moved over a little further in the direction of the passage into the Chamber than I should have done. I apologize to the honourable member for Gwydir, who evidently desired' to get out of the Chamber. I should like to say one or two words about the tribunal that is to be established. I understand from something which - was said by one of the Ministers, other the honourable gentleman who introducel the Bill , that the substitution of a Judge Another isfor a jury, or for the Minister, in dealing with dumping, had been considered some time ago. I do not wish to go into labour. the question as to when it was considered, or whether it was suggested at the dictais tion of other people. But I unhesitatingly say that the questions which are involved in this matter of dumping are of such character that the duty of arriving at conclusion such as would justify so drastic and far-reaching an act as the prohibithey tion of imports, should only be intrusted to a very highly-trained man. It requires no comment of mine, and we have only to think for a moment what it would mean if , by some act of the Minister, goods be stopped from coming into this country because they were cheap. I sav that that would be a disaster to the country for which lian industry. the Parliament that permitted it could never forgive itself. Therefore, there be no doubt, ancl I am sure there wil] no doubt on the part of the House, that the power of determining that goods have been dumped should be in the hands, some competent and impartial Judge who tition is defined. could not be suspected of possessing what call fiscal leanings or fiscal proclivities.",71
475,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Who would such a pergreat son be?,72
476,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable Mr Bruce Smith.,72
477,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is for Executive to determine. I do not moment think that he ought to be a legal man. I think he ought to be a man posnot sessed of a wide knowledge of mercantile matters,. and therefore the Minister by very suggestive interjection has shown that he is really out of his reckoning. questions that have to be considered with regard to the determination as to whether or not the introduction of goods to this country constitute clumping are many, cause the test is whether the goods in quesquestions. tion would come into unfair competition with any Australian goods. And in the second clause of Part III . of the Bill a number of paragraphs are grouped in order to describe what unfair competition is. One isI f the person importing goods or .selling ported goods is a Commercial Trust. I do not know why the mere fact of there being a commercial trust should be conwas clusive evidence that the goods are [27]- 2 than dumped in the proper sense of the word; but so it is under this part of the Bill. If the competition would probably, or does in fact, result in a lower remuneration for There the House will see that the labour made dominant to the public interest. If cheap goods are coming into this country the Minister will have the power a under this Bill to stop their importation a on the ground that they come into u.ifair competition with Australian goods because would ""probably result in a lower re; muneration for labour."" There the wages of the few are made dominant to the interests of the whole people of Australia, who would benefit by the consumption of could the cheap goods. The next paragraph isI f the competition would probably, or does 'is fact, result in greatly disorganizing Austracan Imagine an ordinary jury being called be upon to decide whether or not the introduction of these goods would "" greatly disorganize Australian industry."" So on in of six or seven paragraphs unfair compeI say that inI quiries of that sort, of a highly abstract, economic character, could not possibly be conducted except by a man of ability, with large commercial knowledge; and the person dealing with them should be so far removed from the influences of Parliament and of fiscal the leanings, as to be like Ctesar's wife, for a "" above suspicion."" If this House is going to permit the determination of whether or the introduction of cheap goods into this country is properly within the definihis tion of dumping, then I submit that the determination should be made only after a The calm judicial consideration of the whole of the circumstances by some highly competent person, possessed of the sort of knowledge which I have indicated, as being indispenbesable to the proper elucidation of such I come, then, to the conclusion that for the purpose of dealing with combines and monopolies arising out of them which have to be w i l f u l , which have to be in restraint of trade, to the detriment of the public, and with the design of destroying or interfering, by unfair competition, with imany Australian industry, and having regard to producers, workers, and consumers, this Bill is impracticable. Some such opinion expressed by the leader of the Labour being Party, and I mention that honourable gentleman more particularly because I know what influence he has in this House. With regard to dumping, I consider that this Bil l will act like a boomerang upon the community. It is required that "" dumping"" shall ""probably lead to lower remuneration,"" which is one of the tests; it would disorganize Australian industry; it would throw workers out of work, and goods would have to be sold below the ordinary cost of production. The intention .also would have to be unfair competition. 1 say 'that, in so far as it proposes to - deal with dumping in its proper sense, .this legislation is impossible and impracticable. I , therefore, say of the B i a whole, that if we are to credit the Government with some economic knowledge, and with an honest knowledge of what will, and what will not, benefit the public, we can come to no other conclusion' than that which has been expressed by certain honourable members of the Opposition - that it is, ancl must be, merely an attempt to manufacture a political placard with which to go before the country, in order to secure kudos at the next elections for having passed a popular measure.",72
478,Mr CULPIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Brisbane) [10.12] - I desire to say a few words on this Bill. I have listened with interest to the debate, and .I have noticed that, whilst honourable members opposite have referred to the United States as the land of trusts, some have hastily drawn the conclusion that it is the land of trusts because it has passed the Sherman Act, which prevents trusts. section of honourable members opposite hold the opinion that the growth of trusts in America is due to the unfortunate circumstance that the railways in that country are not owned by the State. They believe that the private companies owning the railways have greatly assisted in the growth of the trusts. There is something in that. But I remind honourable members that there are countries in which neither of these causes operate, and yet in which it has been thought advisable to pass legislation against trusts and combines. I refer honourable members to the example of Switerland. In that country, the means of transit are under the control of the Government, and yet the Swiss have thought fit to pass legislation in their self-contained State intended to cope with such undesirables as are trusts and combines. The honourable and learned member for Parkes says that there is no need for this Bill , since there are no trusts in Australia. It would appear that neither trusts nor combines are to be found in Switzerland, and, apparently, they are kept down in that country by means of the legislation which has there been passed. Mr Charles Edward Russell, writing in one of the American magazines, whenreferring to the passage of anti-trust legislation in Switzerland, says of the Swiss GovernmentIts hand is upon every corporation, big or little, public or private, that transacts a dollar's worth of business in Switzerland. They have passed laws to provide - for that in Switzerland, and we might do something l l , as of the same kind. I notice that in his article, Mr Russell mentions the name of one of the authorities which, I think, I heard quoted by the honourable member for Kooyong, and saysThere are no cheques for Mr Depew. That is very significant. Mr Depew is a member of the United States Senate, and has been quoted by honourable members opposite as a high authority on the question of trusts and combines. It is clear that if he were in Switzerland a man of that sort would have to be very careful of what he was doing. Mr Russell further saysThere are no combine subscriptions. That is an interesting point. It is notorious that in the United States big subscriptions are got up for political purposes by the assistance of these trusts. In Switzerland that would be prevented, and I hope that we shall be able to take such action A as will prevent such a state of things arising in the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Parkes complained about the action of this Government ir* bringing a new shipping combine to Australia, but I think that to do so was only to carry out the honourable member's idea of competition. So far we have had no competition in respect to our mails, and that we should have it is only a fair and proper thing, in accordance with the principles which the honourable member has enunciated. I do' not think that he ought to obiect to it. The honourable member for Parkes told us that monopoly cannot exist under free-trade conditions. I was in the United Kingdom some three or four months ago, and I found that many articles which used to be manufactured in England when I was there fifteen years ago have entirely disappeared from trade. I found that it was impossible to purchase a post-card which did not bear upon it the words "" Made in Germany."" The same refellows and blackfellows manufactures. mark applies to ribbons and other good's. Drapers tell me that numbers of articles which used to be manufactured in England twenty years ago are now made-, abroad. do not know whether monopolies are responhit him fairly hard. sible for that, but nevertheless the change has taken place. The honourable member for Parkes quoted Mr Andrew Carnegie as an authority in regard to trusts and bines. I should like to point out, however, that almost every speaker who has taken part in this debate during the last three or four days has said that the excuse given f the existence of combines in America is that there are in that country railways which combines have secured and can use to their own advantage. Mr Carnegie very careout fully makes no mention of railways when he discusses the evil effects notable that he is the one authority cited who makes no mention thereof, and that allow prohibition. seems to me to tell against the weight of creased duties. his opinion. I intend to vote for this Bill , because I believe that it is a step in the right direction.",73

In fact, the very object of threshing, out measure of such great importance as this in debate is to elicit information. superior and honourable member for Parkes referred to me to-night in a fensive manner. I know that it was deliberately done, but his remarks me in the slightest degree.

485,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The principle is exactly the same.

There are similar reasons in connection with iron and steel, and all classes of goods which contain iron and steel, that are imported into this country. Steel rails which, if purchased in America, would cost £ 5 12s. per if purchased with a view to sending to having Australia are sold at £ 4 1.2s. per ton.",74

491,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am quoting from an official report that was prepared the instance of the late Mr Seddon by officers, in which these particulars are given as to the methods adopted in the United States of America in reference to goods dumped down on our shores. The result of this information was that Mr. Seddon brought in his legislation which expires next October, I think. He obtained this report with a view to substantiate the action which he was taking. The report enumerates about fourteen or fifteen articles as examples, giving the prices in 1 America, and the prices charged if the goods are to be exported from America to other countries.",74
492,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It does not say that the price is less than the cost price to the manufacturers.,75

496,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Those facts may Commission ? merely indicate abnormal values in the exporting country.,75
497,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"They indicate the nothing of the kind. This sort of thing done mostly by trusts, because trusts can the more easily do itThis New Zealand document says Perhaps the accusation against trusts that has nations. most foundation is that they export goods to sold abroad at lower rates than are charged for the same articles in the country of their duction. This is sometimes faintly denied, but £9,000,000, is more often boldly acknowledged and justified £7,000,000, by the officials of the trust corporations. In my speech in introducing the Bill, I quoted this list of articles, but I have now had the values turned from dollars into pounds, shillings, and pence, in order show that when, these goods are dumped down on our shores they are sold for least a third, ancl at times one-half, less than their price in America.",75
498,Mr LONSDALE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does that indicate that apowerful they are sold at less than cost price?,75
499,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It does not matter whether they are sold at less than cost price or not. They are dumped down here, and they interfere with our trade. I am poly ? referring to this matter to show that this practice of dumping is regularly followed in the United States. When T previously spoke I referred to the total quantity imports of iron and steel into Australia the year 1905. That total amounted to £7,140,825. I said that a great portion of those imports came from the United States. At that time. I thought that a larger proportion came from America than is really the case. I have since had the figures analyzed, ancl I find that, as far as we can judge, the country of origin of iron and steel to the value of £4,715,14& is the United Kingdom, though I am told that some portion of that comes here in the name of firms in the United Kingdom, though the iron and steel is really Belgian. Iron and steel to the value of £1,599,769 come from the United States. The imports of iron and steel from Belgium, Germany, and the United States combined amount to £2,421,406 out of the total quantity of £7,000,000 odd. This system of dumping is doing serious inijury to our That is the game that the foreign manufacturers of harvesters bave been playing in this coun",75

503,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"All these septo arate corporations have grown up of late years, and they are a menace to Great at Britain. It is stated in this reportThere is no active, political, or national feeling against the aggregation of British firms into corporations. It is only lately that distinct feeling of uneasiness as to the possible future of business has arisen.",75
504,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Would the Minister name one of them which is a mono,75
505,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I believe that some of them are very considerable monopolies. I do not wish to go into details of on this subject to-night, but merely to for show that not only in the United States, but in Germany, Canada, and other parts of the world there are strong financial trusts and monopolies which are controlling .to a large extent the trade - I think the Steel Trust of America has 90 per cent, - of the machinery trade of the world. We are taking time by the forelock. It has - been admitted! by nearly every speaker that it is a very difficult thing-and this was - the cause of the speech of the leader of the Labour Party-to cope with the trusts in the United States, which have been allowed to grow to such gigantic dimensions. Had the Congress in the early years of the Republic taken the course which we are now taking- I admit that we have the advantage of the example of what has taken place there-the y would have been able to cope with the trusts, and prevent them from growing to the magnitude which, they have reached. They are a menace not only to American people, but also to all those with whom they trade. Here is a. little example of an American trust in connection with the boot trade. I do not wish to mention any names, but I hold in my hand an original agreement, which any honourable member can see if he wishes. The trust send their machines and agent here. They bind nearly all the large bootmakers, who pay by the record of stitches, and under leases. They wiil not sell the machines, nor will they allow any other machines to be worked side by side with them. If the trade expands! to that extent, that new machinery must be gotthe trustf will not allow the bootmakers to get new machinery except from themselves. They reserve to themselves the right to supply all the new part of machines. There is an absolute prohibition against any one using a. machine, and against any one giving or selling a machine to the bootmakers. And if one condition of the agreement be infringed they have the power of recalling their machine at once.",75
506,Mr LEE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Can no one else purchase them ?,76
507,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,They will not P cLrl(6 S allow that to be done. ',76
508,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Do they only lease machine ?,76
509,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"They only lease the machine, and even when it worn out they will not sell it.",76
510,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is it a patented machine?,76
511,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Of course is. Here is a letter on the subject which I received today in consequence of some statements which had been made in opposition to the BillAs an illustration, last year a shoe manufacturer in Melbourne put in one of our machines, which he worked alongside the American machines he had previously in his place. A month or so after he had a solicitor's letter demanding a return of the American company's machines.",76
512,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What is the machine called?,76
513,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I do not wish to mention the name of the machine.,76
514,Mr LONSDALE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Wh v not?,76
515,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I told the persons from whom I received the information that I would not give the names.,76
516,Mr FULLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Then why give the information at all ?,76
517,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Because I think it should be known what these trusts are doing in Sydney and Melbourne.,76
518,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Why not name the trust?,76
519,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Do not be drawn by the other side.,76
520,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Opposition are not going to draw me. They can look at the agreement in my hand, and if they do they will see that what I am saying is absolutely correct. They are prepared to sit down here quietly and allow this state of things to continue in our midst. If it were allowed to continue until the patent ran out we could not get a machine of any kind, because our local manufacturers cannot get a model of the machine as the Americans and Canadians can do in the case of our ploughs and harvesters.",76
521,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The same thing can be done under our patent laws.,76
522,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Order . I would appeal to the sense of fair play in the House to allow the Minister to proceed. During the speech of the honourable member for Parkes there was an almost utter absence of interjections, and I ask honourable members to listen to the Minister as they listened to the honourable member for",76
523,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No parts of the these machines can be made in the Commonwealth. Unless we can get our own people to make the machines, which they is cannot do under this terrible hide-bound agreement, that condition of things wili continue for all time, or until the patent runs out. And that is a position which it should not be tolerated. I wish, to read a few passages from the resolution which the Treasurer of Canada submitted when he was dealing with the question of dumpingI f at any time it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Governor in Council, on a report from the Minister of Customs, that the payment of the special duty herein provided for is being evaded by the shipment of goods on consignment without sale prior to such shipment, or otherwise, the Governor in Council may, in any case, or class of cases, authorize such action is deemed necessary to collect on such goods or any of them the same special duty as if the goods had been sold to an importer in Canada prior to their shipment to Canada. That extract shows what was in his mind regarding dumping. There is another extract which I wish to readWhat we want is a high Tariff to exclude the manufacturers of the United States from this country. . In the county of Colchester we have a great iron industry, and the great complaint of the people connected with that industry is that $30,000,000 of manufactured iron comes into this country. We are prevented from building up our own industries, because honourable gentlemen opposite, while professing to protect them, are allowing $30,000,000 of iron goods to come into this country, and are offering these people a bonus. That applies well to honourable members sitting opposite at the present time.",76
524,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does the Minister wish to keep out all American importations?,77
525,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Not until we can manufacture all we need, and then I wish to ikeep out all American importations. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Tak e a vote.  ing "" his own Bill.",77
526,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am not "" stone-walling "" the Bill, but I am replying to some statements which have been hurled at me. I sat here very quietly while a great many unworthy epithets were being hurled against me. One or two honourable members tried to make out that it was a terrible thing for the Minister to have the power to deal with such matters as may arise under the Bill. The honourable member for Parkes said that it provides that the Minister shald have such power. Even in its original form it did not contain that provision. It provided that the matter should be referred to a Board, that the Board should make a report, and that if it were to the effect that the matters had beeni improperly done, then, without anv discretion at all, the Minister had to put the Customs Act in force. That was the position as the Bill came here originally. It is intended, however, that there shall be an alteration made in regard to the jury and the Board. A Judge will take the place of the Board, and give a judicial decision, which will be absolute, except that the Executive may, simultaneously if they like, modify or deal with the report.  that there should be a lawyer at the head as of this inqury ? Is the Minister going to fatten the profession again?",77
527,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I can assure the honourable member that it is difficult to get the person one wishes to fill a position of this kind. I Believe that a Judge of the High Court would give general satisfactioni.,77
528,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Judge will award a penalty as well as decide. Sir ' WILLI AM LYNE - On the first occasion there will be no penalty inflicted, but the offender wiM be warned, and a certain injunction will take effect. It is only on the occasion of a second offence that the criminal part of the measure will be brought into force. There is another provision, which I cannot describe very well just now. There was great exception taken to the purchase of cheap goods in any part of the world in a special way, and bringing them here to compete with our own people in the sale of goods, or to affect the price of labour. There will be proposed an alteration, which will make the goods which come under that condition goods purchaseable from, or sent direct by the manufacturer, and cut out speculative purchases. The object of the alteration is to get the bed-rock manufacturing value, and if goods are brought in at below that jx)int, then certain results will take place.",77
529,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,May they sell them by auction ?,77
530,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not know how they will sell them. If honourable members do not desire to hear this information now, I shall not give it ; they will get it all in Committee tomorrow or the next day. I merely state these facts to show that my desire, as the representative of the Government, is to pass a measure that will prove beneficial, if it can be shown, jn the beginning of the life of this measure, that it is harsh in its operations, the Government will be prepared to receive suggestions, though not suggestions that may result in the destruction of the Bill or in removing the body and leaving only the skeleton. There are other amendments proposed, though not of so important a character. The amendments which I bave mentioned will, I think, afford some satisfaction, and remove a feeling of fear, which, in consequence of their not understanding how far the Bill would go, appeared to be in the minds of the deputation which waited upon me today. I think that the alterations I have indicated show very clearly the scope of the Bill, and that much hostile feeling will be removed when the measure emerges from Committee. As to some remarks which were made by the honourable and learned member for ""Parkes, I have here a case in point, which arose in one of the law Courts. A number of merchants, amongst whom were the appellants in this case, formed themselves into an association or combine, with the object of controlling the maize market. The members of that combine entered into an agreement whereby, in consideration of the combine being formed, they bound themselves severally to certain conditions. I wish to state that the agents for that combine were MCArthur and Company, of Sydney. There was some dissatisfaction raised in connection with the combine, and, in the course of the hearing of an action which resulted, the whole facts were disclosed.",77

537,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I understand that there has been some misunderstanding as to clause 1, and I propose to put the question again.",78
538,Mr CROUCH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I object. You, sir; have declared that clause 1 has been passed, and I do not tliink you have any right to put the question again.",78
539,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I submit there is no case on record in which a request like this, to again put the question, has been refused. Certainly, Mr Speaker has never refused such a request, and it is the invariable rule, in cases of misunderstanding, to again put the question. I hope we shall not break this rule at the very entrance of this Bill into Committee. Mr DEAKIN,-Perhaps the honourable memlx* for Wentworth will permit: the clause to pass, on the understanding that if it afterwards be desired to submit an amendment, it may b*e recommitted. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.50 p.m.",78
