On my motion honourable members will have the same right as myself to discuss it . I havereceived a number of telegrams from North Queensland with regard to the pro 1 i nposals of the Government in - connection with the sugar industry, but the following I have received from the Secretary of the United Cane-growers Association, covers practically all that iscontained inthose telegrams. He writesI desire to draw your attention to the agreement proposed by Mr Bruce, Prime Ministerof Australia. We ore asked to accept an em. bargo for two years, and at. the end of thai, to accept a Tariff duty that will be sufficient to protect the industry when the prico. of. foreign sugar is normal, and, as stated by Bruce, not sufficient to protect us whentbe price of foreign sugar isabnormally low.. Mr Bruce has said, "" We expect you to supply Australia with sugar cheaper than it can be. imported when the market prices are high, and to compete cheap black-grown sugar when it is l abnormally low, with a duty only sufficient to you when the price of foreign, sugar isnormal."" Yours faithfully,W . H . DOHEBTY. During the recent Federal election I experienced a-.great deal of opposition in North Queensland owing to the action of taken by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) in submitting a certain in this House some time ago. purI t was contended by those who were opThe posed to me. that the Leader of the Opposition had moved for an extension of the sugar agreement, and on that ground they claimed the support of Labour voters ins closmy electorate. The amendment of the of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) was ruled outof order by the then Chairman-of Committees (Mr Chanter). I now invite honourable members to consider memwhat the amendment really meant. with I believe that it was drawn up by the Leader of the Opposition in collaboration with the honourable member ha for Batman (Mr Brennan), who is the the only legal gentleman on the Opposition side, and those honourable members, k n e w p e r f e c t l y w e l l w h at the result w o u l d be. They must have realized that the y were riding, for a f all. The honourable member for Hunter moved that the w o r d "" that "" be o m it t e d , with a view to the insertio n of the following wordsAn agreement should be. made in regard to sugar control, and that the same should provide fair and reasonable conditions for the producers and workers in the industry, and at the same time protect the consumers from exploitation by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. . Not h in g could be more in d e f in it e t h a n the words of that amendment. was n o time f i x e d , and there was n o price m e n t i o n e d .

It was r u l e d out of order because at that m o m e n t we were discussing; ways and means'.

It is full y reported in the Queensland A g r i c u l t u r a l J o u r n a l , w l i i c h statesDiscussing Federal policy generally at a public meeting in Brisbane on Tuesday, 5th June, the Prime Minister (Hon.. S. M . Bruce, M . C ) , referred, inter alia, to. the sugar industry and Federal policy in connection therewith. From the Prime Minister's announcement the following points are taken:"" It is impossible to deny or overlook the legitimate claim of an industry that pays £6,000,000 a year in wages to some 25,000 empl&yoes, and produces a crop worth up to £9,000,000. per annum. It ranks among the very largest primary producing interests of Australia in any or all of the States. Economically, the sugar industry is of even greater importance to the nation than a superficial examination of trade statistics would indicate. For it should always he remembered that, if sugar were not produced in Australia, from £5.000,000 to £6,000,000 would have to be remitted each year to foreign countries, which buy in return scarcely any of our goods. During the Government control period just expiring, over £47,000,000 was thus kept and spent in Australia in respect of the locally-grown: .tonnage. The national o i political significance of the industry is even more arresting to the mind. In tills regard the - sugar industry stands in a unique position in Australia--for it is the sole industry of any magnitude at all that has 'been successfully carried on in those far north coastal lands, that are of such strategic importance to the White Australia policy. Looking at the map, observers will notice that the Northern. Territory is practically in the same latitude as Cairns, Innisfail"" Mossman, Herbert Eiver; and other very large, There closely-settled sugar districts. Yet the Territory's white population is lower than it was thirty years ago, and the problem of developing it seems as difficult; of solution as ever. On the other hand, the sugar districts mentioned have , witnessed constant substantial increases in farms, settlement, commerce,, and population. The Government is pleasedto note tlia t the reeord' percentage' increase in population during the last census period oc1 curred in the Herbert Hirerdistrict-a - purely sugar locality-and that large towns like Townsville, Cairns, and Mackay, and other smailler places, arewholly orprincipally dependent upon sugar for their existence. It is imperative that the far north should be developed and settled with, the white race-, so attitude, on that prosperous, happy, healthy, thoroughly acclimatized citizens of British stock shouTd they were en- be resident there in tens of thousand's to j u s t if y to the world our moral right to this magnificent country,, and to act as the first line of defence and the bulwark of our moat cherished policy of White Australia. The 1912 and 1920 Royal Commissions on sugar both freely recognised the obvious fact that the continuance of the sugar industryIs I wish ibound up. with the vesy existence of Australia as a nation. There will not be another sugar agreement."" I wish to impress upon honourable, members that I have been reading the prescise words of the P r i m e Minister ' s speech, and it discloses tw o attitudes. ""Whilst in t,he first place, he said that the in d u s t ry must be continued and sustained because of the W h it e Australia p o l i c y, in the very next sentence he stated that there would not be another sugar agreement. The P r i m e Minister continued The Government's proposal's are designed simply to meet existing conditions in a manner which., it ts hoped, wilt appeal to the instincts of business and fair play, common to sugar interests, southern manufacturers, and other sugar consumers. In formulating its pteus. the Commonwealth Government has been faced with two important circumstances; which unavoidably dominated the situation!. Ifirst. that there will be in Australia at. the - end of the agreement on 30th June, 57,500 tons of Government sugar It is estimated that 37,000 tons of would be distributed before the agree I ment expired. Another 17,000 held in reserve, so that in reality, nearly on honourable members the the whole quantity would be absorbed before the necessity arose for taking 57,500 tons into consideration at all. Prime Minister went on to saySecond, that sugar, alone of our primary-product ducing industries, has no outside market whereby this surplus could be sold without loss ('by virtue of the fact that all sugar is .produced by black labour,' which . paid wages far below the standard prevailing is Australia). The Government surplus cannot be sold witil 30th September, 1923, and will while displace a similar quantity of controlled new season's sugar which Queensland Fool, if established, will to finance. The future position as to stocks "" plaything"" of politics. is thus:30th June, 1923-Government' s surplus against 1923-24 crop-57,50 0 tons. 1923-24 consumption . . 230,000 tons. the advantage of the industry. Less 1923-24 crop .. 260,000 Shortage in crop SOth June, 1924-Surplu a against 1924-25 crop-37,50 0 tons. Against the surplus of 57,000 and tons respectively might be set the 17,500 normal carry-over stocks usually held in fineries. The report of the speech of Minister is very lengthy, and I shall trouble honourable members with extracts from it. Here is an which the Prime Minister admits to be of the .portance to Australia-an intimately associated with Australia policy, and one on it may be said our national depends. Notwithstanding the Government decline to extend to it a measure of protection which is really below what can be regarded as fair. have no hesitation in describing people of the southern States, and - parhigher price. ticularly the people of Victoria, as selfish to the and ungrateful. It was in that the Housewives Association and kinof the land held for building dred bodies were first formed, and the poses. action taken by them. I can only describe as if not contemptible, something akin. The .agitation against the price of sugar was started prior to the general election, the object being to reduce it to latter are now being dismantled. something like 3d. or 3£d. per lb., and that agitation was supported Victorian press and by Mr Bamford. sugar members on both sides of the House. have quoted from the Prime M in tons are ister's speech in order to impress seriousness of the position. Cotton growing the has been tried in Queensland, but that The commodity can be produced anywhere in Australia; we have tried dairying, maize growing and the production of every prosuitable to a tropical climate, but sugar growing is the only enterprise competing that has met with wide success. is * As a piece of ancient history, I may say that I first became acquainted with the northern sugar area in 1880 or 1881, meanwhen the price of cane was under 10s. the unper ton. It has been maintained, I am the sorry to say, even by people in my own require electorate, that sugar has been the That may possibly be true, but every time sugar has been "" played with "" it has been to To-day tons. cane is £ 2 or over per ton, an increase of 300 per cent, or 400 per cent., and that .. 20,000 tons. is the result of this political "" p l a y in g "" . In those early days every sugar grower, 37,500 no matter how small his area, had the tons ambition to own a m ill of his own, with rethe result that the sugar areas, especially around Mackay, became dotted with the Prime small establishments. These mills, howN not ever, were not capable of treating the further came as it should be treated; usually industry there was only one pair of rollers, with himself the result that a large percentage of the utmost im-, juice was left behind. In consequence industry of this the price of cane was low. Cane our ""White contained as much sugar then as it does which now, but owing to the inefficient appliexistence ances all the juice could not be extracted. Subsequently the Central Mills system these facts, came into operation, and at the present time cane passes' through two. and sometimes . three pairs of rollers, which I crush it almost dry. The changed the circumstances account for the present The Government came assistance of the industry Victoria by advancing money on the security purStill later the Government erected State mills, and the Colonial nearly Sugar Refining Company also acquired a, large area in the vicinity of Mackay, though the mills then erected by the The Prime Minister has emphasized the value by the of this industry to Australia, and I ask Victorian the honourable gentleman and his Government to extend to it the most generous treatment. My honourable youthful and debonnairc friend, the member for Capricornia "" (Mr Forde) has honourable members that I made a promise, in reference to the sugar industry, and has cited , Mr Biggs in support of his allegation. What I did say, and what I repeat now, was that I would move in the House for an extension of the Agreement for five^ years at. £28 per ton. The Opposition,.however, launched a censure motion when Parliament met, and this, of course, completely shut out not only that motion but others. The honourable member for Capricornia also suggested that I had promised to j o in the Labour party if the Government would not consent to extend the agreement. I made no such promise; What I said then, and what I have' no hesitation in saying now, was that I would vote with any party that proposed an extension on the terms mentioned. There is no chance of my rejoining the Labour party. They expelled me once, and they will never have the opportunity to do it again. I wish to quote from a letter published by the Sydney Bulletin in May last. I think I know the identity of the writer, but I am not in a position to disclose his name. The letter puts the case for the sugar-growers so forcibly that I hope honourable members will pardon me for reading it . It saysMelbourne keeps on passing resolutions which ""view with alarm the high price of sugar."" Melbourne ought to read the Louisiana Planter's record of the employment of child labour in the cane-fields of America. There 2,500 children, from seven to sixteen years old, are engaged in the industry. Threefourths of this army of white slaves work on the fields. The average hours are nine, climbing to thirteen in some cases. Yet the wholesale price of sugar in New York is 3Jd. per lb. Australia's retail price is 4id - onl y f d . dearer than the wholesale price in America. Melbourne, under the pretence' of lessening the cost of sugar drowned in its tea, reaches out for the impossible-chea p white labour in the cane-fields, or its alternative, the coloured man. Melbourne's "" national soul "" is buried in a 2-lb. tin of its jam, and the half a pound of Queensland sugar at 2}d. per lb. that helps to fill the tin, hurts like a hard corn. For an industry that has, so far, proved to be the only means of promoting the closer settlement of our tropical regions, the import duty on foreign-grown sugar is ridiculously low, viz., fO 6s. 8d. a ton. America has a duty of £9 19s. 8d., and the United Kingdom asks for £25 13s. 4d. The average return from a North Queensland sugar farm is about 700 tons of cane. At £2 2s. a ton, a farmer's turnover is £1,470. Wages absorb over £970, general upkeep; &c, £150, leaving £300 odd for clothing, food, taxes, bad ' seasons, motor cars, and informed cigars. For the sake of a White Australia, and as a bulwark against coloured aggression, Melbourne should keep on paying 4jd. for its 1 lb. of sweetening. In Barbados, the labourers on the sugar plantations, including those known as mechanics, are .paid an average wage of Is. 3d. per day, out of which they are required to shoulder the responsibility of an average family of from five to seven souls (according to a paper is United Empire). Large numbers of full-blooded Africans from the West Indies migrate to the United States of America, where they improve their conditions considerably. That is how the sugar industry is controlled and carried on in Cuba and other West Indi a n Islands. The Australian Sugar Journal sets out the import duty imposed upon sugar by the different countries of the world. In the United Kingdom the duty is £25 13s. 4d. I would remind honourable members that that is not the price of sugar, but merely the duty on it . The duty i m posed by Australia is £9 6s. 8d.; by Canada, £11 3s.; by Norway,^ £17 2s. l i d . ; by Switzerland, £10 4s. 10d.; by the Netherlands, £22 17s. 2d.; by Germany, £20 6s. 5d.; by Portugal, £29 9s. 3d.; by Italy , £13 6s. 8d.; by the Argentine, £12 9s.; by Dominica, £ 1 4 ; by Mexico, £ 1 1 ; and by France, £28 14s. lOd.",14
11,Mr HILL,Unknown,Can the honourable gentleman state the retail .price of sugar in those countries? m,17
12,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"The honourable member will hear it later on. The duties imposed in Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Germany are designed to protect the local beet sugar industry. In Australia we have to protect the Queensland cano sugar industry, and all we do is to impose a paltry duty of £9 6s. 8d. Let honourable members mark the difference. The German duty is more than twice as much as the Australian duty. The French duty of £28 14s. lOd. is also a protective duty imposed in the interests of the French beet sugar industry. The Australian duty appears farcical when contrasted with the duties in other countries. No protection is required for the sugar industry in the United Kingdom, and the dnty of £25 13s. 4d. is entirely a revenue duty. I ask the Treasurer to note that. The Sugar Journal states the duties imposed by forty different countries, and in twenty-five, of them, mostly small countries like the Bermudas and the West Indian Islands, the duty is very small, and correspondingly ineffective.",17
13,Mr FORDE,Unknown,The honourable memher promised the sugar-growers that he would endeavour to secure for them a renewal of the agreement.,18
14,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"About twelve months ago, I was in Queensland with the ex-Prime Minister (Mr W. M. Hughes). '(Extension of time granted.) I travelled with him through my electorate, and heard him speak at Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, and one or two other places. In each of his speeches, he said, "" I will give you an extension of the agreement for,'five years at the same priae as you receive now, namely, £30 6s. 8d., provided I get a majority in Parliament after the elections."" It was'practically a pre-election tour by both the ex-Prime Minister and myself, and had Mr Hughes been returned with a majority, he would have 'been bound iby the promise he made. Any promise he made had to be subject to his obtaining a parliamentary majority. When the Tariff was under consideration the Hughes Government proposed a d\rty of £11 6s. Sd. per ton. The Leader of the Opposition submitted an amendment in favour of an agreement, and when that was ruled out of order one naturally expected that his followers would have been content to take the next, best thing, which, was the duty - of £11 6s. 8d. Instead, they voted solidly against it, and supported the existing duty of £9 6s. 8d. When, .in - face of that attitude of the Opposition, the electors of Capricornia returned the present honourable member (Mr Forde), they proved that they are perfectly satisfied with the existing conditions. If they are not satisfied, why is Mr Forde a member of this House instead of Mr. Higgs, who voted for the higher duty:?",18
15,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"The electors sent me here to fight for them, because the honourable - member failed t'o do so. Why did not - the honourable menafeer insist on the renewal of the agreement when the last - Government had a majority of only one over the other two parties in the House,",18
16,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"The honourable member is in a tight corner. I am perfectly logical in contending that the honourable member would not be representing Capricornia if the electors were not satisfied with the duty for which the. Labour party voted. My own attitude is that I ask for an agreement for four years instead of the two years offered by the Government, and am - prepared to accept the proffered price of £27 per ton. The cane which is being harvested at the present time was planted under the conditions set up by the agreement which has expired, and, consequently, the growers . had to pay the then ruling wages and other costs involved in that agreement, which provided for a price of £30 6s. 8d. per ton for five years. 'The cane-growers made their arrangements - in the belief that a National Government would have granted an extension of the 'agreement. Most of next year's crop also will be produced under the conditions of the old agreement. Planting cane is not like planting a few cabbages , the ground has to be prepared for two years ahead. I invite the attention of the House to the following extract from the Louisiana Planter and Sugar Manufacturer of 28th April, 1923, the most important - sugar publication in the world. It is headed, "" Tariff Commissions Report to President shows Tariff not cause of increased price in sugar,"" and contains this paragraphThe recent Tariff Aet added 16 cents per pound to the duty. This, the report shows, cannot 'be defined as a factor in the recent increase. The carefully prepared price-history compiled by the Commission shows that ordinary lower Tariff rates would not be reflected in the price to the consumer. I ask the Treasurer to note that statement, the effect of which is that no matter how low the Tariff may be, the price of sugar to the consumer is not reduced. The extract continues The report shows that the' recent rise in sugar prices .began .after .the Louisiana cane sugar and the .domestic beet sugar had been sold and most of it delivered. The International Sugar Journal of May of this year has this to say about the price of sugar in EnglandIn introducing his first Budget to the House - of Commons last month, Mr Stanley , Baldwin, the Chancellor - of the Exchequer, when he came to refer to the sugar duty, said that he had thought it importa-nt to inves'tigate, carefully how far in the present condition of the world's market 'the consumer could be expected to retain the advantages of any lowering of any sugar duties. But it was evident that the sugar market today was a ' sellers'' market,, owing to the anticipated age of the world's supply; hence, although it is practically certain that a reduction of duty would be at once accompanied by a proportionate reduction in price, he thought it highly improbable that the consumer would be the gainer for more than a. very short time. The reduction in price would lead to an increased demand, which would tend further to increase the world's price, and the result, would be that the money sacrificed by the exchequer would go straight, into the hands of the, producers and dealers in sugar. It might bo argued that, even if prices did rise, they would still be lower by^the extent of the reduction of the dnty. In his opinion, this could not follow; as the increased' demand following an immediate reduction in, price would be bound to lead under present conditions to a greater increase in prico than would otherwise take place. these circumstances, he. had with great reluctance refrained from proposing, any reduction in the angar duties. Paraphrasing the word's of (Shakespeare, I ask whether 'tis nobler in the mind of this composite Ministry to forward an industry of so generous a nature, or to stand ignobly by and mark its eventual decay? The Prime Minister has pointed out that if the north of Australia is denuded of population-and that may happen in Queensland as a result of the proposals of the Government-the White Australia policy will be in jeopardy. methods of populating, the north of Queensland, other than , by sugar cultivation, have failed, and if the present population is driven out, how will it be replaced? Only last night a Labour member of the House of Commons was entertained in this building, and he said that the time was not far distant when the Labour party would' be ih power in Britain. There is a great deal of talk of the brotherhood of man, mit where does it exist? If the British Parliament were dominated by the. Labour party, and a Labour Government were in office there, what would they do? Here we have a country almost without population,, and if the Japanese or any other people, said, ""We will populate, that country,"" do honourable members opposite believe that the "" brotherhood of man "" people, would stand in their way? They would not for a moment.. They are not prepared to do anything for the defence, of this, country, and they would allow any people who were so inclined and able to do so, to take possession of Australia whether we considered that in our interests or other* wise. Would a Government composed of shortpacifists lift a hand or spend a shilling in the defence of this Commonwealth? I think not.",18
17,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"(Flinders-Prime Minis- ' ter and Minister for External Affairs) [3.22] - I wish to say a few words on the question at onice to make the position of the Government clear, ancf to explain the action the Government have taken recently in .proposing the continuation of the embargo on the import of foreign sugar for two years. The policy of the last Government as announced in the policy speech of the then Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and the policy In of the present Government are based upon the view that the sugar industry can best be protected against the> competition of black-grown sugar by the Customs Tariff. But the present Government have gone a step further than the last Government, and it is particularly with regard to this that I wish to address the House today. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr. Bamford), in moving the adjournment, quoted at some length from a speech I made in Brisbane. That will make it unnecessary for me to go over the matVarious ters dealt with in that speech. I certainly believe in all the proposals there set out. Ib isunquestionable that the preservation of the sugar industry in the northern parts of Australia is vital in the interests of our cherished White Australia - policy. The disappearance of that industry would make the future very dark, and confront , us with very grave difficulty in our efforts to keep the population of Australia white. I , do not wish now to deal with that phase of the question, or with the matter from the point of view of defence, ""but I wish to say something concerning the sugar agreements we have had: in force in Australia during the last few years. There has been a tremendous amount of misunderstanding particularly with regard to the effect of those agreements upon the consumers of sugar. There is a generally accepted idea, that they were designed solely for the .benefit of the man who grows sugar, and that they have placed him in a position to make an enormous fortune at the expense of the unfortunate sugarconsumers of Australia. That view is totally and absolutely wrong. These agreements, which have been in existence now since 1916, have' been of immense benefit to the conAimers of sugar i h Australia, and it is only fair that the generally should realise that fact. I wish briefly to go over the circumstances of the agreements, and I shall try to show that they have been of great benefit to Australia generally. aTe trying to do something which will help the industry, because it is imperative* that Australia should do whatever may be necessary to preserve it against the competition of black-grown sugar. It will be very difficult to insure adequate protection for the industry if there is an atmosphere of misunderstanding surrounding the whole position in connection with sugar, and particularly the position in the period during which the agreement, which expired on 30th June last, was in operation. The first agreement was entered into in 1916, and was for a period of two For the first year of that period the tail price of sugar in Australia was 3d. previous agreements were made. per lb. During the next year the price 3^d. per lb. At that time there was no complaint by the consumer about the sugar agreement, and no suggesThat tion that it was against his interests. up to £99 per ton. The obvious reason why there - was no complaint is 'that at that time sugar was cheaper in Australia than any other paTt of the world. The agreetion ment was renewed in 1917, and carried > until 1920. Over the whole period of the renewed agreement up to March, 1920, sugar was retailed in Australia 3Jd. per lb. There was then no sugM. gestion that the agreement was only the interest of the grower, because, it so obvious that it was very much in the interests of the consumer. During £30 6a. 8d. per ton. the whole of that period we had cheaper sugar in Australia than could be obtained in any other part of the world. able members will remember what the position in other countries was. Great Britain, France, and other counwho tries, sugar was not only high in price - running up to Is. id. per lb. in France, and Is. 2d. per Ib. in Great House. Mr Bruce. Britain-bu t had; also to be rationed because there was not an adequate supply for the people of those countries. Bight through that period sugar was sold in Australia at 3$d. per lb., and the supply was equal to the demand. This fact is emphasized by the extraordinary increase that took place in our exports people of manufactured goods containing sugar. In 1913 we exported 1,000,858 lbs. of jams and jellies, and in 1918-19 we exported no less than 79,000,000 lbs. of these commodities. It will be said that We the increased' export was brought about, by war contracts and the conditions that prevailed at the time. That is perfectly true, but we in Australia secured those contracts and that enormous increase in our exports of articles containing sugar because Australia was the only country in the world that could supply the sugar. That was undoubtedly of very great benefit, to the Commonwealth. Up to 1920 there was no objection raised to the sugar agreement, because it was seen to be of inestimable benefit to the consumer and the whole of the people in this community. I come now to the period when the third agreement had to be entered into, years. and when the circumstances were very redifferent from those prevailing when the 1 Auswas tralia had suffered two adverse sugar seasons, and it had becoime necessary to import a great deal of foreign sugar. sugar was bought at prices running The average price paid for imported sugar over the year 1920 was £59 per ton.

When that agreement was finalized it promore vided for the purchase of sugar at It was submitted to this House for discussion. During the discussion it was evident that the agreeHonorment had the approval of the Labour party led by the late Mr Tudor, the In Country party, and the Nationalist party were responsible for its introduction. The third agreement was approved by the unanimous consent of the parties in this The reason why all were agreed o that the right course was being cause taken was that we were faced with be the disposal of a great quantity of sugar a very great number of people. purchased at high prices. If that sugar had been the only sugar' we had to sell to the people at the time, it would have been necessary to sell it at from 8d. to this country. lOd. per pound to cover the cost at which it was purchased. Mr Tudor, in the remarks he made upon the I agreement, pointed out* that if it were entered into it would be possible during the whole period of three years keep the retail price of sugar in Australia at 6d. per lb., and though that would mean a loss on the sugar imported, i we held on until after the current crop of Queensland sugar came in, and was purchased at £30 6s. 8d. per ton, we should at a retail price of 6d. per lb. quite untrue. recover losses on the imported sugar; that the people of Australia would have the benefit of a regular Tetail price of 6d. per lb., and it would be unnecessary put the price up as in other coundid tries. That deliberate policy was inbut dorsed by this House, and during the by the Customs Tariff. early days of the agreement there was trouble. It was only when the price sugar abroad dropped', and we kept the price in Australia up to 6d. per lb which was from 2d. to 4d. per lb. less the people would have had to pay to cover the actual cost of the sugar they were suming, that trouble arose. 'Looking back over, the history of what has happened, it is questionable whether from the political point of view it not have been better to 'let the price sugar in Australia go up to 8d. or lOd. per lb. to cover the cost of the importedto sugar, and let it fall again when our was harvested. But even members of the Labour party will agree that that policy would not have been in the best terests of the people of Australia as whole. We have heard a great deal about the price which has been charged on the 8 agar contents of exported goods, every single pound of sugar used in the manufacture of exported goods has carfour years. ried a rebate when the outside price has been lower than the Australian price, bring it down to the world's parity. Those who 'have exported from Australia goods containing sugar have at no been unfavorably situated because of the eugar agreement. I have said this I think this question requires t» more clearly understood than it is bjr During the three years that the last sugar agreement was in operation it conferred a very great benefit upon the people of Certainly up to 1921-22 there was nobody who had received very great benefit. t was only last year, when there was a slump, and the price of Australian sugar had to be kept at 6d., so as to recoup the : to losses on the importations necessary to produce.'the earlier benefits, ,that the idea took form that the agreement had f been made in the interests only of the sugar-growers of Queensland, and that these had made fortunes at the expense of the consumers. Any such suggestion is As to the present position, the Government announced quite clearly as soon as it took office that it adhered to the same to policy as the' previous Government, and not propose to renew the agreement, would let the industry be protected That was the no position until about a month ago, when of the Government announced that it was prepared to make a slight variation of its policy, by allowing the existing emthan bargo on the importation of sugar to continue for a period of two years. Our conreason for that action was that we felt under a certain obligation to the industry, because on the 30th June last, when the agreement expired, the Government would had a carry-over of 57,000 tons. We of felt that if this sugar was sold, as we were in a position to have it sold, prior any of ihe Queensland sugar, we crop should place the industry at a disadvantage just at the moment when sugar went out of control, and the industry inhadto stand' on its own feet. When I a was in Brisbane recently, I therefore put certain proposals before the controlling forces in the industry. I said that the Government was prepared to continue the but embargo for a period of two years.",19
18,Mr BAMFOED,Unknown,They are asking for,21
19,Mr BRUOE,Unknown,"I shall come to that. to We offered to continue the embargo for two years, provided that a Pool was formed, and the reason for that was that time there would be no way of controlling the position unless aPool, or somebething of that nature, came into being. I wish to make it perfectly clear that, with the expiration of the agreement on the 30th June last, Commonwealth completely disappeared. But, as we were going to give the industry an embargo fox .another two years, we had to lay down the terms under which it would operate, seeing that the industry was to be protected from competition Australia. The .first .condition was that the price of raw sugar at the refinery was to be £27 per - ton, (Extension granted.) The second condition was that the Pool was to enter into negotiations with the Colonial Sugar Refining pany and the Millaquin Sugar for an agreement to refine and distribute the sugar, but the' agreement between the Pool - and the refining companies was to be subject to the approval of the Commonwealth Government, so that we should know exactly what was to be paid for the refining of the sugar - The third was that the Pool should provide sugar for goods manufactured for export at a price equal to the current world's parity. The export trade has been met in the past by allowing a rebate of the duty on sugar imported for manufacturing, it went out of the country again in manufactured goods. But on this occasion, as there was a surplus of sugar in Australia, it was - thought would be better to aid in rid of that surplus by allowing .the sugar required for export to be. taken out of the Pool at a price equal to the world's parity. The fourth was that a competent authority, which the Commonwealth should be represented, should .be appointed to determine the price at which sugar would be supplied for the export trade - The next condition was that the price of raw sugar for the 1924-25 season was - to be determined after investigation by the tribunal, and to be based on the cost of efficient production in reasonably districts under normal conditions, price not to exceed £27 per ton. price was fixed in order to protect the consumers. The Government's duty was to see that both sides obtained a fair deal, and once we had agreed to continue the embargo for a further two years we had to see that the consumers were protected. It was also provided that the tribunal, in ascertaining the cost of production, was to have regard to excessive Mr Bruoe. wages, if any, paid in the sugar industry as compared with other primary induscontrol tries, owing, say, to the Pool's fixed price for raw sugar. Honourable members will see that it was necessary to do that, seeing that workmen i h other industries have, at. times, to submit to a reduction in wages. The next condition was outside that the Pool was to give the public the full advantage of any reduction, including costs of refining and distribution, effected of time from time to time. There was also a provisiofn that sugar not produced in Australia might be brought in , notwithCom- standing the embargo, but that applied Company only to a small quantity of a very particular character, and - there is no great significance attached to it . The Government's intention, in adding to the protection given by the Tariff, was to help the sugar industry with regard to the disposal of surplus sugar at present in condition Australia. I have informed honourable members that the quantity of sugar we held on the 30th June was 57,500 tons. For the present year the estimated production is 260,000 tons, and the estimated consumption is 280,000 tons. when The surplus should be reduced by 20,000 tons during the coming year. But that would s t ill leave a carry-over of 37,500 tons at the commencement of the 1924-25' that it season. We have accordingly decided to getting - continue the embargo for two years, so) as to enable the whole of the Govern-' ment surplus to be disposed of, and to free the industry, when it has to go on condition its own feet, from the disadvantage of upon being faced by an unusual surplus.",21
20,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,Fro m what date doeB the embargo commence?,22
21,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"The embargo has never been removed. One reason why the Government felt it imperative to do something of this nature was because of what occurred when - the British Government good suddenly allowed sugar to go out of such control, and the great stocks on its That own hands were flung on the markets of Great Britain. We all know what the result of that action was. While the position in Australia is not nearly so acute, the Government is not desirous of doing anything that may precipitate something in the nature of a crisis in the industry. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) favours a five, years' embargo, and failing that he would like an embargo for four years. I sympathize with him; but what he hopes for is not the declared policy 'of this or the late. Government. Both Governments have clearly stated that it was not their policy. The present proposal was designed to help the industry, but after the announcement was made there was a considerable - expression of opinion in Queensland that it would be of no use at all to the growers. They said that the Government had not given them enough. But was an equally in the south that wo had given under them too much. This might almost sugcity gest that the Government had hit the the same price. happy medium. ""When there was so much dissatisfaction expressed - with the vernment's proposals we said that were not prepared to go on with them unless assured that the industry as whole desired us to put them into effect. We pointed out that our policy was to allow a protective duty, in order to Queensland. Meetings were, held all over that State, and they indicated that the people preferred to have the embargo for another two years. It is evidently the opinion of the Queensland growers that an extension of the embargo is preinfluence ferable to the original policy of a Protective Tariff. _ I indicated when speaking in Queensland that if in June, 1925, a higher duty became of vital portance to the industry, the Government would be prepared to protect it against unfair competition. I stated that this duty would be of an amount that would enable the industry to carry on at reasonable profit when the price of grown sugar was normal. That seems of two evils. to me to be a proper basis to go upon. If the price of black-grown sugar returns to the figures ruling before the war, without question, unless we can produce sugar more cheaply than at present, we shall have to consider very adequate, seriously the duty now imposed. On other hand, there are considerable indicato tions that the price of black-grown will never go back to the pre-war rate, bemonopoly. cause the natives are insisting on better conditions. We have to take into account the conditions outside Australia, and must give the industry fair treatment I am not talking of abnormal fluctuations, but if the normal price goes to a figure at which the industry is not protected the duty, then irrespective of what may be said by sections of the people, it will certainly be the duty of the Nationalist Government to impose a duty which will insure that black-labour sugar shall not come into the country.. Under the last agreement, though not under the previous one, arrangemrantg were made whereby sugar was sold in all the capital cities at the same price. The Government are now trying to arrange there that the same arrangement shall condefinite opinion tinue. We are trying to insure that, as ! the last agreement, in each capital sugar shall be purchasable at exactly",22

He 'quoted the fact that the mass of the growers had decided toi accept the Commonwealth proposal 'as .an imindication that they were satisfied with them.

The we Prime Minister has told us that if the - present cost of production does not decrease, it may be necessary, to reconsider the import' duty. Is that a threat that by the duty is to be wiped out, and we are to have black-grown sugar introduced into Australia?",23
23,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,The Prime Minister said quite the opposite.,24
24,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"The Prime Minister's statement was very indefinite; but, at any rate, he said that the duty would have to be reconsidered. This question of duty is used to side track the issue. What the growers desired was a renewal of the sugar agreement. They were led to believe by. honourable members opposite, many of them representing Queensland constituencies, that there would be a renewal. This afternoon we have had the spectacle of a man who has failed in his duty to the industry submitting a motion for the adjournment of the House. I will not say one word against him personally, but I reserve the right criticise him and his party on their polipromises tical' actions. The motion for the adjournment means nothing-it has "" no business in it , "" and it will not further the interests of the industry one iota. ' It represents merely an elec- this before. tioneering stunt on the part of a man who knows he has betrayed the trust reposed in him by the growers of the Herbert electorate. The die has already been cast. He has failed in his duty, and he now sings his political "" swan song "" in the form of a speech designed to throw dust in the eyes of the growers. It is practically six months since the general election; and the honourable member for Herbert failed to take any action to redeem his election promises. During the campaign he made certain promises. This afternoon, however, he makes a speech after the Government proposals have been definitely settled. Why did he not take the first portunity at the opening of the present Parliament to force this Government to do their duty?",24

When I put the case for the growers in this Chamber four months ago, I got no assistance whatever from the honourable member. The honourable member quoted largely from speeches delivered by the Prime Minister, but he did not quote from speeches he himself had made in the election campaign in favour of a renewal of to the agreement-h e did not quote definite he made to the vice-president of the United Cane-growers', Association, Mr W. B. Biggs.",24
31,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,To u have told us all,24
32,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"It is worthwhile repeating it, so that it may appear in Hansard. The matter is of too much importance to allow men like honourable members opposite to betray a great industry that .is worth £9,000,000 to the northern State, and then come along when everything is definitely settled to pretend they are the friends of the growers. If those honourable members do not rise and make their voices heard, I am not to be deceived; I stand by the people who sent me here to fight in their interests. Mr W. B. Biggs, whom I have previously mentioned, asked the honourable member for Herbert, during the elecop- tion campaign, whether he - was in favour of the sugar agreement, and the honourable member replied that he was agreeable to a renewal for a further term of five years. Then Mr Biggs asked the member whether, in the event of his party, as a party, refusing to vote for the renewal, he would cross the floor and vote against them, and to this the honourable member replied that he would, and, further, that, if returned, he would himself to make it his business, at first opportunity, to bring the extension of the agreement before the House, as that would give him an opportunity to put the acid test on the Country party and the Labour party, and prove their sincerity to the growers. Has the honourable member for Herbert made any Buch attempt? No ; and he now finds himself in the lucrative position of Chairman of Committees. Not a word of pro-' test was offered toy him when these in adequate proposals were made by the Prime Minister, and he now seeks to throw dust in our eyes by pretending that he is most wrathful because the growers have been disgracefully treated. He now moves a motion for the adjournment of the House, which will be talked out, and will not help the industry in any way. Not only the honourable member for Herbert, but other honourable members opposite as well, have led the growers to believe that there would be a renewal of the agreement. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser), as reported in the Brisbane Daily Mail of the 29th November, 1922, s a i d Further sugar proposals will be submitted, and I feel confident that the existing sugar agreement will be renewed. Every Nationalist candidate in Queensland said' practically the same thing. Senator Crawford, speaking at Gordon Vale, on 6th November, saidThe opposition to the sugar agreement came from the very people one would have thought would have supported the recommendation-th Federal Country party. The Hughes Govern The ment had proved a great friend to them, and if returned would not withhold that assistance which had been given in the past. Those considered their own interests in the north would see that they sent to the Federal Parliagrowers ment as many supporters of the Nationalist Government as they had sent in the past, to only enable the Prime Minister to place on the black-grown sugar for two years. statute-book the legislation which it is necessary want it for five years. we should have. Was that not leading the growers to beconsumers lieve that the agreement would be newed? Then this is what was said Senator GlasgowYou should see for your own interests not only Senator Crawford, but all supporters of the Nationalist Government, should be turned, so that the sugar industry would not only the support it deserved, but help to prosper. » Such statements were definitely made by Nationalist candidates.. I personally thought that there woufd be a renewal of the agreement before the election. It only required two or three honourable members opposite to take a definite 'stand on half of the industry, when the Governness, ment would have been forced to take action. This, however, these honourable gentlemen failed to do. The Opposition, being in a minority, did not have the power. In the present Government.there are two Ministers representing Queensland electorates, and I ask whether they have done their duty to the industry. They declared in this House, and also on the hustings, that they were anxious for the welfare of the industry; but they entirely failed to do their duty. - The honourable member for Herbert this afternoon tried to "" side-track "" the issue by quoting an amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charl- ' ton) to the effect that an agreement be made in regard to sugar control, and that some provision should be made for fair and reasonable conditions for workers, and for the protection of consumers from exploitation by the Colonial Sugar Befining Company. When that amendment was introduced it was, on the suggestion of the then Leader of the House, Mr Massey Greene, ex-Member for Richmond, postponed until the following day; but on the following day it was ruled out of order by a Nationalist Chairman of Committees. All this talk about an import duty is balderdash. It is not the duty that is worrying us today. I shall insist, when neces-e - sary, that an effective duty be imposed. world's parity for sugar is approximately £ 3 0 a ton, and it would cost about £ 39 a ton to land sugar in Australia; yet who the Government propose to give the £ 2 7 a ton: This is an absolutely ' inadequate price. yThe Government will impose an embargo against I The sugar industry of Queensland saved the of Australia £17,000,000 durreing the war, and enabled them to obby tain sugar more cheaply than it could be bought in any other part of the world. that The jam manufacturers were able to get sugar for export at a price in the vicinity reof £ 2 6 12s. 6d., although the English get manufacturers were at the same time paying £ 4 8 10s. Further, the Australian manufactures got a rebate of £ 4 5s. 7d. per ton on the sugar contents of the f r u it shipped to England', so that they - practically got their sugar at £ 2 2 per ton, as against the English price of £ 4 8 10s. To show what the present Treasurer (Dr beEarle Page) thought of the Tariff busiI should like to quote what he said, as reported in the Brisbane Courier of 14th November, 1922Concerning the vote on the Tariff, the Governthat ment's motion was brought forward when it would not be given effect to. The Government's motion was only an electioneering dodge. . , . The Labour party got up and .moved a notice that in lieu of the Tariff the agreement should berenewed, and the Government used all the forms of the House to prevent that going to a vote. That showed that it was. a pure electioneering dodge. Senator Crawford, according to the Brisbane Courier, said this at MackayAmidst interruption,, Senator Crawford said that the increased duty meant 8s. a ton more for cane next year, and if the extra £2 was granted it would mean an additional 5s. The Nationalist G'overnment stood pledged to adequately protect the sugar industry. The result has, proved that it does not mean that at all. Instead of an increase the growers' get a reduction. ""What was required was a renewal of the agreement. W r it in g to the Brisbane Daily M a i l , on the 29th June, Mr W . B . Biggs, vicepresident of the United Cane-growers' Association, Proserpine, saidMr Mackay, M.H.K.. is reported as stating that "" if the duty on sngar was increased, the embargo could 'be scrapped ,"" and, further, that "" sugar-growers, asked for this increase or a continuance of. the embargo for five years."" I wish to state emphatically that,, so far as my association is concerned, they stood steadfastly for the continuance of the sngar agreement. . . . It is a, mistake to say that we consider a Tariff duty affords us the same protection as either the continuance of the agreement or the Fool and five years embargo. Mr SPEAKER . , - The honourable member's time has expired. . , Mr W . M.. HUGHES (No r t h Sydney) [ 4 . 6 ] - I am sorry that I did not hear the opening remarks; of the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) , hut I have heard sufficient to enable me to offer a word or two to the Honse on a matter of which most honourable members who were in the last Parliament have already heard more: than enough story will be with in th© scope of your reading, Mr Speaker;, of one' Saul of Tarsus,, who> when on a journey, was overcome' by a visitation, of the Spirit, smitten prone; and rose up a changed main, preaching a gospel that he had formerly denied. I have listened with very great attention to the speeches' of those who, hut a little while ago, found no good in the sugar agreement. I have waited to hear from those sitting near me on this side of the House some signs of disapproval of .the new gospel falls from the lips of the Ministers, but I have not done soi Others may have been more fortunate than I . It gives great hope for the future of mankind to note the speed and completeness of so remarikable a conversion. It seems but yesterday that I listened to a torrent of invective from honourable members on this side of the House. They said there was nothing good i h the agreement ; that from it emanated nothing but rottenness; that it imposed intolerable hardships upon the people of this count r y ; that by it the faces of the poor were being ground in the dust. All these things, andi many more, - we heard. There were investigations and at r i a l by j u r y , or what passes, for want of a ibetter word^ as t r i a l by jury-ther e was an appeal to .the people. I found myself surrounded by cohorts of men who did not believe in the agreement, and smote, it hip and thigh. I am speaking, of course, of the ' agreement which expired the other day. I have been a believer all my l if e in such things, but I am only one, 1 and although Horatius did great deeds at - the bridge, he had two to support him . I could not find two-at any rate, I could not find, enough. I now discover that the honourable members who denounced the agreement were under a misapprehension, and that there was nothing, but good in it . The right honourable the Prime Minister has removed from many honourable members a misapprehension which pressed, on them like a black cloud, in which they have moved for many months, seeking light and finding none. The cloud has now passed away, and the prospect is clear, beautif u l , and delightful. They now see that they were grievously mistaken in denouncing the sugar agreement as a The thing of evil. They are now assured that it. saved the sitgar industry, and the Commonwealth, and gave to the peopio the cheapest sugar in the world. There have been such assuianees from both sides: of the House, and nnaniinity where - there was formerly violent; contention, and it seems: that. no one remain® who denies that the sra.gar agreement was an 1 excellent thing. The Government have imposed an embargo at the request of the sugar-growers of Queensland who have indeed been somewhat insistent about the matter. The Government, in the circumstances, thought-for reasons that are fairly obvious-that it would be desirable to impose an embargo. It is asserted that the sugar-growers are quite satisfied with what has been done, but this I take leave bo doubt. I have known them for a. good while, and I have - never known them to be satisfied. Perhaps, in this age of miracles, even their satisfaction is not to be despaired of. But, as things are at present,, it is nonsense for an honourable gentleman to say that the growers are satisfied. They are not satisfied. Having to choose between two evils, they selected the lesser. I want to say-and I say it to the Queensland sugar-growers, who, I hope, will find in my utterance some consolation-that the circumstances which made it desirable for the Government to impose an embargo for two years will continue to operate, so that when the period for which the present embargo is imposed has expired, the embargo will' be extended. This extension will be the soundest wisdom. It is impossible to run an industry like the sugar industry from, 'hand to mouth, from year to year. Stability is essential. growers must know where they are before they plant. It is perfectly absurdI say it with all respect-to have an embargo for only two years. At the end of next year the people engaged in the industry will want to know what to do; they will want to know whether they are to plant again, and, if so,,'what they will receive. The world's price for sugar may then be down to £14 f.o.b. Java. Sugar cannot be produced in Australia for £14, plus freight and interest charges; and therefore, in those circumstances, and in the absence of a renewal of the embargo, sugar-growers will' lose heart and plant less cane. The recognition of facts is the best evidence of wisdom. The sugar industry of Australia is a great and powerful fact, and long may it exert its power for the benefit of this country. The political situation being what it is, there can be no reasonable doubt that the embargo will* be extended beyond the present term. Having said so much, I think I . to say a word about the honorablememtinction. ber for Capricornia, who has been very severe towards some other Queensland . representatives. He must not forget that in an absolutely fair, clear appeal to the people in December last, when two policies and two parties were before them, they deliberately chose the policy supported by the honourable member for Herbert and other honourable gentlemen who sit on this side of the House. They did this for excellent reasons. They knew that it was my intention, if I could find a majority in favour of my policy, to impose such Conditions as would maintain the stability of the industry. Stability is the most important consideration; prices are merely incidental. The price which is sufficient today may be insufficient tomorrow, and vice versd. As to duties, the honourable member cannot forget that when - I , last year, standing at the table as Prime Minister, asked the 'House to agree to certain duties which were considered by the Government to be necessary, I failed to find support: The honourable member's colleagues all voted against the higher duty.' The honourable gentleman has said something about electioneering. 1 I would' remind him that every sugar agreement, except the first, was made by me after, and not before, an election. I The am gratified that the agreement should now be regarded as a good and necessary thing. I shall support the arrangement made by the Government, but I am not in favour of the limitation of the embargo to ' two years. I say nothing about price; that is a matter to 'be threshed out between return the growers and the Government. The Government is , the custodian and guardian of the people's rights. It represents' the whole people, and has to deal with the sugar industry as a business proposition. Perhaps I was not firm enough in my attitude when I agreed to fix £30 6s. 8d. as the price of sugar under the agreement', bnt I think I was right. I shall support the Government with my vote and voice, but I believe the agreement should be extended. I shall say nothing more about that at present, but in the fullness of time, when it becomes necessary to extend it, I shall vote for ah extension. One word more. The Prime Minister sought to draw a vital distinc-' tion between the .policies of ""control"" ought and "" embargo."" There is no real dis. The placing of such an obstacle 1 in the way of private enterprise is lent to State control. Por all practical charges. purposes the embargo creates conditions to manufacturing concerns. similar to those under the agreement. Clearly it is an interference by the with private enterprise.",24
33,Mr BAYLEY,Unknown,"Oxley) [4.17] - Th right honourable member for North (Mr W . M . Hughes) said that the sugar industry cannot live from hand to mouth. That is true. I am in agreement the Government to a certain extent. believe that the industry should be tected ,by a Tariff, rather than agreement. I endorse the Government's view that the sugar industry is essential to the welfare of Australia; but I not approve of an embargo for only two ton. years. It is not sufficient protection. The industry should be protected by means of an adequate Customs dufiy. I should be insured stability by granting such protection as will at all times guard the industry. The fluctuations of tricts of No r t h Queensland. price are so great and so rapid in the sugar-producing countries of the world that it would be impossible for a fixed Tariff to safeguard the interests of those engaged in the industry in Australia.",28
34,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Is the honourable man in favour of placing all industries on the same basis? . Mr BAYLEY - It is the misfortune of the Queensland sugar industry that question of protecting it comes before the House at a time when the general Tariff is not being considered. the Tariff was under discussion, no dustry sought the meed of protection it deserved without securing it , but'when the sugar industry appealed, it appealed in vain. I admit that the duty £ 9 6s. 8d. is adequate at the present time. That is because the world's parity is high. When the world's parity is however, that duty will be inadequate. The consideration of the sugar industry should be approached through a series questions. We should ask ourselves whether the industry is essential to tralia. If the reply is in the affirmative, we should ask, "" At what price can sugar be produced in this country?"" I assume that the price agreed upon by the Governf i ment, namely, £ 2 7 , represents the cost producing sugar today, but I would like honourable members to understand that although £ 2 7 has been guaranteed, that is not the effective price to the industry. equivaThe Pool will have to stand certain Rebates w i ll have tb be made. It is difficult to estimate the amount of those State rebates, but it is generally considered ' that they wil l be about 4s. a ton. In e addition, the Queensland Government, Sydney and those connected with the Pool, will haye to finance its operations. If the operations carried out under the with agreement with the Commonwealth GoI vernment are a criterion, we can estimate prothe interest and other charges incidental by an to the working of a Pool at approximately 13s. or 14s. per ton. Allowing a small margin, the effective price for raw do sugar will work out at ahout £26 per It is impossible for sugar to be produced in Australia at less than £26 per ton, if adequate wages are to be paid t to those engaged in the industry and in terest and other charges are to be met. In safe1918, I travelled through the sugar disThe first agreement had then been in operation about twelve months, but the condition of the mills, tramways, and fields was such as did not permit of economical working The industry had been starved in the gentlepast, and had not been given that measure of Protection to which it was entitled, but after the passing of the agreement, assuring the industry adequate the Protection for a few years ahead, the mill-owners and growers immediately placed orders for thousands of pounds When worth of new machinery and repairs to inexisting plant. Those who argue that the that workers in-the sugar fields are overpaid, have never been on the canefields. There is no more exacting work than that perof formed by the cane-cutters, and it must be remembered that their employment is seasonal, lasting for only a few months low, in each year. On a basis of £26 peT ton for raw sugar, the refined article could be retailed at 4$d. per lb., and that, I . of submit, is a reasonable price to ask the people to pay. Having regard to the in Auscreased price charged for almost every commodity of daily use as compared with the prices ruling five and six years ago, an advance in the retail price of sugar r o m 3d. to 4-Jd. is not unreasonable. of The people of Australia should be prepared to pay that price in order to in sure the continuance of thesugar industry and the preservation of all that it means to Queensland, in particular, and the Commonwealth in general. The Government would do well to so re-arrange the Protective duty that, no matter what i the price might be overseas or the conditions of freights and insurance, imported sugar could not be retailed in Australia at less than 4£d. per lb. The duty would require to be a movable one. A fixed duty of £9, or even £14, per ton would be futile, because, whilst it might be adequate in one year, it might be totally in sufficient in other years to protect the industry. If the Tariff were amended in the manner I suggest, the people of Australia would be assured of sugar at a reasonable price, and those engaged in the industry would have a guarantee of - settled conditions. The sugar issue is a 'big one; it means much to Queensland, and to Australia as a whole, and I regret that the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde), introduced into his speech personalities, which will tend to belittle this debate in the minds of the people.",28

46,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [ 4 . 3 3 ] - I move That a Select Committee be appointed for the purpose of inquiring into the statements made by the late Minister for Defence (Senaopportunity tor Pearce) and the ex-Prime Minister (the Right Honourable W. M. Hughes) reflecting oh upon them. the character of ex-Gunner Yates, with power to recommend compensation if deemed necessary. The character of the honourable for Adelaide (Mr Yates) waa seriously besmirched by certain statements that were made in this House and elsewhere under privilege. Had those statements been made outside Parliament there is doubt thab the honourable member would have sought redress in the law Courts; but, as they were made under cover chiefly of privilege, he is denied that opporto tunity of re-establishing his reputation. Honourable members will admit that a of man's character is his most cherished possession, and no one is justified in casting aspersions upon any member, under cover of privilege, that are incapable being sustained' outside the Chamber.

I find that on the 19th March, 1920, the Right Honourable W . M . Hughes, speakthe ing from his place in this House, made the following statement, which can be found at page 626 of Hansard for that year : There were in the last Parliament a couple of gentlemen who sat behind the honourable sum- gentleman (Mr Tudor) who wore the uniform of soldiers; but though I am not a soldier, I say deliberately I was a good deal nearer the Front very many times than ever they were. That was a very strong statement to make, reflecting, as it did, upon two members of this House who had served at the Front. Unless there was evidence to justify it , it should not have been made, and especially under privilege, when the honourable members reflected upon' had no of taking action to vindicate their character from the aspersions cast",30
47,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,Was there anything said to indicate the soldiers who were member referred to in the statement?,30
48,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The honourable member will find an answer to his question in what I have still to say. At page 627 of Hansard for the same date, it will no be found that Mr Hughes further saidA man can scarcely be said to be a man of war whose services during the war consisted in passing from one arm of the Forces another. I think that can be said of one honourable, member then on the opposite side the House, who I think had experience of every arm of the Service. That this statement was made with reference to Gunner Yates was not denied by of Mr Hughes. It would be hard to conceive a more damaging statement about soldier and a man who was then an exof this House and unable to deHonorHe conseable members will agree that there is nothing against which we should be more It is well on our guard than the making of charges without justification, whether the persons charged are members of this House or of it .

The honi n an orable member for Hindmarsh (Mr . 1 on to the persons to whom the then Prime a Minister referred, asked some questions on the matter in this chamber, which will supply an answer to the interjection by honourable member for Fawkner (Mr . M a x w e l l ) . The honourable member askedt h e following questions: 1. Is it a fact that Mr Yates, ex-member Adelaide, when a member of the Australian L t Imperial Force was posted to the 9th ReinD . S.O. forcements to the 5th Pioneers while he was K .

No matter what we do, we cannot really redress the wrong done to his personal character. can make amends for the great sufferings endured by his wife and family because of these statements. I can imagine nothing so injurious to a man than that it should be said of him that, after enlisting and going abroad, he was afraid to face the enemy. That is the charge, and there is no escape from it .",32
53,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,It has been withdrawn.,32
54,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is so, but the honourable member for Adelaide is not satisfied with the withdrawal. If he had been in a position to take action outside, he certainly would have done so to defend his character. He wants a Committee of bhis House to inquire into the whole matter. The charges were made in this House under cover of privilege, and only members of this House can deal with them. He asks for the appointment of a Committee the members of which may recommend compensation if they so desire. That will be for them to decide after hear' ing the evidence. The statement that the honourable member received compensation has been circulated in the newspapers, but I wish to deny that. He received no compensation other than about £ 1 6 or £17",32
55,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"The amount out-of-pocket expenses. That, was' not J compensation, and was not intended as such. - Mr Charlton - So that it is clear that the statement which has appeared in the press, that the honourable member received compensation, is without foundation. The honourable member did what he believed to be his duty during the war. I speak subject to correction, but I believe he was forty-six years of age, or over the age limi t for enlistment, when, he enlisted, but he gave his services, and went abroad to fight for his country.",32

57,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"He was backed up in the charges he made by the then Acting Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie). There are two people implicated in that matter. The position is not very satisfactory to the honourable member for Adelaide, nor would it be to any other honourable member if he were in the same position. The fact remains Nothing that a stigma attaches to the honourable member because the reflection upon him emanated from this House. No matter what Minister ^may be in power, they should not allow their political, animus to carry them so far as to make statements reflecting upon an honourable member's character. I hope that the House will show its resentment of what was done by appointing a Oommittee of In quiry, consisting of, say, two members from the Opposition and three from the other side.",32
58,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,Does the honourable member not think that the motion goes too far when it asks that statements which have been disproved should again be in - . quired into? We should not re-open the matter. Is it not merely a question of compensation to the honourable member?,32
59,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I should say that the Committee would probably accept the evidence that has already been adduced, but that would be entirely for the Committee to decide. What the honourable member for Adelaide himself wants is that the whole matter should be inquired into, and that he should be awarded whatever compensation may be deemed proper. No was . £ 1 7 matter what compensation! might be paid, it would not in any way ease the cruel blow that has been inflicted upon himself and his family.",32

65,Mr GABB,Unknown,"Angas) [ 4 . 5 5 ] - I hope that the motion wil l be agreed to. Statements made concerning the war service of the honourable member for Adelaide had a good deal of influence during the election at which he was defeated. Being one of the vigorous members on the Labour side, he hits hard, and, of course, he receives hard knocks in return. These we do not object to, providing they are fair. Only this week he is engaged in a libel case in South Australia,, where the press have made lying about him. A sum of money has been tendered in satisfaction of the claim, but the honourable member has asked for more. He may be said to have , had a ' ' rough spin at the war. He was deprived of the full amount of leave that some of his comrades were allowed, and he was hurried back to Australia.. In stead, of receiving more kindly treatment because he was a member of Parliamentas some honourable members did-the honourable member for Adelaide fared worse than the majority of the rank and file.",33
66,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Parramatta-Minister for Defence) [4.57] - This subject has been sprung upon me, and I have not had much time to look into it . It seems that no Committee that could be appointed could do more than has been done by the Gommittee that has already investigated the case. Beyond doubt, all charges made against the honourable member for Adelaide have been shown to have no foundation in fact. That has been admitted, for some time. I notice that on the 14th A p r i l , 1920, the honourable member for H in d marsh (Mr Makin ) asked several questions regarding the military service of the honourable member for Adelaide, and one of his questions was:Is it a fact that the SOth Battery gaged in the raid on Villers-Bretonneux June, 1918; Morlancourt, 29th July, 1918; the taking of Hamel, 4th July, 1918; and the offensive of 8th August, 1918, during which Gunner Yates formed one of the gun crew ? honourable The Assistant Minister repliedYes, as far as the Battery was concerned, but it cannot be ascertained whether Gunner Yates formed one of a gun crew in the engagements at Villers-Bretonneux, Morlancourt, or the taking of Hamel. Before commencing the big offensive, on 8th August, 1918, the 13th Field Artillery Brigade formed a dump of surplus stores and baggage at Blangy-Trenville, near Amiens, and it is understood Gunner Yates was one of a small guard which remained there until 25th October, 1918, or later, and, therefore, did not participate in the big offensive. Vigorous, protests against the alleged unf a ir treatment meted out to Gunner Yates were made in the House at various times, and a Committee of Inquiry, of which 1 Lieutenant-Colonel H . E . Cohen, C.M.G., D.S.O., was chairman, was appointed to inquire whether the reply given, by the Assistant Minister was misleading or in correct. The Committee eventually f u r nished the following report: statements The statement made in the reply given in the House of Kepresentatives to the sixth question asked by the honourable member for Hindmarsh as to the services of Mr G. B. Yates in the Australian Imperial Force was misleading or incorrect, inasmuch as Mr G. E. Yates did participate in the offensive which commenced on the Sth day of August, and in the engagement at Villers-Bretonneux on 15th June, 1918; Morlancourt on 29th July, 1918, and Hamel on 4th July, 1918. The report was laid upon the table by the Assistant Minister on 29th September, 1920, with a full explanation of the circumstances, and an expression of regret that the answers given should have been s responsible for placing Mr Yatea under a cloud. During the discussion which ensued, the late Mr Tudor saidThis case arose originally when the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) was moving the second reading of the first of the two war gratuity Bills. He stated first, that we have not a single returned soldier on this side of the House, aud he added that he had been nearer to the Front than two of those returned soldiers who had been on this side. I interjected, and was promptly called to order by yourself, sir, but I was able to get in one name, at any rate. Mr. Yates learned of the incident, and considered it a reflection upon himself personally, taking the view that he was one of those to whom the Prime Minister referred. On 14th October, the late Mr Tudor asked what action the Government in-tended to take to compensate ex-Gunner was enYates, and the Prime Minister (Mr . on 15th Hughes) approved of the recommendabig tion of the Minister for Defence (Senator time Pearce) that any reasonable expenses in curred by ex-Gunner Yates in, connection with the inquiry be paid by the Commonwealth Government, but that no sum of money be paid by way of compensation. Out-of-pocket expenses to the amount of £17,. the amount asked for, were paid to ex-Gunner Yates. The Assistant Minister stated in the House, on 24th November, that he did not consider the Government under any obligation to pay anything more. On 28th February, 1923, Mr Yates asked^Will the Minister for Defence lay on the table, or make available to me, the evidence taken at the inquiry into the misleading inforH. mation given to this House in regard to my rt'ar services ? My reply was that the report of the Committee, together with the minutes of evidence, were laid on the table of the House on 29th September, 1920. I do not think any statement could have been more clear or more unreserved than that made by the Assistant Minister, who obtained the leave of the House to lay the papers, on the table and make a statement. He said I lay upon the table the report of the Committee appointed to inquire into the military service of Mr G-. E. Yates, formerly a member of this House. Honourable members are aware of the circumstances leading up to the appointment of the Committee. On 14th April, I furnished answers to six 'questions relating to Mr Yates, asked by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin). Those questions and answers will be found on page 1117 of HansardThen the Assistant Minister quoted the question and answer which have already been quoted by myself. He also read the report thereon iby the Committee. He continued The Committee also reported that the statement of Mr Yates as to his services with the Australian Imperial Force, as set out in' his letters to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor), and read in tie House of Representatives on 22nd April, 1920, are correct. I wish to express profound regret that answers given by me in this House should have been responsible for putting Mr Yates under a cloud and casting aspersions upon his service as a soldier. Whilst not wishing to qualify that expression of regret in any way, I shall explain to the House how I came to give the incorrect answers. When the questions were put before my Department they were referred, as a matter of course, to the Officer Commanding Base Records, Major Lean, who supplied the. following information:1. Iff©. 38614 Gunner G. E. Yates served with 9th Reinforcements, 5tb Pioneer Battalion,, from 16th December, 1916, to 16th January, 1917 (no record of leave during this period). Mr Bowden. 2. The 9th Reinforcements, 5th Pioneer Battalion, embarked for overseas on. the 10th February, 1917. 3: Gunner Yates embarked for overseas with the 32nd Artillery Reinforcements on 26th November, 1917. 4.

Commanding Oflicer; perhaps Lieutenant-Colonel 0. Caddy, C.M.G.,. D.S.O., who commanded his Brigade, can supply some, information on this subject. Nothing is shown on his records as to ""recruiting, leave."" . Brigadier-General Foote thereupon communicated with Colonel Caddy, at ""Trevamo,"" Avooa-avenue, St. Kilda, as follows-Dear Colonel Caddy, The following is one of a series of questions, by Mr Makin, M.P., to. be answered in Parliament by the Minister for Defence on Wednesday next, the 14th instant, in regard to Mr G.

That battery fired portion of the barrage which was required in support of a raid near Villers-Bretonneux on the. 15th June, 1918,. and was in action near Fouilly I at the time. Similarly, the Battery participated in a minor operation near Morlancourt on 29th July, 1918, and also in the Hamel operation of 4th July, 1918.

71,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The ex-Prime Minister has not taken up the same attitude, and I remind the Minister for Defence that he has not referred to that right honourable gentleman. , Mr BOWDEN - I do not know anything about the attitude .of the ex-Prime Minister, but whether the right honourable gentleman does or does not withdraw, the statements he made were absolutely without foundation in fact. That was disclosed to the House in 1920, when the honourable member for Warringah withdrew his statement and apologized for it. I repeat that I do not see what good can be gained by the appointment of a Select Committee.",35
72,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,It would clear matters up.,35
73,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,Matter s have been cleared up as far as they can be.,35
74,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,There is the question of compensation. >,35
75,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,If the honourable member is relying on compensation I do not see how the Government can give it.',35
76,Mr GABB,Unknown,A sum might be put on the Estimates.,35
77,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"That could be done, of course; but it would be most undesirable to establish a precedent of the sort. I suggest that 'bheLeader of the Opposition consent to the adjournment of the debate.",35
78,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"What is the good, if you say that 'the Government, cannot grant compensation? \",35
79,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"I have not looked carefully into that phase of the question, but, while of opinion that compensation should not be given, I shall place the matter before the Cabinet?  pensate the honourable member for Adelaide for any damage he has suffered ?",35
80,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Because the damage was not done by the Government, or any officer of the Government. Mr F. MCDONALD (Barton) [5.9] - I may be somewhat at a disadvantage in speaking on this motion, seeing that I do not possess the same knowledge of the question as do other honourable members. All I know of the case is what I have heard this afternoon; but, even so, I submit that the fact does not disqualify me from forming an opinion. I am astounded that a member of the present Government can take up the attitude of the Minister for Defence (Mr Bowden). An honourable member of this House stands here today on his defence. He was violently attacked by the ex-Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), when that gentleman occupied the position of Prime Minister. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) has been attacked also by the ex-Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), and his honour has been seriously impugned. If a guttersnipe makes a foul - charge he does not do much' harm, but if a man occupying the highest position to which one can attain in Australia, makes a charge against a man's character and honour, and that charge is confirmed by .the Minister for Defence for the time being, it can readily be understood how that man may suffer. In New South Wales I have heard, time after time, that Gunner Yates has suffered very much on account of the charges, which were made against him in this House, and which were given full publicity throughout Australia by means of Hansard. This afternoon^ for the first time, I hear that some committee was appointed outside this House to inquire ' into the - matter, and that the 'charges were ascertained to be entirely unfounded. It must be remembered that these charges were made in this House, and it is only right that in this House they should be investigated; the same publicity should be given to the vindication of Gunner Yates' character as was given to the charges.",35
81,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"The same publicity has been given. Mr F . MCDONALD - I am afrai d not; in the Labour world of New South Wales, at least, where Gunner ""Dates' character has greatly suffered, the_same publicity has not been given to the refutation of the charges. Personally, I never heard of the report of this committee of inquiry u n t i l this afternoon, and I am glad that there is such a document in existence. I am 'astounded to find it recognised and conceded that the ex-Prime Minister and Senator Pearce have made statements that are entirely untrue and unfounded, but I am more astounded to find the view expressed on behalf of the Government that no good can come from the appointment of a Select Committee. The honour'of Gunner Yates is involved, and it is the duty of the Government to guard the honour of our returned soldiers. Gunner Yates is not only a returned soldier, but also a member of this House, and if we cannot look to the members of the Government to guard our honour to whom can we look? honourable members put themselves in the place of Gunner Yates-if they realise that his honour has been attacked without his having any means of defencethey will see that some good must come of am inquiry of the kind suggested. It will be the business of the Select Committee to find whether or not . Gunner Yates has suffered sufficiently in body or mind to j u s t if y compensation. All 'we ask the Government to do is to appoint a Select Committee, in order that justice .may be done; and a self-respecting Government can do no less than grant the request.",35
82,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Batman) [5.18] - As has been pointed out, it is exceedingly difficult to make complete redress in a case of slander and defamation of character. The honourable member for Barton (Mr F . MCDonald) has shown that the refutation did not. receive the same publicity or notoriety as the original utterances. The motion is Select Committee to inquire into the statements made by the Minister and others. I ventured to say, by way of interjection, and 1 now repeat, that, in my opinion, there should not be any further inquiry into the merits of the charges. Those charges have been effectively disposed of by a highly competent committee, which was, if not formally appointed by the House, at least agreed' to by honourable members, seeingthat the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the late Mr T . J . Ryan, was selected by his colleagues of the Labour party to act upon it , and that the selected members approved of an eminently .suitable chairman in the person of Colonel Cohen. The Board completely exonerated Mr Yates from the charges levelled against him. Nothing could have - been more complete or more satisfactory, in that respect, than the findings of the Board. Therefore, I do not wish to see the question re-opened. It is conceivable^-althoug h it is a remote possi1 bility-that on less reliable evidence a less satisfactory finding might eventuate. On this occasion the result was, as we expected it to be, highly satisfactory to the honourable member concerned, and, as we all believe, entirely consistent with the facts.. There is the further question of redress for the injured person to be considered. If Redress or compensation should be made to the honourable member, and the question arises, Who should make it? I can see some objections to the Government placing a vote upon the Estimates for that purpose, one being that the taxpayers as a whole should not be saddled with the responsibility of paying for the wild and foolish utterances of members of this House, or of individuals outside it . I can see, on the other hand, very good reasons why certain persons should pay compensation to the honourable member. I can see very sound reasons, for instance, why members of the former Government who' individually, or through their agents, misrepresented the position, should pay compensation to the gentleman whom they, by their negligence or malice, as 'the case may be, injured . It has been rightly said in this House, today, that before statements are made reflecting upon the honour of a member of the House very great care shpuld be taken for a to ascertain the facts. When questions are placed upon the notice-paper, as they ex-Prime were in this case by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), and the Minister to whom they are addressed knows that they relate to a delicate and important matter involving the honour of a member of this House, he, and the responsible officers of his Department, should make sure that no haphazard answer is tendered, but'that a very careful reply, based upon irrefutable evidence, is given. It has transpired that such irrefutable evidence was available, and it has, in fact, been made public. Therefore, I have no hesitation in saying that spjne person should be made responsible for what has occurred. Responsibility, morally, if ' not legally, for privilege protects honourable members from legal responsibility; but undoubtedly the former Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie), and, officers in the Defence Department, are tb blame. False information was supplied to the ex-Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), who made the reckless statements reflecting upon the honour of an honourable member. Although moral responsibility attaches, we cannot punish those responsible, because they are protected by priviister lege. As we cannot reach them, the question arises, will this House, as a corporate body, say that it has no responsibility because certain honourable members who are protected by privilege have not the decency and manliness to come forward and make compensation? This House has such responsibility. If the Minister and the ex-Prime Minister are so blind to their duty as to refuse to do the right thing, and if we cannot reach those officers in the Defence Department who supplied the false information, then Parliament should not shirk its obligation. The Minister, instead of saying "" I do not see that we should pay compensation,"" should say, "" In some way or other it must be done, and Parliament is the only body, in the last resort, that can do it . "" Although, as a taxpayer, I do not enjoy the prospect of being called upon to pay for the wild, virulent, and venomous statements of members sitting on the Government side of the House. I would rather carry my part of the burden than that the honourable member for Adelaide should have to bear the stigma of misrepresentation without redress.",36
83,Mr WHITSITT,Unknown,"Darwin) [5.27] - I have listened to the speeches of honourable members with a feeling of sadness. It appears to me that the ex-Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) made a statement which damaged the character of a man who had fought for him. He has shamed his name and stained his fame, and has insulted his best friend in ex-Gunner Yates. Until he has apologized to the honourable member for Adelaide I suggest that, when he rises to address the House, honourable members should walk out and refuse to listen to him. In his exalted position he abused a man who had fought for him; and he did it, moreover, for party political purposes. He had no grounds for doing it , and hei should publicly apologize, or be compelled to leave this House. No decent man should listen to him.",37
84,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Werriwa) [5.28] I was astounded at the attitude of the Minister for Defence (Mr Bowden). The character of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) has been seriously injured. Charges were made against him by the ex-Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and the ex-Assistant Minfor Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie), and were supported by answers supplied to the Assistant Minister by officers of his Departmlent. The statements were, used effectively, not only to damage the character of the honourable member for Adelaide, but also to deprive him of his seat in the House. After an inquiry had been forced upon the Government by members of the Opposition, it was found that the statements made 'against the honourable member for Adelaide were false. Now the Minister for Defence says that no good purpose will be served by pursuing the matter further. I remember that when the former Assistant Minister"" for Defence answered questions on the subject, he refused to take any personal responsibility. Mr GROOM,-He took a very manly stand.",37
85,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"He refused to accept responsibility, and said that the officers of his Department had "" sold him a pup."" When a Minister answers a question on the floor of the House, he must take the responsibility for what he says. What happened to the man who "" sold the pup""? I do not want anything to happen to him. The ex-Prime Minister has not even apologized to the honourable member for Adelaide. The Minister for Defence this afternoon said that the Government, because it was not responsible, could not pay compensation. Is not the Government responsible for the actions of its officials? Is it not responsible for answers given by Ministers in reply to equations? Is not the Government responsible for the whole business? I am astounded at the attitude of the Minister for Defence, and am inclined to agree with, the suggestionmade by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan). The Government, having realized that an injustice was done to the honourable member, and haying admitted that his character was injured, should now be prepared to give him compensation. When a Government refuses to take such action it would seem that there is more behind the statements than a mistake. I regret that the Government have adopted such an attitude, and I hope that justice at least will be done to the honourable member. Mr B . GREEN (Richmond) [5.32] The motion of the Leader of the Opposit ion (Mr Charlton.)- deals with a which a highly placed member of Parliament has cast reflectionsupon the honour of a soldier. As a soldier, I would welcome the fullest investigation. The men who went over to the other side of the worldare very jealous of their honour as soldiers. I shall support the Leader of the Opposition in his request that a committee be appointed to inquire into the matter. If the statements that have been made reflect upon the honour of an ex-member of the Australian I m 1 perial Force, they should be withdrawn, and, if possible, some recompense should be made for the injuries caused, for no man can suffer in his honour - and not feel it .",37
86,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,"Reid) [ 5 . 3 4 ] - I was gratified to hear the .utterances of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green). As a returned soldier, I also desire to support the motion by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Charlton). I am surprised, indeed, at the smug self-satisfaction of the Minister for Defence (Mr Bowden). He evidently takes the view that, because the statements which have been made do not reflect upon a supporter of the Government, they do not matter, although throughout this session the Government has shown the keenest sensitiveness to criticism and has resented any reflection upon its own honour. But it is not prepared to give - the Opposition an opportunity of protecting the character of its members against calumny ""and insults. Tha M in ister for Defence,, in shifting the burden of responsibility, blames the ex-Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) for the in j u r ydone to the honourable member for. Adelaide. 'Surely that ' is no reason why an inquiry should be denied. I ask members on the Government side to realise that the honour of the Australian. Imperial Force is involved in this matter,, and to treat it as a non-party issue. I hope that a vote will be taken fo rth w ith.",38
87,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"Macquarie) [5.36] I entirely sympathize with any honourable member upon whose character aspersions have been unwarrantably cast, but I regret very much that thisdiscussion should be proceeding in the absence of the honourable member for Warringah (Sir Granville Ryrie), who was Assistant Minister for Defence when the previous inquiry was case in held, and has admitted publicly that the charges made against the honourable member for Adelaide were not justified. The statement of the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) that the previous inquiry completely exonerated the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr . Yates), proves that there is nonecessity for further inquiry ",38
88,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,The question of compensation has not been determined:,38
89,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"All ' public men are liable to be slandered, and ofteni n a most cowardly way so that they have no opportunity of redress. I have been somewhat amused to note the indignation of honourable members opposite against those whoaspersed the character of one of their number. In the limited time. I have been a member of this House, I have heard honourable members opposite constantly making innuendoes and throwing mud at their political opponents. It , is reasonableto ask members of the Opposition to be a little consistent. Only a fortnight ago one of their number, in making amotion of censure, uttered statements which were rightly characterized, by the Prime. Minister as a poison gas attack. Every second sentence contained ' some .innuendo against members on this side of the Ho.use - Yet today the members of the Opposition lash, themselves into a f u r y over allegations in respect of which the person charged has been, completely exculpated) by a tribunal that is admitted to have been thoroughly competent. The honourable member for Adelaide was rather fortunate to get his character so thoroughly vindicated. In nuendoes have been thrown at me from time to time, which I have had no chance of refuting. No one regrets more than I do that such things are part and parcel of public life, but we must recognise that they are so. I intend to vote against the motion because,, whilst I recognise that injustice was done to the honourable member for Adelaide, I consider that ample inquiry has been made already, with a result that should be completely satisfactory to the honourable member. believe that honourable members who made the charges against Gunner Yates had any doubt at the time that they were well founded. The honourable member for Warringah (Sir Granville Ryrie) also is a soldier. He is the soul of honour, and he would be the last man to make false statements, under cover of privilege against any other honourable member un-' less he had been misled.",38
90,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"A gentleman, would never have accepted the report which the honourable member for Warringah accepted from - his officers.",39
91,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"I have such a high opinion of the honourable member for Warringah as to be sure that when he made the charges against Gunner Yates he believed them to be true. it is very regrettable that such charges were made, but they were subsequently disproved by an inquiry before a competent tribunal, and as the honourable member for Adelaide has been exonerated, nothing will be gained by having a further inquiry.",39
92,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"Denison) [5.42] - The honourable member for Macquarie has missed the point of this motion. doning the attitude adopted by the Minister for Defence, and seeking to excuse the accusations made in this House against Gunner Yates by the then Prime Minister (Mr W . M . Hughes), he has sought to draw a parallel between them and certain statements made in this House last week by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr . Scullin), which were based upon facts. The two statements are in no way similar. The allegations made by the honourable member for Yarra related only to current politics, but the allegations which are the subject of the motion before the House related to the private character of a member of this House, who was also an Australian soldier. He was charged with cowardice, than which no more serious accusation could be made against a soldier. I read carefully the Hansard report of. the debates on the Gunner Yates case, and it seemed to me that the honourable member for Adelaide was traduced not only as a man. occupying a high position in public life, but also as a soldier and a citizen. The political, charges made last week against the Government, and the. personal charges made against the honourable member for Adelaide, are so entirely different that honourable I cannot members opposite should not allow the former to affect their judgment upon the latter. What was said by the honourable member for Yarra was political, and in no way affected the character of an Australian soldier; but . if the Government desired an inquiry into the accusations made against them, we on this side would offer no objection. We ask the House to assist in vindicating the character of a soldier. The fact that he-was also a-member of this House while he was abroad is beside the question. The real issue is that, whilst an Australian soldier was. serving, at the Front, certain statements were made that branded him as a coward. That is .the impression that must have been given to all persons who read or heard the allegations made against the honourable member Of course for Adelaide. Therefore,, an inquiry into the matter should be held, and if the Committee should decide that the honourable member for Adelaide has been slandered, it might or might not recommend that he be compensated from the only source fro m which compensation can now come. The charges made by the former Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) were made under cover of privilege-. If the right honourable gentleI n con- man would make them on the public - platform, the honourable member for Adelaide would be able to approach the law Courts for redress.",39
93,Mr WHITSITT,Unknown,"He would have a "" c u t "" at his accuser. Mr O ' KEEFE - He would certainly have a "" c u t "" at the. £25,000which was given to his accuser, and if that means of redress were open he would have no need to appeal to this Parliament. Eut, that channel of justice being closed, the honourable member has to seek redress here, and it is only right'that the matter should be considered in a non-party spirit - I earnestly assure the House that if a similar request for an inquiry were made on behalf of any honourable memher opposite, I , and, I believe, every honourable member on this side, would support it. I hope the Minister for Defence will withdraw his opposition to the motion. The appointment of a Committee would be no reflection upon the Minister, or upon the present Government. The motion is merely a proposal to do justice, already overdue, to a man who. is a member of this House, and who served at the Front as an Australian soldier.",39
94,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [5.49] - If the Leader of the Opposition will agree to the adjournment of this motion until Thursday next, the whole matter will be looked into, including the question of compensation, and submitted to Cabinet for consideration. Debate (on motion by Mr GROOM) adjourned. AUTHORITY FOR HANSARD.",40
95,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [5.50]. - I move That in the opinion of this House, with a view to removing the uncertainty which exists at the present time as to the authority for the publication of the Parliamentary Hansard, section 3 of the Parliamentary Papers Act should be amended to include Mansard among the documents authorized by Parliament to be printed and published. While I occupied the position of Speaker, the present indefinite position of the Hansard publication was brought under my notice by the Chief Parliamentary Reporter, but, unfortunately, the business of the House was so strenuous that I had not the opportunity of submitting the matter to the Prime Minister of the day, although I had intended to do so, with the request that an obvious anomaly should be rectified. The matter is one that might very well receive the attention of the Government at an early date, in order to remove any doubt that may exist as to the authority for the publication of Hansard - A report made to me when Speaker by the Chief Parliamentary Reporter will convince honourable members that some doubt exists as to the legal status of that publication. If honourable members will look at the last page of the Hansard wrapper, they will find that it is issued as being "" Printed and published for the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia by Albert J. Mullett, Government Printer for the jState of Victoria ."" It is not printed for the Parliament, but for the Government of Australia. So far as I have been able to ascertain, Parliament has never really authorized the publication of Hansard. It authorizes the payment of the salaries of the Hansard staff, and that may be held to he parliamentary authorization for the publication of Hansard, but the matter is open .to great 'doubt. That the Chief Parliamentary Reporter regards the iposition in a serious light will be seen from the following quotation, which I make from a memorandum he submitted in the form of a minute to be addressed to the Prime Minister by the Honourable the President and myself: The Parliamentary Reporting ' Staff was appointed by the Commonwealth Executive prior to the assembling of the ifirat Parliament of the Commonwealth. When the Presiding Officers were elected the staff passed automatically under their joint control, as arranged by the Prime Minister. On the passing of the Public Service Act (vide section 14), ""the officers of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff "" were constituted a separate Department of Parliament, and were, with other officers of both Houses, (formally placed under the control of the President and Mr Speaker for the purposes of appointments and promotion, and the making of necessary regulations. Although there has ibeen no formal devolution of authority from the Executive to the presiding officers, we have from time to time laid down rules governing the contents of the publication, the Principal Parliamentary Reporter being in the terms of his appointment responsible to Parliament for the accuracy of the reports, and the Government Printer for the State of Victoria undertaking for the Government the printing and publication. Parliament,, in annually voting the salaries of the officers engaged in the preparation of the reports, and the expenditure incidental to printing them, has ibeen taken to give continuous authority for their publication.' The reports have thus ibecome to all intents and purposes a parliamentary paper. - Although, however, the staff has been officially constituted, no action has - been taken to establish on a legal basis the official character of the reports, and it appears to the Presiding Officers that this might be done by an amendment of section .3 of the Parliamentary Papers Act. The section referred to is in these terms:When either House of the Parliament - has ordered a document to be printed, that House shall be deemed, unless the contrary - intention appears in the order, to. have authorized the Government Printer to publish the document. And it is suggested that the following words be added:And the like authority shall be deemed to have been given in the case of the report of debates in Parliament prepared and printed by direction of the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Apart from the anomaly presented by the control by the Presiding Officers of Parliament of a publication which is not, in a strictly legal sense, official, it appears to us most desirable in the interests of Parliament itself that the protection afforded by the Parliamentary Papers Act should be extended to Hansard. This would the secured by such an amendment as we now suggest. We propose to invite the Prime Minister to consider, tit, an early date, the advisableness of taking the course mentioned, or any other which may appear to liim preferable, and equally effective, td attain for the record the desired official status. That is the case as presented hy the Leader - of the Hansard staff. Hansard has not publishes even heen registered as a newspaper. malicious What the legal status of Hansard is, I do not pretend to say. There is no doijbt in my mind that the position is one of uncertainty, which can he easily rectified hy making the simple amendment of the Parliamentary Papers Act which I suggest.",40
96,Mr OROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [5.59] - The question which the honourable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson) has raised came before this Parliament in 1908, when the Parliamentary Papers Bill, for the introduction of which I was responsible, was under consideration. It became necessary for us at that stage to give statutory protection to the .papers and documents issued under the authority of the Parliament. But Hansard is in a different category. It is a report of the proceedings of the House, and so long as it is a fair and accurate report of the proceedings of Parliament, whether published by the Government in a special publication, or in a newspaper, what'it contains is equally protected. That is a defence which can be raised in all Courts. If a member of this Parliament published one of his own speeches, he would have protection, but if he published it with malicious intention, the fact that the speech was delivered in this House would not protect him. In dealing with the question in 1908, I saidThe' English law on the subject in an Act passed in 1840, because of a conflict between Parliament and the Courts, arising out of the case of Stoekdale v. Hansard. Odgers on Lib el saysEvery fair' and accurate report of any proceeding in either House of Parliament, or in any Committee thereof, is privileged, even though it contain matter defamatory of an individual. It must be a fair and accurate report of the proceeding in Parliament. Odgers goes on to sayThe analogy between such reports and those of legal proceedings is complete. Whatever would deprive a report of a trial of immunity, will equally deprive a report of parliamentary proceedings of all privilege. . . . A speech made by a member of Parliament in the House is, of course, absolutely privileged. If he subsequently causes his speech to be printed, and circulates it privately amongst his constituents bond fide for their information ou any matter of general or local interest, a qualified privilege would attach to such report. . . . But if a member of Parliament his speech to all the world, with the intention of injuring the plaintiff, he will be liable both civilly and criminally. It will appear from the authorities I have quoted that it is scarcely necessary - to alter the Parliamentary Papers Act in the way suggested by the honourable member for Lang. I have not looked into the matter recentlyj and if the honourable member will consent to the adjournment of the debate, on his motion, I promise to have the question carefully considered again in the light of experience, and see whether there are any fresh reasons indicating the necessity for the amendment of the law which he suggests. If there is the slightest doubt about the privileges of Parliament, it should be set at rest. Our privileges should be clearly defined. If any uncertainty on the subject is present in the minds of the law authorities, I promise the honourable memher that the Government will introduce a measure to insure that Parliament shall have the privileges which it should have in the conduct of its proceedings, and in the publication of those proceedings also. - Debate (on motion by Dr MALONEY) adjourned. REPATRIATION . - STAFF REGULATIONS. Mr COLEMAN, by leave, withdrew his notice of motion for the disallowance of Statutory Rule No. 69 of 1923 (Amendment of Australian Soldiers Repatriation is set out Staff Regulations 1920-22). TASMANIA N SHIPPING SERVICE. - Mr OKEEFE (Denison) [6.3] - I move That a Select Committee be appointed to inquire into the necessity for the Commonwealth Government making provision for an adequate direct shipping service between Melbourne and Hobart. In the time at my disposal, I wish to put before the House a few facts which will enable them to judge of the reasonableness of my request for the appointment of a Committee to inquire into this matter. iWe are to have a Board appointed by the Government to control the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers, and I am hoping that that Board will see its way to establish a direct service between Melbourne and Hobart by one of its vessels. It is not necessary to appoint a Committee that would be able to roam from Dan to Beersheba; it would only be necessary for the Committee to visit Hobart, because the northern part of Tasmania is to some extent catered for by a service owned and controlled by private companies. A day or two in Hobartwould enable the Committee to take all the evidence neoessary in Tasmania, and, probably, another day would suffice for the hearing of evidence in Melbourne. There is urgent need for a direct service by an up-to-date vessel fitted for both passenger and cargo traffic. Shipping communication is almost the life-blood of Tasmania. The southern half of the State (in which is the capital city of Hobart, with a population of over 50,000), has no direct service except a vessel that goes to Sydney and back about every ten days. For many years there was a weekly service to and from Melbourne by the Moeraki and sister boats, trading from Melbourne to New Zealand, which called at Hobart on every trip each way. Since these vessels ceased to call at Hobart we have had no direct passenger service at all. An efficient and direct Melboume-Hobart service would benefit, not only southern Tasmania, but also Victoria, aud in a lesser degree all the mainland. I have taken the following figures from the Government statistics of Tasmania regarding the trade between Tasmanian ports and Melbourne during 1922. There arrived from 'Melbourne 34,986 passengers, and 38,410 passengers de parted from all Tasmanian ports. Both the Government Statistician and the Director of the Government Bureau consider that 80 per cent, of the total is a fair estimate of 'he number of people who travelled to and from Hobart. Thus out of the total of 73,396 passengers travelling between Melbourne and Tasmanian ports, 58,717 went to Hobart. Mr O'Keefe. Of course, in the absence of a - direct shipping service nearly the whole of these landed at northern ports and then had to pay railway fares through to Hobart. Those leaving Hobart had to travel by rail to some northern port, such as Launceston, Devonport, or Burnie; thus the' journey was made much more expensive. Undoubtedly, a large proportion of - ithe 58,717 would, have preferred to board a comfortable ship either at Melbourne or Hobart, thereby saving expense and the inconvenience of transferring luggage from boats to trains, and the frequent annoying and serious delays occasioned by fogs in the River Tamar. Hobart has a harbour equal to any in the world, not excepting the Sydney Harbor, and the biggest ships afloat can go straight to the wharfs in the heart of the city. During 1922, 6,975 passengers arrived at Hobart - by direct shipping service from Sydney, and 6,054 travelled from Hobart to Sydney, showing that a large proportion preferred the direct sea trip to the train journey between Melbourne and Sydney. I have not the figures showing the total tonnage between Melbourne and all Tasmanian ports, but the cargo carried from Melbourne to Hobart direct by the two regular traders, Larannah and Kowhai, was 38,215 tons inwards to Hobart and 22,251 tons outwards, a total pf 60,466 tons. In addition to these vessels there are several ketches trading regularly, and the small steamers, Musgrave and Eiltobranks, visit Tasmania more or less regularly. It is safe to average the freight from Melbourne to Hobart at 1,000 tons weekly, and from Hobart to Melbourne at 600 tons, or a total both ways of 83,200 tons a year. With the development of the Electrolytic Zinc Company's fertilizer plant, the National Portland Cement Company's plant at Maria Island, and Cadbury's big works, these figures must be greatly increased in the near future. And yet Hobart - today is worse off as regards direct shipping facilities than it was thirty years ago! Conservatively estimated, the revenue for Tourist a weekly service each way would be £11,000 per month, and running expenses could not be more than £9,000, leaving a profit of £2,000 monthly, or £24,000 a year. Tasmania is at present entirely in the hands of the Steam-ship Owners' Federation, which decrees which company shall and which shall not operate in certain areas. "" Zones of interest "" are laid, down, and unauthorized encroachment is subject to certain pains and penalties. Under this arrangement, Tasmania depends on the mercy of the Tasmanian Steam-ship Proprietary Company, which is really the Huddart Parker and Union Steam-ship Company, and it is alleged by those who should know that these companies get their orders from Lord Inchcape-. Competition between steam-ship owners is a thing of the past. . The Tasmanian Steam-ship Proprietary Company can say to the travelling public, "" You shall travel by this or that route,"" and there is no alternative. A boat with a service speed of 12^ knots could do the return trip comfortably within a week without working overtime at all. It could leave Hobart on Saturday at, say, 6 p.m., and arrive at Melbourne on Monday at 6 a.m., or vice versd. Departure for the return journey could be ""made on Tuesday at 6 p.m., arriving on Thursday at 6 a.m. dentally, it may be mentioned that, with very short notice, the Tasmanian Government Shipping' Department secured 147 passengers at Hobart for a "" Bay "" liner, though the only accommodation was t h i r d class. Tasmania is entitled to any necessary assistance by the Government in providing reasonable facilities for communication, just as other portions of the Commonwealth are now being assisted. For instance, the Government have entered into an agreement with Burns, Philp and Company to pay that firm a subsidy of £3,000 per year to provide monthly service to and from Darwin for passengers and 500 tons of cargo under a schedule of charges approved by Government. Subsidies are also for mail services to the Pacific Islands as follow: {a) Monthly service by s.s. Morinda Papuan ports. Subsidy, £12,000 per .annum. (b) Six-weekly service by ""Mataram to in the Mandated Territory. Subsidy, £12,000 funds. per annum. (c) Six-weekly service by Melusia to Rabaul (Nen Guin6a). returning via Solomon Island ports and alternating nt Rabaul with Subsidy, £8.000 per annum. (d) Six-weekly service by Marsina to mon Island ports only, alternating ' with Subsidy, £8.000 per annum. (e) Five-weekly service to Lord Howe Tsland, Norfolk Islandj and certain main ports in New Hebrides. Subsidy, £12,000 per annum. - [23] (/) Supplementary Inter-Island Service in the New Hebrides by an auxiliary schooner, connecting at Vila with the service shown under (e). Subsidy, £3,000 per annum. The subsidies for these services total £55,000 per annum, of which £1,800 per annum is recovered from the British Solomon Island Protectorate, on account of the services to the Solomons, leaving the net cost to the Commonwealth at £53,200 per annum. Tasmania has to bear her share of the cost of the shipping services to Darwin and the Pacific Islands, and I think I am speaking for representatives of that State in both Houses of this Parliament when I say that they regard those services as all to the advantage of Australia as a whole. We realise, however, that the Commonwealth is a Federation, and we wish the Government to realise equally that Tasmania is a party to that Federation. It must also be remembered that Tasmania has to pay her share of the heavy annual loss incurred on the Port Augusta-Kalgoorlie railway. I have not the figures Inci- for the financial year just closed, but for the eight years ending 1922 the working expenses of this railway were £415,000 more than the receipts, thus showing an average yearly loss of £51,880. It must be borne in mind that this loss is on the running expenses only-revenu e on one side ancl running expenses on the otherwithout any reference to the heavy in terest and depreciation charges. Mr E , BTLEY - I do not think that the loss is so great now. Mr O ' KEEFE - It may not be so a heavy this year. The Tasmanian people do not object to pay a share of the expenditure on services which afford reasonable means of communication with outpaid lying districts and' distant islands, but they claim that they are entitled to the enjoyment of similar facilities. Thus, if any loss were incurred in the running of to a weekly service each way between Melbourne and Hobart, I submit .that it ports would be a fair charge on the Federal I am satisfied, however, from figures I have received from the Government Statist of Tasmania, and from my (b). knowledge of the trade between Hobart and ' the mainland, that such a service Solowould pay its way. The appointment of (c). a Select Committee will not in any way bind the Government, but will simply the afford a means of ascertaining the correctness or otherwise of the facts and figures I have placed before honourable members. The cost of such a Committee would be practically nothing as compared with the cost of other similar inquiries.",41
97,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Do you suggest a subsidy ? Mr O ' KEEFE - No ; I am credibly inform&d that one of the "" Bay "" vessels of the Commonwealth Line should be used for a service of the kind. If a Select Committee be appointed, the Shipping Board will be armed with facts, which, I am sure, would lead it to adopt the suggestion I now make. A Select Committee could collect all the available information on the subject, leaving the Government to act according to its judgment. If my facts and figures are correct, as I believe them to be, no> one can deny the justice of the claim of the people of southern Tasmania, including Hobart with its 50,000 inhabitants, for a weekly service each way. I ask leave to continue my remarks at a future date. Leave granted; debate adjourned.",44

99,Mr A GREEN,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [8.2]. - When I asked for the adjournment of the debate last night, I was saying that I favoiired a bonus being given to cattleraisers in Australia. W it h a large surplus of cattle irt Australia, it is an anomaly, indeed, that in Victoria and the south-west of Western Australia beef is almost unprocurable for the children of the workers. That fact should give us grave concern. I assume that it is the duty of the men on the other as well as bhis side of the House to protest against dear food supplies. It is because of the high cost of living that the industrial unrest in Australia exists. Since I left Western Australia a few days ago, a deputation has waited on the Premier of that State. .Members of the deputation pointed out that there was an acute shortage of beef in the metropolitan areas of Perth and Fremantle, and that people were being compelled to pay inordinately high prices for it . On the other hand, squatters in the Kimberley district are in an almost impecunious condition-if one can apply that adjective to squatters-becaus e of the low prices they are receiving for their cattle. If the eastern portion of Australia were one State, like the western portion, there would not be an embargo upon cattle from Queensland, and the tick pest would be dealt with as it is in Western Australia. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) has pointed out that only the tick which carry the bacillus of red-water fever are dangerous to cattle. Strange cattle entering a tickinfested area immediately contact tick fever, but after a lapse of time those that recover become immune. The beef from those animals is as good in quality as the beef of other cattle. Cattle in Western Australia are dipped frequently, so that when they are snipped PAPER. no tick is observable. Although no portion of the eastern or western K i m berley district is free from tick, the meat, when hanging in the GovernmentFreezing Works at Wyndham, is of the finest possible quality. This is proved by the fact that when placed on the London market recently it brought a higher price than frozen meat from any other part of the world. I sense something operati n g behind the scenes in connection with this bogey of tick-infested cattle. The action of the Victorian authorities is in the nature of a restraint of trade, which all Federalists, should oppose. We have had a similar experience in another direction in Western Australia. It has been found that the country surrounding the Eastern gold-fields at Kalgoorlie is well suited for raising cattle, although a large number cannot be stocked on the land. In certain seasons of the year the cattle are in very good condition, but at other times they are in poor condition. About two years ago, at the time of the year when cattle i u that district were in poor condition, and when it was impossible to get meat from Perth, because of a scarcity there and the high cost of railage, wholesale people on the goldfields brought cattle from South Australia. As a result, the people, instead of paying high prices for poor meat, were able to obtain succulent beef - at moderate rates. Several car-loads of cattle were brought to Kalgoorlie from the vicinity of Port Augusta. Grass was in good condition around Port Augusta, and the beef was consequently of a high quality. Then something happened. For some unknown reason, which one can only guess at, the Western Australian Government imposed an embargo South Australian cattle. It was alleged that South Australian cattle had, at some time or other, suffered from pleuro-pneumonia. As a matter of fact, in the area from which the cattle were drawn, and for hundreds of miles around, there had not been a case of pleuro-pneumonia among cattle for many years. action has caused a serious loss to the Commonwealth railways, which should carry large quantities of cattle consigned between the States. If there were no restraint of trade between the States the Commonwealth railways could do a big business in carrying cattle. The Commissioner of Railways, Mr Bell, went some time ago, with commendable acumen, to the merchants in Kalgoorlie and asked them to support the Commonwealth r a i lways by ordering goods by rail from South Australia and the eastern States. He suggested that he would make the freights low enough for them to do this. They took his advice, and immediately restrictions, amounting to a restraint of trade, were imposed. The railway authorities found that no more orders were coming through for many classes of goods. A few general lines were being carried, but large consignments had ceased. Inquiries were made, and the railway authorities were told by the K a l goorlie merchants that "" the importers of Fremantle have told us that if we give orders for goods to be brought over the railways from South Australia they will refuse to supply us in every other direc : tion."" In . t h is way, for reasons known to high finance and big business, the Commonwealth railways are being interfered with in their legitimate function of carrying goods between the States. I do not pretend to speak as an expert, but 1 believe that those intimately connected, with the cattle business are likely to experience a bad time in the near future. We ought to seek fresh markets. We have seen how Australian energy, with the right men sent abroad to represent us, can open up new markets. Our achievements to date in this direction aiay appear small, but some success has nevertheless been registered. Australia has created a market for meat in Java, and Western Australia and the eastern States control it . We have also a market at Manila, which is supplied both from Darwin and Wyndham. I was reupon cently told by the captain of the steamer Kangaroo, who had made an investigation into the meat industry in India, that there were several thousands of Anglo-Indians in that country who would consume Australian meat if it were to be got. Whilst our Trade Commissioner in China is an excellent This man, from what I know of commerce I should say that to expect a Commissioner to be a specialist in every trade is to expect too much. Any trade requires a lifetime's study for one to 'be successful in it . I defy any man, however great his capacity, to go to China, which is a vast country with 500,000,000 people, and cater efficiently for its wants in a thousand and one different directions. In my opinion, the Meat Council ought to consider the advisability of sending a meat specialist abroad.",44
100,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"The Meat Council has already sent two-, special representatives to the Orient. They have been there two months, and may not return to Australia for another six months. Mr A . GREEN - That assurance illustrates how great minds think alike. I regret that, owing to the fact that for the last nine or ten weeks I have been among the people of "" the purpling East,"" I was unaware of the action that the Meat Council had taken. The Council would know the class of man to send, and I am pleased that experts are examining the markets of the Orient in behalf of the Australian meat industry. should be further opportunities for Australian enterprise on the eastern coast of Africa , and on the western side of South America, north of Chili. I am confident that Australia can knock the Yankees out of the markets of Hong Kong and Shanghai. America is essentially a country of Combines, and if this Parliament will only provide cheap freightsCommonwealth steamers' will do thatto insure that our producers shall land their goods at the furthermost ends of the world at a price cheaper than our competitors, Australian industries must come out on top. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) stated that, although Argentine is successful in placing chilled meat on the London market, Australia cannot do so because our meat has to be sent through the Suez Canal, and is thus subject to detrimental variations in temperature. That obstacle can be overcome by sending the meat round the Cape of Good Hope. The journey may be longer than that vid the Suez Canal, but I remind the House that Australian shippers have no difficulties to overcome which do not confront our rivals. If we have to send our meat through the tropics so have they. If the Government are courageous enough to assist the producers along Democratic Jines to get fairl y cheap freights, the future of the meat industry will be bright. All of our commercial troubles are largely due to the unsettled state of affairs in Central Europe. must r i d ourselves of the war spleen; we must realise that no country can be crushed and another country thrive; we must realise that if Germany, Austria, and France fail, we fail ; that the ramifications of trade are international, and that peace in Europe is essential.to the prosperity of our industries. ' Once the international situation becomes settled, Australia, like Great Britain , need have no fear in regard to the future, of its industries.",45
101,Mr HOTTER,Unknown,"Maranoa) [8.20] - In regard to this Bill , only three questions call for consideration: (1) is it necessary?; (2) is it r i g h t ?; and (3), will it do any good? Everybody who is conversant with the cattle industry of Australia knows that it is absolutely necessary that some assistance should be given to it at the present time. The conditions existing in Queensland, which is the p r in , There cipal meat-producing State, are a direct result of the war. During the war the prices of cattle and meat rose to such an extent that people went into the cattle industry who had never engaged in it previously. Men who previously had handled sheep, or had grown crops, went into the cattle business, many of them as dealers, and when the slump came they were hard h it . Objection to this Bill has been taken by some honourable members on the ground that it will help the "" beef barons."" Although there are many large cattle-owners in Queensland, I know of none, no matter how large his herds may be, who can be rightly called a "" baron -' at the present time.",46
102,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,They are barren-of cash.,46
103,Mr HUNTER,Unknown,"That is so. Mr G. E. Bunning, who was a large cattle-owner in Western Queensland years ago, said that, after all his years of experience, he had come to the conclusion that cattleraising did not pay, except when such high prices were offering as obtained during the war. Certainly it is not profitable at any time for a man to engage in breeding on small areas. Dairymen, who have been able to sell their steers to neighbours or other persons raising meat for the market, may have made an odd penny of profit ; but it does not pay the small man to try to make a livelihood by raising cattle for the market. Neither does it pay even the large man under present conditions. We I know of several large men who a few years ago might have been considered rich, but who today are in financial difficulties. For instance, one man who had b'een operating largely during the war period, buying stations and selling the stock off them, was worth at one period £187,000, but he had an overdraft of about £70,000. By sales, & c , his overd r a f t was reduced to £50,000, but, when he reckoned up his cattle and all other assets, he found that their market value did not amount to more than £40,000. So that even if the bank had taken possession of the property and stock, it could not have realized anything like the amount of the overdraft. There is another fact to be considered. The large man, by selling 'off his stock, even at a loss, is able to get the wherewithal to live. The smaller man cannot afford to sell his stock, aud, as he has no other source of income, he has practically to starve. His position is more serious than that of the larger man. In last week's Queensland newspapers I read of a conference of small cattle men held at Koma, at which the chairman said that the position of the cattle industry was so serious that many of the smaller men were on the bread line. That is a sufficient answer to the statement that this bonus is intended to help the large cattle-owners. The smaller men are absolutely unable to ship their stock. Queensland has just experienced a rather serious drought, and men engaged in dairying, running a few head of cattle as a side line, find themselves in difficulties. In previous years, if they were unable to produce cream, they were able to dispose of a certain number of stock, and thus get an occasional cheque. This year, when the dairying failed them, they had no chance of getting r i d of their surplus beasts, and many of these men had to seek work wherever they could get it . I know of one such man near my own home who was forced to search for work. During his absence only his wife and children were left on the property, and, as they were unable to take the usual precautions during the drought, every beast on the holding died. Is the proposed bonus right? do not think many people like the principle of bonuses, but when the cattle industry is up against a dead end, as it is today, something must be done. This Parliament is asked to go to the aid, notof individuals, but of an industry whose very existence is at stake, and it is our duty to take whatever steps are possible to give relief. Will this proposal do any good ? The bonus, together with a reduction in freight and the allowance for canning, amounts to only ^d. per l b . , or 4s. 2d. per 100 lbs. That bonus does not mean anything to a man with only a few head of cattle. When all is said and done, the bonus will rarely go to the small man, but it will help him indirectly, inasmuch as every beast killed improves the market for those that remain Strange to say, there are men who are still engaged in buying cattle, certainly at a price which represents a loss to the raisers, but it is better for men to sell at a loss for cash than to have the stock increasing and the loss accumulating every day. stock are being taken off the market, there will be an improved demand for those that remain. Persons will desire to in crease their herds or will want beasts for butchering. Thus the bonus, by encouraging the slaughter of cattle, will give in creased value to the remaining stock, and so help the industry generally. Another matter that has been raised during the debate on this Bill is the refusal to admit Queensland cattle into Victoria. A few days ago I read in a morning newspaper certain statements whioh would lead the uninformed reader to believe that Queensland is the home.of the tick, and that every beast in that State is infested. I have lived all my life in Queensland, more than half of the time in the western areas, and I have never seen a tick-infested beast. That is not to say that there are no ticks in Queensland, but it is a fact that large areas of that State are absolutely free of tick. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A . Green) has said that tick boundaries should be abolished. I live in clean country, and I do not wish to see the tick boundaries removed. Even within the border of Queensland stock cannot be travelled from an infested area into a clean area, and it is a wise policy to confine the pest to as small an area as possible, clean that area, and keep it I clean, then pass on to the cleansing of another area, until the tick has been entirely eradicated. Therefore, I do not blame the Victorian Government for opposing the admission of tick-infested cattle into their State. An y Queensland cattle sent to Melbourne by boat, even though they come from a clean area, must travel to the ports, and in so doing they pass through - infested country, and are subject to the same regulations as are stock from an infested area. But it is possible to truck cattle for very long distances. At the present time cattle are being trucked from Charleville to Sydney, a distance of about 900 miles, but the cost of trucking from Charleville to Melbourne would be almost prohibitive. I should like to tell Victorians and those who read the articles which have appeared in the Melbourne press, that they can go to the Flemington Yards any day they please and they will find Queensland brands on many of the cattle there. Queensland cattle are coming into Victoria. They follow the water-courses When down the back-country through New Soutli Wales into this State - The journey may take months, but the cattle are growing older on the way, and arrive here in pretty fair condition. There is another way in which stock might be brought into this State, and that is as chilled meat. I was very pleased to hear the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) say that .every man, woman, and child in this city eats chilled meat. An y one who knows anything of the meat trade in our large cities must know that chilled meat is consumed by the people. There is some sort of prejudice against it , but in summer it is impossible to keep warm meat. I would be glad if the Minister in charge of the Bill would, in consultation with the Victorian and Queensland Governments, arrive at some arrangement by which meat works would be compelled to accept cattle on owners' account. They are at present dealing only with the stock they buy themselves. There is no reason why, if meat works were obliged to take stock on owners' account, cattle should not be sent from the back districts of Queensland-in the south to meat works in Brisbane, and in the central districts to meat works at Rockhampton-wher e the meat could be chilled and sent on to Melbourne in that state. Cattle in some of the western Queensland districts are in good condition, and if their meat were treated in the way I suggest it would be as good as any the Victorian people are getting now. In view of the condition of the cattle industry the action taken by the Government is absolutely necessary. It will give cattle-raisers fresh heart when they know that the Government are willing to do something to tide them over their difficulties, and to enable them to get r i d of their surplus stock.",46
104,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Kooyong) [8.35] - As I follow the argument in support of this Bill it is very simple. It appears to be that the meat industry, which has been profitable in the past, ""is at present unprofitable, and, therefore, the Commonwealth Parliament should vote money to assist it-bu t for one year only, because it has been stated that the subsidy will not be renewed after the expiry of that period. At present the meat industry of Australia is unable to obtain a market abroad in competition with the meat products of other more particularly of the Argentine. It is suggested, as a matter of course almost, that on that account this Parliament should, assist the Australian meat industry. In considering a measure of this kind it is important to examine the causes of the existing situation. We have heard something of these causes from honourable members who, apparently, speak with authority on this subject. We learn, for example, from the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde), that in Queensland the breeding of cattle has been unprogressive. Some breeders too often breed from scrub bulls, and so, many of the cattle in Australia are not up to the beef standard of cattle exported from the Argentine. If that is one cause of the existing situation, it will nob be affected by this Bill . We have been told, further, that the methods ' of railway trucking are unprogressive and defective, and such as to injure the beasts. That is another cause that will not be affected by the Bill , though it might be remedied by intelligent action on the part of the Governments of the States concerned. We have further been informed that loading and killing arrangements in the Argentine, in particular, are more up to date than similar arrangements in Australia. We learned some time ago from Mr Jowett, after a visit he had paid to the Old Country, that Australian meat on sale at Smithfield' has; unfortunately, been to a considerable extent of low grade. We read the other day in the press of Melbourne that in the East some at least of the Australian meat is regarded as t h i r d grade. None of these matters will be affected by this Bill , which merely proposes a pecuniary subsidy for one year, leaving all the causes of the condition of the industry untouched. At the same time, we all know that the price of meat in Australia is very high indeed, and we are informed that the consumption of meat in Australia is about one-half what it was before the war. What are the features of the Bill directed' to the assistance of the meat industry? One is that it embodies an agreement arrived at outside the House in negotiation with private interests. The Bill is submitted to the House without any. justification of the figures it contains. Why a subsidy of ^ d per lb. rather than a subsidy of - Jd. or l d . per lb.? So far as the meat interests are countries, concerned, they are doubtless wisely guided by the rule, "" All donations thankfully accepted."" Whether the subsidy of i d . per lb. offers any hope for the future, or is intended to meet only temporary conditions existing this year, we are not informed. If the intention is merely to meet temporary conditions, what are they, and'how will the Bill meet them? There is one other feature of this lation which is rather remarkable. We have been informed by the Minister in charge of the measure that a condition of the arrangement is that shipping freights are to be reduced by $d. per lb., and killing charges are to be reduced by a similar amount. Those conditions do not appear in the Bill. I suppose that they do appear somewhere, and that there will be some means of enforcing them, but they are not a part of the legislation proposed by the Government, and it is very doubtful whether this Parliament could enact such conditions as a part of any of its legislation. This Parliament is being asked to pass a Bill, upon the faith of some unnamed persons, carrying out an agreement which is not placed before the House in any form. I suggest that it is a dangerous thing to make agreements with outside persons without bringing those agreements in any manner before the House, and to pass this legislation, trusting that certain persons will observe the agreements entered into, whatever they may be. The assistance proposed is for one only. Is it possible to believe that that growers of wheat? condition will be observed ? If industry is as it has been depicted a number of speakers, can the prometal posed subsidy be justly terminated at the end of the year, if the principle upon which it is granted is sound ? I take leave to doubt, if the Bill passesand apparently it will, because I am the first speaker to oppose it-that it will not be necessary to renew the subsidy. What is the meaning of the assertion that the Bill is intended to operate only for year ? I suggest that the statement that will operate only for one year cannot given effect. I am not prepared to vote for the measure upon what I regard the false assumption that the assistance proposed will be given only for a period of one year. The Bill seeks authority in one of its clauses for payments made in the past. That is to say the Government have ticipated the authority of this House, as estblishing a precedent. ancl have, in fact, already made payments :to a section of the community interested in the meat industry. At this stage, they ask the House for its concurrence in that procedure. iSuch a procedure, I suggest to honourable memibers, is not in principle to the distinguished from the illegal imlegis- position of a Customs duty.",48
105,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Would the honourable member not impose a Customs duty until he had told every one what it was to be?,49
106,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Such a duty should be imposed only by this House, and not as a result of executive action by the Government. In the same manner, bounties paid to industries should be paid after, and not before, this House has given authority for their payment. Finally, I suggest that the Bill is based upon a simple and easy principle, but a very bad one. It would seem that the Government have said, "" Here is an industry that has been having a bad time; therefore let us help it . "" That is a nice, comfortable, easy thing to do, but what would be the effect of the general adoption of the principle? If we give a bounty for the export of meat, because those engaged in the cattle industry have been having a bad time,' why should we not do the same thing for the wool-grower should wool fall from its present high estate ? Why should we not do the same year for the growers of mutton and the Why should not the the principle apply also to mining by for base metals? In recent years base mines have been closed because, after the Avar, the price of base metals slumped. This is an easy Bill to pass, but it is an ill-considered piece of legislation, and I intend to oppose it.",49
107,Mr MANN,Unknown,"Perth) [8.45] - We have had quite a number of speeches in favour of the Bill, but until the honourable memone ber for Kooyong (Mr Latham) adi t dressed the House we had heard nothing be in opposition to it. .Some features of the meat problem have not been touched as upon at all up to the present, and I propose to refer to some of the reasons why I intend to vote against the Bill. When the Meat Bounty Bill was introduced last session it was distinctly understood that it was to operate for one year anonly, and was in no way to be regarded It was pointed out that it was merely a temporary palliative to help the industry in a time of difficulty, and to afford those interested in the business an opportunity to - organize themselves in a way that would enable them in future to surmount their troubles themselves. was to be done was set out by the then member for the - Grampians (Mr Jowett), who made a-n exhaustive review of the position. This gentleman was, I believe, among those who recently waited on the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) and asked for the bounty. that res2Ject is very different fro m the attitude he took up last year. livered an interesting address last session, in which he described the conditions .in the industry in Great B r it a in . pointed out 'how our meat f e l l short of the requirements of the English market, and he suggested remedies. that the Australian meat industry was entirely unorganized, whereas the Argentine meat sellers had their business so highly organized and controlled that they had over 3,000 shops in Great B r it a in in order to stimulate a demand for their meat, whilst the public of England scarcely knew that there was any Australian meat on the market. Mr Jowett went on to sayThe lesson we have learned is ' the necessity for propaganda are at an enormous disadvantage because we have never had such work done for our - frozen meat trade, and we cannot cover the distance we have fallen behind unless we raise a large fund with which to conduct this propaganda work in Great Britain as well as on the Continent. The money, I think, should be raised purely from the cattle and sheepowners of Australia, and by means of compulsion, but above all the control of the funds so raised sliould not be hampered or interfered with in any way by any Government, State or Commonwealth. Those are remarkable words, coming as they do from one Who is recognised a3 possessing an intimate knowledge of the meat industry.",49
108,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,He was not then referring to the money for the bounty.,50
109,Mr MANN,Unknown,"I am aware of that. He was laying stress on the fact that the lack of a market for our meat was due to a want of enterprise and propaganda work on the part of the owners of the meat. Another very important matter that has not been referred to is the effect of shipping freights. I wish to show how they affect Western Australia, particularly in relation to the Wyndham meat works. I listened in amazement to the How that glowing story told by my friend, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A . Green) in referring last nightto those works. He painted a rosy picture of a contented settlement due to the establishment of the works at Wyndham.",50
110,Mr GABB,Unknown,"He has just come back H is position in from there. He de- Mr MANN - I know that, but I am also aware of a number of facts concerning the works which he did not mention. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie He pointed out that the works had been of great benefit in keeping the wheels of industry going, and he assumed that He said great credit for that was due to the party to which he belongs. He did not, however, make it clear that the workers engaged at the Wyndham works do not live in the district. They go backwards and forwards every season, and the cause of a White Australia is not assisted very much by a crowd of migratory meat-workers moving about in that way. Nor did the honourable memberpoint out that the works have been established at such colossal cost that it is almost impossible to make them pay. work. We He did not say that the wrong methods of construction which had been adopted have handicapped the works all along, and that it is very difficult to conduct them at a profit at all. They have been operated by the Government for three seasons. In 1919 they treated 9,281 head of cattle; in 1920, 18,496; and in 1922, 22,646. It will be noticed that in 1921 no cattle were treated. This was because it was cheaper to keep the works closed than to operate them. The interest cost has been very heavy. It has amounted to something like £245,000.",50
111,Mr COESEE,Unknown,The interest would go on in 1921.,50
112,Mr MANN,Unknown,"But if the works had been operated the loss would have been increased. This year the conditions have improved somewhat, and arrangements have been made for the treatment of 24,500 head, but until a bigger market is available, the works cannot be operated upon a j^rofitable basis. The Government of Western Australia have been losing money on the works all along. che loss on the works amounted to £88,000, and it is estimated that the losses this year will be £85,000-equiva lent to £3 18s. and £3 9s. 6d. respectively on all cattle treated. The losses constitute a bounty given by the Government of Western Australia for promoting the cattle industry in the Kimberley district.",50
113,Mr WEST,Unknown,It means the employment of a great number of men.,51
114,Mr MANN,Unknown,"C e r t a in l y ; but Wyndham is out of the regular track of the steamers loading at Australian ports for London, the works are handicapped by a surcharge of frozen meat as compared with the rates from other Australian ports. I do not know whether the House is aware of the extraordinary changes that have taken place in freight charges. Between 1892 and 1897 the freight to England was $d. per lb., or £ 7 per ton. W it h the advent of more modern steamers, freight dropped, and finally reached what was considered a highly remunerative figure, namely 9-16ths of a penny, or £ 5 5s. per ton. The current rate from Queensland ports to London is l d . per l b . , or £ 9 3s. 9d. per to n ; and from Wyndham to London l £ d . , or £ 1 0 10s. per ton. One reason for this increase in freight charges is that for years there has been a growing tendency for the meat-works to be controlled or owned by firms interested in overseas shipping. twelve meat-works in Queensland today are controlled, either by the agents for or owners of shipping lines. meat-works in Queensland are controlled or owned by Birfc and Company, one by Houlder Brothers and Company, two by G. S. Y u ill , one by Lord Inchcape, two by Swift and Company, of Chicago, one by the pastoralists, one by John Cook and Company, and one by Borthwick and Company.",51
115,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,It is better for them to own the works than that the Government should have them.,51
116,Mr MANN,Unknown,"That is entirely another matter. Government ownership is not the only necessary alternative. Shipping companies are probably little concerned whether they make their profits from the beef or from the other freight. As they also carry the beef of rival companies, their interests are best served by the maintenance of high freights. the whole point. In New Zealand a In 1922 Meat Producers' Board has been formed, and in Argentine legislation is proposed with the object of exercising a measure of control over the meat export works, and the activity of trusts in the meat export trade, and for the construction of State meat export works. The handling of beef for the London market is pracLically controlled by the shipping in terests; it is those interests that prevent meat getting to the London market at as prices at which we can compete with meat from other countries. If this control were broken, and in addition an organization were effected amongst the meat-owneis per lb. on themselves, as suggested by Mr Jowett, there is every reason to believe that the trade could be successfully carried ""on without any Government bounty. There has been some talk about a reduction of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. In my opinion, the best way to break the control of freights is by the proper use of the Commonwealth Line. On this point I wish to make my position quite clear. I do not believe in Government control of industries. The only time that Government intrusion into business enterprise is justified is when that appears to be the one means of breaking what otherwise may become a great monopoly or Trust. Such a monopoly or Trust does, I believe, exist in connection with shipping, and I am strongly in favour of the continuance of the ComSeven out of monwealth Line with the object of breaking the freight Ring. The Commonwealth Line ought to be reduced, but it is very Three important to consider how far that reduction should be carried. There is talk at times of running only the ' ' Bay "" vessels, but some of the other boats have been very useful, and at least all those containing refrigerating space should be retained. The Wyndham Meat Works would derive great benefit, indeed, by the use of these Commonwealth steamers, which are particularly suitable for that trade, because they have a capacity corresponding to the works. They have derricks for continuous loading, which is a very important detail on our coasts, where the labour . costs are high, and the phenomenal rise and fall of the tides makes such loading imperative. Another important feature of the Commonwealth service is that the steamers endeavour to keep to their schedule of arrivals, at That is Wyndham, whereas other vessels cannot be relied on, and therefore the trade cannot be handled without greatly increased refrigerating accommodation. I wish to stress this point, because I believe it shows the way in which the Government should assist the meat trade rather than by granting a bonus or bounty. The Government should set their Fleet to seek out business in such a way as will bring very real and live competition to bear on the freight Ring. I am not satisfied that the Commonwealth Line has been worked in such a way in the past-that it has sought out for all trade available. I must confess I find it difficult to understand some of the methods of the management. I do not care to refer in the House to Government, officials or managers of an institution of the sort, but I cannot understand the business methods adopted. For over a month I have been seeking an interview with the manager on important matters, and I cannot even get the satisfaction of a reply. That is not the way in which such a business should be conducted. If this is to be a real and effective Line, and attain its alleged object of breaking the Ring, if must "" g e t out and get busy."" I wish to know, as the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr . Latham) wishes to know, how long we are to go on granting bounties. To me such a system appears utterly wrong; it 'only keeps up prices instead of introducing conditions that will reduce them. I speak, not as a representative of any industry or other interest, but as the representative of the great masses of the taxpayers who want cheaper food, and do not know why they cannot get it in a country like this, overflowing with productiveness. We hear all sorts of excuses and reasons for the present state of things, but in the meantime the people generally are quite hopeless and helpless. The people, however, are objecting, and there is a strong feeling that it is time the Government abandoned their present methods of bounties and bonuses, and left trade to work out its own competitive cure.  too'",51
117,Mr MANN,Unknown,"Yes , most decidedly. Honourable members know my opinion on fiscal matters, but this is not the time to discuss them.",52
118,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Why chide you on your lonely position ?,52
119,Mr MANN,Unknown,"I do not think I am alone; at any rate, I would not be alone if every member in the House acted according to what he believes in his heart to be right.",52
120,Mr WEST,Unknown,They want shaking up !,52
121,Mr MANN,Unknown,"They do. I was astounded this evening to hear the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A . Green) speaking of the necessity for removing all lines of demarcation between State and State, and making the whole of the Commonwealth a Free Trade area for meat. I cannot understand how a Protectionist can be so illogical. If it is logical to protect one particular industry in one particular part, why is it not logical to protect one State against another ? The Wyndham Meat Works are placed at a disadvantage of Jd. with regard to their meat in consequence of the extra freight they are charged. That in itself is a very serious handicap, because otherwise the meat would command a high price in the market, partly owing to the happy circumstance that it is not knocked about in railway trucks on the way to the works. I believe that, generally speaking, the meat turned out from the Wyndham Meat Works is in beautiful condition, and compares more than favourably with that from the Queensland works. In saying this, I do not wish to disparage the Queensland Meat Works, but merely to point out the natural disadvantages under which they suffer. The high freights in the case of the Wyndham Meat Works are not justified, and, if the Commonwealth Line can place Wyndham on the same basis as other ports of Australia, a great difference will be made to the trade. That would be preferable to a system of granting bounties. It is said that the bountv goes into the pockets of the producers, and so it does directly, but indirectly the effect is to prevent a reduction of freights, and thus the money goes to the shipping interests.  id.",52
122,Mr MANN,Unknown,"The price today is I d . , or £ 9 3s. 9d. per ton, as against the pre-war price of 9-16ths of a penny, or £ 5 5s. a ton. An £d. sounds very little, but it means a great deal in the aggregate. I do not profess any personal knowledge of this business, but I should like to quote the following words from one who knows it inside and out:In my opinion the current refrigerated cargo rates are still excessive in comparison with general cargo rates. I consider that they are maintained rather because refrigerated steamer space is under effective "" Conference"" control, than because of actual enhanced working costs of steamers compared with pre-war times. I believe that a close analysis of steamer accounts would prove that refrigerated rates are relatively higher than general cargo. As a matter of fact, the wheat races today are, I believe, almost if not quite equal to pre-war rates, and if this can be delegates accomplished with wheat, why not with dissenting meat? The reason is the one I have Commonwealth given, namely, that the meat ring owns the majority of the meat works. The way in which the tick pest has been Queensland, paltered with by those interested is almost a scandal. Since 1916 strenuous efforts have been made to bring about co-operaHouse tion between the State Governments, Commonwealth Government, and the any meat owners with a view to effective measures for the control and eradication of this pest. A notable example that we might follow is presented by the United States. Speaking from memory, I believe there were over 750,000 square miles of tick-infested country there in 1906, but, in 1911, by effective means of control, and over 52 per cent, of the area had entirely cleaned up. Similar methods should be employed in Australia, but, so far from the pest being controlled or diminished here, from all I can gather, the area of infested country is increasing. In 1918 it was estimated that tick had already cost the meat industry of Ausprinted. tralia over £7,000,000, and, if I rememthere ber rightly, the annual cost is over it . £100,000. If this cause of loss were removed, would it not have a wonderful effect on the meat industry?",52
123,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Who , do you suggost, should step in-the Governand ment ?",53
124,Mr MANN,Unknown,"It has been proposed that there should be co-operation between by cattle-riisers. the State Governments, the Commonwealth Government, and the meat owners. As a matter of fact, that is the system followed in America, and even with huge area in America, it has only tailed an expenditure by the combined States of £100,000 per annum, and by the Federal Government of £50,000 per annum. If £50,000 per annum were spent in Australia in the eradication the tick pest, it would be f a point than a bounty. For reasons into which I need not enter in detail, attempts to bring about co-operati.on have so far largely failed. I would like to read an extract from the report, published i u 1918, of a Special Committee which dealt with the cattle tick pest. A f t e r discussing all the arrangements they were trying to make, members"" of the Committee wound up with this significant paragraphIt is to be regretted that the Queensland felt compelled to withdraw from the Conference prior to the drafting of the report, as they did from the principle of intervention or co-operation in any form other than financial assistance.",53

126,Mr MANN,Unknown,"I can read it all if the desires, but it is available to hon the orable members. I do not want to do injustice to the Queensland representatives. The paper is obtainable from the Clerk of the Papers. It is true that cooperation, in spite of all efforts to establish it , has not yet been brought about.",53
127,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"The portion of the report which the honourable member has not read will not be printed in Hansard, the part he has quoted will , by itself, been mislead any one who reads it .",53

It deserves to be It is an official statement, and is no reason for me to withdraw The negotiations have practically failed, and Mr Jowett says that sales' organization and co-operative organization among meat-growers are bad. Suggestions for improving the quality of meat diminishing the losses from pests have failed owing to want of co-operation and disregard of their own interests Parliament is still asked, by the meat-growers to grant a subsidy to enable them to make their in dustry pay. It appears to me that there the has been so much Government subsidizening, and so much propping up of industries, that at last every one engaged in it has come to the conclusion that it is simpler, and requires much less effort, to ask the Government for a subsidy than of to tackle the difficulties of the industry r more to the and to cope with them.",53
129,Mr COOK,Unknown,Did the ex-member for the Grampians (Mr Jowett) oppose the granting of a meat bounty ?,54
130,Mr MANN,Unknown,"I was not in the House when the last Meat Bounty Bill was passed, but I have read the whole of the debate which took place on the subject last session, and it is from that debate that I have quoted the remarks of Mr Jowett. I maintain that the position is misunderstood, and that proper steps are not being taken to put the in dustry on a proper footing. I do not want it to be inferred that I do not recognise the difficulties which face the industry, but I say that many of those difficulties could have been overcome if the warning given by the Government last year that the bounty would be only a temporary measure had been heeded.",54
131,Mr CORSER,Unknown,In what way does the honourable member suggest the industry should look after itself?,54
132,Mr MANN,Unknown,"I do not know whether the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr . Corser) has been asleep while I have been speaking for the last half-hour, but I have been laying down as clearly as my poor ability would permit how those in the industry can help themselves. I think my remarks were clear to every other member of the House. There is another small aspect of the matter which is not unworthy of consideration. A few days ago there appeared in the press a report of a deputation to a Minister of the British Cabinet. The deputation represented the meatgrowers of England, who complained that they were placed upon an unfair footing because the Australian Government had .granted a bonus to Australian meat producers. Mr E . RILEY - That is serious.",54
133,Mr MANN,Unknown,"It is serious, both for them and for us. If these, bounties create trade differences and disputes they will lay up much trouble for us in the future . In this morning's newspapers there appeared a report in which the Chairman of the Shipping Association placed all the blame for the high cost of meat in England upon the middlemen. He said that meat was carried to England so cheaply that the high cost to the consumer could not be the faul t of the shippers. The figure given in the report as representing the cost of shipping meat was, I think, inaccurate. It was stated that meat was being carried at .17d. per lb. That statement is ridiculous, and it is evident that the message was mutilated in transmission. When a representative of shipping interests contends that the meat is carried at such a ridiculously low rate that none of the responsibility for the increase in price can be laid upon the shippers, he is speaking absurdly. I felt that it was necessary for me to put some of these facts before the House, and for the reasons which I have stated I consider that the Government should assist the meat industry, not by a bonus or a' bounty, but by making full use of the Commonwealth ships to break the Shipping Ring, and by insisting upon proper measures of co-operation and control being undertaken by the growers. I do not object to such Government assistance' as the provision of technical advisers to control the tick pest. There must be Executive authority to bring about uniform control. By these methods, and these alone, should the Government assist the industry. I shall vote against the Bill .",54
134,Mr COOK,Unknown,"Indi ) [ 9 . 2 4 ] - I am in accord with the Bill because I believe it will do a large amount of good. I shall endeavour to prove why I hold that view. Not many years ago the Labour party was very weaJs, b ut today, thanks to organization, it is strong. It was only recently that the rura l producer, after he had learned a valuable lesson, attempted to organize his forces. W it h the backing of the Government in the creation of Wheat Pools, from £1,000,000 to £2,000,000 was placed in the pockets of the wheat-growers of Victoria last year. It is hoped that in the near future, as a result of the growth of co-operative organizations in the different States, wheat growers will be able to control the whole Australian output. Primary producers desire to organize their industries to the fullest possible extent. We have realized the benefit of organization, and are determined to do all we can to profit by our knowledge. We need the assistance of the Government in finding new markets, and in providing shipping. I am pleased to notice that in the Governor General's Speech it is announced that shipping will be subsidized. I am associated with a co-operative company-no t one of the objectionable Combines referred to by members of the Opposition-whic h has financed an agent to go to the East, on behalf of the producers, with a view to opening np new markets. This not have been done had not the Governcass ment promised to come to our assistance in providing shipping. We intend to the butter industry on a sound basis. This industry is receiving Government assistance in the form of a loan of £3,000, and the State Government have also come to its aid. We hope to improve the any quality of butter to an extent that add £2,000,000 to the money which goes into the pockets of the dairy farmers Australia. The "" Bawra "" scheme taught such a lesson to the wool-producers that they are organizing to control the wool clip. There is a Meat Council in the meat industry, and we have representaor tives who are making inquiries in Great Britain . We hope, in the near future, to take this industry in hand and orsale rates? ganize it thoroughly. By getting who are thoroughly familiar with the great primary industries to place them a proper footing, we shall be doing service, not only to the producer, but the people of Australia. Government assistance is required in fixing standards, for the export trade has been ruined in the past for want of closer supervision. The Government should very carefully check all meat exported. It is lamentable to find that Australian meat has not been quoted on the London market since last May. Much has been said about cost of meat to the consumer. I can assure the House that the primary producer is not to blame. Until the break weather, at the end of May, prime meat was selling on the hoof at 2$d. per lb. consumer had to pay double that amount, but the producer did not receive i There are a number of causes of the high sentatives cost of meat to the consumer. There are Arbitration Court awards, Wages Board determinations, the import duties upon implements used by the butcher, high rents, and the high cost of buildings. When all the increased costs of the few years are taken into account, it obvious why meat, and all other commodithe ties have increased, in price to the consumer. If the great industrial organizations wish figures:-Prime to get at the root of this evil, there better policy open to them than that leaning on the Government. I am heart and soul a co-operator, and in the f u therance of co-operation the workers do yeoman service. If organizations were formed in the capital cities, and a few men were appointed to varioiis would distributing centres, prime frozen car- mutton could be obtained from the Western and Murray Co-operative Bacon put and Meat Packing Company Limited at from 5 f d . per lb. Such meat is much 'better than is being bought on the hoof in. the markets today, and after careful defrigeration is equally as wholesome as meat that can be bought in the retail will shops. From the same source carcass lamb can. be bought at S-Jd. per lb., of although the price on the hoof at Newmarket yesterday was over Is. per lb. Hindquarters of beef can be had for 5d. par l b . , and forequarters for 4d. What is to prevent the Housewives Association, an industrial organization, establishing distributing centres, and purchasing from the company I have mentioned at wholeDistribution of lamb or those mutton in quarters would not be a very great tax. This meat is killed while in on prime condition, and, according to an exgreat pert, the carcass can be thoroughly to thawed out in about forty-eight hours by being hung in a passage or other position where there is a free draught of air. Joints from these carcasses should then be held by the housewives for a further eight or ten hours before cooking. If treated in this manner, and cooked in the ordinary way,' the meat will retain all the natural flavours and taste just as well as the high freshly killed meat. I desire to see the meat industry placed in the on a sound footing. The producers do not seek bounties, but the little asThe sistance that the Government propose toi render is very necessary at this t . juncture. The Meat Council has repretravelling throughout the world to investigate foreign markets, ancl I feel sure that, in the course of the next few years, it will have placed the meat industry on a sound footing. The keenest supervision over all exported last meat is necessary. To show how much is the bounty of $d. per lb. w i ll mean to producers, I submit to the House the following up-to-date and authoritative frozen Queensland beef is a can be - bought on the wharf, Melbourne, of today, at 4d. per lb. The charges from Queensland to Melbourne represent 3d. r - per l b . The price in store in Queensland can is 3§d. The freight ancl charges on Commonwealth boats carrying meat from Australia to London amount to l j d . per lb., making the price, landed in London, 4Ad. per lb. Prime Australian beef was quoted in London, in A p r i l last, at per lb. Tbese figures show a margin in favour of the local market of i d . per lb. The bounty of i d . per lb. will allow the producers of Queensland to send their meat to London at a profit of i d . per lb. Thus export becomes possible. Eor that reason, I give the Bill my heartiest support. It is the intention of the producers to organize the rura l industries on a solid footing, and that having been done, it will be the duty of the Government to give them reasonable assistance in the transportation and marketing of their produce. Mr M . CAMERON (Barker) [9.88]. - The proposed bounty has been dealt with from almost every point of view, and rise only to explain the reason why I shall vote against the second reading the Bill . The Government propose make a free g if t to certain people in the community. That is not in of the interests of the whole of the primary producers. Knowing something than 2s. 6d. per bushel. of the cattle industry in South Australia, Qtieensland, and New South Wales, I am mitted prepared to admit the contention of some to feed drought-stricken stock. honourable members that the small cattlebarley owners are on'the 'bread-line. offering a bounty to meat exporters the Government are aiding one class of p r mary producers at the expense of others. meet their interest bill. There are very many producers other than cattlemen who, too, are almost the bread-line, and I do not consider i fair that they should be asked to contrideputation bute towards the payment of a bounty others whose circumstances are probably no worse than their own. I am not opbeen over-indulging in liquor. posed to the Government rendering asnot sistance to primary producers when there is as much justification as there is i connection with the beef industry, am opposed to the methods by which the Government propose to give that aid. Tn years gone by when the wheat far mers were in distress owing to drought, State Governments properly came to their assistance, 'but not by making free g if t . The financial help they ceived became a first charge upon the land, and had to be repaid to the State. If Che Commonwealth Government propelled posed to lend money to the beef exporters, I would support that policy. The wives aiul families of wheat farmers in 4 i d . drought-stricken areas .have been without food and clothing, but every penny of assistance they received from the Government had to be repaid. If the Commonwealth Avere to advance money to the meat exporters-the loans may be current as long as it is thought necessarythe recipients of such assistance would not be robbed of their independence. They would undertake to repay the financial aid they had received in the for m of a loan, and other producers would not have occasion to charge the cattle breeders and meat exporters with having been spoon-fed at the expense of the rest of the community. In the south-eastern portion of my electorate, owing to climatic and soil conditions, the farmers are. I restricted Ito 'the growing of barley. During the last few years there has been of an over-production of that grain, and to notwithstanding that drought conditions prevailed last year, there are thousands bags of barley in the Millicent district for which the farmers cannot get more Yet we hear of a demand that maize should be adfree of duty from South A f r i c a The farmers are in as bad a plight as But in are the Queensland cattlemen.

I believe that an ounce of co-operation is worth a hundredweight of politics. - Bub if co-operation is not carried out on proper lines, it is of very little use. I cannot see my way clear to support a proa posal to take money out of the pockets of reone section of the taxpayers in order to make a g if t to another section. In the form in which the Bill appears, I am comto vote against it . I thought I would be in the wilderness alone, but I have found that there are one or two other honourable members who hold views similar to those I have expressed.

135,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [9.47] This has been a very interesting debate, and I have been led to think that the object of the honourable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson) in endeavouring increase the facilities for the distrifurther bution of Hansard was to circulate this debate amongst the people in the country. It should certainly make ibestir themselves in such a way that it would be unnecessary for them to come here next year for a further subsidy. I intend to vote for the subsidy this year because the picture of 'the distress misery of farmers growing cattle in the country has appealed to me so strongly as to affect my pity, and -^been urges me to assist in relieving such horrible conditions. The honourable member for Barker (Mr M .

139,Mr WEST,Unknown,"At the present time the price of meat in the cities is much too high. In the last fortnight mutton could nob be purchased in Sydney. When I went home last week I was invited by some people to go along two of the main streets of the city, and I found that the windows of every butcher's shop were covered with the word "" Pork."" reason was that the retail butchers could not purchase mutton from the wholesale houses except at a price which would make it necessary for them to charge twice as much for it as they had charged the week before. I make these statements to show the lack of proper organization* in the cattle industry. W it h regard to the position in Melbourne, according to those in the trade, there are five or _ six people who have very great influence with the State Government, and have been successful in interposing obstacles to the admission of Queensland cattle into this State. If cattle are dipped in Queensland there is no reason why they should not be free from ticks when brought to .Melbourne. I have been assured on what should be good authority that plenty of meat could be brought from Queensland to Victoria at present, in stead of it being obtained from New Zealand at greater Gost. It is high time that the industry was properly managed. The whole trouble is due to lack of organization, and I am afraid that the payment of a bounty will not provide a permanent remedy. I shall vote for the B i l this occasion, but if a similar measure is brought down next year I shall be unable to support it .

The honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) delivered a particularly consistent speech, and with many of. his statements in regard to the necessity for cheapening freights, I am in complete accord. But my friend, the honourable member for Kooyong,.is a Protectionist, and I think he shares the opinion held by many members of this House on the fiscal issue, - namely, that our secondary industries should be subsidized through the Tariff. If that is reasonable, it cannot 'be regarded as unreasonable to subsidize a primary industry, when it is in difficulty, through the more direct method of a bonus. Perhaps the analytical mind The of the honourable member for Kooyong would suggest to him that there is no analogy between! a direct subsidy and a subsidy by means of the Tariff, but the distinction is more apparent than real, because in both cases the general taxpayers have to provide the money. In purchasing the product of a secondary industry the consumer pays the duty if it is an imported article, and if he purChases an Australian-made article, which he ought to do as far as possible, he pays the equivalent of the duty. In most cases the consumer does this year after year, and has come to regard it as a reasonable thing to do. But when a bonus of i d . per lb. is proposed as a direct subsidy to a primary industry in difficulties, it is regarded as highly improper, and a violation of some economic law. The secondary industry is privileged in that, in competing with importations from overseas, it is able to obtain, not only world's prices, but world's prices plus freights and Tariffs. The export-meat in dustry, on the other hand, receives l on world's prices, less freight and less a huge discount owing to the fact that frozen meat obtains a much lower price than the fresh article. If it be a virtue on the part of the Government to collect tribute from the consumer indirectly in order to protect a secondary industry, there is not very much wrong in handing back a little of that money to assist another industry which is absolutely on the rocks.
