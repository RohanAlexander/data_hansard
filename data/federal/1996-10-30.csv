1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Anderson, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
2,Mr ANDERSON,WOOL INTERNATIONAL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill represents a significant milestone the very troubled Australian wool industry. It is the culmination of a period of very extensive consultation and the development of very considerable cooperation-which came out of that consultation-within the industry and clearly demonstrates that the industry can come together on issues of critical importance to its future. It reflects a willingness on the part of the industry to work together that I hope will remain a feature of the industry for many years to come, particularly as it grapples with the need to find strategies and directions to secure a realistic living for the people in the industry. This government has worked alongside the industry during a very difficult period to help reach the consensus approach to the package of measures reflected in this bill. It is a of the level of cooperation and the recognition of the need for a consensus which brought the industry and government together to resolve this issue at the successful 30 August round table. This bill represents the final stage in the disposal of the wool stockpile which was created during the last years of the reserve price scheme. The stockpile and the associated debt are both now at a level which is less than half that which had built up in the early 1990s. To a very large extent-this is, unfortunately, often overlooked in the understandable hurt and emotion of the moment-this is a tribute to the fixed release schedule which has operated since 1994. This government supported the implementation of the fixed release schedule on the basis that it presented a sound mechanism for disposing of the stockpile and removing the detrimental effect it was having at that time on the entire wool market. Only through the success of this arrangement has the industry been given the opportunity to review and recommend change to the disposal schedule to enable Wool International, as the stockpile manager, to exercise greater commercial flexibility and responsiveness in the interests of the overall wool market. The bill provides for a package of measures which will see the stockpile finally cleared by 31 December 2000. The package broadens for considerably the range within which Wool International is required to sell stockpile wool each quarter. The quarterly minimum disposal requirement is reduced from its current level of 182,000 bales per quarter-first to 135,000 bales per quarter from 1 January 1997 to June 1993, then reducing to 90,000 bales per quarter from 1 July 1997. The quarterly maximum disposal requirement is increased from 192,000 bales per quarter to 350,000 bales per quarter from 1 January 1997. The intention of broadening the disposal range is to provide Wool International with considerably greater commercial flexibility to sell more in a rising market and sell less in a softer market. The expectation is that this will ease the pressure on the fresh wool market at more critical periods in the wool market mark cycle. I think we would all acknowledge now that, whilst the focus when Wool International was put in place was very much on debt and on the need to recover as much of that debt as possible, it was appropriate at that time to concentrate on and to recognise in Wool International's charter-through the legislation that put it in place-the need to maximise the value of the stockpile. There is no doubt now, however, that the urgent priority is to maximise returns to growers in their current very difficult circumstances after some five or six years of wool prices being essentially below the cost of production. It has done immense damage in much of rural Australia. We need to remember that there are vast slabs of this country where the only really viable agricultural pursuit is wool growing. Those entire areas are tragically at very real risk at the moment, with run-down properties, dispirited landowners, towns falling apart, small businesses collapsing and the very infrastructure of communities starting to unravel-a truly tragic picture. The member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who is in the chamber, would know only too well of what is happening in his area and in many of the towns and communities in western New South Wales. As I said, the expectation is that the new approach will ease the pressure on the fresh wool market at critical times in the wool market cycle. I point out, on the flip side of the coin-this needs to be kept clearly in mind-that the Wool International Board will need to balance the exercise of this new greater commercial flexibility against three other new elements. First, as a means of ensuring a steady retirement of debt, a target date of 31 December 1998 has been set for the final repayment of the debt. Once this has been achieved, the government's debt guarantee arrangements will also end. This underlines the government's view that it needs to continue to withdraw from the industry to allow the industry to determine its future direction. That is not to say that we will not work with the industry in the future to achieve the best possible results for it. In broad terms, are determined as a government to create the best possible economic environment for the industry to operate in with the lowest possible costs, inflation and interest rates. Those of things that have done so much damage to rural Australia in the past will be squarely tackled, as has been made plain in this place on many occasions by the government. We are committed to more flexible industrial relations. It needs to be remembered that the Garnaut report identified very considerable savings for wool growers through more efficient handling, storage and waterfront arrangements in particular, and we need to pursue those. I see a very important role for government in the area of research and development, and we will continue to contribute very significantly in that regard. I also see a very important role for government in assisting with trade negotiations and market access negotiations. The pursuit of these sorts of initiatives is reflected by the recent signing of a wool cooperation agreement between Tim Fischer, as Minister for Trade, and Dr Herminio Blanco, the Mexican Minister for Trade and Industrial Development, in which I participated. Under this agreement, wool tops from this country will be exported to Mexico with no tariffs being applied along the way. Our tops, with Australian expertise and skills being used in the process, will be value added in Mexico and then re-exported as finished garments into North America-again, under NAFTA on a tariff free basis. The government has a major role to play in that sort of enlightened approach as we seek to secure for the industry that which it needs most-and I use those terms advisedly-and that is a very significant opening up in market opportunities. If the wool industry is to have a future, it really must, together with government, now focus on the vital prerequisite-the key to that futurewhich is boosting demand. I hear a lot of growers complaining about the performance of those who seek to promote their product; yet it is not all bad news. Just by way of example, since the first major shake-out of the IWS in the late 1980s when we the reserve price scheme collapsed, the leaned down and much trimmer IWS, with its more carefully targeted programs, has managed not only to halt the erosion of wool share of the sorts apparel markets in our six major customer nations but also to tum that around. It is very unfortunate indeed. I cannot work out why wool prices are not recovering more strongly now, because the pipeline is freeing up, and both the on-farm stockpile and the inwarehouse stockpile is easing. The signs are there that supply and demand ought to be coming back into a healthier balance. It does concern me that we are not seeing the pick-up that one might have expected out of that relatively happy coincidence of events. It is regrettable that fibre markets right across the globe are very flat at the moment. The cotton industry is experiencing the same thing; so is the synthetics industry. In part, and this needs to be kept in mind by wool growers, it reflects the fact that there are so many things now competing for the consumer's dollar. Consumers may decide they are going to buy new clothes; they might equally decide they are going to buy some new computer equipment for the kids; or they may decide that, instead of buying a couple of sweaters during the winter, they are going buy one of a higher quality and keep it longer. Changing consumer patterns are very much part of what is happening to the wool market internationally. That needs to be addressed. It needs to be tackled. We need to find innovative ways to operate and to promote the product in that changed environment. One other thing that concerns me enormously is that, some five or six years ago, research undertaken by the International Wool Secretariat showed, quite plainly, that under35s in most major Western consuming nations had a very low awareness of the qualities of wool. I suppose in general terms it could be summarised by saying that they thought of it as a natural product. They also thought that wool was expensive, hard to look after, and in general knew very little about it. I am alarmed to see some more recent work that shows five years down the road it is the under-40s who have no particular appreciation of the qualities of wool; in other words, we are not managing to break that age barrier. In another five years, if we are not careful, it will be the under-45s and in 10 years time it will be the under-50s. Then we really will be looking at a very small market indeed if we cannot get younger people more switched on to the qualities and the desirability of wool a fibre. The second point that needs to be kept in mind in terms of new parameters is that Wool International will be required to have sold and delivered the last bale in the stockpile by an end date of 31 December 2000. This is included to ensure that the overhang effects of the stockpile on the wool market can be removed at the earliest possible time, taking account of the many other factors in the market. It is also included to ensure that Wool International and the government's involvement in the statutory authority can be wound up within a reasonable time frame. Of course, there may well be an opportunity-and I for one sincerely hope there is-for Wool International to clear the debt and the stockpile well in advance of these legislated dates. This would be entirely consistent with the government's objective of an early withdrawal from direct involvement in issues that are clearly matters for the industry and for the marketplace. Finally, but very significantly, Wool International's objectives have been changed in two ways in order to add a new factor which the Wool International board must take into account in determining the rate of stockpile disposal at any particular time in the future. The requirement for Wool International to foster the long-term profitability and efficiency of the Australian wool industry has been amended to remove the phrase 'long term'. This reflects the increasing need, as the stockpile runs down, of Wool International to foster the short, medium and long term profitability of the industry to the greatest extent possible. In addition, Wool International is to be required, in providing for the disposal and management of the wool stockpile and in addition to enhancing the ultimate value of the stockpile, to take account of the effect of the disposal of stockpile wool on the Australian wool market. This requirement is repeated in Wool International's functions so as to ensure that there is no doubt as to its importance in the disposal program. As a result, I expect Wool International to review its sales program and, in reaching the decision it as makes on a day-by-day basis on the level of sales, to be continuously addressing the issue of the impact of those sales on the wool market. I had some time in Western Australia last week and I am deeply conscious of the discussions I had there. On one occasion I had a rather interesting and spirited discussion with a large group of growers who were concerned about the impact on the price of fresh wool of Wool International's selling approaches. I undertook with them in good faith to look at this matter very closely and, in particular, to address their proposition that all the wool out of the stockpile ought to be sold at auction. I will shortly be announcing details as to how we will participate in a review and make some decisions in relation to that matter, although I make it quite plain that we will be looking for the best outcome for growers, recognising their need for price relief at the earliest instance. As I said at the outset, this package is the culmination of a very intense and widespread consultative process. It is a very clear signal that the Australian wool industry is prepared to set its own course and determine its own destiny without relying on government for support. When I came into this portfolio the view that I formed was that the industry was not only dispirited, it was badly divided. There were major problems confronting the wool industry and there were debates at that time over whether the major problem was the stockpile, the way the stockpile was being disposed of or lack of demand. I formed the view that in one sense the greatest problem of all confronting the industry was division because without unity they had no hope of tackling those other problems. My energies have been devoted towards drawing this industry together, getting them communicating and focusing on the need to speak with one voice, and getting them switched on to the fact that their real competiOn tors-those with whom they need to argue and establish a point of view or a dominance with-are not other sectors of their own industry but their competitors; and their competitors are cotton and synthetic fibres. The industry need to be very conscious of that as we grapple for a future for this vitally important Australian industry. What we have seen in recent times is a very encouraging sign of the industry'S increasing maturity as it forges ahead. Representatives of the industry, including AWRAP and the Wool Council, will be consulting widely on the other issues that are of importance and that were discussed at the wool round tables, such as promotion and the need to address not only the nature of how we are going to target promotion and what we are going to do to increase people's awareness of wool, but also how we are going to fund it. At the moment, on the back of lower wool prices, the level of funding for the wool industry's promotion objectives and campaigns is running at quite a low level, around $130 million globally. When you compare that with the sort of money that such people as Coca-Cola spend on maintaining demand for their product, $130 million for such a vitally important product worth many billions of dollars annually to the Australian economy is not a lot of money. But finding extra money in the current hard-pressed conditions that growers find themselves in is not easy. The problem with nearly all the options for increased funding that this government and the previous government have participated in trying to identify is that ultimately it nearly all ends up coming out of growers' pockets anyway. That will be a difficult debate but I do encourage growers to participate in an increased promotion effort, carefully targeted perhaps with an attempt to be as innovative as possible and recognising the very different parameters that confront the industry as it seeks to promote its product in the modem marketplace. Recognising all of those things, I am sure a more effective approach can be adopted in the future-that is not to take anything away from those who are currently seeking to direct promotion at the moment. that basis, it is with great pleasure that I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Tanner) adjourned. NA (NUMBERING FEES) AMENDMENT BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Warwick Smith, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
3,Mr WARWICK SMITH,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (9.50 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is part of a package relating to charging for telecommunications numbers. The second part of this package is the Telecommunications Amendment Bill, which I will deal with shortly. This bill is about the government delivering on its promises to deliver a fair and equitable environment for the telecommunications industry. The bill enables the Commonwealth to charge for certain numbers used for the delivery of telecommunications services. These numbers are a limited public resource. Under the current arrangements, carriers and service providers do not pay for the numbers allocated to them by Austel, the government regulator. I am informed that the carriers do charge users for some of these numbers. A price based allocation system for numbers will remove the windfall gains which the carriers currently enjoy, and will also encourage an efficient allocation of this limited resource. I expect that charging for number allocations would encourage the carriers to rationalise some of their holdings, including returning numbers held in carrier and service provider inventories. These numbers would thus be freed for use by new market entrants. The government's scheme, as reflected in the bill, will provide the following: carriers and service providers will be charged for the allocation of blocks of numbers they receive from Austel; charges will be levied annually; Austel is to set the level of fees for differwhich ent number ranges by determination. The Austel determination, which will specify the numbers to attract a charge and the level of the charge, will be a disallowable instrument. The parliament will therefore have the opportunity to examine the administrative details of the scheme. I expect the charging scheme to derive in the vicinity of $30 million in Commonwealth revenue. I am advised that, to meet this figure, the charge on some numbers could be as low as $1.00. The Minister for Communications and the Arts can issue a direction to Austel under section 50 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 prohibiting Austel from levying charges on certain numbers. It is important to note that the minister will issue a direction which will prevent charges from being imposed on telephone numbers which are allocated for the provision of the standard telephone servicethat is, 'basic' telephone numbers for both residential and business users. It is envisaged that the highest chargeswith a maximum limit of $100,000-will be imposed on certain premium numbers, including: '13' six-digit and' 134' eight-digit numbers used for special network services '1800' lO-digit numbers, which are reserved for free phone services '190' 10-digit numbers for information services, and '005' nine-digit numbers, also used for information services. Charges would therefore be applied to a maximum of six million numbers in relation to these premium ranges. Charges will not be set on numbers allocated for the standard telephone service. Certain blocks could reasonably be considered to hold more intrinsic value than others. The specific charges to be applied to specific blocks of numbers will be considered by Austel in consultation with the industry. Currently, the Telecommunications (Numbering Fees) Act 1991 does not permit fees being applied to numbers that have already been allocated free of charge. The existing legislation also does not allow annual charges, are appropriate for a public resource where we do not wish to grant long-term ownership rights. The bill I am now presenting to the parliament enables the accomplishment of the proposed charging scheme. It will enable efficient management and allocation of a valuable national resource. It will also provide for charges to be levied on numbers which have already been allocated to carriers, thus ensuring that carriers will not be unfairly advantaged over other market players. Furthermore, the bill will ensure that at least some of the value of this resource is recovered by the Commonwealth. A separate bill will be introduced to the House as part of the post-1997 telecommunications regulatory environment to ensure the number charging scheme continues after the deregulation of the industry on 1 July 1997. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Tanner) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Warwick Smith, and read a first time. Second Reading",16
4,Mr WARWICK SMITH,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (9.55 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Part 1 of the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1996 relates to disclosure of information to emergency services. Part 2 relates to charging for telecommunications numbers. In regard to charging for telecommunications numbers, this bill comprises the second part of a package of legislative amendments. I have provided details of the proposed charging scheme for telecommunications numbers in my second reading speech for the Telecommunications (Numbering Fees) Amendment Bill 1996. This bill adds to the scheme by providing for the collection of numbering charges. The purpose of part 1 of the Telecommunications Amendment Bill is to clarify the exemptions from prosecution, which are provided for disclosure by employees of telecommunications carriers or eligible service providers of customer information to operators of emergency services. Under paragraph 88(3)(d) of the Telecommunications Act 1991, information obtained by a carrier or service provider employee about the name, telephone number, address or location of callers to the emergency number 000, or information about the content of such calls may be disclosed to police, fire or ambulance officers. Information may not be disclosed where calls are to other emergency numbers allocated by Austel nor disclosed to persons performing services on behalf of the emergency services. Austel has specified in the national numbering plan an alternative emergency number '112' for callers using digital mobile services, and there is a proposal for another emergency number to be specified by Austel for access by hearing and speech impaired persons to emergency services using teletypewriter equipment via the national relay service. The amendments will enable the specified information about callers or calls to emergency services to be disclosed on all emergency numbers identified by Austel in the national numbering plan. The amendments will allow information to be disclosed to an emergency service contractor rather than to the emergency services directly. It seems that in at least one state there is a proposal for emergency services to outsource call taking and dispatch functions. These amendments do not in any way alter the obligation of carriers to provide free access to an emergency number. The government will ensure that this obligation continues in the post-1997 telecommunications environment. The amendments will facilitate quick responses by emergency services to calls to emergency services, while ensuring that the confidentiality of personal customer information continues to be protected. The office of the Privacy Commissioner has raised no objections to the amendments other than to comment that they should be accompanied by an appropriate public education campaign to ensure that callers to the emergency number are aware of the information that may be disclosed and in what circumstances. The government will ensure that such a campaign takes place. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Tanner) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (WAITING PERIOD) First Reading Bill presented by Mr Abbott, and read first time. Second Reading",18
5,Mr ABBOTT,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends part 2 of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973. Part 2 of the Student and Youth Assistance Act provides for the Austudy scheme. The bill introduces a two-year (104 week) waiting period for access to Austudy benefits which will, as a general rule, apply to migrants, including New Zealand citizens, who arrive in Australia on or after I January 1997. The two-year waiting period will not apply to migrants who settled in Australia before January 1997. However, the existing sixthe month Austudy waiting period for New bill to the House. Zealand citizens will continue to apply to those who arrive before 1 January 1997. Migrants and New Zealand citizens who have visited Australia before 1 January 1997 as a tourist or in some other temporary capacity and subsequently return to settle on or after 1 January 1997 will be subject to the waiting period. A safety net exemption from the waiting period will be available to: Refugee and humanitarian migrants and their immediate family members; former holders of visa subclasses 820 (spouses or fiances of Australian citizens) and 826 (interdependent relationships); holders of visa subclasses 832 and 833 (innocent illegals-unlawfuls who are over 18 but entered Australia and became unlawful while they were children); and people who would otherwise be subject to the waiting period but who experience after arrival in Australia a change in circumstances, when they are aged 21 years or less, such that they no longer BILL 1996 have access to a parental home and financial support. a The bill ensures that migrants make provision for their own and their children's education during their first two years as Australian residents. This reflects community expectations that new migrants make a reasonable contribution towards certain educational costs (9.59 upon their arrival in Australia. A similar bill currently being considered by the parliament will introduce a two-year waiting period for receipt of most Department of Social Security payments by migrants who arrived in Australia on or after 1 April 1996. For migrants subject to the two-year waiting period, it will commence on the day the migrant entered Australia or the day they became a permanent resident, whichever is the later. For migrants subject to the two-year waiting period who are New Zealand citizens, the waiting period will commence on the day they permanently settled in Australia. The two-year waiting period does not include I periods of absence from Australia. I present explanatory memorandum. I commend the Debate (on motion by Mr Tanner) adjourned. NATIONAL HEALTH (BUDGET MEASURES) AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Consideration in Detail Clause 2. Consideration resumed from 29 October.",19
6,Mr LEE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"I am in a rather difficult position, because I had been hoping that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), who was in the chamber just a few minutes ago, would be present for this debate. I shall assist the House by responding to a couple of matters that were raised by the minister in his response to the second reading and, in particular, his criticisms of some of the Labor speakers in the debate for accusing the government of wanting to wind back Medicare. The view I have put is that this government and this minister in some ways are putting the Medicare salami on the delicatessen slicer. As each budget comes along, as this minister rolls in each piece of legislation, this government slices off another piece of the Medicare salami. Freezing the rebate for general practitioners is one slice of the salami. An $800 million cutback in funding for public hospitals is another slice off the Medicare salami. Other increases in the cost of expensive operations also have an impact on Medicare and ultimately on the services that are provided to the Australian people who rely on Medicare. Given that I have only three minutes left and there are a number of issues that I would like to raise, perhaps I can put them to the minister at the table, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran), and he might consider responding to them after advice from the advisers in the advisers' box. The issue that we were discussing when the debate was interrupted on the last occasion was whether or not the government or the minister had given assurances to any member or senator that Medicare offices in their own electorates would be closed or kept open. The minister made the following remarks in response to my question: I think that what I had actually said was that not made a decision about which offices were to close. That does not mean that I have not made a decision as to which offices might stay open. The two do not necessarily follow. If the minister was telling us that he has in fact made some decisions about which offices will stay open, I would like to ask the minister at the table to please tell us which offices the government has decided will remain open. In particular, given that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and even the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) have claimed that the Penrith, Richmond, Windsor and, I think, a few other offices in that electorate are to remain open, can the minister confirm that decisions have been made to keep open all of the Medicare offices? In another electorate, the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) in media on the Central Coast has claimed that the Medicare offices at Umina and Erina are to remain open and he claimed that he had an assurance from the minister that that was the case. I would like the minister to advise me today before I go on to additional comments whether or not that is the case. He might like to consult the advisers in the box. Mr MCGauran-No need to.",19
7,Mr LEE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"The minister says he does not need to. I hope he can respond to those questions so that we in this House can find out whether or not some members of the House of Representatives are lucky enough to know that their Medicare offices are to be kept open. We would like to know whether or not Labor members of parliament are having their Medicare offices targeted as some form of political discrimination. For example, I think this parliament has received more petitions from more constituents about the Medicare office in The Entrance in my own electorate than about any other Medicare office in Australia, as a result of the volunteer efforts of members of The Entrance-Long Jetty Combined Pensioners Association. Since I have been unable to get an assurance that the Medicare office at The Entrance will remain open, I would like to ask the minister at the table: if I cannot I had receive that assurance about the Medicare office at The Entrance, have assurances been given to other members, such as the member for Lindsay, such as the Prime Minister, such as the Treasurer and such as the member for Robertson?",20
8,Mr MCGAURAN,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"I will not attempt to speak entirely on behalf of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) on this matter except to say that I can reassure the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) that decisions regarding the future of Medicare offices will not be made on political grounds. Instead, there is a full, complete, thorough and proper review under way at present to assess their effectiveness, where proper savings can be identified and so on. However, it is obvious that some Medicare offices are necessary because of the population they serve. Members on this side of the House, as indeed on your own side, are entitled to be fairly confident in their tions about which Medicare offices will be retained. Others we can be less sure of. For instance, in my rural electorate of Gippsland there are issues of population to be taken into account in considering whether or not all of the offices remain open. But what is very reassuring for members in rural electorates like mine is the government's initiative of establishing Medicare branches or agencies or facilities in pharmacies. So I have been able to tell the good voters of Gippsland that they will still have this direct access to Medicare. The pharmacies in my electorate are very interested and, indeed, excited by the potential of their being part of the system. So in summary, as I am sure the minister for health will tell us, he is not going to preempt in some piecemeal fashion the review of Medicare offices under way. It is high time that was done. It is necessary. There are shifts in population, shifts in degrees of services as well as the opportunity to use pharmacies for Medicare services. It is a wonder it was not done, frankly, during your term in government. This is no Ros Kelly type of whiteboard exercise where you favour your political mates and punish your political opponents. This is a wholly transparent, thorough, needed and credible exercise. And bear in mind that pharmacies will be open for business for Medicare in a way they have never been before.",20
9,Mr LEE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"I reject the political rhetoric of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran) but I appreciate the comments that he made. I am grateful that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) is now in the chamber for this consideration. I might use this as an opportunity to put to him the claims by some members of the government that they have received assurances from him that their Medicare offices will remain open. Could he please advise us whether or not any government, opposition members or independent members have been advised by him or his office that any Medicare offices in their electorates will remain open?",21
10,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"I discussed this yesterday evening. Really, nothing has changed since yesterday evening. No firm decisions have been made about closure, although there are a small number of Medicare offices which now have such a very low throughput of claims that it is standing out fairly starkly that it is hard to justify their existence. Some Medicare offices have a large volume of claims that are stable and do not have close proximity to another office, so it is patently obvious they are going to stay open. And there is the overwhelming majority in the middle. So while no firm decision has been made on any office, I have indicated to one of my colleagues that there is some likelihood that some offices in this electorate will close. I have said to the odd colleague, I am sure, over the last couple of months that, gi ven the nature of a certain office, it is likely that it would stay open. But that is an absolute minority of cases. There is a process independent of me and independent of the political processes looking at things objectively by an objective set of criteria. As soon as that report is given to me I will make a decision and honourable members will know straight after.",21
11,Mr LEE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"The specific case we have been raising is the situation of the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) who, in the central coast media, has claimed that he had an assurance from you that the Medicare offices at Erina and Umina would remain open. Could you advise the House whether you, your staff or the department has given the member for Robertson such an assurance?",21
12,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"Off the top of my head I cannot give such an assurance. As I said, we are trying to do it as fast as we can. It is not in our interest or anyone's interest that there be prolonged speculation. Mr Lee-Would the minister agree to take it on notice and provide me with a written response?",21
13,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,I have had three goes at answering this. I have given as honest and as frank an answer as I can.,22
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! Before we go any further I appreciate that in the earlier parts of this morning's debate there was some attempt to accommodate the procedures of the House. This is consideration in detail. The chair both last night and this morning has given a degree of latitude. If we could bring this discussion to a close it would be of assistance.,22
15,Mr LEE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"With that, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will follow your counsel. Perhaps I could summarise the other points that I think are important for considering the matters before the House at the moment. The minister has advised the House this morning that some of his colleagues have been lucky enough to have been informed that their Medicare offices will remain open. Yet in the Senate estimates hearing a Ms Wood from the Health Insurance Commission on 21 October, which is not that long ago-if I have my numbers right it is only about eight or nine days ago-was asked what criteria would be used to determine which offices would remain open and which would close. She was asked about the consideration of which Medicare offices would remain open and which would remain closed. She said: This is why I am still unable to give you final criteria, because it is not finalised. So Ms Wood is indicating quite clearly that the criteria for determining which offices remain open or closed have not yet been finalised. That was nine days ago. Yet, minister, apparently you have been able to assure some of your colleagues, irrespective of the criteria being determined, that certain Medicare offices will remain open. I am sure that a number of my colleagues would also like to have the benefit of being told that Medicare offices could remain open, irrespective of the criteria to be used in that assessment not yet being finalised. I ask the minister to advise the House whether or not these criteria have been finalised and, if they have not, how the minister is able to determine which offices remain open or closed if the Health Insurance Commission does not know the criteria to be used. Will the minister also confirm the information given to the Senate estimates committee that 35 Medicare offices will close this year and that that number will increase to 51 next year, 68 the year after, to a total of 84 three years from now. If that is the case, minister, don't you think you should have been honest enough to have admitted that Medicare offices with a substantial turnover are going to be affected by your decision in this budget to close one-third of all Medicare offices? I would also like to pick up another point made by the minister, that is, the claim that these new pharmacy agencies will be in some way a replacement for the closed Medicare offices. Could the minister please advise us what equipment will be fitted out in the pharmacies that are lucky enough to be chosen as agencies? One of the budget papers claimed that a fax machine would be used in the pharmacy agencies that acted on behalf of the government. Does that government document still apply or has there been some change? Will it be a fax machine or some form of computer? To what extent will pharmacy staff be required to assist claimants to lodge their claims, or will this be one of those do-it-yourself Medicare offices where you fax off your Medicare claim to some central point? I would be grateful for some clarification of that. Last night the minister said that a number of options were being considered as to what would be the clear and transparent process for deciding which of several pharmacies in a town would be selected. I would be grateful if the minister would confirm, as he appeared to do last night-although it is not clear from the Hansard record-whether one of the options under consideration is in the form of an auction and whether we are expecting the their pharmacy that is lucky enough to be chosen in a particular town to pay money to the government. Or is it a case, which we had understood until now, of the government paying that pharmacy for any expenses that they might be required to meet? Finally, the minister mentioned a number of issues affecting people who rely on incontinence aids. While I appreciate that his attempts to rationalise federal-state relations might have that outcome, will he at least concede that in the short term this budget, in lifting the threshold for the tax concession on medical expenditure from $1,000 to $1,500, is actually going to mean that people who do have to purchase those incontinence aids are worse off as a result of this budget decision?",22
16,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"The proper purpose of examining a bill in detailed consideration is not to have another go at question time or Senate estimates. I have been asked very detailed questions. They are normally and properly something that would be done on notice, or placed on the Notice Paper. So it is very difficult for me, without warning, in a forum that is not normally used to do this sort of thing, to be expected to say things off the top of my head. Mr Lee-What about the criteria?",23
17,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"I will do it as best I can, but I am just saying it is without warning and it is not normally a forum in which one would do this. With regard to Medicare offices, the Health Insurance Commission showed me some draft criteria before the budget, I think. There were four, as far as I remember, some of which I have mentioned. The first was a rapidly declining number of claims, the second was a low absolute number of claims, the third related to geographic proximity-and off the top of my head I cannot remember what the fourth was. I do not see any inconsistency. It is quite possible that they are not finalised. I do not know off the top of my head whether they have or have not been finalised. I have not seen anything to do with a further set of criteria since before the budget, so it is quite possible they have not been finalised and a minute is working its way through the system to me to do so. I have just assumed there would be no change to those criteria but it is possible that there would be change. As for giving people assurances that offices will stay open, I think a check of the records of what I said before and what I said last night would show that the comments I made to my colleagues were on the basis of saying things would be likely. I have talked about the criteria openly. I would be happy to do the same thing for an opposition MP or an independent MP, because I think being elected to this place does give an obligation and that members, in pursuing activities in the area they represent, deserve a degree of courtesy. Not many MPs have bothered to come to see me. I have tried not to give assurances, but in one case I pointed out they should be prepared because there is a great likelihood, given a very low absolute number of claims, and in others that given certain other criteria it would be likely. I have tried to leave some flexibility because the process is somewhat at arm's length from me. The second question related to auctions. Again, I can inform the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) that not a lot has happened between 10.30 last night and 10.30 this morning in relation to the government and the Pharmacy Guild's negotiations. As soon as they are finalised, we will let everybody know, because there is a good deal of interest on the part of rural MPs-most of whom are on our side, but I concede that you still have a few rural seats left, although not many. I will treat rural and regional MPs in the same way, regardless of where they sit in this House, for exactly the same reason that I outlined before. To represent people in this place means that you deserve a degree of courtesy. Any MP will have a chance to have an input into that. The final way that we will do it is still subject to detailed negotiations with the guild.",23
18,Mr ROBERT BROWN,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"Could I say in connection with this question that while I do not deny the normal courtesies that we expect and receive from the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), the soft and soothing tone used by the minister and the other minister who has been here during the consideration in detail stage of the bill does very little to allay my apprehension and concerns about what is going to happen to Medicare offices in my electorate and in the wider Newcastle region. There is a great deal of concern in the community about what is taking place. I congratulate the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) for identifying the problems and our concerns with the legislation and raising questions about them. For a Senate estimates committee to be advised that 35 offices will close this year, 51 next year and a total of 84 over three years and then the minister to say that, while it is possible to be exact about how many offices will close, he does not know at this stage which ones they will be is just inconceivable. I want to know what is going to happen to the Medicare offices in my electorate and the Newcastle region in particular. There is a question about the whole effectiveness of the service delivery of Medicare-Dne of the most fundamental areas of concern for people. For people to have to be dependent upon the adequacy of public transport, where practically no public transport exists, to access the offices that may continue to operate or to access unidentified pharmacies or to use part of their refund to use the postal service to secure that refund is simply not good enough. I would be interested to know whether all the pharmacies in my electorate are going to become subagencies of Medicare. If they are not, what patronage is going to be involved in identifying those that will. The people who have to claim a refund will then presumably be forced to go into a particular pharmacy. If the minister can tell me which ones they are going to be, I think I might take out a share in them at this stage. If people have to go to particular pharmacies to get their refunds, or to arrange for the processing of their refunds, obvious advantages will accrue to those particular pharmacies. If there is not going to be patronage involved it means that all pharmacies will act as subagents of some kind. When you have that amount of duplication-not only duplication of administrative processes but also duplication of necessary security because they will presumably be carrying moneyMr MCGauran-No, it's credited to people's accounts.",23
19,Mr ROBERT BROWN,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"If it is credited directly to their account then we can chop out the need for additional security in connection with the funds. The duplication of administration means that the apparent savings that may accrue to Medicare as a result of these arrangements will not necessarily come about. Those people who are most dependent upon the refund are often people on low incomes and people who can ill-afford to go to the additional expense of accessing those centres. There has been not a brilliant and not a complete network of Medicare offices but certainly a network of Medicare offices which made it possible for most people to access that service. They are the people who are apprehensive. Many of the pharmacists are apprehensive. The people who are employed by Medicare in those offices are apprehensive. I think it is high time the whole question was clarified, made transparent and laid out on the table so that we can be sure that the sort of patronage that this government displayed in relation to the gun buyback proposal will not be extended to Medicare as well. Clause agreed to. Schedule 1.",24
20,Mr LEE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"The opposition will be opposing schedule 1. This schedule implements the budget decision to increase the cost of pharmaceuticals for pensioners and other concession card holders by 50c. It may not sound like much to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) but increasing the cost of every script from $2.70 to $3.20 would do several things. First of all it would increase the cost of essential medications for pensioners. It is actually about an 18 per cent increase in the cost of each script for pensioners who are ill enough to need essential medicines. Most importantly, for the first time it breaks the link between the co-payment for medication and the pharmacy allowance that pensioners receive. When the co-payment was introduced by the former Labor government we ensured that no pensioner was worse off even if they required 52 or more scripts a year which is when the safety net cuts in. What this minister and this government have done in unilaterally increasing the cost of medication is break that undertaking to pensioners that they would be no worse off no matter how ill they are and no matter how many drugs they need each year. In the past most people were a little better off because they did not use 52 scripts a year. But, as a result of this legislation, for the first time those pensioners and concession cardholders unlucky enough to need to use those full 52 or more scripts a year are going to be receiving less from the pharmacy allowance than they payout in their co-payments for their drugs. We think that not only is this unfair to those pensioners and concession cardholders but also it is a breach of the undertakings which Dr Wooldridge, the Minister for Health and Family Services, and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), for that matter, made to pensioners before the last election. Before the last election, they said that they would maintain the real value of pensions and concessions that people receive, yet in their first budget they have devalued that pharmacy concession by approximately 18 per cent through this increase. The example that I really found a bit outrageous was the claim in the minister's speech that: It is important to note that the 'safety net' arrangements under the PBS are not changing, thus maintaining the high level of protection afforded under this scheme. The annual concession limit to access the safety net will remain at 52 times the patient contribution at $166.40 ... The minister is correct in his claim that the safety net stays at 52 times the patient contribution, but he does not explain that it is 52 times $3.20 whereas before it was 52 times $2.70. Minister, your claim that the safety net arrangements are not changing is a rather twisted form of logic. In fact, the safety net increase is from $140.40 to $166.40. That might not sound like much to someone on a member of parliament's salary or even to someone on average weekly earnings but, if you are a person who lives on the base pension and are a resident of a nursing home, 87'12 per cent of your income goes to paying for your accommodation. It leaves you with only a very small amount of money-around $30 a week-for things such as your toiletries, clothing, bus fares, telephone calls or pharmaceuticals. This increase takes away about one week's income from such a person. If members of this House had one week's income taken away in additional costs for their drugs or their medication, they would certainly scream loudly, as would any other wage and salary earner. That is why we believe that this measure is unfair, hits pensioners in a terrible way and breaks the promises that were made before the election. The simple point is there are lots of pensioners out there who this time decided to trust Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, and give him a go. With this legislation and schedule, the coalition are showing that they have broken that trust; they have betrayed those people who were willing to believe their word when they said that no pensioner concessions would be touched.",24
21,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"I will just make some brief comments. The basic problem is twofold: firstly, we went into the election with the then Minister for Finance, now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), saying the budget would be in surplus. On 12 March, we were presented with figures from the Department of Finance and the Treasury that showed we were facing an $8 billion deficit that actually slid and was worse than that by the end of the budget process. It would be nice if there were a magic pudding. But with the pharmaceutical benefits system we also inherited from the Labor Party a system that has a budget substantially larger than that of the state of Tasmania, that had doubled in costs in the previous four years and that was proposed to double or go up 50 per cent in costs in the next four years if no new drugs came on stream. With the new drugs coming on stream, it is expected to go up 100 per cent in costs again. I am sorry, I just cannot find an extra $2.6 billion every four years, particularly when we were slugged with a deficit that we were told was not there. We have tried to have the least impact we possibly can on people. I concede that the average concessional cardholder will be $8.50 a year worse off-not a week or month but $8.50 a year-and that the average old age concessional cardholder will be $15 a year worse off. But the pharmaceutical allowance overcompensates the majority of people, and even after this the majority of pensioners will be overcompensated by the pharmaceutical allowance with the pension. It has not been changed. I am very happy to face the pensioners or anyone in my electorate at any time. I think the pensioners in Lindsay spoke a couple of weekends ago and said exactly what they thought. The fact is that 70 per cent of people in my electorate over 60 years of age have private health insurance and they are very happy at the prospect of being $250 a year better off as the result of being able to get a rebate on private health insurance. If you look at the package as a whole, they are substantially better off, and they know that. The basic problem the Labor Party has is that they can pick little bits out, they can carp and whinge and nitpick, but the public is sick of that. The public knows the problems. The public wants solutions. That is the reason that the Labor Party vote dropped five per cent further in Lindsay. The public wanted to just make sure they got the message. It appears they have not.",25
22,Ms MACKLIN,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"I might just remind the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) sitting opposite of the comments the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), when Leader of the Opposition, made on the John Laws program before the election. In answer to a question, 'Which would you do, break your promises or have a bigger deficit?' he said, 'We won't be breaking our promises.' Of course, there are a couple of big broken promises in this bill. One is that concessions to pensioners would not be removed-a very important promise and one that, as the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has said in previous remarks, did reassure pensioners and make them think that they would not be worse off under this government. They have found that, not just as a result of the increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals but a whole range of other increases in costs, they are going to be a lot worse off. It is the case that we have a broken promise, one which the Prime Minister explicitly said before the election would not be broken. These measures are not about restricting the cost of new drugs. The minister makes great play of the problems for the pharmaceutical benefit scheme of the cost of new drugs. That certainly is an issue which any government has to deal with, but slugging pensioners an additional 50c per script does nothing to deal with the cost of new drugs-absolutely nothing. This is a very complicated area, one that requires a sophisticated response, not just a simple price signal. It also needs to be said that concession card holders will be worse off. You say that at the moment the pharmaceutical allowance overcompensates pensioners. Why, in your election campaign, did you say that pensioners would not have any of their concessions reduced? Why did you make them think that, should the price of pharmaceuticals go up, you would increase the pharmaceutical allowance? You did not want to tell them that they would be worse off, that you would not compensate them as they have rightly come to expect. We have heard the remarks about Lindsay, but the people of that electorate have not had to pay yet. On 1 January the story in Lindsay and all the other electorates around the country will be quite different once people start paying not just for the increase in pharmaceuticals but also the increased cost of nursing home care. Then there is the increased cost of alI the other things that families will have to bear--child care, HECS payments-all the costs that will impact on Australian families. Because it is families, not just pensioners, who will pay a lot more for their pharmaceuticals as a result of these changes. The minister refers to a number of people in his electorate on private health insurance. That has nothing to do with the cost of pharmaceuticals. Those people will face an increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals. They will be paying $20 per script if they are not on some sort of pension or benefit. Families and pensioners will pay a lot more for their drugs. They will not be compensated by the family tax initiative about which you carry on so much. That will be taken up by all the costs that this budget imposes on families. It will not be the case that families are better off; they will be worse off. Yet another broken promise arises from the myriad of changes in this budget. Coming back to the pharmaceutical issue: it is having a very big impact; it is making a lot of older people very concerned about their future. Many older people, many chronically ill people, have high pharmaceutical costscosts which they have to bear. You might think that an additional $8 is nothing on average, but those who are near the safety net will have a very big payment. It is also the case that families will get no benefit from the safety net until they pay $600. They will be paying $20 a pop until they meet the safety net of $600. That is a very significant increase for those families, especially when children get sick together. It will be $20, $40 or $60 a pop every time they need to go to the doctor. (Time expired)",26
23,Mr ROBERT BROWN,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"I want to take the opportunity to endorse the comments made by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) and the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) on the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill 1996. When the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) was making his comments on this issue, to a large extent it was just gobbledegook, such as when he referred to average figures. The member for Dobell made it perfectly clear that for many of the most disadvantaged pensioners this government is ripping away the equivalent of one full week's effective income. Don't let us understate this: that is what it amounts to. We have heard it said that an increase from $2.70 to $3.20 is only SOc. But, as the member for Dobell pointed out, that is a savage attack of 18 per cent-an 18 per cent increase. It is not good enough for the government to claim that it is doing this as a result of iting a deficit in excess of the outcome previously expected. The member for Jagajaga quite correctly drew our attention again to the John Laws interview, when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), then opposition leader, was asked whether an incoming Howard government would honour the undertakings it had given, or whether it would seek to eliminate the deficit. The present Prime Minister's commitment on that occasion was absolutely clear. He said that the government would honour its commitment. Of course, it has not done so. There was an undertaking that pensioners would be no worse off-and that mirrors the undertaking given about industrial relations that workers would not be worse off. Time after time, those obligations, those undertakings, those promises, those commitments have been tom asunder by the government. They come out with all these spurious examples, presented to us and to the wider community in the context of sheer gobbledegook.",27
24,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (l0.43 a.m.)-In this debate on the National Health (Budget Measures) Amendment Bill 1996 I want to make some closing comments in relation to the last two speakers. Obviously, the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) has not yet worked out why they lost the March election. I am happy for that condition to remain. The longer those opposite fail to work out why they lost, the longer they will be in opposition. The way they are going at the moment, I think it will be for a very long time. The reason we have proposed the measures contained in this bill is that the former leader of their party got his figures wrong. The leader of their party said that the budget was in surplus when it was wildly out of surplus. He could have checked those figures, he could have allowed Finance to release the figures. He chose not to. That is the reason we are in the position we are. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) said that things are going to change after 1 January. Great! If you would like to engineer another by-election after 1 January, we would inherbe happy to take you on and you will get a similar result. What the people of Lindsay were trying to tell you was that you have not got the message, and your vote dropped another five per cent just so you would get the message. There were a good number of inaccuracies in the speech by the member for Jagajaga, but I will not respond to them all. As for the $20 a script, it is $17.40 at the moment. The average number of scripts for a nonconcessional card holder is 1.6 a year. So the average person will be paying $4 a year more. I accept that. I would rather it was not the case. If they are concerned, they can send the bill to the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley. Ms Macklin-What about the people who are not average?",27
25,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"That is right, and this is where the Labor Party's position is so hypocritical. Ms Macklin-We are actually worried about people who are sick.",28
26,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"The honourable member says she is worried about people who are sick. I accept that you have not been here very long, but let me tell you what your party did in the last budget. People who are sick the safety net. People who are sick reach a certain amount, and then they get all their scripts for free. For non-concessionals, we have left the safety net the same. So someone who is sick will not pay a cent more. They will just reach the safety net sooner. In the last budget, the Labor Party increased the safety net by $200, so every sick person in Australia who was not a concessional card holder had to pay $200 more because of that decision. Every person who is chronically ill and who is not a concessional will pay nothing more, because the safety net remains unchanged. Ms Macklin-Y ou don't think th at's hypocritical?",28
27,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"It is hypocritical when you increased the safety net in the last budget by 200 bucks and you now say you are worried about the sick. The second thing that is hypocritical is that we did not oppose that piece of legislation last year because it was a budget measure. We actually thought the government had a right to get the budget through. It will be interesting to see how the public responds to your nitpicking and your whingeing, because it just shows that you have not worked out why you lost the last election. The member for Charlton talked about disadvantaged pensioners. I wonder whether he actually knows who he is talking about. The disadvantaged pensioners he is talking about are category 1, 2 and 3 nursing home patients. If the honourable member had spent much time talking to nursing home proprietors, he would know the extreme frailty of these people. It is not as if they shoot down to the local milk bar to buy a packet of cigarettes or some chewing gum. These people have incredibly high dependence needs. Certain information I get tells me that, by and large, they do not spend the limited amount of money they have. I have had numerous complaints from nursing home proprietors saying that the family turns up once every three months and demands the money out of the parent's account. I would rather not charge a pensioner $8.50 a year more, but put it in perspective. It is hit $8.50 a year. Opposition members can whinge all they like and scare people all they like but, in the end, the people are not convinced and they are not going to be convinced. I invite opposition members to keep going exactly the same way they are, because it will mean we will be in government for a very long time.",28
28,Mr LEE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"Let me give the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) an assurance. The Labor Party will continue to speak up for disadvantaged people-such as pensioners and residents of nursing homes-when we think the government is doing the wrong thing. The message from Lindsay was not that the Labor Party should in some way sit mute while you slug pensioners and slug the people whom we are speaking up for today. Minister, let me remind you that, when you wrote to your constituents before the last election in the famous letter to the residents of Box Hill, you said there would be no change in the PBS. You said that people, such as these pensioners, would not be slugged by the legislation you have brought into this House and we are considering today. You did not tell the residents of Box Hill in your letter to them before the election that, depending on the deficit outcome and depending on the number of new drugs that get put onto the PBS list, things could change. You did not tell them that in some way your undertakings and commitments were conditional. You told them that they would not have to pay these increases. You told them that and they trusted you. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) went on the John Laws program and said that if he had to choose between breaking his promises or having a higher deficit he would not break his promises. I bet a lot of John Laws' listeners believed him. Mr Robert Brown-They know better now.",28
29,Mr LEE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"As the member for Charlton interjected, they know better now. Today they know that the letters you write to your constituents and the words the Prime Minister speaks on the John Laws program cannot be trusted. They thought they might give you a go, but they are going to see on 1 January that your undertakings and your commitments simply are not worth the paper they are written on. As for the minister's attempt to claim that families are not going to be badly hit by the increases from $17.40 to $20 for the maximum co-payment for families, let me just draw the House's attention to the minister's claim. He said: . . . general users of the scheme safety net limit quicker, using fewer prescriptions. As if, Minister, this is some virtue that you are proud of. These people reach the safety net limit quicker using fewer prescriptions only because they are paying more. It is quite clear that families are definitely paying more, because this schedule takes $323 million out of the pockets of pensioners and concession card holders and $180 million out of the pockets of families. That is what this schedule does. That is how you have broken your promises, and that is how the Prime Minister, with his budget, has broken the undertakings he made on the John Laws program.",29
30,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"I cannot resist the temptation. The trouble with the Labor Party is this. They have produced a document titled 'Australian Labor Party Policy Document 1993'. It is their health policy. Let me remind honourable members what the Labor Party promised in 1993. Their new directions state: 1. New initiatives with the private sector. $25 million each year for four years made available to contract with private hospitals for elective surgery. Well, $17 million was spent and the scheme was scrapped. 2. Private hospitals will be included in health services regional planning agreements under the Medicare agreement. Never happened. Never attempted. 3. The aged care industry review will examine the adequacy of nursing staff to meet the increasing dependency of those living in hostels. Well, people in hostels have become much more dependent. That was never implemented. 4. A national rural health program will focus on expanding the rural health centres initiative. That was not done. 5. Access to Medicare rebates for bone densimetry for women at risk of developing osteoporosis. That was never introduced. 6. Establishment of a national health promotion authority. Never happened. 7. Legislative reform to the National Health Act will ensure Australia's commitment to the promotion of health. will now reach the Never attempted. 8. Provision of language services in public hospitals. Never done. 9. Establishment of a national advisory council on ethnic health. Never done. 10. Continuation of the national mental health strategy. Never done. Abandoned. 11. Development of a national primary health care policy. Never done. 12. A national environmental health strategy. Never done. I have just read from pages 3 and 4 of the policy. You have form and I have to say that I will relish the opportunity at the next election to compare what we have done in health from 1996 to 1999 with your inactivity and your broken promises, of which I have read 12 out of just two pages of your 1993 policy.",29
31,Ms MACKLIN,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"I want to refer to some of the remarks that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) made in his earlier contribution. He said that nursing home residents do not use the approximately $30 per week they have left from their pension after they have paid their contribution to the nursing home. This is what the proprietors tell him. I do not know which proprietors he is talking to because it is the case, as he acknowledged, that the vast majority-in fact, I would have said all nursing home patients-are on a large number of prescriptions. As a result of being on a large number of prescriptions, they are now going to pay an additional $26 per year, which is equivalent to one week's money in their pocket that they have to spend on essential toiletries, to have a few things that make their life a little more comfortable. The idea that they are not spending the money and that the families are trying to collect it off the nursing home owners makes me feel as if there are some awful rorts going on out there that this government should be trying to address. It is terribly important that the small amount of money that nursing home patients have left over to them each week is available to make their lives a bit more comfortable. It should not be going to help meet your perceived problems with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. These are people who are in the last months or years of their lives. You are saying to them that, although they might have only $30 a week, you are going to take $26 off them per year because you have a budget problem, even though you promised them before the election that you would not do this. Older people all around Australia are not your average Australian that you are talking about. The vast number of 20-, 30and 40-year-old people in our country do not need prescriptions. I cannot remember the last time. I needed to fill one myself, but I can tell you that I fill them frequently for my children. It is the case that people in their seventies and eighties need to fill prescriptions very regularly. They have weekly prescriptions that need to be filled. They are the people that are going to be paying the extra SOc, which, as the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) said, is an increase of 18 per cent-a heck of a lot higher than the consumer price index figure. The idea that somehow they are going to be able to distinguish between necessary and unnecessary prescriptions or, even more ridiculous, the idea that people in nursing homes will be able to distinguish between necessary and unnecessary prescriptions is the most heartless remark I have heard in all my life. It is not the case that older people are your average Australians. That is a most dishonest way of presenting statistics. It is the case that healthy young people do not need prescriptions. Older people who are not healthy are going to bear the brunt of more and more broken promises from this government. It is a callous move. As the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has said, we will continue to stand up for this group of people. It is certainly the case in my electorate and in the electorate of the member for Dobell that older people are very concerned about these increases in prescriptions. We will certainly bring their concerns to this parliament as frequently as we need to.",30
32,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"I am delighted that the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) has acknowledged that there are some awful rorts going on out there.

33,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"Schedule 2 implements the government's decision in the budget to change the indexation rules for co-payments and for the safety net as well, as I understand it. I would just like to quote from item 1 of schedule 2. This is what this particular schedule implements: Omit ""down to the nearest multiple of 10 cents"", substitute ""to the nearest multiple of 10 cents. However, if the amount is not a multiple of 10 cents but it is a multiple of 5 cents, the amount is to be increased by 5 cents"". Those confusing words mean that each year when the government was considering indexing the co-payment for general users, pensioners and concession card holders, the government has always rounded down to the nearest 10c. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I know that has been of great assistance to many of your own constituents who in about 1993 would otherwise have been hit with a lOc increase in the cost of the co-payment for drugs which were obtained by pensioners and other concession cardholders. In that year, as a result of the rounding down, the co-payment was at the lower 10c level rather than being rounded up. These changes mean that, even when it is a dead heat and is spot on the ball at 5c, this heartless government does not round down; it rounds up to the nearest lOco You would have thought that, if it was spot on the dot halfway, they would have rounded down and given the pensioners and the other general users the benefit of the doubt and a bit of generosity. But that is the last thing you would expect from this mob. This change might not sound like much but, according to the information in the explanatory memorandum, these changes will deliver $56 million to consolidated revenue. It means that, as a result of this change, pensioners, concession cardholders and families will be paying an extra $56 million for their medication and for their drugs. In many ways, I think it shows the difference between the Labor Party and the coalition government. The coalition has this economic rationalist's approach to working out how much sick people should pay for their medicines whereas we try to give people the benefit of the doubt by rounding down. They use the economist's approach, the approach that means people will end up paying that extra $56 million.",31
34,Mr JENKINS,PAIRS,"It is regrettable that, probably for some good reason, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) cannot be here for this part of the debate. I would just like to touch on the point that the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has made about this particular measure within schedule 2 that it is an economist's-or bean counter's-view of the way in which there is an attempt to save money for the PBS. Throughout the debate, the minister has made the point-and I take it that these are the figures-that over the last four years the PBS has doubled as an expenditure to government and that it is predicted to grow by 50 per cent over the next four years, even without any new drugs. As I said in the second reading debate last night, one of my concerns is the way in which the bean counters, as I describe them, of Treasury and of Finance look upon the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. By way of illustration I said that, yet again, the Industry Commission has chosen to make suggestions that tamper with the basis of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, especially the way in which new drugs will be put on to the listing. If it is a fact that the cost to government of the scheme is to grow by 50 per cent without new drugs, are the minister's comments to be taken as code such that, in the run-up to next May's budget where we have the machinery of government already working and in place, there will be further measures that will hit the patients? If there is going to be pressure from the pharmaceutical industry in trying to get even better prices for the continuing products on the list or for new product, the only way in which the government appears to be addressing the increase in the cost to government of the PBS is to make patients pay. I think it is an unreasonable way to look at the PBS in isolation. It should be looked at in to to. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme sits as part of our health system. We have to continue to improve the basic health of the community; we have to continue to look at the non-drug alternatives to treatment; and, all the time, we have to be conscious of the cost factors involved. The debate that we are having with this piece of legislation illustrates the continuing problem that we have, where people seem to see this completely in dollars and cents terms without addressing the real requirement, and that is to look at the outcomes. If the outcomes require that the more expensive drugs should be listed, so be it. But we then as a community have to deal with how we handle those cost pressures on the system. A disappointing aspect of the minister's response has been that he will not give an indication to the House, not only in the case of this piece of legislation but for the future, of what he envisages the government will be required to do. For instance, in the last vote the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) came in and voted with the government. He will have to make a response to the Industry Commission report which suggests that the PBS should be dismantled which will lead to the pharmaceutical industry going holus bolus in a free market attempt to get the best price they can for the pharmaceuticals that are listed. It has been a tradition of the PBS that Australia has managed to keep the cost of drugs capped at as low as possible a level. The PBS has been a mechanism whereby drugs have been made available to the Australian community at the most reasonable price. That is the thing that is continually challenged. We have been mean spirited. That is why the other industry aspects of continuing to assist the pharmaceutical industry are also important-and they need to be addressed. They have not been addressed in the responses by the minister during this debate.",32
35,Ms MACKLIN,PAIRS,"I would have to say that this is the sneakiest way I have ever seen of raising $56 million. No pensioner or user of pharmaceutical drugs will know that they are contributing $56 million to the government coffers as a result of this measure. None of them will know: I am sure they will not be told by the government that this sneaky measure of changing the way the rounding happens will raise $56 million out of sick people's pockets, to help meet this government's budget. I cannot understand why a well-established practice that has been to the benefit of sick people has been changed by this government. It can only be seen as the callous measure that it is. Just to say a word in support of the comments by the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins): the idea that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme might be abolished would have to be the most short-sighted measure any government could even consider because it is the case that prices have been kept down by Australia having such an outstanding pharmaceutical benefits scheme. If you look at the amount of money that this country spends on drugs compared with the amount spent in similar countries, it is the case that we spend considerably less. Even though the concerns of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) about increases are correct, the idea that we should throw the baby out with the bath water and get rid of the PBS and that somehow market forces-the great mantra that this government loves so much-would help bring the price down is absolutely incorrect. In all the other countries around world their experience shows that, unless you have a strong, central government controlling the level of fees or prices charged for pharmaceuticals, you see a massive blow-out in the amount the country spends on its essential medicines. My main point is that to take another $56 million out by this rounding method is just plain sneaky-I cannot think of words that sum it up more appropriatelybecause it will not be explained to pensioners or sick people that they are paying it. It is something that should be opposed and the government should come clean about its actions.",33
36,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,PAIRS,"I wish to take the comments raised by the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) and the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) slightly further in the context of previous years negotiations in this field. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will no doubt remember that the then opposition harassed the then government as it tried to negotiate a new set of arrangements with the pharmaceutical industry. If you recall, there were three components. The first was an extension in patent life; in other words, giving drug manufacturers a longer sale life in Australia. The second component was called factor F: for drugs designed or manufactured in Australia they would be paid a higher price. The third factor was the introduction and acceptance of generic drugs as genuine, legitimate, properly tested and equivalent in every sense drugs to the brand name drugs. Those were the three components. We fought up hill and down dale in this chamber against the now government's attempts to suggest that this was to the benefit of the PBS system. The pharmacists and, more importantly, the drug industry took the factor F and they took the patent life extension of four years, but when it came to generics the war was on. It was about saying that when a drug's patent life has expired, when it is no longer owned by the person who first designed it, it is reasonable that access to that drug be much cheaper; in other words, that the chemical and bioequivalence should be available for Australians-and the the government should facilitate that. The fact is that the then opposition fought so hard against that and is now bringing in here the absolutely reverse kind of approach. Rather than its attempting now to help repair the damage it did then to the PBS systemand the way it operates-and to the drug companies, what we are seeing is total surrender. If you have a problem with the budget, what do you do? You slog the pensioners. Do not look at the costs or why they are there and do not look at the cost shift from the states to the Commonwealth in terms of hospital discharges in recent years. Do not look at what drugs are available and whether we are paying too much for drugs which are way out of their patent life. Do not examine any of those things. Slog the pensioner instead. At the start of my speech last night I made the point that this debate was not about health; it was about budget. Quite frankly, the second reading should have been moved by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). To have the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) arguing here that somehow this was an improvement to the system is a travesty and an insult to all our intelligences. He may have been in here trying to argue for an improvement to the system-improved communications with pharmacists, improved documentation and improved coordination between pharmacists, doctors and us in terms of what drugs are available in Australia and which drug companies are playing a fair game-but it is still the case that in Australia Bartl ett, K. 1. very large companies, many of whose turnovers are greater than our federal budget, are still profiteering on drugs whose cost was paid out a decade ago. They are still making substantial profits on Dondas, N. M. drugs that are costing infinitesimal amounts to produce. Who is paying for it? Australians are. Whether they are paying through the PBS or some other way, they are paying for it. The only answer to that is for the government to be firm, and the PBS has always been the vehicle for that. Remember, we extended the patent life. We gave those companies four extra years of patent life in Australia, which was a bonus to them, on the grounds that they would accept and eventually bring in the same drugs as generic at a genuine, not an exaggerated, profit. Those same forces that worked together against the previous government's attempt to improve the system are now working together to rip off pensioners and beneficiaries. Rather than take on the drug companies and get the drugs that are available cheaply, what are you doing? You are slogging them instead. It is outrageous that the same group of people are doing it. If you look at the minister's speech from last night, you will see him saying over and over again that this is an improved system. All the way through he was trying to pretend that somehow this is going to make things better. It will make things much worse. The message is very clear. If you have a budget problem, you slog the people; you do not find a benefit for the system. And that is a disgrace! (Time expired) Question put: That schedule 2 be agreed to. The House divided.

37,Mr LEE,AYES,"The remainder of the bill deals with a number of matters, including the restriction of pharmaceutical benefits. Basically, it brings the rules of entitlement into line with those that apply AYES for medical benefits under the Health Insurance Act. The concerns that we had raised in the debate remain. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) says that he is currently having discussions with the Pharmacy Guild about the obligations that we placed on pharmacists. I would like to put on the record this morning the Labor Party's continuing concern about what mechanism the government will put in place so that pharmacists can assess whether or not people are eligible for the subsidies that are available under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. NOES Basically, these changes mean that you will be entitled to subsidised drugs under the PBS only if you are an Australian citizen, an Australian resident or you are the citizen of a country with which Australia has a reciprocal health agreement. That will then place an obligation on pharmacists to try to find out who the other people are. The Labor Party is quite happy to support the government in saying that people who are tourists, people on holiday to Australia, should not expect the Australian taxpayer to subsidise their medication. If they come to Australia on a holiday, we would expect them to have travel insurance and that their travel insurance should meet the cost of any medication they need. If they have not taken out travel insurance, then that is a cost that they should meet from their own pockets, just as Australians who travel to other countries PAIRS would expect that any medication that they need while they are away on holidays should be met from their travel insurance or from their pocket. We think that is quite reasonable. What I am not sure of is how pharmacists will be expected to pick Australian residents, Australian citizens and people from countries with which we have reciprocal health care agreements. The government might expect pharmacists to check whether someone has a Medicare card-that would be one way to double-check. We would hope that only Australian citizens or residents would have Medicare cards, given that we are picking up the eligibility rules under the Health Insurance Act. To pick people who are citizens of countries with which we have reciprocal health agreements, I imagine that pharmacists might have to check passports or some other form of identification-perhaps a photo ID or driver's licence might be acceptable. I certainly hope that the government will not be expecting pharmacists to keep detailed paperwork on these things. I hope that at the end of the day maybe the pharmacist's word is good enough that the pharmacist has actually sighted a passport or photo ID of sufficient security to ensure that the taxpayer is not getting ripped off. As I say, I place on record my concern that the government keeps the undertakings the minister made last night that the government would not be pursuing measures that place an undue bureaucratic burden on pharmacists. Bill agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Jull)-by leaveread a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 October, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the bill be now read a second time.  a.m.)-The Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill contains a number of items, some of which are non-contentious. A number of items in the bill relate to indexation adjust to ments for price movements to payments made to universities. Some of the other provisions reflect some of the more benign aspects of the coalition's announcements on higher education, such as the increases in research infrastructure spending, the system of merit scholarships and so forth. These clearly are matters that we would support. It has to be stressed, however, that they scarcely begin to offset the very negative impact on the higher education system of the other measures that the government is taking, particularly the cuts in university operating grants and other forms of funding and the changes that are being brought about through measures in this bill to the higher education contribution scheme, allowing the charging of full fees to Australian undergraduates, the changes to the open learning system and so forth. There are a number of measures in the bill that we will be opposing very strongly. We are on the public record as saying that we are fundamentally against the proposals to increase the level of HECS and to reduce the threshold at which repayments of HECS become payable, as well as the proposal to allow universities to charge full fees. When we get to the detailed consideration of the bill I will be moving a number of amendments to the schedule setting out these changes to delete the items that we find objectionable. We will be opposing these measures right down the line. We will be dividing on the third reading, assuming our amendments are not agreed to by the House. We will continue that opposition when the legislation goes on to the Senate. We think these are fundamental issues. We have fundamental concerns and objections to what the government is doing in these areas. It is also worth noting at this point that the bill is noteworthy not just for what is included in it but for what it omits. The key thing that it omits that you would expect a piece of higher education legislation at this time to include is the legislative provision for funding for the last year of the rolling triennium. It was the practice of the previous government after the budget and once the issues had been settled about the total amounts to be allocated higher education to legislate to amend the Higher Education Funding Act to incorporate those amounts specified in the act for the three years of the rolling triennium. The rolling triennium now should include the years 1997, 1998 and 1999. This bill does not include the funding relating to 1999. We think that is a very major concern, as does the higher education sector. The Australian Vice Chancellors Committee and the National Tertiary Education Union and other organisations directly involved with the sector have expressed very grave concern about what this implies for the stability and security of funding for universities in the coming period. This is a particular concern, obviously, in the light of what the government has already done by announcing that it will be paying to universities less than the amounts already legislated for for 1997 and 1998. The way the Higher Education Funding Act is framed the minister has a capacity to make a determination under the act to pay an amount less than the maximum specified in the act, something we never did. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) has announced that she will, effectively, undermine that triennial funding arrangement both by not legislating for the 1999 funding and also by determining amounts for 1997 and 1998 less than those already specified in the act. We are very concerned about that. We believe that that is part of a matrix of decisions this government has taken on higher education that will fundamentally transform the system over the coming years. It is significant that at the time of announcing its higher education budget measures for this year that was done in a separate statement 10 days or so before the budget-the government also announced that it would be conducting a review of higher education policy and funding. We think it is extraordinary, given that the government expresses a view that it is necessary or desirable to have a fundamental review of all aspects of higher education funding, that it would be taking decisions of this degree of significance and magnitude within the short-term context of this year's budget. We think it is very short sighted. It is important to stress that these decisions are not minor incremental changes. They are very significant changes. We believe that they will have a very significant and negative effect on both the quality and accessibility of higher education in this country. When I say 'accessibility' I mean accessibility to people irrespective of their backgrounds and irrespective of their degree of relative disadvantage. Professor Bruce Chapman, the designer of the original HECS scheme, in a paper he released recently in which he discusses the impact of this government's budget decisions makes the point: The changes to Australia's higher education system announced in the 1996/97 Budget have more potential to transform financial arrangements than any other funding policy variations introduced over the last 30 years. This includes the abolition of fees in 1974 and the introduction of HECS in 1989. That was said by Professor Chapman who, as the architect and designer of HECS, is obviously well acquainted with the scheme. He goes on to say: There are three important points: there is now a different basis determining the relative charge for courses; there are increased effective charges for not just all future students, but also all current HECS debtors; and there will be an inevitable increase in the composition of enrolments towards students from rich backgrounds as the currently universal HECS arrangements move towards a system in which a significant minority of students are paying up-front fees. These changes are very significant and will have a very profound impact. We think it is indefensible that the government has chosen to go down this route without first carefully evaluating the potential impact of these changes and without first seeing whatever emerges from its broad based review of higher education funding. We are particularly concerned about the impact of these changes on equity of access to higher education. In government for over 13 years, we made it a major priority to greatly expand access to university education. You can see that in the aggregate numbers. The number of students in our universities grew from around 350,000 in 1983 to over 600,000 last year, a very large increase. That was matched by a very large increase in the real level of Commonwealth funding for universities. That went up by about 70 per cent. In terms of the degree of access to people in our society, if you focus on schoolleavers, there are some interesting tables in DEETY A's publication Selected Higher Education Funding 1995. If you look at the 17 to 19 age group, which you can regard as most relevant when assessing access for school leavers, the level of participation per thousand of population increased by about 60 per cent over the period that we were in government. So notwithstanding the claims that are sometimes made-and I note the minister has sometimes said that opportunities for school leavers fell during particular periods-the overall impact during our period in government has been a very major and significant increase in the level of opportunities to participate in higher education by school leavers. We also made it a very significant priority to expand not just the number of places and access across the board, but access for groups who are particularly disadvantaged. I do not pretend that by any means we achieved everything that we set out to achieve in that area, but there were some notable achievements. These are documented in a report by the Higher Education Council on the effectiveness of the former government's equity programs which was released earlier this year. It showed that particular groups-and I instance Aboriginals, people from non-English speaking backgrounds and women in nontraditional areas of study-had very significant improvements in terms of access and participation. If you take Aboriginals, for example, from 1990 to 1995, the number of Aboriginal students participating in higher education rose by about 50 per cent. That same report, as Senator Vanstone has pointed out on a couple of occasions, also showed that the share in university enrolments of people from low socio-economic backgrounds and people from rural and isolated backgrounds did not improve. That is true, but bear in mind that the absolute numbers of people from those backgrounds participating in higher education grew quite significantly. In other words, while people from those disadvantaged backgrounds did not increase their share of university intakes, they certainly were able to benefit from the overall growth in participation numbers that took place during our period of government. It is singularly ironic that the minister raises that matter because when we talk about HECS I think it is important to look at the HECS impact on people's decision as to whether to participate in higher education. A range of studies that we conducted back in 1992 showed that the group which were most sensitive in terms of their participation decisions to changes in HECS were precisely those groups which have proved to be most difficult to improve in terms of raising overall participation rates-that is, people from low socio-economic backgrounds and people from rural backgrounds. If you combine those characteristics, you start to see--even back in 1992 when we did the studies and even at the level of HECS at which we pitched it-that they were the group most likely to be deterred. I think about 20 per cent cited HECS as a significant factor affecting their decision to participate. It is singularly ironic that the minister, in seeking to disparage the achievements of the previous government in this area, refers to our lack of achievement in regard to those groups and then in this budget proposes to ramp up HECS by a very large amount, given that these are the very groups that are most likely to be deterred by a HECS increase. What we sought to do in government in the higher education area was to achieve a system where access to the maximum extent feasible was a function of motivation and capacity and not of financial means. That is the central equity issue and that is the central national interest issue when we talk about arrangements for higher education funding-avoiding a circumstance where people are not able or do not feel that they are able to participate in higher education because of a less advantaged background. We had some significant runs on the board in that area. We did not achieve everything we wanted, but in so far as we did increase the proportion of people from low socio-economic background-we certainly increased their absolute numbers-any deficiency in the previous government's achievement in this area will obviously and clearly be compounded by what the current government is doing in regard to HECS. Another aspect to which we attached great priority in government was addressing the regional aspect of disadvantage in terms of access to higher education opportunities. We accorded a very high priority to developing new regional institutions. We put hundreds of millions of dollars into capital developments at new universities-for example, in New South Wales, the University of Western Sydney, Charles Sturt University and others. We believe that the impact of this government's decisions will be particularly detrimental to that aspect of what we sought to achieve. I would like to tum to some of the specific measures contained in the bill. The bill is notable for the omission of the inclusion of funding for the out year of the rolling triennium. This is all done against the background of major cuts in higher education expenditure. If you add together the cut in operating grant, which is in excess of $600 million, and the abolition of discretionary funds, which is a cut in excess of $200 million, you are up over $800 million over the forward estimates period. You have to also combine that with the decision to not provide supplementation for academic salaries, which will have the most significant impact of all. The government says that it is prepared to consider financial assistance in particular cases where institutions are seeking to facilitate salary negotiations at the institutional level. It has been made very clear to the universities by DEETYA, as I understand it, that the most that can be expected in this regard is some adjustment in cash flow-in other words, a bringing forward of funding for universities but not a real substantive increase. Professor Gavin Brown, who I understand is a mathematician by training and is ViceChancellor of Sydney University, estimated that by the year 2000 there would be an effective 15 per cent cut for his institution a combined result of these decisions. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and others have put the effective combined cut resulting from non-supplementation and cuts to operating grants and discretionary funding in the range of 10 to 12 per cent. It is hardly a nick, to quote Senator Vanstone's term. When you look at the measures in this bill, you really have to take this overall constraint on funding and the reduction in effective available funding for institutions into account when you think about the potential impact of HECS increases and full fees. You cannot consider these things in isolation. As the demand for higher education resumes its growth in the longer term-and there is a bit of a demographic dip at the moment-how is that growth going to be accommodated? Is it going to be accommodated through increases in Commonwealth funding on the basis of HECS paying places? I do not believe so. The reality is-and I think the universities are becoming reconciled to this-that the growth will be in the fee paying area. That will mean that in the more lucrative and attractive courses over time you are going to see a progressive substitution of full fee places for HECS paying places. The government claims to have safeguards in that area. I do not believe for a minute that they will be workable. In any case, that does not deal with the question of growth. The growth area is going to be in full fee places. As Professor Chapman points out, the impact of this over time will be a severe diminution in the level of equity of access to our system. It will mean that certain professions will be restored as bastions of privilege. You will have to pay very large sums to get into them. You will have to be prepared to undertake very substantial levels of financial risk. Clearly, people from low socio-economic backgrounds are going to be less inclined and less able to incur that level of financial risk. Turning to the HECS changes, I think what has been proposed is tragic in terms of its implications. We had at the outset-and this is not just my view; a number of respected academic commentators have confirmed as this-succeeded in creating one of the most accessible systems of higher education in the world. The HECS, when it was introduced, involved a degree of cost recovery and user pays, but it was very carefully designed to avoid constituting a barrier to participation for people from low income backgrounds. That was reflected in the basic structure of the scheme with the income contingent repayment mechanism and a zero real interest rate so people did not have to start paying until their incomes were above average weekly earnings. We thought that was a reasonable benchmark. It was also reflected in the level at which we pitched tax, which was a bit over 20 per cent of average course costs. It was also reflected in the importance we attached to continued monitoring of the impact of HECS on participation decisions. We introduced a legislative requirement that the Higher Education Council report regularly to parliament on the impact of HECS on participation decisions. At the time we made the initial decision to go down the HECS route we said that we would commission a body of research to give us some indication of what the likely impact of HECS would be on participation decisions. That research was conducted, most of it in 1991-92. It broadly confirmed that, at the level we had pitched it at and with the structure we had created, it was not going to have a major impact in terms of deterring people from disadvantaged backgrounds from participating. Having said that, you cannot say that it was a completely non-existent factor. There are particular subgroups, particularly those from low socio-economic backgrounds and residing in rural areas, that did start to show some significant proportion potentially being deterred by HECS. To ramp it up by an order of magnitude in the way which is being done, without any rcal knowledge and any underlying research to get a sense of what the probable impact of it will be, we think, is highly irresponsible and highly likely to constitute a problem for people from low income backgrounds. The rationale for differential HECS was considered by the government at the time HECS was introduced. It was considered and rejected for what we regarded as good and cogent reasons. The sort of rationale that underpinned our rejection of differential HECS is starting to be borne out already, even at this early stage in what we are seeing with enrolment application patterns. One of our key concerns at the time was that there are courses which are relatively expensive to teach-and that includes many of the technology and science based subjects-but which do not necessarily lead on to hugely lucrative career paths, but which are areas of education and training which are very important from the national point of view if we are to have a work force which is scientifically and technologically competent. What we are seeing with the early information on enrolments is very interesting and disturbing. We do not have the full information yet because it is not generally available in all states. But I have had my staff ring around a variety of institutions to try to get a sense of what has been going on. We see in some cases quite catastrophic declines in applications for enrolment in fields like science and engineering. The University of Western Sydney, for example, has had an overall decline in student numbers of 8\12 per cent but a 41 per cent decline in engineering and a 14 per cent decline in science and technology. Even in Queensland, where, contrary to the national trend, there has been overall growth in applications, science and engineering have suffered. For example, at the Central Queensland University, which had overall growth of six per cent, there is a 20 per cent decline in applications for science courses and a seven per cent decline in engineering courses. We are seeing that decline in some of the areas of study that are really essential to this country's future if it is to be a country capable of sustaining industries producing sophisticated manufactures and sophisticated services and having a good scientific knowledge base and qualified science and mathematics teachers. The latter is another major problem. We are seeing the prospect of a critical shortage of teachers generally at some point in the future; but particularly in the area of science and mathematics teaching. You look at all that and ask yourself: in terms of the national interest, what are the implications of these changes? I think they are very serious, particularly when you consider the impact of some of the government's other decisions, such as in the research and development area, where there are clear indications that quite a bit of the research and development activity conducted by the private sector is likely to move offshore. What is the combined impact of these changes? I would argue it is a very significant detriment to this country. We have to be concerned about that. It is also clear that people particularly affected by the reduction in the HECS repayments threshold are showing evidence of a decline in interest in higher education. The best reflection of that is the numbers of mature age applicants for university admission. In some cases, the falls are quite stark. In Victoria, for example, there is a 1.4 per cent decline in school leaver applications but a 14.7 per cent decline in non-year 12. What does this mean for people being able to access the education and training system throughout their lives? There is a lot of rhetoric spouted about the importance of lifelong learning. And it is not just rhetoric; it is very important. As a consequence of these changes, it is going to be increasingly difficult for people who need to support a family-and therefore need to earn some sort of an income-to justify or sustain participation in higher education. Given this sharp drop in the repayments schedule to $20,700, these people will, in many cases, be having to make repayments at the very time they are studying. In terms of the HECS rises and their impact on science applications, Dr John Rice, who is the President of the Australian Council of Deans of Science, has pointed to what he describes as a 'quantum' reduction in applications for science, which he directly attributes to the impact of the government's changes to HECS. This was reported in the Australian on 24 October 1996. The President of the Australian Council of Deans of Education has pointed out that there is a significant impact on potential production of qualified teachers in science and mathematics. These are very serious impacts from these HECS changes which, as well as diminishing the equity of higher education provision, are going to mean that the accessibility of the system throughout people's working lives is going to be severely diminished. The rationale for differential HECS is also fundamentally flawed. It is all very well to say that statistically on average graduates in a particular course will earn a certain amount. You can compute an average, but the reality is that there is a huge amount of variation around that average. Take. law, for example. People who go into practice in community legal centres or the very high proportion of law graduates who go into professions or occupations other than the practice of law are going to be affected by the presumption that they will be achieving earnings that, in reality, they will not achieve. If the concern is with achieving more equitable distribution of lifetime earnings and income, the HECS structure is not the appropriate instrument to achieve that objective. There are other and far more direct mechanisms to do that, the obvious one being the taxation system. It is certainly not rational to try to use the HECS system as a means of equalising and achieving a more equitable distribution of lifetime earnings. We are fundamentally opposed to the fee changes, for the reasons I have already outlined. You are going to see, as the system continues to grow, the progressive substitution of HECS paying places by fee paying places. The reality is that some institutions are going to be particularly severely affected by that. Charles Sturt University, which is in western New South Wales, is an example. Quite a high proportion of its generic business students come from metropolitan Sydney. They are facing the combination of a sharply increased rate of HECS and the cost of moving, and of parents supporting their move, away from home. If the University of New South Wales, or any of the other long-established metropolitan Sydney universities start to offer full fee paying places in the same area, the potential impact on institutions like Charles Sturt could be quite serious and will undermine that key dimension that we focused on in government-that is, trying to make sure that the locational aspect of educational disadvantage was effectively addressed. There is not much time to talk about the open learning changes in this bill. Needless to say, we oppose the opening up of the open learning courses for unrestricted fee charging. I was the minister responsible for the initiation of the open learning system. It was certainly not my intention to create a Trojan Horse for the demolition of the whole current structure and system of access to higher education. We will be opposing those measures in the legislation as well. In conclusion: this bill contains a mixture of measures, some of which are unobjectionable, some of which we will support. But it also contains a number of the core decisions in this year's higher education budget that we find profoundly objectionable and which we will be opposing right down to the wire when this bill goes to the Senate. When we get to consideration in detail, I will be moving a series of amendments which seek to delete from the schedule to the act containing the substantive measures those which we find particularly objectionable. Assuming that those amendments will be defeated in the House of Representatives, as no doubt they will be, we will be opposing and dividing on the third reading. That approach will be taken to the bill whole because we think these measures are so objectionable that such a level of opposition is warranted. We will be pursuing that level of opposition in the Senate. Whereas the outcome in this chamber is predetermined, that is not the case in the Senate. I can tell you that we will be going right down to the wire on this issue and doing everything in our power to defeat the bill and overcome these objectionable proposals.",35
38,Mr CHARLES,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I rise to support the government's Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. Having listened to the last comments the  Baldwin) made, I am highly disappointed that, firstly, he finds this bill objectionable and, secondly, that the opposition will not support the legislation but will vote against it, as says, 'down to the wire'. We have known for a very long time that there are various degrees of benefit from this business we call higher education. I have said in this place before that, essentially, the public certainly derives benefit from higher education. Industry, business and commerce also derive benefit by virtue of the fact that the outputs of the education system-the educated students-are available to pursue business, technical and industry careers which benefit the businesses they work for. The third benefit is to the individual who chooses to go to an institution of higher learning, who is capable of undertaking the study, and who has the will and determination to last through that study and obtain the appropriate outcome, be it a diploma, a degree or a higher degree, and who is able to use those both to personal benefit and to the benefit of the broader society. This morning I will look at each of those three benefits and see how this bill impacts on them and at where higher education is heading in this country. Over the last year or two it has occurred to me that industry, which is one of the beneficiaries I talked about, has perhaps too little a part to play in our system of education, be it at the primary or secondary level, the technical and vocational education level, or at the as a higher education level. We have created an almost totally government-dominated education business in this country. There is nothing wrong with that except that it sends a message to private industry that it need not participate, that government will take care of educating our citizens and that industry need not supply their resources to help in that effort because government will take care of it. Government takes taxation revenue from the general population and from trade and industries on profits and capital gains. It then reapplies it to a number of mechanisms for social good-welfare, the defence of our nation and, of course, the education of our citizens. But the more I think about this the more I feel there is no particular reason for government to go beyond the funding of the he public provision of education and deliver that education. I am not sure why government has to own and run schools. The more I think about this the more I am enthused by the prospect of government funding education while others supply it. Government has not been very good at running industry. That is why the former government, 13 years worth, did its best to sell and privatise the majority of major government-owned assets. Part of it, sure, was to get some income because they could not balance the books and were not willing to attack the deficit problem, as this government is willing to do. But, on the other side of the coin, they also knew that for efficiency, productivity and competition reasons, government need not be the absolute providers of businesses or services that others can logically provide. There is absolutely nothing to indicate that education should be a monopoly service. There is no reason, once government takes taxes from people and redistributes them by paying for education at all levels, that ment then has to be a monopoly supplier. We should think about opening up all sectors to increasing competition from the private sector. This bill ensures a fairer balance between the public and private benefits derived from higher education. I have said before when talking about this concept that there are millions of people in this country who contribute to the public purse but who will never derive any benefit, other than the social benefit of having a more enlightened nation, from higher education because they will not be participating. These people will go to high school, find a job and perhaps take a few TAFE courses or private industry training courses and get on with their lives. They will never ever go to a university, yet they pay taxes that fund the university places for those who do have the intellect, the drive, the will and the energy to go on to university to complete university qualifications. Those people who do go to university almost inevitably earn more money than those who do not. They derive greater benefit. Yet millions of our citizens who do not go to university help pay their bills. This bill brings a bit more balance into the equation, because we have asked students to make a greater contribution. We have also asked them to make a greater contribution in a differential sense-that is, by designating three categories of courses where the government and the department believe that, on average, higher incomes will be earned by the individuals who complete them. So those individuals are asked to pay a bit more towards the cost of their courses. That seems to me to be reasonable. It seems to me to be unreasonable to ask someone who is studying for an arts degree and wants to be a librarian in a public library on Public Service pay levels to pay the same contribution for a three-year or four-year university degree as a medical student, who will earn many times the income of that arts student who wants to go on to be a librarian. So it is reasonable that we ask those who will benefit more to contribute more of their own income in this sense. When we look at the total public benefit of govern- universities, we need to examine why we have universities in the first place. I would say that there are a number of factors. The first is that universities, as I was taught, teach their students how to learn. That is the major reason for having universities-to teach individuals who undertake the course work how to learn. It would be unrealistic to expect people to go through a four-year course, sit through class after class and lecture after lecture and read book after book, and then retain all of that knowledge in a secondary memory bank in the back of their heads so they could get instant recall of everything they learnt in every course they ever took. I can tell honourable members that I frequently wondered, as I struggled through the theory of statistics at university, why on earth I ever needed the theory of statistics or what I would ever do with it. In fact, I am quite certain that I have never had to develop a statistical equation from what I learned in that class. But I did learn a lot about logic. I learnt a lot about numerical logic, how the system of mathematics is put together and how one develops statistical equations, which changed a bit of my thinking process. So I cannot say that the course was not worthwhile. It did teach me how to learn. It taught me how to learn, but not necessarily each of the individual, discrete skills I may have used some time later in life. In that respect, the world of work, as we all know, is changing dramatically. In the future, it is unrealistic to expect that one would go to primary school, secondary school and university, get a job and stay with that company for life. I predict that 30and 40-year watches will go out of style, because we are finding increasingly that people are changing their career paths. They move up in their jobs. They gain a greater capacity and shift to another occupation, another career or another company. We are going to see this increasingly happen, as we have seen part-time and casual work increase rapidly over the past decade. So learning how to learn is very important. The second thing we learn at university is definitive skills. A university is no different from a TAPE college in that it teaches definitive skills. I can tell honourable members that employers around the nation are finally making an impact on universities. They are making them realise that their course structure needs to be more up-to-date and that they need to think more about modem, relevant skill development to make their graduates more employable. In that respect, I acknowledge and commend the work of the Berwick campus of Monash University and the Casey TAPE at Berwick, which are working together in dual courses whereby a student obtains both a degree and a diploma from TAPE. Employers will value those pieces of paper because they will know that the students not only have studied the theoretical aspects of the course but have been trained in many of the practical aspects. Those students will be employable upon graduation, rather than having to go back and do other work in order just to be able to get a job. There are, I note, a number of graduates in my electorate who have chosen to go to TAPE after they have finished university to get some TAPE relevant work skills before they actually put themselves on the job market. They do that because, when they go to get a job, they want to be able to get the job they want and they know they will be more employable. So I commend the Berwick campus of Monash and Casey TAPE for the work they are doing conjointly to develop courses that will give young ·people more relevant skills. Another area that we gain from universally in higher education is an area you could call thinking. In the education sector, we produce people who learn how to think, how to put those thoughts on paper and how to communicate those thoughts to other people, and they can do it in a better fashion than those who have not gone through some structured, rigorous, academic program. That is important for us as a nation. It is important that we people who are philosophers, who can think about the nature of life, the nature of work, the nature of mankind and the nature of our relationship with our environment-all these things that, in our day-today work lives, we probably never give two seconds of thought to. The universities provide a very useful institutional opportunity for people to think and to communicate their thoughts for the betterment of all of us. Many of our institutions are research institutions. I commend this bill for the increase in funding for research. We have known for a very long time that we have had a problem in Australia with Australian companies devoting enough of their overall turnover or sales to research and development. I have to say that I am pleased that industry seems to be increasingly concentrating on research and development. Some of our most successful companies are now spending huge proportions of their sales on basic and applied research and development to develop new products, to further develop products they already make and to make products they have more marketable to meet the requirements of other markets overseas so that they can help us address our balance of payments problem. That is very positive, but we still need to support academic research within our tertiary institutions. So I commend the extra spending on research. Australia has a long and proud history in funding public sector research both through the universities and through CSIRO, and I am pleased to note that the government has maintained its commitments and increased its commitments in that regard. Social and economic infrastructure are items which are also addressed by our tertiary training institutions. In the local example I just quoted you of the Berwick campus of Monash, we have great hopes that the newly announced public hospital for Berwick will be built on our university site and, over time, will become a teaching hospital. That will give the community huge opportunities to develop young minds, to develop training and expertise and new and modem medical techniques to work with the communication have facilities at the Berwick campus and with doctors and scientists in other countries. This will help improve overall our access to modern medicine techniques and our communications with other people who are doing similar work in the same or other fields in other countries. Universities contribute to the social and economic infrastructure of our nation, and they need to be supported in that regard. Notwithstanding what the member for Sydney had to say, the bill provides increases of $7 million in 1996, of $7.7 million in 1997 and $24.5 million in 1998 on the current legislated amount. While there is some decrease in funding on Labor's forward estimates, nonetheless the government is maintaining its commitment to the tertiary sector by maintaining funding. There is a dramatic increase in funding available to the universities if they take up the options of filling their funded places and then offering some more of their places to students who pay their HECS contribution. That contribution, instead of going into general revenue, will go straight back to the university. So where they have the capacity to add a few more students to individual courses, those universities will have the added capacity of taking further students and receiving the HECS payments themselves. The second opportunity is an issue that I began speaking about in this House many years ago, and that is a matter of equity. It has seemed to me for a very long time that it was totally inequitable that we would offer full fee paying places to overseas students but not to Australian students. How was it fair that, if you were born in the Philippines or in Indonesia or in the United States or in England, you could come to Australia, pay fees to go to university and be assured of a place because the university had welcomed you with open arms but, if you were born in Melbourne or my village of Berwick and you qualified to go to university but did not make the financially imposed cut-off, you could not get a place. The only way you could get a place at all to pay your way through university was to go overseas where the other students came from. How equitable is that? It was always a nonsense and we have fixed that. I absolutely praise the minister for taking that action, because it will give thousands of young people who otherwise might not have had the opportunity the opportunity to participate. I welcome absolutely the funding for 4,000 students to have scholarships between now and the year 2000, maintaining the government's commitment to those who come from low income backgrounds and who have outstanding academic qualifications to give them a real opportunity to participate in university life and in tertiary education generally. I recommend the bill to the House. I am disappointed that the opposition, the Labor Party, does not see fit to support the bill.",42
39,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"What a lame defence from the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) for what I think is the greatest attack which has occurred all of in this country on tertiary education this century. We have had in Australia a progressive expansion of tertiary education, a progressive revolution in participation in tertiary education which this bill threatens to knock on the head. All the member for La Trobe can do is come into this place and demonstrate once again his hostility to all things public, his obsession with the private sector, and propose that we have privately run universities, privately run schools and that we abandon government involvement and government commitment to education and to tertiary education. Many years ago we did have these things, but it was precisely because the private sector failed-it could not provide a decent education system; it could not provide a decent tertiary education-that government-funded universities developed. If we were to go back to that system, in time it would be the case that only the wealthy would get access to universities. You would not have standards being guaranteed; you would have a mishmash of standards. Indeed, the courses and disciplines to which the member for La Trobe referred, like philosophy and the courses which contribute to this nation's rich intellectual culture, would wither and die on the vine. It is remarkable that the member for La Trobe can come into this place and mount such a lame defence for this legislation. I think that is one of the reasons why his electorate will, in my view, be one of the first to fall at the next election. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 is a remarkable bill. It appears that it may well be changed before it even gets through the parliament. I draw the attention of the House to comments made by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, as reported in the West Australian of 24 September. It stated: · .. she may review proposals to charge high fees to university students studying to be mathematics and science teachers. The article said that the minister had told the deans of Australia's education faculties: · .. that the HECS changes first had to get through the Senate. It actually sounded like she was hoping she would get off the hook because they would not get through the Senate. But, if they did get through the Senate, the minister said: · . . if there was a problem with the differential fees, the Government would fix it. Senator Vanstone was quoted in the Weekend Australian of 28 September as saying: The Federal Government would reconsider its Budget changes to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme if evidence showed higher charges were deterring students from taking science and engineering courses ... The concession came as the vice-chancellor of the University of Sydney, Professor Gavin Brown, told students the shift to a three-tier HECS system was a ""gratuitous act of violence which showed a lack of understanding on the part of politiciansI hasten to add Liberal politiciansabout the impact of their decisions"". Well might Senator Vanstone be considering reviewing this legislation and these proposals even before they go through the parliament. In the Herald-Sun of 24 September, Senator Vanstone conceded 'there could be a downturn in students applying for university'. The Herald-Sun noted: Applications to Victorian institutions are down almost half compared with last year, with just four days to go. Since then, we have had a procession of headlines around the nation indicating just what a dramatic adverse impact this bill has had on student enrolments. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald of Friday, 4 October, under the headline 'Fees hike forcing thousands out of uni', stated: Thousands of NSW Year 12 students have rejected university as an option, confirming the fears of university chiefs that Federal Government plans to lift substantially the cost of obtaining a degree could lead to a collapse in enrolments. The Canberra Times of 5 October, in an article headed 'Fees uncertainty hits uni enrolments', said: A reduction of 3.5 per cent in the number of ACT students applying for a university place since last year ... The Australian of 25 September, in an article headed 'Budget implications emerge', stated: The Federal Government's higher education changes are already easing demand for university places, particularly from mature-age students, according to Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee president Professor Fay Gale. Professor Gale said evidence was emerging of declining applications in Victoria and Queensland, especially from mature age applicants. The Daily Telegraph of 18 October, in an article headed 'Western student intake slumps', stated that the University of Western Sydney: . .. has experienced a fall of up to 22 per cent in the number of school leavers wanting to study at the institution;says a leaked memo. The University of Western Sydney memo ... appears to confirm fears that Federal Budget rises in fees will deter disadvantaged young people from higher education. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 19 October, under the headline 'Students slump as uni fees rise', stated: NSW universities are seeing record slumps of up to 40 per cent in the number of Year 12 students signing up, with many university chiefs blaming Federal Government plans to increase dramatically the cost of getting a degree. Macquarie University has attracted 2,000 fewer Year 12 first-round applicants than it did last year-an unprecedented 40 per cent drop, the registrar and Vice-Principal, Mr Brian Spencer said. The University of Western Sydney's (US) firstpreference applications have fallen by 14 per cent An article from the Age in Melbourne on 2 October, under the headline, 'HECS fee changes hit women', stated: Prospective mature-age students, mainly women, are emerging as the main group affected by the Federal Government's changes to tertiary fees, with Victorian enrolment applications falling 13 per cent. Data from the Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre after applications closed last Friday indicates that mature-age applicants fell from 24,000 last year to 21,000 this year. Perhaps most disturbing is the specific impact of these rises on applicants in the area of science and mathematics. The Australian of 24 October, in an article headed 'Unis hit by sharp drop in demand' and 'HECS rises science applications', stated: The number of students choosing to study science at university has dropped by ""a quantum leap"" because of higher fees on the subject, ing to the president of the Australian Council of Deans of Science, Dr John Rice. Dr Rice, also dean of science and engineering at Flinders University, blamed the drop on the increased HECS charges for science and engineering degrees. Applications for science have fallen by as much as 20 per cent at some institutions. ""What the Federal Government has done is introduce a policy which is going to reduce participation in science"" ... Extraordinarily, the University of New South Wales has put forward the idea of subsidising up to half the cost of students' science degrees in a bid to halt the dramatic decline in enrolments in these courses. Once again, Dr Rice has said: Australia is starting to become a client nation ... [one] that only buys things that are made overseas, but it doesn't actually produce any of those technogreater logical goods ... that actually makes you a national backwater if it keeps going on. ... I think there are people who haven't thought it through, or those who don't particularly mind idea that we will be simply marketing agents [and] sales representatives. We have here a drop in enrolments as a result of this legislation, which may well need to be reviewed in the event that the legislation gets through the Senate. These changes will make Australia, according to evidence submitted to the Senate inquiry, the second highest fee-charging country in the world for students in public universities. The National Tertiary Education Union's submission to the Senate inquiry indicated that the World Bank recommended that students in public institutions should not be charged above 30 per cent of the cost of study. Back in 1994 the World Bank conducted a survey which placed Australia as about average internationally in the study cost for students through HECS. With these proposed amendments, we will have a situation where only students in South Korea will pay more for study in a public institution, according to that World Bank chart. The union has also expressed the view that these changes: ... will be destabilising, unequal in their impact, and will result in unintended consequences of some accordsignificance for quality and equity. Similarly, the architect of the HECS proposals, Professor Bruce Chapman, has said that the government's changes will have more potential to transform the system than any other funding policy variations introduced during the past generation. He is concerned that the government's decision to allow universities to charge undergraduates up-front fees for 25 per cent of enrolments could lead the higher education sector, in his view 'in the least desirable economic and social directions'. Professor Chapman also said: Without a HECS-type loan mechanism, the charging of up-front fees for 25 per cent of students will have the inescapable consequence of the Australian higher education system becoming one with an increased composition of the student body from wealthy families willing to pay. Moving towards up-front fees also means a entrenchment of the nexus between one's socio-economic background and future life opportunities. There we have it! There could be no greater the contrast between the Liberal and Labor parties than our respective approaches to education. It is Labor who, in the words of Paul Keating, are the enlargers; it is Labor who have promoted tertiary education opportunities through the measures of the Whitlam government and, subsequently, through the measures of the Hawke and Keating governments. Our vision of Australia as a clever country; our understanding that Australia's future opportunities depended on having a well-educated, skilled nation and a skilled work force; and our understanding that the life chances of individuals also depend, more than anything else, on the quality of the education that we getthat was what the Whitlam, Hawke and Keating governments understood. We were able to generate a revolution in participation in education. When we came to office, the number of students completing secondary education was just one in three; during our period in office we increased that to over two in three. It was not just enough to focus on secondary education; we also focused on post-secondary and tertiary education. Total enrolments at universities increased from 350,000 back in 1983 to some 630,000 this year, with the proportion of 17to 19year-olds participating rising by over 60 per cent during this period. That did not come about through accident; that came about through the commitment and the hard effort of those Labor governments. But now we have the Liberal view. They, by contrast, are the straighteners and reducers. It is not their view that education should be available to all. If you have access to all, diminishes the advantages which go to the sons and daughters of the wealthy in terms of their capacity to get a quality education. It is also not their view that we need a skilled nation. They linger in the past in this view of workers as having arms and legs-just being that pool of labour that they want to be able to use in the workplace. The Liberal view of education is once again leading to a reduction in participation, which is shown through the reduction in enrolments around the nation that I categorised. For the first time since 1983 we will see a decline in the percentage of Australians going on to enjoy and participate in tertiary education. The coalition, when in opposition, had something altogether different to say about what Labor had achieved in our revolution in higher education participation. Let me quote what Senator Robert Hill wrote in a letter to the National Union of Students in December last year: . . . the Coalition has be.:n very critical of the reduction of commonwealth expenditure in real terms per student following the Dawkins reforms. Of course, this is a matter of making education more efficient. Everywhere else you get criticised if you spend more per student on education or more per head in health. But here they say, 'No, this is a bad thing.' What was occurring was a dramatic increase in the numbers of students participating in tertiary education. The coalition in their document entitled Quality, diversity and choice-which has been shown to be a fraud, a charade-told students: ... the Coalition will at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities in terms of operating grants and research grants. They went on to say: The Coalition recognises that the significant per capita reduction of Commonwealth funds under Labor has had a detrimental effect on quality. This has been evident in overcrowded lectures, unworkable tutorials and inadequate libraries. The financial squeeze also has detrimentally affected research infrastructure, research training and research capacity. Overall, this has put at risk the quality of both education and research. It is little wonder that people like the ViceChancellor at Latrobe University, Professor that Michael Osborne, said, on looking at these quotes: It is difficult to see how even devotees of Alice in Wonderland can view these commitments as equivocal. We have a government weeping crocodile tears on behalf of those in the student and academic communities, encouraging them to believe the coalition were sympathetic to them and had a commitment to higher education. But what did the coalition do? What are they doing with this bill? You will find there are net savings of $2 billion over four years being achieved, first, by funding cuts; second, by dramatically increased HECS charges; and, third, by making universities absorb the costs of staff salary increases to the tune of some $200 million per year. This is from the coalition which said they were going to maintain spending on higher education. We are seeing the HECS repayment threshold changed so that instead of the threshold being $28,000 per annum, it is being dropped to $20,700 per annum from 1 July next year. Many more students and former students will be forced to repay HECS before they are earning the average weekly income. That, in tum, will deter a lot of people from ordinary families and a lot of battlers from going to university and enjoying the benefits of university education. This is part of the triple whammy on young people: they are facing something like a $1.8 billion cut from labour market programs, are facing the industrial relations legislation which will exploit young people in terms of the amount of time they are expected to spend on training and they are being attacked through the higher HECS charges. So we have a coalition which tricked people into thinking that they in the coalition were pathetic to higher education would look after students better. But what we find in this legislation are measures which will reduce the level of participation in nation on higher education, to the detriment of Australia's well-being and to the detriment of many people from ordinary families who will not be able to go to university. A number of I'eople in my electorate have indicated that they will not be able to afford to send their children to university under higher HECS charges, under that three-tiered HECS system where in some courses we will have a rise from $2,442-the present leveluniversity to $5,500. In each case we will have rises to $3,300. So this is a measure which indicates the Liberal Party's lack of concern for educatheir tion and their lack of concern for the needs young people to have better educational opportunities. I regret very much the damage it is likely to do to the future of this country. It will affect our nation's competitiveness, productivity and our living standards in years to come. It is a very short-sighted decision government saying that these budget cuts are planning for the future and saying that we not want to leave our children with a legacy of debt. But if we do not leave our children with the legacy of a decent education, their capacity for improved living standards will be very much diminished. It is not smart to say that we do not want to leave our children with a legacy of debt but then say we will not be able to provide them with a tertiary education. That is not the way to prepare this nation for the future. The opposition vigorously opposes those elements of this legislation which increase the HECS charges. We note that Senator Vanstone has already indicated that she may be prepared to review this legislation, so I urge the government to abandon this bill now. they Do not take the House through this charade which is already damaging enrolments, particularly in the science and engineering areas and for mature aged students, only to have to come back to the House later with amendments. I urge the government to withdraw this legislation now and engage in proper consulsymtation with universities, the academic comand that they munity and students.",45
40,Ms GAMBARO,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the this Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill. This bill is part of the budget process and further strengthens this government's commitment to higher education. The bill provides funding for open learning organisations, teaching hospitals and special capital projects. It is a bill that contains initiatives the not only for those students who are about to leave year 12 at the end of this year but also for people of all ages who wish to attend to further their education. Further education has become a must in today's world. Many employers encourage employees to update their skills, whether of through a university course, the TAFE system or industry related courses run by training providers. The higher education sector is very competitive. I feel for students in my electorour ate who at the moment are finishing their year 12 studies. They are making some decisions which will impact on the rest of their lives to have a and their future careers. I note that most Queensland universities do have indicated that there has been a slight increase in the overall number of applications for university courses for next year of upwards of five per cent and there has been little change in demand for placements for school leavers. The member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) and the member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin) quoted some dramatic figures. I must point out to them, having taught in the university sector, that first preference figures are highly speculative. There have been many occasions in the past when I was teaching when I would have no idea of my student numbers until second and third preferences came in. The particular figures they are quoting are highly speculative. I feel I should point this out to them. Our country's higher education sector has for a long time been a bastion for research and development, and the hallowed halls of universities have been integral to underlining the knowledge and skills of the most learned minds of this country-our top scientists, our medical practitioners and average Australians who graduate with a sense of pride and achievement. The importance of the higher education sector should never be underestimated. Universities prepare students with skills and great confidence, and they make opportunities become a reality. Universities are very much a culture within themselves. From the dress, language, lectures and lifestyles, a university education is a treasured commodity which should never be bargained away or taken from anyone. The higher education sector is blossoming into a competitive and marketable sector. There seems to be a move to offer students not only a quality teaching environment but also up to the minute library facilities, gymnasiums, sporting complexes and accommodation. Universities now attract not only local students but those outside the metropolitan areas-the state, the country and areas around the world. The education sector forms a very large part of our overall services sector, particularly our export sector. As the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) mentioned, Monash University leads the way in this area. Dr Ian Reinecke, pro-vice-chancellor at the University of Queensland, in a recent article in the Australian stated: The emerging full-service universities will have analysed the market structure for education, search and professional services and will know much as they can about their existing and likely future competitors. The vice-chancellor then went on to indicate the need for universities to have a number of characteristics, including the need for service differentiation, quality use of communication infrastructure, becoming leaders in information technology, and offering targeted professional services. Just as people need to make very careful decisions about purchasing motor vehicles or houses, choosing the right university has become just as important. Universities are facing up to that challenge. Now is a great opportunity for them to make the structural changes that they have long advocated. More and more of our institutions need to continuously structure and focus their operations to cater for the needs of students. The aim is to be leaders providing all-round service which will attract students, their families, friends and colleagues. The federal government understands the needs of universities and their students and has balanced this with equity and cost effectiveness which is needed to make this a very workable sector. I speak with some experience in the higher education sector. As a lecturer and tutor at the Queensland University of Technology in the area of marketing, I know of the work and commitment which is placed into higher education by students, lecturers and administration. It is not easy, but it can be very rewarding. I acknowledge the fact that university life does not just revolve around students themselves. Family support and contacts made at universities form a very valuable support structure in the community. Let me take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of all those involved in the higher education sector, particularly the teaching staff who work long and endless hours, freely giving of their time for student advice and counsel after hours and on the weekends. The Carseldine campus of the Queensland University of Technology is a feature of the Petrie electorate. Students can undertake at this campus Bachelor of Business courses majoring in human resource management, Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Social re- Science. The Queensland University of Techas nology is the second largest tertiary institution in the state and educates and accommodates upwards of 16,000 full-time students and 11,000 part-time students. It is pleasing to see that the operating grants for Queensland institutions will be 3.6 per cent higher in 1997 than in 1996. In 1998, operating grants for Queensland will continue to grow relative to 1996, being 4.6 per cent higher than they were in 1996. Furthermore, one of the aspects of this bill, which all sides of the House should find commendable, is the commitment to research. Undoubtedly, universities have a primary responsibility for the provision of research training and for undertaking the majority of Australia's basic research. It is my understanding that further research infrastructure will be most welcome in this area. The bill demonstrates the government's commitment to research by increasing funding for Australian postgraduate awards and collaborative research by $39.3 million and research infrastructure by $90 million. Over the next three years, this government is giving an assurance for a real commitment to research in higher education-$90 million will be provided to ensure the international competitiveness of Australia's higher education research infrastructure; $9.3 million will be provided for postgraduate research training, and the additional funding will provide support for a further 100 research students; and $30 million will be provided to enhance research between universities and industry. This is a very positive step. It is very rewarding for those who place much time and effort in these areas. I would now like to speak about HECS. To provide a fairer balance in the public and private benefits from higher education this government has made a hard decision on the higher education contribution scheme, or HECS. Payment for study and the resources provided is largely accepted. That HECS can be paid up-front or deferred are important options which this government fully supports. Under this bill, HECS will be altered to more closely reflect the cost of delivery and future earnings associated with different courses of study. The three different bands of contribution for HECS liable students will apply. This move, in essence, will provide a much fairer and more equitable distribution across all bands. Why should we rely on non-graduate taxpayers to subsidise the cost of higher education? It was interesting to note the comments made by the member for Wills particularly in reference to Professor Chapman's comments about up-front fees. In the past many students came to me when I was teaching at the university and said that they hoped they would never have to pay back their HECS. The fact is that the cost of delivering higher education will now be more clearly defined. There is no doubt that some university courses lead to higher paying jobs, and these are much more expensive to provide. It must also be remembered that students with a HECS debt and those involved in current courses will not be affected. Importantly, this government's initiative will alleviate the criticism that everyone has to pay the same fee when they attend a university. Furthermore, the move to lower the repayment threshold is another very positive step. But it must be remembered that students have a right to apply to have the HECS payments deferred where these payments would cause serious hardship. Lower income earners will not be disadvantaged through the amendment. It will actually allow students to repay their debt more quickly than under the previous provisions. I wish to alleviate concerns and make it clear to students and their families that existing students will not be disadvantaged. No qualified student will be prevented from entering higher education. The federal government has presented a higher education package which improves rather than substantially restructures the sector. Greater diversity and choice must always be paramount and confidence in the university sector must be maintained. Current university students can be assured of no increases in the HECS charge or debt levels for existing students and HECS liable students in their current courses, as promised before the election. A qualified student should not miss out on an opportunity to attend university just because that person is unable to pay at the time of enrolment. The government is bringing greater equity to HECS by introducing a three-tiered system which reflects both the actual course costs and future income. This government's commitment to research, HECS and its other initiatives, such as introducing a new system of merit scholarships, are positives of this legislation. The new system of merit scholarships, in particular, will open wonderful opportunities for 4,000 new undergraduate students from 1997 to the year 2000. The scholarship further highlights this government's commitment to young people and to those who are disadvantaged or are from low income families. This legislation is a benchmark and it is a strategy which balances the fiscal and education needs of the sector. It is a package which seeks to support and secure higher education well into the next century.",49
41,Mr SAWFORD,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"It is interesting that only four members of the government had the gall to come into this chamber to speak on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill and to defend the government's actions in its attack on university students. The great swag of new members, bar the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro), wanted no part in the government's action. Nothing on the record for them! Even the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister, who is at the table, was dragooned here, weren't you? Mr Miles-No. I volunteered.",52
42,Mr SA WFORD,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"And where is the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay)? Remember him? The member for Herbert said recently that rich people are smarter than poor people and so they have smarter children. This, he said, explained the high proportion of wealthy students in universities. He said that it is a reflection of higher intelligence rather than better opportunities. That is what he said. That comment exposes, yet again, the current of elitism which runs through this government. It is an elitism which is reflected in the range of statements and bills which have emanated from this government since its election in March. The member for Herbert's view is not a rogue view within the government. It is shared by many others. The provisions within this bill provide the evidence that it is not an isolated rogue view. It may be a subliminal view in some cases, but its effects are consistent and expose its presence. This bill further disadvantages already disadvantaged students and potential students from lower income backgrounds. It will deter such students from undertaking tertiary studies and reaping the benefits of tertiary qualifications. It will return privilege to the privileged. In this sense, the bill is consistent with the government's ongoing verbal and legislative attack on the disadvantaged. Witness in this context the extraordinary track record of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron). Witness the soft-shoe shuffle of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in his response to the abominable views of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). The member for Oxley's rogue views are totally rejected by everyone on this side of the House, but that is not the case on the government side as they struggle to come to terms with their former colleague. The attack goes on. Witness the strategy of cutting the wages and conditions of the lowest paid in the work force in the upcoming industrial relations bill. Witness the government's consistent attacks on programs designed to create greater equality of opportunity, such as jobs training programs under Working Nation which have had an 80 per cent cut in the western suburbs of Adelaide but only a 25 per cent cut in the leafy eastern suburbs. Witness the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), who, in this bill, is slamming down the shutters on access to tertiary qualifications for young people from lower income backgrounds. Under this government, Australia is reverting to a two-tiered society. The new financial imposts on students contained in this bill are inconsequential to those from high income backgrounds. That view was reinforced by the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro). The impost will make all the difference for those not enjoying the privilege of family wealth. The increased financial burden for students will hit in three ways. First, the bill raises the HECS contribution for all new students, including very large increases for some students under the differential HECS structure. The current rate of HECS, set at $2,442, is to be replaced by a three-tiered structure of $4,300, $4,700 and $5,500. This will raise $313 million from students over four years. It gets worse. Second, the bill lowers the threshold at which HECS becomes repayable from the old benchmark of average male weekly earnings to the second tax threshold, and indexed thereafter to average weekly earnings. That is, HECS liability is to be repaid on incomes above $20,701 compared with the $28,495 under Labor. This will raise another $817.4 million from students and graduates over four years. That is a total of $1.3 billion to be taken from students by the government over the next four years. This measure breaks the coalition's pre-election promise not to change the HECS rules for students already studying. It means an increased financial burden for all students-not just future students-and all graduates as well. Third, the bill allows universities to charge full fees for places above the target number of funded places enabling wealthy but less able students to jump the queue. If the government, at a later date, adopts its handpicked audit commission's recommendation that future university funding be limited to a capped number of scholarships, properly qualified applicants may have to pay full fees or miss out altogether on a tertiary education. The bill dismantles the equity of access principle that was at the heart of Labor education policy, a principle, by the way, that was seen as an impediment by many from wealthy backgrounds with inferior scorecards. HECS was introduced by Labor, but it was designed in a way to avoid creating barriers to participation by students from low income backgrounds. Further, the Labor government required constant monitoring of the impact of HECS on participation by low income students. Under the provisions of this bill all students will face major increases ranging from 35 per cent to 125 per cent. The new financial impost means that students will have to make an assessment about the financial risk involved. Many students may make the decision to forgo an education in order to avoid a crippling debt incurred by the dramatic increase in the cost of courses. Furthermore, the harsh reality is that repayments on the HECS debt will be required on an income of $20,701 rather than $28,495. For students from a high income background, this is not a matter of concern. Wealthy parents generally foot the bill for their children's education. Students from low income backgrounds do not have that comfort zone and they will have to reassess the risk involved for them. Under Labor, repayment was not required until the student had gained employment with an income that reflected the benefit of achieving a tertiary qualification. By lowering the income on which repayment of HECS debts is required, the government will be requiring repayments from students and graduates with incomes not reflecting the benefits of having undertaken a course of study. Those affected by this change include students who fail to complete a course of study and graduates who opt for occupations which do not maximise their income producing power. Students who leave an institution without achieving a qualification will still be liable to repay debt once their income rises above the new lower threshold, even if their occupation presents little scope for pay increases above that threshold. Remember, the income on which HECS will be repayable is a very long way below average male weekly earnings. The students who are most likely not to complete a course will be those who are unable to repeat a portion of the course and those on whom there is a less family expectation that they will complete the course. In short, this is an attack on people from low income backgrounds. Also adversely affected will be those who are working in low paid employment while studying for a further qualification. These students will be required to repay HECS debt on their current incomes before enjoying the higher incomes that qualification may eventually bring. Others to be particularly disadvantaged include those who attain the qualification but are not able to gain work in their chosen profession. For example, as the member for  teachers who have completed their training but are unable to find work as teachers and elect instead to work in lower paid, non-professional jobs. They will be required to repay HECS debts on incomes not reflecting their tertiary qualifications. Still others may decide, for a range of reasons, not to maximise their income producing power. There are still people in this country who work for philanthropic reasons rather than remuneration. A lawyer, for example, may opt to work in a community legal service rather than a legal practice but he or she will be required to repay debt on a very moderate income. As a result of the new financial impost on students and graduates by this bill, how many talented young Australians will simply give up their higher education aspirations? The signs are not good, if you bother to talk to current senior secondary students in the schools in your electorate. This bill is a perfect policy reflection of the elitism of the government espoused by the member for Herbert, in that they have most disadvantaged those from low income backgrounds. For such students, the attainment of professional tertiary qualifications may never have been an expectation. It certainly would never have been regarded as a right. In fact, some students may not even know anyone with a tertiary qualification. This is something that members on the government side simply cannot comprehend. Historically, people from low income backgrounds viewed tertiary institutions as inaccessible and remote. In contrast, the privileged saw tertiary education as their right and used it to maintain their privilege and their wealth. Under Labor, the financial accessibility relieved and the doors of opportunity were opened. Labor successfully encouraged students to complete high school and undertake tertiary courses. The honourable member for Sturt would be, I hope, concerned at the drop in retention rates in South Australia from over 90 to just over 60 per cent in three years of a state Brown government. At the same time, Labor used various policies to break down the inherent elitism within tertiary institutions. This was highly resented and strongly resisted by many within the institutions and within the then opposition, who believe that people from low income backgrounds have no place in tertiary institutions. The honourable member for Herbert is a representative for this view, and there are many others on the government side. This bill reflects that point of view. It reflects the cloistered, elitist views of tertiary institutions. It is a bill which puts up the bars around tertiary institutions, around tertiary qualifications and around tertiary incomes. It is a bill that turns back the clock and closes up the flowering under Labor of equality of opportunity in tertiary education. This bill will please some. It will please those who believe that universities should revert to being the preserve of the wealthy and the privileged. It will please those who believe that extending the opportunity of higher education to people from lower income backgrounds lowers academic standards. It will please those who believe that certain high paid professions should be the preserve of the privileged, as they were before Labor turned it around. Medicine, for example, will once again become the faculty of the children of the leafy suburbs. This bill provides further evidence that under this government this country will again become two tiered. The government is aiming to make health care two tiered by starving the public sector of funds. The work force will become two tiered by swiping away award protection for those who are most vulnerable. And education will become two tiered by this bill cutting accessibility for students from lower income backgrounds, while providing opportunities for the wealthy to jump the was queue ahead of poorer, better qualified students. Under this government, elitism rules. This bill epitomises the government's policy formulation since their election in March this year. So much of their policy is about exclusion. So much of their policy formulation is about punishment. All of their policy formulation reflects an elitist view. It reflects a complete remoteness from the problems and the difficulties that people from middle and especially lower incomes face. It reflects a view of the world without genuine compassion. It reflects an intent to drive a wedge through Australian society, to punish those who they do not like and to reward those from the upper echelons, from their side of town. This is a government for the privileged sector of the community, not for all of us, as they proclaimed before the election. In summary, this bill is a blatant betrayal young Australians' aspirations for fair access and participation in higher education. It breaches the solemn promises the government made to the Australian electorate. It forgoes equity, it forgoes access, it rejects inclusiveness and it promotes exclusivity. Under Labor, Australia's higher education system was internationally regarded as one of the most accessible systems in the world. And it had to be, because total enrolments in higher education grew from around 350,000 to 630,000 this year. That is some achievement. Over the next four years the government aims to cut over $1.8 billion from this sector through the combination of funding cuts and these dramatically increased HECS charges. In fact, it is worse than that. Salary increases of about $300 million are not included, and what about the $2 billion in fees that universities receive from overseas students and a consequent risk to jobs of Australians because of the idiotic and unfounded comments of the member for Oxley? This is the very same coalition which promised to maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities. This is the very same coalition that promised not to make changes to HECS rules after a student has begun study. Mr Deputy Speaker, we on this side of the House always knew those promises were worthless, but many in the Australian electorate believed the coalition's promises on 2 March. It may take some time but they will know better next time.  to begin by commenting on how peculiar it is that the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) and I quite often follow each other in the debates on higher education. Mr Sawford-I'm starting to worry about you.  occasion when I have followed you in a debate on higher education. But I must comment that unfortunately your contributions have not improved over that time. You do stay and listen each time to my contribution, but after listening to my contribution you have not improved the next time you speak. of Perhaps if you listen very carefully today you might be better next time you make your contribution. Can I make a few comments on the speech of the member for Port Adelaide. The first is that I thought that he decided to talk on higher education funding in the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, but then we had long dissertations on industrial relations reform in Australia and on the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and race relations. Mr Sawford-It was just one sentence.  ces. Really you should have kept those things to a more general debate, perhaps the debate on the motion to be brought into the House later today on race relations. Then I rather liked your Benjamin Disraeli 'We are becoming two societies in one country' effort about the fact that you say we are establishing two tiers of society. It is absolutely extraordinary that the Labor Party in its hypocrisy",52
43,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Would the honourable member resume his seat. Point of order. Mr Tanner- Mr Deputy Speaker, I think it would be appropriate if the member for Sturt addressed his comments through the chair.  amazing that, though the member for Melbourne has been elevated to the front bench of the Labor Party he is still trying those childish tactics of getting up during members' speeches on bills and interrupting them so that they cannot continue the flow of their debate. It is really pathetic. I want to comment on the hypocrisy of the Labor Party in trying to make the claim that because the Liberal Party has been in government for seven months we are somehow creating two societies in this country, when for 13 years the gap between the rich and poor in Australia widened very considerably, very significantly. I would also make the comment that under the Labor Party the rich got richer and the poor got poorer, but it took a Liberal-National Party government to make changes in the budget like a surcharge on superannuation on high income earners, and cutting off the Medicare private health insurance rebate for people on high incomes and giving it to people on low and middle incomes. It was a Liberal government that did that. It was a coalition government that actually had the courage to recognise that the gap between rich and poor was widening in this country and that we should act to ensure that that did not continue. The Labor Party spent 13 years trying to pretend that it was not happening while they cosied up to big business and to big unions. The member for Port Adelaide also made some comments about the flowering of equal opportunity under Labor and financial accessibility relieved under Labor because of their changes to the higher education sector. It is a known fact that from the moment that Gough Whitlam introduced free education to Australia-or so-called free education, because the taxpayer still was paying for itnothing changed in the make-up of students who have attended university. All that has happened is that some people have been subsidised outrageously for higher education over that 25-year period and those who needed support, who needed to be looked after, were not being looked after by the Labor Party because of some ideological hang-up about free education. The member for Port Adelaide says changes are now at risk because of a Liberal government, when for the years of the Whitlam government and later the 13 years of Hawke and Keating none of those changes was in fact achieved. The member for Port Adelaide also made some extraordinarily banal comments about the fact that students would only be able to go into medicine from the leafy eastern suburbs of Adelaide. Perhaps he has not caught up with the government's changes, but medicine is the only faculty in which Australian students will not be able to purchase places over and above the places that are provided by the government in medical schools-other than overseas students, who will be able to continue to pay for places. Even if you buy the argument-which I do not and the government does not-about the rich and thick being able to send their children to university, it is actually the medical school where no positions, other than government-funded positions and overseas-funded positions by private students, will be available, so it is ridiculous. He also tried to claim that all courses will now be filled by rich people from the eastern suburbs. Incomes, family incomes and backgrounds have made no difference and will make no difference in the future under the coalition government's changes. If you can get the scores to get into university you will attend university; it will make no difference to you whether you have funding from home or from special incomes. The government has recognised the importance, which you never did, of protecting people from low socio-economic backgrounds, rural and remote people and indigenous people by creating 4,000 scholarships for those people to go to university; something that you never did. I do not wish to speak for very long on this bill as I spoke in the appropriation debate on higher education in the main committee, but as the chairman of the government Committee on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs I feel I should make some contribution. After 13 years of attempting to create a nation in their own image, it is perhaps natural that the few remaining members of that former ruling class shy away from change. A baker's dozen in years was enough for them to put in place their required policies, setting up a system to suit themselves. Clearly, they are in no hurry to see it dismantled. Thirteen years, however, was not long enough for them to complete the Faustian deal craved so desperately by those opposite. The people showed on 2 March that they were not prepared to sell their souls in return for the free ride promised by Labor. Australians do not expect a free ride; they only expect a fair go. They sensed Labor could deliver neither and so they voted for change. Now it is time to make those changes. Those opposite rue their political impotence, but believe me, their affliction is viewed as a blessing out there in the community, something they failed to understand and that was underlined by the Lindsay by-election. It is time to move now to ensure that our higher education produces what it promises. The succession of Labor governments loved to use the yardsticks of access and equity and the member for Port Adelaide recognised this in his own speech. In most areas their policies on access and equity failed miserably, but especially in higher education. In that regard, ours was the vision that was embraced by the voters and I believe that the size of our majority is fair evidence of that. It is amusing that the Labor Party now poses as the defenders of the people after years of indifference to them. I would add that I imagine that the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) and the member for Port Adelaide would agree with me on these issues, coming from that part of the Labor Party that was so out in the cold under Paul Keating in the last four years. I could go on about their shabby treatment to those in so many areas of Australian life but today I wish to confine my remarks to higher education. Here are the facts: the system has not yet collapsed despite 13 years of Labor government, but it is rickety and it certainly needs repair. At its best, it has functioned only adequately; in government Labor occasionally recognised shortcomings in the system, particularly in the 1980s, but never took responsibility for the shortcomings that it caused. So-called free education did not produce higher education for all, merely a larger bill for the nation's learning. Then the Labor government introduced HECS, a fall back second-best option to the previously utopian one preferred by the short-lived Whitlam government. Despite HECS, education is still, in the main, sponsored by the taxpayers. If the system produces qualified people who work in Australia's interest then everyone benefits. The timing and size of that repayment is dependent on graduates becoming productive; they must be qualified and the work force must be capable of absorbing them. The Labor Party did little to ensure either. That academic excellence meant little to Labor members was clearly demonstrated when they introduced full fees for postgraduate studies. Rather than rewarding the ambitious and the excellent, those who would in the longer term be able to contribute more to Australia, they treated them as elitists and made it more difficult for them. At the same time, while they expanded the tertiary education sector massively they reduced per capita funding for students. Education was clearly not their goal; rather, their goal was a reduction in unemployment queues with babies and sitters posing as students and academics. This government is about making the term 'the clever country' mean something genuine. This bill heralds much needed changes in attitude to, and the direction of, higher education. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) has worked diligently in bringing all this together. She has consulted with many people, sought many opinions, and sadly been subjected to many more. Unlike her recent predecessors, she has the ideas and the conviction to bring about dividends for and from the system. Senator Vanstone has responsibility for portfolios that are vital to Australia's future. It is a shame that some are placing politics above people in attempting to block her initiatives. Mr Tanner-What about the Wright family?  it in the Canberra Times today about the waste of time you have been having on the Wright family. It must sadden some of the old former Labor reformers to see those opposite, like Horatio on the bridge, staunchly defending a system that fails to measure up in today's competitive environment. Education, like most things these days, comes at a cost. We only get what we pay for. Polls have shown that Australians are happy to dig deep for something that they believe in. There has been a preparedness amongst the Australian people to pay more for a better health system, to for a gun buy-back system, and some have offered to throw money even at the ABC because they believe in its importance. Because we believe education really matters, because we believe it should be more than merely a job alternative, we are asking students to contribute a little more. Our aim is to improve the system so that increased input will mean increased output. It is quite equitable to ask those students taking specialised courses to pay a little more than those who are taking general studies. The top 20 per cent of households derive more than five times the benefit from education than the bottom 20 per cent of households. Those students who will ultimately join the ranks of the very high income earners are subsidised by all the taxpayers, whether they are white collar or blue collar, rich or poor. Our changes to HECS are fair. They will not affect students already undertaking a university course, as was promised in the last election. The previous government showed no such courtesy to students, and to me as a HECS payer, when they retrospectively increased HECS three times in the last parliament. The previous government also introduced fees for students from overseas countries for places over and above government provided places. They did not, however, allow Australians the same opportunity to participate in that scheme. The coalition government's initiative to allow Australians to purchase a university place will not, despite the murmurs of the nay sayers, including the members opposite, lead to thick young people from rich families receiving preference over any other. Rather it will increase the scope for students to take courses in which they have an interest and it will bring in money to the system. HECS paying students will not be disadvantaged in the least. This is an interesting statistic which you might like to add to your next speech. If universities attract only one per cent additional undergraduate student load in 1997, if they increase it by one per cent of fee paying undergraduates, they will raise another $17 million in income. Imagine, if they get their pay full 25 per cent, how much money that will mean for universities in terms of revenue. One of the challenges of the new global economy is to be good enough to compete with the best. Our academic institutions must cut the mustard with the very best universities around the world. It is not enough to provide higher education, we must remove duplication. We must cut the waste, we must strive for excellence and ultimately be the best. We should be looking to the areas in which we can excel. It seems to me that with our extraordinary natural wealth in the mining area and so on we should be leading the world in training students for that field. Instead, people are travelling overseas to be trained in that field. Why should Australians have to venture overseas to obtain the best qualifications? We often force those students to go looking for gold, metaphorically speaking, and complain when they do not come back. While our undergraduate degrees are as valuable as most on this planet, it is the postgraduate level where we fall behind. Because of that we will be funding an additional 100 postgraduate awards at a cost of $9.3 million over the next three years. We will be providing another $30 million for collaborative research grants to foster links between our universities and the industrial sector and we will provide $90 million for research and for investment in new equipment for facilities. Commonwealth funding for higher education operating grants and research will increase by $50 million next year. Universities are being asked to find a one per cent saving this year. I am disappointed that the member for Port Adelaide is leaving during this debate, having indicated that he wished to listen to my speech so that he could improve his future ones. But to continue, universities must plan and budget so that they can find another 4c in the dollar by 1999. These are hardly draconian measures, especially at a time when Australians are being asked to make sacrifices for the greater national good. While we favour moving to more of a userpays system, we have not forgotten the disadvantaged, as I said earlier when I mentioned the 4,000 HECS-free scholarships. I am amazed that the members of the Australian Labor Party who envelop themselves in the shroud of social justice-particularly the member for Melbourne-ould object to this fair and reasonable bill. Then again, nothing surprises me anymore about the Labor Party, a party that is down, with its collective neck pinned to the floor by the heavy boot of its union bosses. If the Labor Party is to recover, it needs to listen to the people, not to special interest groups. The Lindsay by-election proved that people have still not found a place in their hearts for the Labor Party. As long as Labor continues to pull cynical stunts like running failed ex-ministers in the seat of Lindsay, a man who had been rejected only months earlier by the electorate, it will remain locked out. As long as members of the Labor Party are obstructionist, they must be content to remain on the outside, mere spectators to the passing parade.",55
44,Mr TANNER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Melbourne) (1.32 p.m.)The Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill is of great importance to me. As a student, I was fortunate to be in the very first intake in 1974 and was able to go to university without the burden of fees and with assistance from the tertiary education assistance scheme, or TEAS as it was called-the forerunner to Austudy. Many people that I went to university with probably would not have been there without help from the changes initiated by the Whitlam government. My parents were not wealthy, but given their very strong commitment to my education, I suspect that they would have virtually starved in order to pay my fees, had that been necessary. Many people in society at that time did not have the option of going to university because of the arrangements under the Liberal government, which meant that if they were unable to get one of the limited number of Commonwealth scholarships, and they were unable to afford the fees for university, they simply did not go. It worries me a great deal how, even under the arrangements that were put in place by the former Labor government, students can manage their financial obligations when they are going to university. It took me quite a number of years to clear the debts that I accumulated when I was at university, and I did not have HECS to worry about. It greatly troubles me that students these days, even under Labor's arrangements, have considerable difficulty coping with the HECS burden after they leave university, as well as with the debts that inevitably accumulate throughout that time. As a background to this debate, it is important to go through the record of Labor in office. That record is sometimes misrepresented, not only by people within the coalition, but also by people in the student political arena who are further to the left of the Labor Party. Although I was very troubled by some of those initiatives, and I even opposed some of them at the time, retrospectively, Labor's performance in overall terms was excellent. In real dollar terms, funding for the higher education sector increased by 70 per cent over the period that Labor was in office. Even if this is taken on an equivalent full-time student unit basis-an EFfSU basis-there was a slight increase in funding per student. The real story is in those two figures, and it is that Labor massively expanded the higher education system.  made some fleeting references to access and equity and alleged that Labor had failed on that front. The massive increase in the number of young people and mature aged students who gained access to higher education under Labor shows how fallacious his comments are. In order to estimate the true magnitude of this, you only need to look at the comparison between when I left university back in the early 1980s and now. When I left university there were roughly about 90,000 Australians who were in receipt of TEAS, the forerunner to Austudy. The amount of money that was spent from the federal budget on TEAS was about $150 million. That was towards the end of the Fraser government's period in office. Now that amount is approaching $1 billion. From $150 million to $1 billion, even when that is reduced to be in constant prices, is still a massive increase. The number of recipients is over 250,000. That is the outcome of 13 years of dedicated effort by a Labor government to ensure that access to higher education is broadened. It has expanded enormously. As a result of that, participation, in numerical terms, in higher education has virtually doubled over that time. In that context, the HECS system, in retrospect, was probably a justified change. At the time. I was not in support of the HECS system. I believed that it would function as a barrier to participation and that particular groups of students, particularly people from lower income backgrounds, would be disadvantaged as a result of it. There has been some study of the operation of the HECS system on that front and there is some evidence to suggest that, on the margins, it has operated as a disincentive to some students to participate in the higher education system. But, generally speaking, that disincentive factor has been relatively limited and certainly much less than I expected at the time when the debate was occurring. In the broader context of massively expanding the system and ensuring that the quantity of people in our society who can gain access to higher education is enormously increased, then the HECS system, I think, was justified. The age-old debate that has been revived by the member for Sturt today about the question of equity and about the fact that the predominance of people in higher education, both prior to the Whitlam government and subsequently, has been disproportionately people of a wealthier background, really has one missing part in it. That is, in order to achieve some degree of equity in the higher education system, it is necessary to remove barriers to participation by people from lower income backgrounds. But that by itself is not sufficient. The great fallacy in this debate is the notion that because these barriers were removed by the Whitlam government and there was no sudden dramatic change in the socio-economic mix of people participating in higher education, somehow this was an inappropriate approach and that we should go back to the old days of major financial barriers to participation. The fact is that the reasons why people participate are more comprehensive and more complex than just financial barriers such as being required to pay fees. But the solution to these problems is not to reinstitute fees. It is not to put the barriers back. The solutions are to do other things as well. Therefore, it is absurd to argue that, because these changes by themselves have not brought about a revolution in participation, at least proportionally, therefore they should be removed. Even though that revolution did not occur on a proportionate basis, we must remember that on a strict aggregate basis--on a numerical basis-there has been a revolution in participation simply because the total percentage of particular age groups, the 18 to 24 age group most obviously, that does now participate in higher education has increased enormously. That, by definition, brings within its ambit a much larger number of people of middle and lower income backgrounds. I tum now to the changes that have been put forward in this legislation by the government. There are three key changes on the HECS front and one or two others that are ancillary changes. The first is that the single rate of HECS of $2,442 will be replaced by a three-tier rate. That starts at $3,300 per year, moves up to a second level of $4,700odd per year and then the highest level of $5,500, which depends on which particular course you are doing. The important thing to recognise here is that, unlike some of the criticisms that were levelled at the former uniform rate of $2,400-odd, these rates do not reflect the cost of individual courses to the taxpayer. They appear to be based-and it is a very crude basis at best-on the anticipated earnings that individuals will achieve as a result of doing those particular courses. Law, which is relatively cheap to teach, is in the highest group. But science and engineering, which are more expensive, by definition, to teach than law and for which the taxpayer pays more per individual student than in the case of law, are in the second group. The second change that has occurred is that the repayment threshold has been reduced from $28,495 to $20,701. In other words, after you have completed your course-if you are fortunate enough to have completed your course-you start repaying your BECS as soon as your annual income hits above $20,000; in effect, as soon as you get a full time job. That is, effectively, the nature of it. There is some full-time employment around these days below $20,000 a year, of course; but, as a proportion of the total, it is fairly limited. The third key part of the change is to permit universities to charge full fees for additional places-for people who are unable to get in in the normal way-up to the equivalent of 25 per cent of BECS linked places. There are some additional factors that have been put into the changes by the government, for example, the 4,000 scholarships-starting off in this financial year as 1,000 scholarships, building up year by year to 4,000which will eliminate the need for 4,000 people from low income backgrounds to pay HECS. It is important to point out that those 4,000 are roughly 0.6 per cent of the total current enrolments in higher education. To trumpet that as some sort of magnificent equity initiative really is a joke. It is a very tiny, very limited initiative. It really takes back to the old Menzies Liberal approach, which was 'We are going to have an elite system for the young people from better-off families from the eastern suburbs of Melbourne and those sorts of areas. We will let in a small proportion of the deserving poor, the very bright working class. We will give them a help up. But we do not really want the vast mass of people from lower socio-economic background areas there.' That is really what all this is about. When you add to this a 4.9 per cent cut in funding for the higher education sectorwhich, when you put all of these things together, amounts to about $2 billion less from the federal government for the sector over the next four years-what you get is an overall picture of withdrawal of government from provision of higher education, withdrawal of government from ensuring that the largest number of people in our community that we can possibly manage get skills, get a decent education and are able to contribute to a different society and a much more vibrant economy based on high skills, high knowledge and sophisticated manufacturing and service industries. There are other changes associated with this legislation. For example one of the keys changes in Austudy-I remember the impact of it very well, because I have been through it as a student-is to increase from 22 to 25 the threshold age when a person can be deemed to be independent of their parents. Labor, to its great credit, reduced that threshold from 25 to 22 years of age. The government is reinstating that threshold, so that you are now deemed to be dependent upon your parents until the age of 25. What is even more ludicrous about it is that it starts at the commencement of a course and continues throughout that course. So, if you start doing medicine at the age of 24, you are still deemed to be dependent upon your parents almost to the age of 30. There probably are some people out there who are still dependent on their parents up to that age, but I doubt if there are very many. Yet the government is going to deem that to be the case. It is all part of excluding from the system you people who are not well off. It does not matter if a person who is from a wealthy background continues to be deemed to be dependent upon their parents. That does not matter to them because they have got money to draw on from that source if they need it. But where it does very much matter is for somebody who is genuinely independent but struggles to be able to prove that under the very restrictive criteria. In these changes you can see the resonance of the Fraser government's approach, the peaand-thimble stuff: 'This is all wonderful, it is equitable and it is more expenditure.' I remember very well that in 1976 Malcolm Fraser increased the level of TEAS from $31 to $46 per week, but at the same time he managed to drastically reduce the total amount of money being spent on it by changing the criteria, so a lot fewer people were actually eligible for it. What we have is a major breach of promise by this government with respect to the higher education sector-and, incidentally, yet another breach of promise in respect of the commitment not to increase taxes. HECS ultimately is a tax. It is a charge; it is it is being increased, contrary to the commitment made by the government. The impact of these changes will be, first, to alter radically the equation that confronts a person about to enter higher education. There are substantial financial risks involved and they are being made more substantial. Although it is assumed that higher education in certain courses automatically leads to wealth or high incomes, that is not necessarily the case, particularly when repayments will now start above the income of $20,000. That illustrates just how absurd this assumption is. There are many areas where people end up in employment that is not particularly remunerative, after having completed courses such as science, law or arts. As the expression of some sort of equity notion, this legislation is clearly absurd. Like all good conservative governments, this government runs away from the obvious. The obvious is that if you think that people on higher incomes should contribute more to the collective costs of society then it is through the taxation system that you do that. You do not use a random, blunt instrument on people, some of whom may achieve substantially higher incomes-but many of whom will not-as a result of the education that you are providing to them. Provision for full fee places to be offered people who are not able to get in by the normal course process will inevitably erode over time the number of ordinary HECS payment places that are there for students. Universities will naturally be wanting to get more people on a full fee basis; they will naturally push to get more of those students there. The government, particularly this conservative government, will in consequence allow the number of HECS payment places to erode. Bit by bit, we will see precisely what the honourable member for Sturt has denied will occur, namely, that people will be able to get in because they have got money and not on merit. More and more people who should get in on merit will be excluded because they do not have money. We will be back to the bad old days of the wealthy, effectively, buying their way in. I am indebted to the honourable member for a tax; Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) for providing some of the details that have been reported in the media over the last few weeks. It is very significant that we are already seeing drastic reductions in enrolments and drastic reductions in first preferences. The honourable member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) was quite right in saying that first preferences will not necessarily always tell you of final outcomes. There will be variations. Nonetheless it is very disturbing to see, for example, the preferences in the mature age student enrolment in Victoria drop from 24,OOO-odd to 21,000. It is very disturbing to see the serious decline in the number of people expressing a preference for science and related courses. Time may indicate that these concerns are unjustified, but the initial evidence is not good. The initial evidence suggests that the changes that are occurring in the system are clearly deterring a substantial number of people from entering higher education or from entering particular courses. The final aspect of the legislation, a most disturbing aspect, concerns Australia's economic future. One of the great achievements of the Hawke and Keating governments was the emphasis on the clever country-the emphasis on shifting away from our traditional reliance on digging things out of the to ground and sending them overseas, earning enormous wealth from that and redistributing it. It is essential for our future that we produce both sophisticated manufactures and services and are able to diversify our economic base. We are already exporting roughly $1 billion worth of education services and that could rise to $3 billion within a matter of five to 10 years if we can continue on the path that we are on. Also, higher education is a critical underpinning for our sophisticated manufacturing capacity and our capacity to deliver a range of other services. Already we are earning substantial amounts by delivering legal services in Asia, and that has enormous potential to grow. This legislation is all part of, ultimately, a mindless, backward looking, 'back to the 50s' agenda that the coalition seems unable to escape from. There are no intelligent conservatives left any more, it seems. We keep the diesel fuel rebate, we look after the farmers and the miners and the good traditional producers of Australia's export income and so forth, but we knock off the bounties for fast ferries, even though that is now producing nearly half a billion dollars a year worth of export income. We knock over research and development assistance, we get rid of a whole range of industry policy initiatives, targeted industry initiatives, and just simply go back to the past. These changes in higher education are all part of that overall pattern-back to the 1950s. It is no wonder that organisations like the Heavy Engineering Manufacturing Association are already complaining vociferously about the orientation of this government which has no sense of Australia's future economic role, which has no sense of the imperatives in world trade patterns that are pushing us more and more, if we want to stay a first world nation with a high living standard, into ensuring that we are competitive and have a strong product to sell in areas like high tech manufacturing and services. What we are now seeing is a very serious disincentive to study in all of the areas that are going to provide the base for our capacity to fulfil that promise in those areas. So it is being undermined and the structure of the Australian economy is being undermined and sent backwards in the long term on all of these fronts. The final concern I have is that this is yet one more step in an overall process in our society of atomisation, of user pays, of individualisation, of deconstructing everything that occurs in our society down to individual transactions, individual obligations, so that there is no social obligation, there is no such thing as society-as Margaret Thatcher once famously said-and that every transaction can be deconstructed, can be disaggregated down to its component parts and charged according to market imperatives. This is another step on the road to ultimate privatisation of the higher education sector. It is another step on the road to a reduction in total participation in the higher education sector, as we are already seeing, and it is another major step on the road to reducing our long-term capacity to compete internationally. (Time expired)",59
45,Mr MILES,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (1.52 p.m.)-I rise to speak on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. Just to follow on from the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), I would like to make one or two comments about things which he said. First of all, he said that this government has no sense of a future economic role for Australia. I must say that is rather laughable, considering the circumstances in which the government of which he was a part left this country on 2 March this year. When the new government came into parliament this time, we found that there was this huge debt which Australia had to work out how to fund. For members of the opposition to come in here and say that this government has no sense of a future economic role for Australia is an absolute joke. This government did not create the problems of huge debt, of a huge overburden on future generations of this country, for our children, for our grandchildren. We did not create that debt but we are determined to take responsibility for doing something about it. Not only that, the previous government had no plan for Australia in regard to providing for services such as higher education, and other areas of course, as well as no clear plan as to how you raise the finances to fund those services to our young people. There was no plan from the previous government. We do have a plan to do this. It is very interesting, in regard to this debate on higher education, that essentially what the minister has set about doing in this legislation is to put forward a coherent, integrated strategy which balances up our fiscal policy, or raising the money in this country, as well as providing for education. The equation has got two sides and it has to be balanced up. The previous government was happy to spend. It was a 'put it on the Bankcard' mentality, and let tomorrow take care of itself. This government has got a more prudent management strategy in which we are prepared to address how we raise the finance and balance up the budget. We are here to provide for services for our young people. There has been a lot of comment so far in this debate that the higher education sector is missing out. I want to say that in the electorate I come from, 70 per cent of our young people do not get the opportunity of going to university. Governments do not put very much money into the year 10 student or the year 12 student who leaves, goes out and starts to operate in private enterprise or in business. They get no help at all and that is 40 per cent of my young people. Another 30 per cent of my young people do get some assistance through TAPE education but not to the same extent as those going to university. What we are saying here is that those people who do get the opportunity of going on to university should make a contribution. We did not bring in the HECS charge; it has been agreed by both sides of government that HECS is a way of financing higher education and providing greater opportunities for more people to go on to higher education. We do have to fund it some way. We are moving at the margins for sure to increase HECS, but that is not the fundamental reason which prevents young people from getting to university. The real difficulty is in regional Australia and I know the Deputy Speaker, the member for Franklin (Mr Quick) would also know that there are students from his area and my electorate for whom the great trouble is the level of Austudy which is provided to get them into university. That is the biggest barrier and one of the barriers there is the cutoff point for eligibility for living away from home. It is very difficult for a family earning gross about $40,000 who want to get two of their students into university from regional Australia-even more difficult if they have got three students. I know several families who will have three students in university, or who want to go to university next year, and they will find it extremely difficult to fund $30,000 net out of a total income package of around about $45,000 or $46,000. You have got to take tax off that $47,000 and then they have got to fund another $30,000-about $10,000 per student-to go from regional Australia into a university city or town. It is an enormous problem for young people in regional Australia. It is an area which we have to look at and where we have to make sure that we establish a mechanism where students from regional Australia can actually have the same opportunity of getting into universities. Another aspect to this legislation which is very important is the amount of research funding which we are providing. In that area of Australian postgraduate awards and the collaborative research, the amount of funding is going to be increased by $39.3 million. Not only that, research infrastructure will be increased by $90 million. The previous speaker in this debate, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) was saying that we are not a government looking towards the future. This certainly contradicts that. Here is the evidence that this government is interested in the future and ensuring that there is financial assistance going into research; and research is one of those areas which is definitely forward looking. Contrary to what the member was sayingthat we are not interested in research in the manufacturing area-these research projects no doubt help quite remarkably the amount of research which is undertaken in the technological area within the country. Not only that, we are going to provide 4,000 scholarships which will exempt students from paying HECS. There will be 4,000 scholarships which will be called merit equity scholarships. These will certai,nly help people from regional and rural Australia. They will help indigenous young people have an opportunity of going to university and will minimise the impact of having to pay HECS because these students will be exempt from that. This is important to provide for those students on a merit basis. Not only that, $72 million of funding will be provided in this legislation to ensure that indigenous people in higher education are catered for. That is a substantial amount of money provided in this act of the bill before the House.",63
46,Mr SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Order! It being 2 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Balance of Payments",65
47,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer him to today's balance of payments figures, which show that capital imports are down 15 per cent in the first three months of this year, compared with the final three months of the last financial year. Given this slowing in capital imports and hence business investment in plant and equipment, does the Treasurer accept that this is a sign that investment will be weaker than forecast in the budget? Don't these figures mean fewer jobs and even more unemployment?",65
48,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was interested by the prelude to that question because, in seasonally adjusted terms, capital goods rose $62 million or four per cent in the figures that were announced today. I do not know who wrote the question or how you tried to manipulate the figures, but as today's balance of payments show on page 3 regarding merchandise imports in seasonally adjusted terms, 'Capital goods rose $62 million or four per cent to $1,507 million.' I think we can do away with the whole question on that basis. Rather than do that, I want to come to the gist of the question and say something about today's balance of payments figures. The current account deficit announced for September 1996 today was $1.7 billion, a higher figure than expected, although the current account deficit this year has improved as against 1995 when Australia had the highest current account deficit in the industrialised world-worse than Mexico. That was a long-term development over 13 years of Labor government, which drove net foreign debt from about $23 billion up to around $180 billion and left us with a permanent deficit on the current account required to service foreign debt. You would see in today's figures the current account deficit of $1.7 billion, but the net income deficit was $1.76 billion. In other words, we have a permanent current account deficit, which is the cost of servicing the foreign debt which was built up over the 13 failed years of Labor Keating government. As a result, we have that permanent pressure in relation to our current account deficit. Just as this problem built up over a long period of time, this problem will take numbers of years to fix. And in relation to the fixing of our current account deficit, it is the question of savings that must be addressed. At the heart of the problem of Australia's current account deficit is our savings problem. It is bridging that savings problem that is going to give us the structural improvement in the current account deficit. The reason this government set on a course of balancing Australia's budget was to deal with savings, to make sure that the Commonwealth government got back in the business of savings. After five years of growth, our predecessors had accumulated $70 billion worth of deficits in underlying terms-$70 billion worth of dissavings over the last five years. As if that were not bad enough, having created the problem and failed to fix it, we now find in opposition they are trying to sabotage the solution, doing whatever they can to try to knock off the savings measures that this government put in place. Mr Crean-You're knocking off.",65
49,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the case of the member for Hotham, it is a sabotaging of savings by making it optional for high income earners to pay tax. He is the one who has been grabbed by the tax avoidance industry, who is single-handedly coming around, trying to re-introduce the R&D tax concessions, a guaranteed return for a tax break. And we know who is putting the pressure on the member for Hotham to bring those tax concessions back: all of the people he was dealing with back in his days as ACTU president. Let us make it entirely clear that it is member for Hotham who is driving the reintroduction of tax concessions in relation to R&D syndicates, just part of the proposals of the Labor opposition to try to knock off, over four years, $19 billion worth of savings. Having created the problem, they could at least stand by as this government fixed it, but police. they will not do that and they stand doubly condemned. Racial Tolerance",65
50,Mr BRADFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Have there been any new developments in attempts to produce a joint resolution for this parliament dealing with the importance of having a tolerant society where all Australians are given a fair go?,66
51,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can tell the honourable member for MCPherson that an agreement has been reached after negotiations between the Leader of the House and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for a resolution that, with the leave of the House, I will introduce for debate after question time and will be seconded by the Leader of the Opposition. I believe that it is a resolution which expresses common ground on certain basic values and attitudes within Australian society. I will endeavour to pre-empt the debate or the resolution, beyond saying that. Abuse of Singaporean Troops",66
52,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Is the minister aware of reports today that Singaporean troops who are guests of the Australian defence forces at the Shoal water Bay training area have been physically and racially abused, including a situation in which one Singaporean officer has been required to seek medical treatment and in which two Singaporean women have been pelted with eggs and spat upon? Will the minister provide the House with details of these incidents, and what is the minister's sponse to the reports?",66
53,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I have seen the media reports. I am advised that a number of incidents are alleged to have occurred during the Singaporean deployment, including two of the assault and robbery, one of assault, one of throwing projectiles at a female and five of verbal abuse. However, I understand that, of the 51 incidents reported to the police during the time of the Singaporean deployment, only two involved our visitors. At this stage one of those incidents is being investigated by the Whatever the cause, we regard any incidents like this as an abomination and extremely regrettable. Those armed forces personnel who were the subject of these unfortunate incidents were on leave at Rockhampton, as you know extremely well, from an exercise that has been conducted up there for some time now in the Shoalwater Bay training area. We conduct a number of those exercises with our neighbours from PNG, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Philippines and elsewhere. Those activities have been highly successful. They promote mutual confidence, which is essential to regional stability and peace in the area. It is worth noting that the Singapore contingent for the exercise comprised some 400 personnel. They were personnel quartered in Rockhampton as well as 2,000 personnel who were out at Shoalwater Bay, some of whom not came into Rockhampton at the end of the exercise. We have found that the behaviour of those visiting friends has been exemplary. The reaction of the local community has been in the main most welcoming. An example of this is that on the weekend when two of those incidents that were mentioned were alleged to have occurred, some 15,000 residents went to two concerts conducted by the Singapore armed forces concert company. So obviously relationships are very good. We provide a very high level of support to the Singapore armed services through a wide range of training facilities. They will now increase because, in addition to training at rePearce and other exercises of the sort I have just mentioned, we have recently signed several major agreements and understandings with Singapore, including one signed by Dr Tony Tan and myself on the 21st of this month-Dr Tan is the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence-for the conducting of helicopter training at Oakey. That will involve the stationingMr Bevis-This is all history. What are you going to do about it?",66
54,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Do you want the answer to the relationship question or do you just want to know the police thing, because if you do, go and ask the police. Mr Martin Ferguson-Are you going to sit on your hands or do something?",67
55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question has been asked and it is being answered in a comprehensive manner.,67
56,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I am quite happy to show the shadow minister the details that I have. I then think he will understand why this thing is better kept under the hat. If you want to blow it up, then you will be adding to the problems that other people in the newspapers are alleging. We look forward to continuing these relationships with Singapore and others. We will be building on those relationships, no matter what you say. In response to exaggerated claims it is always worth bearing in mind what has now become Hastie's law. Hastie was a left wing economist, I understand. You would know better than 1. But he seems to have had some wise things to say. He said in the 1980s: In any society racism will increase in direct proportion to the number of people who are given well paid and prestigious positions to discover Immigration: Racism",67
57,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs why he has written to the Thai paper The Nation. What is the message to the countries, governments and press of the region regarding the government's commitment to a non-discriminatory immigration policy and its repudiation of racism?",67
58,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Longman for his question. I did indeed write yesterday to the editor of The Nation newspaper in Thailand because I thought an editorial that that newspaper had published in the last few days was totally wrong, was ignorant and was offensive to Australians. It is important that I, in my capacity as the foreign minister, correct the record when the record is so blatantly wrong. I have not, of course, responded to wire service reports from AAP and AFP and others or reports written by Australian stringers for Asian newspapers, but where an editorial was written in Thailand in such offensive terms I thought it was important that the government's position and, indeed, Australia's position was clarified for the readers of that newspaper. I will continue to do that if newspapers of any kind deliberately misrepresent or even inadvertently misrepresent the position of the Australian government and the mainstream of the Australian people. I made the point-and I make it more generally too, not just in the context of that letter but more broadly in the context of our engagement with our region-that this government unequivocally repudiates racism. It has done so since it was elected and as an opposition we did so as well. So this government unreservedly repudiates all forms of racism. We will not have a bar of it. That statement is clear and absolutely unequivocal. On this side of House, as I believe most members of the House do, we find racism little short of repugnant. The second point I would make is that we have a rock solid commitment to a nondiscriminatory immigration policy. We are not it. intending to change the law, we are not intending to change our policy and we are not intending to change our commitment. It is the government that makes policies, not Independents or others out there in the broader community. It is the government in the end that makes the policy. The government has made it clear that it will not stand for racism and that it will not even contemplate a discriminatory immigration policy. I have made that point absolutely clear wherever it has been raised in the region. Not only did I do so in the last day in a letter to a Thai newspaper which had made such false comments about Australia and the Australian government, but I did so in a speech I made in Malaysia on my first visit to Asia after this controversy erupted in Australia. I did so also during my recent visit to India. So the government's position is clear, it is absolute and the government's position is not changing. Abuse of Singaporean Troops",67
59,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I also refer to the alleged racist attacks on Singaporean troops exercising in North Queensland. Has the Singapore High Commission expressed concern to your department about these incidents? Will you advise the House of what assurances the government has given Singapore in response to their concerns?,68
60,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of the concerns of those who are affected by these events and I understand that the Singapore High Commissioner has passed these concerns on to my department. I would have to check to be 100 per cent sure of that, but I think he has. In any case, he would understandably be concerned. This afternoon, after the proposed resolution has been debated, I will be meeting with the Singapore foreign minister, the Singapore trade minister, the Singapore environment minister and deputy defence minister and also, of course, the Singapore High Commissioner. I do not normally like to foreshadow discussions but for the benefit of the House let me say that in those discussions I will be making it clear that, obviously, incidents such as those that occurred are deeply regrettable and quite clearly offensive. But more than that, I will be explaining yet again, to ensure that there is no doubt in anybody's mind, including in the minds of senior officials from Singapore, what Australia's position is on these issues-that we repudiate racism, that we have a non-discriminatory immigration policy, and I will make that perfectly clear. Research and Development",68
61,Mr TONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address my question to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Is the minister aware of reports in today's Australian Financial Review that a number of companies are threatening to take legal action over proposed changes to the R&D tax concession? Can the minister explain why it was necessary for the government to make these changes and what the government is now doing to ensure that worthwhile business R&D is encouraged?",68
62,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am glad to have received the question because it gives me an opportunity to point out where we stand in relation to the changes to the R&D tax concession. Under the previous government, the administration of R&D had been allowed to fall into total disrepair. For example, I am aware of one company which had applied for the registration of an R&D tax concession in May 1995. By December of that year it still had not received any response. That is a totally unacceptable position. This government, upon coming to office, set about cleaning up a very considerable mess that was in the department at that stage. The government announced on 3 June 1996 that retrospective claims under the R&D tax concession for the year 1992-93 and earlier had to be registered by 6 December 1995-in other words, the 'grave digging' concessions. This aspect of the proposed legislation merely confirmed the decision made by the previous government and announced in the innovation statement of 6 December. It was passed by this House and is being examined by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. Legislation to put an end to the much abused syndication program is to be introduced shortly. Mr Crean-When?",68
63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham!,68
64,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are the ones to sort out your friends. In framing its decision on these matters, the government gave very serious regard to the transitional arrangements that should apply. Those companies which do not qualify for those transitional arrangements will be eligible' to apply under the new START program. The IR&D board is currently considering draft ministerial directions which will establish the START program. The START program will provide very generous assistance to eligible companies. I look forward to receiving the board's response so that the program can commence as soon as practicable. NA",68
65,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from Belgium, led by the Speaker and the President of the Senate. On behalf of the House, we extend to our visitors a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Research and Development",69
66,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question follows the previous one: can the Treasurer confirm that the Australian Taxation Office has hitherto allowed genuine expenditure on research ·and development as deductible for income tax purposes? Has the Treasurer been advised in several executive minutes from Treasury that such outlays should now be regarded by the ATO as non-deductible capital expenditure? Will any change to the tax treatment of these expenses be legislated or will it be ordained by the ATO?,69
67,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In relation to expenditure on R&D, it has been allowed as a deduction where it comes within the ordinary concepts and that will continue to be the case subject to the changes that were announced on 3 June, 23 July and 20 August. The 3 June announcements were a clarification of an announcement that had been made under the Labor government to prevent 'grave digging' claims. The point about 'grave digging' claims is that these were claims which were right back into 1992-93. The reason why it was necessary to clarify those was that here was expenditure which had been undertaken where people had filed their returns a?d, several years after the event, were c-mmg back and asking that claims be reconstituted as R&D claims and that the accelerated deduction be allowed. Mr Crean-Why didn't you support us last year?",69
68,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That was what it was all about. The Labor government made an announcement but could never legislate it. Mr Crean-You opposed it.,69
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Botham is going very close to the line.,69
70,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In relation to 23 July, the R&D syndicates which were marketed by financial institutions gave a guaranteed return and a 150 per cent deduction. They are the schemes that made it optional for high income earners to pay tax. They are the schemes that the member for Hotham wants to bring back. He wants to bring them back for the most base of reasons. He has been captured by the people that enjoy that optional tax advantage. He wants to bring them back for the most base of reasons on their behalf. The shadow Treasurer is talking about taking the Labor stick to the big end of town. The member for Hotham is trying to reopen one of the most generous tax concessions that this country has ever seen, and the Labor Party dislikes it. Another ex-ACro president is sitting there smiling because he knows he could not in all conscience have behaved as his predecessor ACro president did. The two former ACro presidents, one from the left and one from right-the member for Batman and the member for Hotham-are over there, but they have very different views in relation to tax concessions and tax treatment. I say in response to the question asked by the honourable member for Curtin that there will be no change in relation to the constitution of capital or deductibles. They will be treated in accordance with the concepts that apply in the income tax act. If th-re i- any requirement that that be changed It - Ill .be changed by legislation. The only legislative changes that we have announced are those that I have explained for June, July and August. Australian Defence Force: Compensation",69
71,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Is the minister concerned at the level of compensation currently available to serving and former serving meIl?bers <?f. the Australian Defence Force and their families? If so, can the minister inform the House about the moves to rectify this position? Will any moves be made retrospectively?",69
72,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. I have to announce that today. I h-ve released the terms of reference for an mqUiry into the adequacy of compensation and rehabilitation for serving members of the ADF and former serving members of the ADF. It came to my attention very early on when I took on this responsibility that former members who had suffered paraplegia or quadriplegia were really questioning the adequacy of the compensation that had been paid to them. This became more apparent and focused upon when the tragic Black Hawk incident occurred in June of this year. I said subsequently that we would conduct an inquiry into the adequacy of the compensa- industries. tion paid. Currently, the compensation that is paid consists of a lump sum, through life care and income support. The question is: is the mix right and are the sums right? That goes hand in hand with the next question that the committee will investigate and that is whether compensation is better delivered via the Veterans' Entitlement Act or the military compensation scheme or whether we need a completely new scheme. I have set out in the terms of reference eight veterans' organisations that must be consulted, but there is the ability to consult others as well. The committee is required to look at the question of retrospectivity and whether or not it should be retrospective to 1994, which is the date of the commencement of the military compensation scheme. That report must be handed to me on or before 1 March 1997. Tourism: Racial Tolerance",69
73,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Has the minister's attention been drawn to remarks by the Queensland Premier in which he stated that a $12 million resort project to be constructed north of Brisbane is in jeopardy over fears of its Chinese backers that the nation was returning to a White Australia policy? Has he also seen comments by the tourism task force deputy chief executive that Japanese tourists on the Gold have been called names and had things thrown at them and that comments by the member for Oxley on Asian immigration threaten Australian tourism? What steps will the minister take to ensure that Australia's major export earning industry, which employs thousands of Australians, will not be further detrimentally affected by such ill-informed, naive and dangerous notions?",70
74,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of some comments that have been made by the Premier of Queensland and other sources. It is of concern to areas of the tourism industry of Australia that these comments are being made. However, I am also aware of the enormous confidence there is within the tourism industry that these matters will not be allowed to interfere with what is one of Australia's greatest When you see the export earnings and the income that that industry generates within the domestic market, it is quite important that we not allow ourselves to be distracted into arguments of this nature. I express my concern about this. 1 know the industry itself will do all it can to overcome this. Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism .",70
75,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Can the minister assure the House that there is nothing in his continued interest in the company Ralsten Pty Ltd which conflicts with the Prime Minister's ministerial guidelines?",70
76,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have thought after last week that those opposite would have had enough of these questions. Just for the record, all declarations I have to make under the requirements as a member of the House and as a member of the Howard government have been made. Superannuation",70
77,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. Can the minister inform the House of progress made towards the implementation of the National Commission of Audit recommendations in relation to Coast unfunded defined benefit superannuation schemes operating in the public sector? Mr FAHEYI thank the honourable member for his question. Honourable members would no doubt be aware that the National Commission of Audit report released in June of this year identified accrued Commonwealth unfunded liability in respect of public sector superannuation schemes of nearly $70 billion. Superannuation schemes that contributed to that unfunded liability included Commonwealth employee schemes, defence personnel, parliamentarians and judges. It has been the Commonwealth practice-as I am sure all honourable members would know-for several decades now not to set aside money in respect of the liabilities accruing during the working lives of eligible employees. While there is no question that the Commonwealth has the capacity to meet its liability in future years, the sion of Audit did suggest that the Commonwealth should in future fund its employer superannuation liability as it accrues. The National Commission of Audit also identified the need to examine the replacement of its defined benefit superannuation schemes with accumulation schemes. It did not propose that the total value of overall remuneration packages should be reduced but that Commonwealth employees should be treated in a similar way to the broader work force. There are two matters relating to parliamentarians' superannuation benefits which I believe warrant further comment. The first relates to entitlements of former members of parliament to access benefits before age 55. It is a legitimate question to ask why members of parliament should have different provisions from all other members of the public-that is, relating to access before age 55. The second matter relates to what is known as double dipping, where former members of parliament continue to draw a percentage of their annuity even when they take on full-time employment in some capacity with the Commonwealth some time after leaving parliament. On this matter, I see merit in the annuity being frozen during the period of post-parliament full-time employment with the Commonwealth. The matter is on the agenda for the next meeting of the trustees of the parliamentary retirement allowance trust shortly. I propose that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation take a reference and conduct an inquiry. That committee has the capacity to be a constructive vehicle for the examination of this important issue. I trust the terms of reference can be settled and that the committee can commence work as soon as possible, with a view to reporting in the first half of next year. I emphasise the government has made no decisions yet to change existing Commonwealth employee superannuation schemes. But the government is determined to fully examine the recommendations on public sector superannuation made by the National ComNational Commis- mission of Audit. Salaries of Chief Executives",70
78,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, I refer to your condemnation yesterday of the outrageously high salaries that chief executives of some of Australia's major companies have been granted. Is the Prime Minister aware of media reports that the new chief executive of the government's one-stop shop organisation, which is responsible for providing income support programs to Australian battlers, could command a salary of between $250,000 and $400,000? Is the Prime Minister also aware that the new chief executive of the government's public employment placement enterprise, which is responsible for assisting unemployed Australians into work, could command a similar salary? Will the Prime Minister ensure that appointments to these positions, essentially in the Public Service, set an example to the business community by not exceeding Public Service senior executive salaries?",71
79,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the other parts of the question is that I think there is a world of difference between a salary in excess of $2 million and a salary of $200,000-like 10 times. It is an extraordinary difference.",71
80,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"$400,000, $500,000!",71
81,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the Leader of the Opposition wants to wander into some of these areas, then it would repay the House to study some of the wage movements that occurred-from recollection, I did not condemn them-in some statutory offices under the former government. The reality is that in some areas, in order to attract a person of ability, you do need to pay that person a decent market rate. But there is a world of difference between a decent market rate and a salary of over $2 million. Youth Suicide",71
82,Mrs WEST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. The tragic issue of youth suicide is of serious concern the whole community. Would the minister inform the House what action the government has taken to support young people at risk of suicide?,72
83,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank my colleague the member for Bowman for that question. Youth suicide is indeed a national tragedy. The government's response to this issue was outlined in the national youth suicide strategy announced in the budget-$19 million has been committed to fund services, which will include the provision of rural youth counselling services, support for telephone crisis lines, programs for parents and training for professionals, health professionals in particuforward lar. It will also provide for the long-term improvement of services through the funding of research and aims to ensure that the media are cooperative in providing responsible reporting of youth suicide. This is in addition to funds already committed under the existing Here for Life program. Today I am pleased to announce that the government will be providing $6 million to support phone help lines operated by Lifeline and the Kid's Helpline operated by Boys Town. The government has offered each of these organisations $3 million over the period to June 1999. They have been asked to develop detailed proposals for my approval, which would include improving the reach of established phone support services, improving the coordination of referral tion and ensuring that the availability of services is widely promoted to young people. To emphasise the pressure being faced by young people in our community, I am advised that there are approximately 11,000 calls taken per week by these two organisations from young people seeking the support offered by these services. That is around 65 calls per hour. During 1995, one of these organisations alone received 3,000 calls from young people expressing suicidal tendencies and, on average, there were two calls per day received where there was an emergency relating to self-harming actions which needed to be resolved. This funding is in addition to two other projects announced by the government relatto ing to youth suicide. First is $1 million for the establishment of the Indigenous Foundation for Families and Young People. This funding will be used for demonstration projects specifically designed to reduce the rate of self-harming behaviour among young indigenous Australians. Second is a federal grant of $450,000 as part of the national allocation of $1.35 million to improve the skills of general practitioners and community health personnel working in the area of youth suicide. There is potential for youth suicide prevention strategy to influence the youth suicide rate in a positive way in Australia. I look to the support of my colleagues on both sides of the House in promoting the various initiatives throughout their electorates in regard to the prevention of youth suicide. Iron and Steel Industry",72
84,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question ""is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Is the minister aware that, yesterday, 250 jobs were lost from BHP Steel in Whyalla? Given that Labor, through its steel industry plan, was able to save regional steel centres like Wollongong and Newcastle, will the minister agree to the request of the House Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology for a reference on the future of the iron and steel industry so as to stop the loss of further steel services informa- industry jobs?",72
85,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"- Mr Speaker, I am aware of the recent developments at Why alia and Newcastle. An approach has been made to me by the member for Newcastle for a subcommittee of that committee to look at affairs as a result of what has happened at Newcastle. I have asked, as an alternative to that, that a consultative committee of members of parliament be formed which could travel to Newcastle to see for itself exactly what is going on in that area and what might affect it. I believe that is a better way than going through the committee. Literacy",72
86,Mrs JOHNSTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Beam them over, Scotty. Mr Tanner-UFOs.",73
87,Mrs JOHNSTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Exactly! Can the minister inform the House what informationOpposition members-Da-da, da-da.",73
88,Mrs JOHNSTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Beam them over, Mr Spock. Come on!",73
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Canning will get to her question or resume her seat.,73
90,Mrs JOHNSTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Can the minister inform the House what information has recently become available about the literacy levels of Australian students? Can the minister also tell the House why such information has not been revealed previously?",73
91,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Canning for her question. She has had a long and deep interest in this matter of getting literacy skills to young people in her electorate. Last week, I announced key findings by the Australian Council for Educational Research which showed that 30 per cent of 14-year-olds in Year 9 in Australia had unsatisfactory reading skills. There had been a stream of anecdotal evidence to this effect over quite a number of years but I think it is fair to say that the findings I announced last week have shocked many in the community. They have certainly produced very strong support throughout the community for the government's determination to address literacy as a matter of national priority. One of the reasons for the strength of the community reaction on this matter has been the failure of the previous Labor government to tell people the facts about the literacy situation in this country. For 13 years the previous government had access to key data. The community could have been informed. These facts could have been made available to parents, to small business, and to members of this parliament. The data that I announced existed in the longitudinal studies of Australian youth. There were surveys taken in 1975, 1980, 1989, 1991, 1992 and 1995. At any point over the term of the previous Labor government this data could have been analysed and the Australian community could have been informed about the state of literacy of young Australians. Effective policies could then have been put in place to address the problem. Instead, the Labor Party made itself, you would have to say, the compliant partner of the cult of secrecy to conceal this information from the community. It was, of course, their mates in the teacher unions, for whom they have been the persistent mouthpiece in this parliament, which encouraged them to conceal this information from parents and the wider community. The government has now directed that this crucial body of data be analysed and that Australian parents be told what it shows. What it shows, among other disturbing findings, is that the reading comprehension of Australian boys of 14 has actually declined over the last 20 years. The proportion with inadequate skills rose from 30 to 35 per cent. It shows that, despite the enormous amount of empty rhetoric over the last 13 years, there has been no improvement in the reading skills amongst students from homes where English is not the first language. Overall, it shows that the percentage of Year 9 14-year-olds who failed to attain these basic skills was 28 per cent in 1975 and 30 per cent in 1995, despite the expenditure of over $1 billion on disadvantaged schools programs. Over the next four years the government will be spending over $635 million on its broadbanded literacy program. I can assure the members of this House and Australian parents that this government is determined that this money will be spent in a way where the results from its expenditure will be monitored closely. We will ensure that young people who are seeking to be assisted by this expenditure actually will be assisted. The Commonwealth will be working very closely with the states, teachers, the Australyou Ian Primary Principals Association, parents and communities to make sure that the proper priority will be given at last to providing young Australians with the foundations for life-that is, good literacy skills. Gun Control Advertising Campaign",73
92,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I might point out that the minister is re-badging our programs but at a lower level of resource.,74
93,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will address his question.,74
94,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Given he has said that concerns about the award of the gun control advertising contract to DDB Needham Adelaide are a nonsense and a blind alley, will he now explain why he has appointed no lesser figure than the head of the Prime Minister's department to inquire into the matter? Will the inquiry investigate why DDB was put on the tender list only after the intervention of the Prime Minister's chief political adviser and why DDB was short-listed at the suggestion of his chief political adviser, despite being rated one of the worse tenderers? Why did it win the contract, despite being rated worse of the short-listed finns? Will the Prime Minister now reveal the purpose, terms of reference and progress of this secret inquiry and guarantee that its final report will be made public?",74
95,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As is appropriate in a matter of this kind, I have sought the advice of my department. Also, as is both appropriate and nonnal under governments of both political persuasions, the advice I receive will remain a matter between me and the head of my department. Opposition members-Oh!",74
96,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh! Big conspiracy! It is something really new! It is absolutely new, and an astounding rewriting of the Westminster system! Mr Speaker, can I tell the Leader of the Opposition to keep on asking the questions",74
97,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yeah, we will.",74
98,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is fine. The longer ask the questions, the more you will find that more and more people in more electorates will proclaim you to be irrelevant to the mainstream of the Australian political debate. Opposition members spent a whole week asking questions about share ownership, and where did that get you in Lindsay? A big fat down; your votes went right down. I tell you what: you may wave in excitement, but you know that the numbers that really count in politics are the numbers cast in the ballot box, and you drew a big fat zero in Lindsay. Salaries of Chief Executives",74
99,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, could I add to the answer I gave to an earlier question from the Leader of the Opposition. I point out that Mr Neville Wran, who was appointed chainnan of ANL, for two days' work per week was paid in excess of $300,000 over a period of 12 months. That makes the one-stop shop bloke look rather low paid, doesn't it? Drugs Mr ruCKS-My question is directed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, the minister responsible for Customs. Given community concerns about illicit drug abuse and trafficking, could the minister give the parliament an outline of significant seizures that have been made by the Customs Service over the last two months?  his question. Customs have in fact had a great deal of success in recent months, particularly in regard to drug detections and seizures. They have been responsible for 15 major seizures of prohibited drugs, and by major seizures I mean not less than one kilogram. They have comprised 25.3 kilograms of heroin, 22 kilograms of cocaine, six kilograms of cannabis and 10.5 kilograms of ecstasy. In addition to that, the member would be pleased to know that Customs have been responsible for eight seizures concerning the illegal export of currency. Those currency seizures have amounted to some $1.4 million. But the seizures in the last two months have gone further. In the last two months Customs, through their dog detector unit and in association with state authorities, have provided access and assistance to state and territory police forces that have resulted in 17 seizures of drugs and cash. Customs Coastwatch have also apprehended some 46 foreign vessels and five vessels suspected of involvement in the illegal entry of people into the country. I have to say that just yesterday it was reported that Customs, in a joint state-federal operation with the New South Wales police force and the Office of State Revenue, apprehended some seven persons involved in a scam involving revenue of some $6.8 million on cigarettes. Customs' involvement was based on the export and re-import of those cigarettes and contraband. Twenty-four locations were raided, and nine customs officers were involved in backup. The seizures amounted to $750,000 in cash, $500,000 in contraband and a quantity of firearms. I am pleased to report to the parliament that the Customs Service are working smarter. With the better risk assessment and the technology they have, they are apprehending drugs coming into Australia from all ports in addition to those areas in the Torres Strait. I might add as an aside that the Customs Service, on behalf of its agency clients, have also seized some five kilometres of illegal fishing net. The Customs Service is protecting the community and is making an increasing number of drug detections because of its risk assessment and the diligence of its officers. I hope the community and the opposition will recognise the work that the fine officers from the Customs Service are carrying out on behalf of the Australian people. Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism",74
100,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to !he Minister for Industry, Science and TourIsm. I refer to the minister's earlier answer. Can the minister confirm that he holds all but one of the issued shares in Ralsten and all of its 750,000 $1 redeemable preference shares? Can he confirm that Ralsten's principal activity is share trading? Can he confirm that Ralsten have in the last month engaged in significant share trading, including the sale of $200,000 Alliance gold mining shares on 23 and 25 October worth $50,000 and 5,500 Petroz shares on 18 and 20 September worth $3,700? Given that the Prime Minister's guidelines specifically state that ministers must not engage in share trading, can he explain why his ownership and control of this share trading company does not breach those guidelines?",75
101,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is back to the grubby old game of searching around the countryside. You got well and truly done over in the Lindsay by-election, and you are still at it. As I said earlier, the declarations that are required of me have been made.",75
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I call the honourable member for Wannon. Mr Crean-Supplementary question, Mr Speaker. Can he confirm the ownership of those shares?",75
103,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I have called the honourable member for Wannon. Wool,75
104,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I draw the minister's attention to the fact that wool growers throughout Australia, and in my electorate of Wannon in particular, are increasingly concerned about the continuing sluggish state of the wool market, which means for most that they are producing wool at a loss or at best they break even. My first question is: what is being done to arrest this continuing slump in the market? Secondly, what plans does the government have to restore the wool industry to one of the world's leading fibre producers?",75
105,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question, and I understand it is of real concern to him and to many other members in this place. There have been some six years now during which wool growers have been producing at below the cost of production. There is no doubt that it is doing immense damage not only to those growers in the industry but also to the rural communities that they come from, and it is of real concern I am sure to all members in this House. There are many parts of Australia where there are no viable options except that of growing wool, and entire communities are dependent upon that industry. Following even further slide into despair in terms of prices last year, on coming to government found myself confronted by a very dispirited and divided industry, one uncertain to grapple with its major problems, which it saw as the management of the stockpile and the creation of further demand. I set about doing everything that I could restore some sense of unity and purpose in industry, because I saw that unity and that sense of purpose as being prerequisites to tackling the questions that will determine whether or not the industry has a future. initiated two round tables involving growers, industry leaders, buyers, end users and retailwithout ers-a wide cross-section of industry thinkers, movers and shakers. As a result of their deliberations and as a result of the way in which the fixed released schedule had reduced the very frightening debt the industry was facing a couple of years ago to below $1 billion today and the fact that the stockpile is now down to below two million bales, we established that there was freedom to move in the management of the stockpile. This morning I brought legislation into this place which reflects that new found freedom. From January next year there will a relaxing of the fixed release schedule. I would like to place on record my appreciation of the cooperation of my opposite number-Senator Bob Collins-in this matter. He has gone out of his way to assure us that he will expedite the passage of the legislation to allow for an early start-up date next year. Attention now switches to the real matters of increasing demand, which is absolutely critical to securing the prosperity of the industry in the future. We do face major problems there. The under-40s in our major customer nations have a very low consciousexpects ness of the desirable qualities of wool. think of it as expensive and hard to look after, although they think of it as a natural product. workers? We have to turn that around. It is in the national interest. This is a multibillion dollar industry. Major efforts will be made in the next little while to focus carefully on market promotion and how it is done, ensuring that we have sufficient resources to do so. WIne the the government appropriately should be involved, we will be; where not, we will not I be. In many ways it is now a question of industry leadership picking up the ball and about how running with it. I do make a couple of observations. We have just signed a very valuable trade agreement with Mexico. The Minister for Trade, to Minister Fischer, and the minister for ecothe nomic affairs for Mexico, Minister Blanco, have agreed to an arrangement whereby we export tops and, with it, expertise from this country to Mexico. There will be no tariffs I applying to that movement of wool. They will value-add it and re-export it to America any tariffs being imposed under the NAFTA free trade agreement. Those sorts of agreements offer very much the way forward for the Australian wool industry. The one final point I would make is that we are exploring options for the early recovery by growers of their equity in the stockpile. There is likely to be somewhere between $600 million and $900 million to be recovered. We will look at all options for returning that to growers as early as possible. I know that on this matter all members in this place look forwarq to an early recovery for this be very hard pressed industry, the people in it and the communities that depend on it. Salaries of Chief Executives",75
106,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's comments yesterday and today on executive remuneration. Is the Prime Minister aware that his government's appointee to the Reserve Bank board, Mr Hugh Morgan, received a 26 per cent, or $200,000 per year, increase in his salary during 1995-96? Is this 26 per cent increase the criterion the Prime Minister the Reserve Bank board to apply in They assessing the reasonableness of the wage increases achieved by ordinary Australian",76
107,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am broadly awareMr MCMullan-Broadly!,76
108,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you are suggesting that the man in question is paid a high salary, you are right. 'It is also true that somebody you appointed from that same city to the Reserve Bank board is paid a very high salary as well. I wouldn't get into that game, mate, because you will get into very deep trouble. You will be right up to here if you get into that game. I have absolutely no hesitation in saying that the remarks I made yesterday about the need for salary restraint can fall where they may, irrespective of whom they apply to. Transport: Indonesia",77
109,Mr TAYLOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Can the minister inform the House of the transport sector achievements arising from the Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum last week and the opportunities that have been created for Australian business?,77
110,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. The AustraliaIndonesia Ministerial Forum of last week was a highly successful exercise for both Australia and Indonesia. On this occasion, we brought a large group of business delegates to participate in the discussions in order to take up the opportunity. of meeting their counterparts in Indonesia and also to meet senior Indonesian government ministers and bureaucrats. This was something that they very much appreciated and was an initiative of this particular forum. However, in the transport sector, there were a number of very valuable and significant outcomes from the discussions. For example, we agreed between ourselves and the Indonesian minister, Dr Haryanto, that we would establish aviation services within AIDA-the Australia-Indonesia Development Area-and that Australia would participate in the provision of aviation services within AIDA and would set up points within northern Australia from which aviation services can operate. This will be very valuable for both Indonesia and Australia. We also agreed that Australia would take up the training of air traffic controllers. Very significant numbers of air traffic controllers will be trained by Australian air traffic controllers and that will help improve air traffic control services within Indonesia, and between Indonesia and Australia. We will also be training Indonesian seafarers in Australia. Also, we have agreed to train the trainers in road safety skills. This is something that Indonesia was particularly interested in. For a country made up of some 17,500 islands, as Indonesia is, the development of fast ferry services is important to the development of the economies of those islands. Australia is at the leading edge of technology in the development of fast ferries. We have opened up opportunities for Australians to provide fast ferries and operate those services in the East Indonesian area. We will also be participating in the exchange of departmental officers between the Australian department and the Indonesian department. We have set up a transport working group. The contact group's next meeting is on 17 November, I think, in Darwin, just before the Australian Transport Council meeting. Dr Haryanto will be visiting Australia in December, and he will be holding business to business meetings and also meetings with Australian ministers in Canberra. All of this has been done in a spirit of positive cooperation. The result of it will be the creation of jobs both in Australia and in Indonesia-a most successful outcome, particularly from the transport point of view, as a result of that very good forum held in Indonesia last week.",77
111,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. Abuse of Singaporean Troops",77
112,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I would like to add to a question asked of me by the member for Kingsford-Smith. I had a recollection that the Singapore High Commissioner had raised,77
113,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,77
114,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a serious question, actually. If you want the information, I would suggest you try to take the parliament seriously and calm down. It is a serious issue. My recollection is that the Singapore High Commissioner had mentioned this question of the Queensland incident and Singapore defence force personnel. I inform the House that the Singapore High Commissioner did raise it, I think on Monday night, with the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at a reception they both attended. NA",77
115,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I have received advice from the honourable member for Cunningham that he has withdrawn the matter of public importance which he had submitted for discussion this day. NA,78
116,Mr HOWARD,RACIAL TOLERANCE,"by leave-I move: That this House(I) reaffirms its commitment to the right of all Australians to enjoy equal rights and be treated with equal respect regardless of race, colour, creed or origin; (2) reaffirms its commitment to maintaining an immigration policy wholly non-discriminatory on grounds of race, colour, creed or origin; (3) reaffirms its commitment to the process of reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, in the context of redressing their profound social and economic disadvantage; (4) reaffirms its commitment to maintaining Australia as a culturally diverse, tolerant and open society, united by an overriding commitment to our nation, and its democratic institutions and values; and (5) denounces racial intolerance in any form as incompatible with the kind of society we are and want to be. As indicated in question time, the terms of this motion have been agreed in discussions between the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). I want to say at the outset that, so far as the government is concerned and I am sure the same applies for the opposition, this motion is not an attempt to pretend some phoney level of bipartisanship; rather, it is an embodiment of certain attitudes and values that both sides of the House in the national parliament have in common. It embodies a number of notions which have been enunciated by me repeatedly over a long period of time. It contains commitments to the kind of Australian society that I believe in and have always believed in. It contains a commitment to some common Australian values which are held by Australians, irrespective of whether they were born in this country and irrespective of whether their ancestors came from the British Isles, Europe, the Middle East or Asia. It embodies a number of principles which are a proper underpinning for vigorous and robust debate that ought properly to take place in the Australian community on all issues. Whatever the rights and wrongs and the contribution of different people and different attitudes in the Australian community, it comes at a time when it is appropriate and in the national interest to send a clear and unambiguous signal, particularly to the nations of our region but not only to the nations of our region, of the kind of society we are. It is put forward to this parliament by the government and I trust also by the opposition not in any sense of apology, not in any self-conscious sense and not in any selfdeprecatory sense, but as a simple, direct and unambiguous statement of certain common values and principles. There are few nations in the world that can boast such a record of democracy, such a record of fair treatment and such a record of harmonious blending together of people of different racial backgrounds than Australia. Australia remains one of the very few nations of the world that has been continuously democratic for the whole of this century. It pioneered many liberal reforms in many areas. Its record of achievement in integrating into a very harmonious and united nation people from all parts of the world is something of which all of us can be immensely proud and something to which all of us have made a special contribution. There was a time when this nation was overwhelmingly made up of people, apart from our indigenous people, whose ancestors came from England, Scotland, Ireland or Wales. Successive waves of immigration, particularly after World War II, began to alter that pattern; although we continued to have a significant number of immigrants from the British Isles and from Ireland. Subsequently, and certainly in the last 20 years, there has been a significant flow of immigration from the areas of our region, from the Middle East, from South America and also small numbers from the African continent. There are certain landmarks along that path of development. The abolition of the White Australia Policy in 1966 under the Liberal prime ministership of Harold Holt represented a very significant cultural and attitudinal change on the part of the Australian people. I accept that it was supported at the time by people across the political spectrum. I also accept that it was not at that time greeted with universal acclaim but I believe it gradually won very strong acceptance. I remain very proud of the fact that I was a member of the coalition government led by Malcolm Fraser which, in the late 1970s, chose to admit to this country tens of thousands of people from war-tom Indochina; so much so that Australia on a per capita basis took more Indochinese refugees than any nation in the world. It is worth repeating that: Australia took more Indochinese refugees on a per capita basis than any other nation in the world. I repeated that because on occasions I hear voices saying that we have a past which in these areas is totally bigoted and prejudiced. The reality is that, on that occasion, we demonstrated a passion and a willingness to accept and absorb, which was an example to the rest of the world and something of which all Australians should feel particularly proud. Inevitably, the character of Australia has changed as a result of this migration. Much of that change has been profoundly beneficial. I think this country owes an enormous debt to people that have chosen this as their homepeople who have come from the four comers of the world. When I returned to the leadership of the Liberal Party on 31 January 1995, one of the things I said was that the policies that we would put together would be guided, in certain respects, by a belief that Australia was composed of people drawn from all parts of the world but united behind a common commitment to the values, beliefs and institutions of the Australian community. We can within our ranks have legitimate debate about the size of our immigration program. There is a different attitude towards immigration now than there was in the 1950s and 1960s. All of us, whatever our political views, should take account of that. You cannot isolate the sense of insecurity and anxiety that people at a time of relatively high unemployment feel from considerations of levels of immigration. There is a legitimate debate to be had as to whether or not we should have more or less immigration. I think that debate should go on in a calm, rational and intelligent fashion. It is natural that people, particularly those who feel themselves at the sharp end of challenge and anxiety in industries that have seen extensive job losses, should feel some sense of anxiety about immigration levels. It is the obligation of all of us to understand that. It is our obligation to point out, where it is appropriate, the error in their understanding of the causation between immigration and job security. But it is also our responsibility to involve them in the debate. It is never appropriate for us, as I think on both sides of the House in the past we have tended to do, to take the attitude towards the Australian community: after all, this is really a little bit too hard for you to understand; leave it to us; we will make the decision on your behalf. Some of the difficulties and some of the resentments that we have seen in recent times are as a direct result of many Australians feeling that there is in some sense a political elite in this community-and that political elite has been composed of people from both sides-that has denied to the people of the Australian community a right to participate. This motion is about saying to the Australian people and to the nations of the region that we are a tolerant society; we are a compassionate society; we are a society that has demonstrated our credentials so far as the absorption of people from all around the world is concerned, in a fashion that entitles us to feel extremely proud about our past. It is also a statement of some fundamental beliefs about the nature of our existence as human beings in Australia: the very strong belief that people should always be judged on their individual worth and merit, on their character and behaviour, and on what they do for their fellow man and not on the basis of their ethnic origin, the colour of their skin, their religious beliefs or their lack of religious beliefs, or where they may happen to have been born. Any notion that anybody in this country entertains that it is in the moral, political or economic interests-and I put them deliberately in that order-of Australia to return to anything approaching the White Australia policy I think is profoundly wrong. That is a view that my government enunciated when it came to power; it is a view I enunciated when I became the Leader of the Opposition in January last year and I believe that, soberly explained and properly understood and put in the context of some of the things that I have said earlier in this speech, it is something that on reflection the great majority of the Australian people will accept. It is an obligation on all of us to put that view calmly and in an understanding fashion. This motion also says something about our attitude towards the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia, the original Australians and first inhabitants of this continent of ours, however one would wish to describe it. There will continue to be debate and there will continue to be sharp differences of opinion between the government and the Australian Labor Party about the appropriate policies to respond to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.",78
117,Mr CAMPBELL,RACIAL TOLERANCE,"No, there won't.",80
118,Mr HOWARD,RACIAL TOLERANCE,"There will be-and that is as it should be. But I think we can agree on one or two things. We can agree that as an identifiable group the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are the most profoundly disadvantaged within our midst. That is something I have said not just for the first time and it will not be the last time. I say it; it is a view I have expressed before. I do believe, as I know the opposition believes, in a process of reconciliation. We will have our different views as to what reconciliation represents. To me, the most effective way to achieve reconciliation is to address current disadvantage in areas such as health, housing and education. I do not believe, and I have always strongly rejected, notions of intergenerational guilt. I regret as an Australian the appalling way in which members of the indigenous community have been treated in the past and I believe the truth about what occurred in our history should be taught in an unvarnished fashion. But could I also say that I profoundly reject with the same vigour what others have described, and I have adopted the description, as the black armband view of Australian history. I believe the balance sheet of Australian history is a very generous and benign one. I believe that, like any other nation, we have black marks upon our history but amongst the nations of the world we have a remarkably positive history. I think there is a yearning in the Australian community right across the political divide for its leaders to enunciate more pride and sense of achievement in what has gone before us. I think we have been too apologetic about our history in the past. I think we have been far too self-conscious about what this country has achieved and I believe it is tremendously important that we understand, particularly as we approach the centenary of the Federation of Australia, that the Australian achievement has been a heroic one, a courageous one and a humanitarian one. Any attempts to denigrate that achievement I believe will derive the justifiable ire and criticism of the Australian community, however people may lie in the political spectrum. There has been some talk in recent weeks about the way in which political debate should be conducted in this country. I have said before, and I am happy to repeat it, that I do believe that in recent times there has been a tendency towards excessive political correctness in political debate in this country. There will be those opposite who will disagree with that. I naturally accept their perfect right to express that disagreement and put their point of view. I think the way some people in the Australian community have reacted to the debate of recent weeks, and the way advice has been given to me and to others as to the precise way in which I should respond to particular comments, has demonstrated an absolute obsession with the form rather than the substance of the debate. I think there has been a wholly disproportionate reaction by too many people in too many areas of Australian society to one particular speech. I find it rather interesting that I pick up the newspapers, I watch the television, I listen to the radio and I hear constant talk about the deeply divisive debate on immigration which is going on within the Australian community. Yet I learn on the morning after the Lindsay by-election that Australians Against Further Immigration received a little over six per cent of the primary vote in the electorate of Lindsay. If ever AAFI were to have a hope of scoring a high result, it was in the Lindsay by-election. Yet the result was that the party polled a derisory share of the popular vote. I think it does say something about the maturity of the Australian people. It demonstrates the ill wisdom of any attempts by any of us to deny the Australian people the courtesy of accepting that they can debate and understand things in a mature and open fashion. Every time we treat them in that patronising fashion, they will demonstrate their great maturity and their great understanding. Two other things that I want to say, I want to say very directly to Australians of Asian descent: so far as the government of this country is concerned, those Australians of Asian descent are as honoured citizens as any other section of the Australian community. People of the Asian communities have contributed very greatly to the enrichment of our life. They have brought their values of the extended family, they have brought their values of hard work, they have brought their values of commitment to small business and entrepreneurial flair and their infectious vigour in so many other areas to our shores, and particularly, but not only, of course, in my own home city of Sydney they have made a very significant mark on the life and the activities of that city. They number amongst their ranks like any other section of the Australian communitypeople whose views we mayor may not share. But it is important that we remember that relations between people have a deeply personal character. Insensitive remarks, hurts, insults and intemperately made generalisations can inflict enormous personal hurt and damage on individuals. A few weeks ago I made a speech to the Queensland division of the Liberal Party, which subsequently attracted some attention. I do not recant, retract or take away one syllable of what I said during that speech. I might be permitted to say something to the House about that speech. I remind the House that, having said that I believed we had entered an era of clear and more open debate in the Australian community, I supported the right of Australians to participate in a vigorous fashion in open political debate. I then went on to say: . .. that freedom of speech carries with it a responsibility on all of those who exercise that freedom to do so in a tolerant and moderate fashion and to not convert the new-found freedom, if I may put it that way, into a vehicle for using needlessly insensitive and intolerant language. It is a caveat and an injunction that I think all members of this House should follow and observe. I hope that this motion attracts the support of everyone in this chamber, because it does reflect, despite our profound political differences, including on some of the issues I have canvassed in my speech, the common assent of the members of the national parliament of Australia to some very important and fundamental human values.",80
119,Mr BEAZLEY,RACIAL TOLERANCE,"The opposition supports this motion. It has been negotiated, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) indicates, between the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) for some time now. It followed the withdrawal of a motion I put down several weeks ago in this chamber dealing with a similar matter. Naturally, as a motion which has been arrived at on the basis of an agreement between the two sides of this House, not all that either side might have liked-and that applies to us-is contained within the motion. Nevertheless, what is there is very good indeed. What is there is an absolutely essential statement by this parliament at this point in our history and at this point in the debate on the matters to which the Prime Minister referred. Therefore, it deserves the optimal possible support from both sides of the House when a vote is ultimately taken on it. The motion is very significant because if it is carried it means the national parliament will insist that an absolutely essential ingredient take its place in the current community discussion about racism and multiculturalism in this society. This ingredient is leadership by us at the national level. Without it, the discussion will go down ugly and destructive paths. Without national leadership, given the discussion on these issues by governments from both sides of the political divide for the last 30 years, we would never have grown into the tolerant, fair, decent and fundamentally democratic society that we are today. We always have been a democratic society. Even at points when we had very different views about immigration to those which we hold now and when a very different standard of treatment was applied to the Aboriginal population than that which is applied now, Australia has had a proud democratic tradition. There is still a version of ballot which is described around the world as the 'Australian ballot'. It is the process by which most countries which are democratic undertake their elections. At the time of our Federation we were seen as an experimental nation; indeed, we were seen as so experimental that Lenin felt it necessary to devote a pamphlet to attacking the Australian Labor Party, so attractive was its example in international socialist Europe, and largely coming off the sorts of propositions that were put here. I make those points to make this point clear: for well over 100 years, freedom of speech has never been an issue in this country. I do not know what political correctness is supposed to mean. I think it means the prevailing majority of opinion at any time. I suspect that that is what political correctness means, if it means anything at all. I think the problem with juxtaposing two propositionsfreedom of speech versus political correctness-has had the unfortunate impact on this debate of causing a number of people in our community to take the view that what was always unacceptable under free speech is now acceptable and, therefore, can be expressed. There are a large number of people who have become victims of that in this country as a result of that perception. Since World War II, we have received a massive influx of new citizens bringing with them a wide range of cultures. Over this period, we have progressed from what used to be an inward looking society. Each new intake of people brought with it a new culture that enriched and sustained our community. We have now become a society in which all these different cultures are not just accommodated but celebrated. But each time each new wave of migrants came in-whether they were from southern Europe, eastern Europe, the Middle East and now more recently from Asia-there has been a requirement on the political leadership in this country to point out the advantage; to mould, insofar as we can, and without arrogance, community opinion that makes it acceptable and ensures that the community sustains its tolerant and decent traditions. There has been that requirement constantly upon us for leadership. Over this same period, our attitudes have changed to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It cannot be said that we have completely in this parliament successfully discharged the responsibility given to the government by the 1967 referendum. But much has been achieved to give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people their honoured place in the development of Australia as a affairs in decent nation. It is 30 years since the coalition parties and we ourselves, then in opposition, wiped our platforms clean of the phrase 'White Australia'. It is more than 20 years now since the concept of White Australia was finally abolished in any implication from official government policy. It is 20 years since the Fraser government enacted the Northern Territory land rights legislation, based on propositions originally moved in the time when Gough Whitlam was in government. I might say that it is now something like 45 years since my father moved land rights onto the Labor Party platform. It is more than 20 years since the Whitlam government embraced the concept of a multicultural Australia. In these periods of time we have, I do believe, much to be very proud of. But it has to be said that these are new initiatives and new things because treatment and attitudes were different before then. In the discussion of our history these must be completely understood by all people in our society. If every person in this society is going to be entitled to their culture, they are also going to be entitled to their history. I think we need to comprehend in the fullness the nature of that history and what its true character is. Some of that will require us in this generation to pass judgment, whether we like it or not, on what was and was not acceptable about policy in the past. Probably in no area is that more necessary than in relations with the Aboriginal community-and this is a central part of the reconciliation process. I have my own disagreements with some of the current teaching in relation to past racial relations and Aboriginal questions that now form part of the school curriculum, and I do not intend to bore the parliament with those at this time. But I do think that if you look realistically at Aboriginal people you have to qualify the notion of settlement, you have to include the question of invasion, and they are entitled to the dignity of resistance. I am delighted to see that in the recent Oxford Companion to Australian Military History there is now an excellent section dealing with Aboriginal resistance. I hope that those issues come into the curriculums and are thoroughly understood. It is an interesting part of our history and it is a part of our history that we do need to understand. We have made some very substantial changes. I mention those changes with pride as an Australian. They have been critical to our developing a decent society and they are critical for our future. They are also critical for our relationship with the region around us. This has happened really just in time. We were really shut out of our traditional markets in the 1960s, or our entry to them was made very difficult indeed. Successive governments have struck out of the embrace of those traditional markets and the lock-step relationship that we had with them to build a very substantial trading posture for this nation. But it is being built in the region around us. Over the last 13 years we have had a much more significant proportion of our GDP in exports. In gaining that situation, virtually all of that increase has been a product of our successful penetration of markets in the region around us. Along the way we have been able to present to those societies the notion that we are a decent, hospitable society with an honoured place in the global community. Through such policies that we have been talking about here today and others, which include support for the elimination of apartheid in South Africa, we on this side of the House were quick to recognise the role played in this by former Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser. That position was confirmed and continued by the Hawke and Keating governments and produced that moving and magnificent visit by Nelson Mandela here in his new position in a changed South Africa. These changes have been critical to the solidity and strength of our relationship with the rest of the region. We have grown into the sort of society which our neighbours are proud to be associated with and with which they are happy to trade. Of course, we have to be realistic. One of the reasons we are a decent society is that we are a pluralistic society, and not everybody agrees with the path that we have taken. But when those views are as false and destructive as some of those which have been put about lately they have to be answered and dealt with in detail. However great the disagreement, we have to preserve our climate of tolerance. When people are abused in public places, it is time for government, for people in authority, to step in and beat the bounds. That is what we need now. It is a disgrace that, because of the way in which the issues of race and multiculturalism have been argued lately, Australian citizens would be physically abused in the streets because of their perceived origins. I am especially saddened when I see reports of the headlines about all this in newspapers in countries all around us, especially when newspapers reflect-or are supposed to reflect-official or at least authoritative opinion. Australia has never been portrayed in this way-never. In the days when we did pursue discriminatory policies, the ambience of international relations was very different, as were our trading patterns-and that despite some changes. Indeed, the changes to immigration policy also came at a time when our trading relations with the South-East Asian region changed quite considerably simultaneously. These reports have to be mentioned and have to be dealt with. The Bangkok Post, for example, talked of Australia's 'new-found freedom of speech and bigotry'. The South China Morning Post talked of our response as 'a stamp of approval for those individuals who hold extremist views to take the stage in Australia'. An official of the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce thought that 'The debate would make many local people think twice about travelling to Australia'. 'It would not take much in Hong Kong', he said, 'to revive memories of the dark days of the White Australia Policy'. A prominent scholar in the School of Commerce at Keio University in Japan also thought that the debate that was developing evoked memories of White Australia. As we have seen this week, this view continues among commentators in our region. The Bangkok Post, for example, has commentated on the prolonged silence on the issues being debated. The Nation newspaper of Thailand has warned of potential economic retaliation against Australia. It is no wonder, therefore, that the former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser has had to point out: The discussion has now got to the point where extraordinarily dangerous for the future of Australia. These changes that we have seen over the last 20 or 30 years have made Australia a good and decent place to live. They were successful because they have received consistent bipartisan support. They have been sustained because they were supported by the national leadership of the day. It is always appropriate to debate matters around these issues. Obviously, from time to time we are going to have disagreements about what exactly the content of some particular policy should be in Aboriginal affairs or immigration. But our messages must always be clear-cut, and not subliminal. Our messages to the people of this nation must always contain what we actually believe. There must never be any suspicion in the public mind that when we say one thing we mean another and that we hope to gain from encouraging the other to be expressed more fully. We must never do that in the opinions that we express because that debate gets out of control very quickly. It has consequences that we do not intend. This is a nation which has become a clever nation, an effective nation. I am proud to boast when I go overseas, for example, that there are more Japanese speakers per capita in Australia than in any other country outside Japan. We go through a whole series of Asian languages which we teach in our schools. We go through a whole re-orientation of Australian business to present itself effectively in the region around us. We have presented as a nation with a great brand name, not simply as a nation of primary products but as a nation of sophisticated value added product as well, important though both of those are. We have been substantially changing ourselves in the way in which we have presented ourselves in the region as a modern sophisticated society-and therein lies our economic survival. These are issues of economics and they are also issues of morals and politics. These points need to be conveyed. There are no prospects of a decent employment future without an effective posture in the region around us-none. There is no prospect of an it is opportunity for young people in this country without that relationship with the region around us-none. We cannot survive as a nation with a market based on a population of 18 million people. It is not possible. Therefore, the policies that we pursue are not just about the nature and character of our society, vital though those are; they are also utterly critical about the nature of the future survival of this country. We have got these policies right by and large over the last 30 years. It is absolutely critical that they stay right. It is very important that this motion, when it is passed, goes out as a signal to the region around us that Australia is still in business as a decent society, as a society that is interested in doing the right thing in the way we relate to the region around us and a society that does not talk up its sleeve about the nature of the racial, cultural or whatever background of the people with whom we do business or about any of our citizens.",81
120,Mr TIM FISCHER,RACIAL TOLERANCE,"There are critical times when it is necessary for the Parliament of Australia to address motions of this kind. I am privileged to support this joint motion put to the House by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). I am delighted to see in the gallery the presence of Senator Bill O'Chee, and I note the certain absence of others. Senator Bill O'Chee is of ChineseIrish descent. I commend to members of the House the words he uttered to the Senate this day when he represented to the Senate in clear-cut terms what it has meant to be an Australian, what it means to be an Australian and the difficulties he endured in growing up in Australia. He is a proud Australian. I know that he would want me to indicate his support for this motion. There is no room in this parliament for racism. There is no room in this parliament, in the government or in the opposition for racism. The National Party abhors racism and its ugly effects. It was Jack MCEwen, I remind the House, who in 1957, against considerable opposition, some of it racially motivated, drove through and gave leadership to the negotiation of the then Australia-Japan Trade Treaty signed off by the coalition government at the time. He faced resolutions of no confidence from the RSL of the day and from other elements of the society of the day. But it was clear-cut leadership at the time. It was correct leadership at the time. It is, in a sense, leadership replicated in the motion before the House today. For too long in this country the ignorant and the marginalised have been looking for scapegoats. Sadly, immigrants and Australians of Aboriginal heritage are the easiest scapegoats, for various reasons. These attitudes are unacceptable. These agendas are destructive. They are destructive of job creation and job sustainability, quite apart from the moral dimensions, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out. I make it very clear that we are absolutely opposed to the attitudes and agendas being pushed by certain elements at this time and previously. All Australians must enjoy equal rights, as stated by the motion. This country must have and does have a wholly non-discriminatory immigration policy. This country must deal with the profound social issues facing Australians of Aboriginal heritage, but do it sensibly. These issues come about as a result of both economic circumstances and geographic isolation. They are issues that can only be dealt with through a process of reconciliation rather than the profound dishonesty which comes from bigotry, discrimination and scapegoating. But the programs associated with providing the solutions must be practical, must be sensible and must help add to the cohesion of Australia. We are a culturally diverse, tolerant and open society. I find that that makes for a more exciting and invigorating Australia than might otherwise be the case. Does anyone seriously assert that Australia is not a better place for the input of various people from various parts of the world, be it from the Mediterranean, be it from the Middle East, be it from Asia, be it from Latin America or be it from elsewhere? There is hardly a town in Australia nowadays which does not have an Italian or a Chinese restaurant-in many cases for many decades-or a Lebanese or a Thai restaurant. There is hardly a town in Australia without a substantial proportion of residents from overseas. This is positive. Australians, by and large, welcome the diversity. Australians are not ugly, as is so often depicted, but rather an extraordinarily tolerant, easygoing people who have welcomed the diversity and challenges that come from a non-discriminatory immigration policy. In judging Australia on these matters, I would submit that our benchmarks with regard to our non-discriminatory immigration policy, our benchmarks with regard to the general modus operandi of what it means to be Australian and go about our lives here in Australia, can be judged well and we can walk tall and proudly when compared to many other countries in this regard. I commend the motion that has been formulated by the Leader of the House and Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) and by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). It is a motion which I will put forward on a forthcoming brief visit through Thailand to India for the launch of the government's New Horizons program-not with any sense of feeling defensive about the matter, but as a proud Australian, determined to promote a proud Australia, a capable Australia, a cohesive Australia that will build, through mutual respect, the sort of expanded links of the trade, investment, tourism and cultural kind that we would want with our part of the world. I have done that for many, many years before it became fashionable to do so. During the many years I spent in opposition, I sent frequent cables and requests for help through DFAT, at the time when my colleague opposite, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, was Minister for Foreign Affairs, because I made working visi ts to 19 different Asian countries before March this year, when I had the privilege to become Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. I say in conclusion: firstly, governments set trade and foreign affairs policy priorities. The Australian coalition government has decided that Asia is our top trade and foreign affairs policy priority. No individuals will be allowed to derail that. Secondly, on the export front, which was referred to by the Leader of the Opposition, our exports to that region of the world totalled $46 billion last year and our imports from that region totalled $28 billion, a net surplus of $18 billion. We choose our non-discriminatory immigration policies and our approach embodied in this motion for moral reasons. But it is instructive to think also of the practical circumstances. Thirdly, let me say one other thing: Australians have the right to decide who comes to live in Australia. We should exercise that right. We should make no apology for doing so. After all, every other country seeks to do just that. We will continue to build our relations with the region based on mutual respect. I commend this motion to the House and to the nation, to all Australians, as being a fairly constructed and carefully worded motion which is correct at this time, as it would be correct at other times, in one sense in the relatively short history of Australia by some European standards, but in a proud history of Australia and the achievements that Australia has brought about in this part of the world. We can walk tall in relation to it. I support the motion.",85
121,Mr GARETH EVANS,RACIAL TOLERANCE,"Let me begin by putting this in rather personal terms. I do not think there is any resolution with which I have been associated in my 18 years in the parliament which I have regarded as more important than this one. That is essentially because there is no issue about which I have cared more deeply throughout my adult life than the issue of racial tolerance-as a student campaigning against the white Australia policy and for Aboriginal rights in the 1960s, as a lawyer working in the 1970s on drafting racial discrimination legislation and helping to found Aboriginal legal services around the country, and then as a parliamentarian and as a minister, in the 1980s and 1990s, very passionately committed to the evolution of Australia as a genuinely multicultural society with a wholly new kind of relationship with our regional neighbourhood. Nothing hitherto in parliament, I think, has made me prouder than the role I helped to play in piloting the Mabo legislation through our parliament. Nothing made me prouder as Australia's Foreign Minister over eight or so years than my sense that over the last decade Australia really had come of age. It had come of age as a tolerant, outwardly looking, genuinely multicultural society, revelling in the fact of our diversity, with people among us born in over 140 different countries-in - c----n-ctm-,ili-IW different countries; as a country genuinely committed for the first time to reconciliation with our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; and as a country which was genuinely embarking on redressing a great historical injustice by recognising, for the first time, land rights. I was very proud, as Fmeign Minister, as a member of the previous government and this parliament, of the way in which Australia was rapidly becoming fully integrated into our own Asia-Pacific region, and especially East Asian region; not any longer as a kind of nervous outsider, the Anglo-Saxon outpost; feeling alone and threatened in an alien sea; not as the urchin outside the tart shop wanting to get in and be part of the glittering economic action but being excluded essentially from it, not least because of a sense of distance alienation from what was going on; rather, as a player, as a participant, as a partner region, respected and appreciated for our commitment and our contribution to it. I was proud, too, of the way in which this country was becoming so evidently to have, as part of our community, a growing number of Australians of Asian origin and a huge presence here of students, tourists and business visitors from throughout the region. Against that background, nothing has made me more troubled in recent weeks than the sense that all of this was slipping away, in new and very ugly atmosphere generated, let us state it frankly, by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), by her immediate supporters, by those who have given encouragement, active or tacit, to her, and by those-let us face it again-failing to exercise leadership in speaking out against her. Because of that support and because of that failure of leadership, a great deal of damage has already been done. Many individuals have been hurt, many have been humiliated, many have been distressed and, in some cases, some have even been assaulted as a result of the atmosphere that has been generated. Australia's hard won reputation in the region has been put at dramatic risk, and the editorials and the articles that have proliferated around the region in recent days are abundant proof of that. There is a fear abroad, if you want to look at it economically, in the business community about the future of tourism, about discretionary tenders, about discretionary investment and about the future of education exports if this spirit and atmosphere continues. But, worse of all in many ways, there has been a resurgence-in the name of 'free speech', in the name of 'the end of political correctness'-of what can only be described as indecency and incivility in public discourse in this country. We have old stereotypes, old idiocies, old insults abounding-about the place 'being swamfled by Asians'; about the country being 'mongrelised'-I never thought I would hear again in public discourse that word that we heard the other day from the and Mayor of Port Lincoln; about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people not being disadin that vantaged so much as being especially 'privileged' members of our community, fm god's sake. Malcolm Fraser, whom I have always much admired for his position on these issues, said recently of the member for Oxley quite specifically, in words which should have been heard long before today: She is just plain wrong, and wrong in ways that can lead to great evil. Because of all this, there has been a desperate the need for a circuit-breaker. A desperate need in this country for political leadership to reassert itself, for markers to be laid down, for guidance to be given by this parliament about what is decent and civil, not indecent and uncivil in the public discourse of this country, and the basic principles that must be observed if we are to avoid hurt, distress and humiliation to individuals in our midst, if we are to preserve the social fabric and harmony of our community and if we are to avoid harm to Australia's international interests and standing. It is not a matter of prohibiting the expression of any views on any of these issues. But it is certainly not a matter of encouraging and giving comfort to those views and expressions that are wrong in fact, deeply hurtful to individuals, deeply harmful to the community's harmony as a whole and deeply hurtful to our international reputation. This motion provides that circuit-breaker and it is not before time. It covers all the key issues that need to be addressed, the principles that need to be laid down. It does so in a way that is concise but, I hope, is unmistakably clear. It should be said that the language is not necessarily that which we ideally would have preferred. Drafting involves a process of give and take and I acknowledge the very constructive spirit in which the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) played the role of embarking on this exercise with me in recent days. There are some concepts as a result of that process that are less clearly developed than I would have liked-the concept of 'reconciliation', which has many more dimensions to it than that which are implied perhaps by the terms of this motion; the language of 'economic and social disadvantage' of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; and I would have liked to have seen specific reference to the 'spiritual and cultural needs', in the context particularly of land rights. I would certainly have liked-as would I think all of us on this side of the chamber and perhaps many on your side as well-to have seen a specific reference to a 'multicultural' Australia-with the coalition not being afraid and shirking specific reference to the 'M' word, a word after all which appears in all the policy documents of the coalition before the last election and in the title of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) sitting here in this chamber. But, that said, the points are made. The language is there of commitment to cultural diversity and the message is unmistakably clear. The motion also avoids saying some things that perhaps should have been said, in particular about Australian history. About our 200 year history of sad mistreatment and neglect, and often worse than that, of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. And our shameful 70-year history, this century since we federated, of the White Australia policy-a history for which my party bears much of the responsibility, we being racists long before we were socialists, as I have had occasion to say at party forums from time to time-to the great disgust of many of my colleagues, but it is true. The Prime Minister said we should reject the 'black armband' theory of Australian history. I put it this way: it is not a matter of demanding that people accept guilt now for what happened in all those years gone by. Guilt perhaps is an inappropriate thing to demand of people who were not personally responsible. But it is a matter, and we can distinguish it, of acknowledging the shame of what went so badly wrong for so long. It is a matter of shame and we should acknowledge that, learn from it and construct appropriate and new policy responses accordingly. The Prime Minister has been on record-he did not say it today, but he has said it often enough before-that 'Australia should not have to choose between its history and its geography'. The point is however, I have to say, that in our national interest, especially our relationships with our own region, we do have to choose, because our history for the first seven decades of this century-the white Australia policy history-is an appalling liability. It would be a real sign of coming of age, of maturity, to recognise that liability. Not, as I say, as a matter of guilt for individuals not directly responsible but certainly as a matter of shame for all of us. With all those reservations, this is a motion which says a great deal about the kind of society we have become and should aspire to continue to be-diverse, tolerant, open and inclusive. I for one have not been very proud to be an Australian these last few weeks. But I am proud today to be part of a parliament which is prepared to commit itself to the values and principles set out in this motion. And if this motion has the impact which we all-or the overwhelming majority at least of us in this parliament-hope that it will, I will be, like most others in this chamber, a very proud Australian once again.",86
122,Mr DOWNER,RACIAL TOLERANCE,"I very much welcome this motion which has been negotiated by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). I am particularly delighted that this national issue is being discussed in this parliament not as a partisan one but in a genuinely national way. The motion that has been moved by the Prime Minister encompasses very much what are becoming the traditional values of Australia. As a foreign minister, like my predecessor I do a great deal of travelling and meet people of all cultures and just about all countries. When you come back to Australia, one of the things that never ceases to surprise you is the relaxed, polite and decent way in which people in Australia treat each other. It is that deep-rooted sense of decency in Australia that the rest of the world needs to understand, and I think increasingly does understand. Australians are not threatening people. Australians are not impolite, unduly aggressive people. They are not at heart, as the Prime Minister of Malaysia pointed out the other day, a racist people. This motion that has been moved in the House today very much encompasses those sentiments. I personally welcome, and I know the government welcomes, the commitment to equality and diversity free from racial intolerentrench ance. I welcome the government's support for a non-discriminatory immigration policy and I welcome the support for the reconciliation process. This motion, in a practical sense, is very important for two reasons: first-it is not a term that members of parliament often use or are advised often to use-this motion does have a real moral force. I was making a speech to the Foreign Affairs trainees over at the new Casey building a couple of weeks ago. There were trainees from Australia and quite a number of countries around the world. I was telling them of my experience when I first joined the foreign service back in 1976 and did a training course with people from 10 or 15 different countries-probably more like 15 than 10. They were countries with quite different cultures and creeds and colours. When you spend time with people from different cultures and creeds and of different colours, you realise how irrelevant those things are. You realise how fundamentally cruel and unfair it is-and, as I put it, how fundamentally immoral it is-to discriminate against people on the basis of colour. It is a completely irrational thing to do, but it is certainly something that has a deep moral dimension. I think it is appropriate that, on this rare occasion, this parliament recognises the moral dimension of racial issues. Like other members of the parliament on both sides, I have always abhorred racism. We want the world to know that, as a country, we overwhelmingly, if not unanimously, utterly abhor racism. The second thing I would say about the motion is that it is a matter of real and obvious self-interest that we should promote these sorts of values. First of all, in a country made up of people from around 130 different countries, if we are to achieve internal harmony we have to have as one of our core community values the value of tolerance. People really have to understand that. One of the great tragedies of so many multicultural communities around the world is that they are so intolerant, that different cultures are so intolerant of each other. Unless you preach the value of tolerance, unless you the value of tolerance as a core value in your society, you simply will not succeed in holding that society together. People in the Australian community who do not appreciate that need to learn it and understand it. This is a blessed country in that it lives in such peace and such harmony. But it is not something we in Australia should just take for granted. It is something achieved because we have an underlying fundamental value of tolerance and it needs to be utterly entrenched in this country. The second reason why it is in our self interest to promote the values of this motion is that Australia is living-and is recognising that it is living, in the main-in an increasingly internationalised world: the global village, as many like to say. There is no point in trying to pretend you can get away from it. Love it or loathe it-and I personally am on the side of loving it-you cannot avoid it. It is there. Telecommunications, physical communications-transport, for example-the global trend towards market liberalisation, towards reducing trade and tariff and nontariff barriers, are all entrenched. That is the way the world is going. It has not got nearly as far as it is going to go. If the Bogor declaration becomes a reality-and I believe it will-by 2020 there will be no protection left of any kind in the Asia Pacific region. What an excellent thing that will be. That will contribute to the living standards of the people of this country as well those of the other 17 members of APEC-and there will probably be quite a few more members of APEC by 2020. It is also true that the general trend in the World Trade Organisation is towards intern ationalisation and a reduction in tariff protection. It is just common sense economics. Of course, you will always find a few people left in the world who want to try to resist this trend. They will gradually be washed out with the tide because their ideas simply do not stand up to scrutiny. At the end of the day, if Australia wants to participate in the international community-in other words, if members of this House want Australians to be able to get jobs and want to see their living standards rise-we have to demonstrate to the world that we are an open and tolerant society. If we decided not only to pull up the tariff drawbridge but to pull up some sort of racial drawbridge as well, then Australia would become completely isolated from the rest of the world. It would be a grossly irresponsible thing for this parliament even to contemplate. It would crush living standards in this country. It would destroy tens of thousands of jobs. It would also be a quite immoral and foolish thing to do. We have a practical interest in promoting the values that underline this motion. Look at Australia. It is a country surrounded by nations of quite varied cultures and with people of all sorts of creeds. If we are to be successful in engaging with our own regionand we have to be-there is no point in adopting old-fashioned, racist, elitist attitudes. It would simply and utterly destroy this country if we adopted those sorts of values. Surely we have a self-interest in cultural diversity, not the ennui of a mono-culture. At 45 years of age, even I have seen the evolution of cultural diversity in Australia. I am glad to say that my father, as the minister for immigration for six years in this country, made a good contribution to developing this country's cultural diversity, but since his time it has become much more culturally diverse. And how we rejoice in that. People talk about restaurants and cuisinethat is one thing-but there is much more to cultural diversity than that. It makes Australia such a colourful, fascinating and unique society. Mr Hardgrave-And intelligent.",89
123,Mr DOWNER,RACIAL TOLERANCE,"Yes. If some people want to reject the cultural diversity of Australia and return, which they cannot do, to some sort of grey, bleak mono-culture, where all you can get is steak and kidney pie, I have to say that those people would be in a tiny minority. As the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) would know, it is an enormous honour to be the foreign minister and to attend international conferences, meet with international organisations and go to other countries as the representative of a country like Australia. Okay, like any country, it has a few bigots running around saying vile things, but it is a country peopled overwhelmingly by really decent people, caring people, moral people, a country with great cultural diversity, and a country with a great underlying tradition and sense of tolerance. You can feel really proud walking into the United Nations-dare I mention it-as the Australian foreign minister because you know you come from a country which is a pretty good place and which is pretty well trouble free because there is an overwhelming acknowledgment of the common sense of tolerance and of the morality of decency. I support this motion with the greatest pleasure. I am sure it will transmit a very good message to the Asia-Pacific region.",90
124,Mr KERR,RACIAL TOLERANCE,"The passage of this resolution will be an emphatic statement to the people of Australia, and to those interested in this debate from outside our borders, that this parliament will not allow the subject of race to be used for shortterm political gain. It will not be toyed with. The two great political movements that this country has generated-the Labor Party and the coalition parties-have joined together on unambiguous common ground to reject racism. Let those who take offence at that fact take their arguments where they may. They have a right of free speech. Let them make their case as they will. But we too have responsibilities and the right to speak. We should speak with a common voice and we should say, as we do say in this motion, that there is no place for a second preference strategy on racism in the Australian political system. We should not underestimate the degree of difficulty in dealing with some of the problems that have emerged recently. There have been instances where school kids of Asian background and Arab background have been bashed. There have been instances where visiting troops from countries with whom we have friendly relations have been assaulted. There have been instances were Jewish broadcasters have had their houses daubed. This is a serious issue. This is an issue which should have been nipped in the bud but which has been allowed to bloom. We need to put an end to it. This motion will not discharge our responsibilities fully because our responsibilities are ongoing. Our responsibilities do not end with our speaking in this House, joining together, Labor and coalition, to state a common position in relation to these matters. Our responsibility--each and every one of us-is to continued leadership in the Australian community on these issues of fundamental importance. It is true, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has said, that we are only 20 years from the time when the Labor Party expunged the White Australia policy from its policy documents. It was only in 1967 that Aboriginal Australians were recognised within the census and given the right to vote. So there are layers of tradition and history country based upon a set of beliefs that are still held by some within our community, notwithstanding the quite proper bipartisan stand on this issue over the last 25 years. We need to build on that bipartisanship and never allow ourselves to be tainted by the thought that there could be political advantage in exploiting those who do not share those views which are so fundamental to our national interest. We are a new nation. One of the great differences between us and some other countries is that we do not have a history of prolonged conflict between different peoples within our borders. Only 200 years ago, white settlement brought with it people from different religious backgrounds, some coming as convicts to this country. It brought the Irish and the English-people who had long standing and religion-based enmities between them and which are still manifesting themselves in sectarian ways in their home countries. Successive generations and waves of people who have come to this country have come from places where there are long-built structures which have led one person to stand against another on the basis of racial, cultural, social or religious divide. That has not been our history. We must insist that it never become our history. We have the chance to build a new nation built on diversity and tolerance. Whatever else we might say, now that there has been 25 years of a non-discriminatory policy within this country, the option of going back is no longer there. There are something of the order of 3Y2 million people who have made Australia their home and who have come from non-Anglo-Saxon backgrounds. They come from different cultures and are of different races. They have come to this country to make it their home. In some environments you might say that that is a difficult thing. If I were to settle in Japan or Germany, I might find it hard, even though I might live there, to think of myself as German or Japanese. That is because there is such a long cultural history. In Australia, we are making our nation together. We make our nation out of diversity. Our nation is in our made out of tolerance. It is made out of respect for others. The one thing we demand of new people who come to this country is that they share this tolerance. Have they lived up to that? I would say remarkably so. Wherever there have been ethnic conflicts around the globe, have they been transmitted into conflicts in our society? Remarkably rarely. Have we been able to maintain a civil society based on respect for democratic and fundamental values? I believe the answer to that is yes. Can we allow that to be undone? I believe we must not. Yet the responsibility will always be on each and every one of us as leaders not to allow it. It is times think that we are too complacent. We think that advancement in human evolution is a necessary thing, but it is not. We have instances of places that have superficially civilised and democratic structures having fallen apart when voices of intolerance have gained a foothold. We have seen those things happen. There are lessons for us to learn. We have nothing to learn by looking to the old countries of Europe or, indeed, the countries of Asia in what they can teach us, other than the example of how to build a society built around respect for each other as we make this new country our home. This does not mean that there will be no disagreements. A phoney kind of argument has been put on a number of occasions that because Labor and the coalition agree on these fundamental issues of value we are in some sense seeking to repress free speech or not allow the Australian community to be heard. Far from it. What we are doing is that which leaders in a democratic society ought to do, and that is articulate the principles and visions that we believe will make Australia a secure place for all of us in the future. There will still remain areas of significant and quite substantial debate. This House will debate legislation proposed by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) which was tabled last week. The parties will disagree on some aspects of that legislation. In the Senate, the Labor Party has moved to disallow a number of regulations the minister has proposed. That debate ought to be conducted with respect and restraint. Each and every one of us in this parliament ought to have seen what has occurred in the last few weeks and realise our particular responsibilities in this area. There are substantial disagreements. They go to values and issues relating to policy, but they also relate to second order issues. They must not go to the fundamental issue of our integrity as a society or the right to respect every other person's entitlements as a citizen, once they have come here to make this country their home, to feel safe here and to know that their government respects those rights and will speak straightforwardly on possible. I some- every occasion. There is also an obligation to make sure that we do, because of our agreement about these fundamentals, go out into the community and articulate those things. One point that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) raised which is true is that there was a certain degree of complacency that, because there was agreement between the two major parties, the case did not have to be articulated perhaps as vigorously as it might. So some myths grew-the. myth, for example, that Australia was being swamped by Asians. The fact is, as the minister has said, that about four per cent of Australians currently living in Australia come from Asian backgrounds. Mr Ruddock-Born in Asia.",90
125,Mr KERR,RACIAL TOLERANCE,"Born in Asia. I think, subject to confirmation, that figure is less than the proportion of Asians who lived in Australia at the time of Federation. 1 also understand that the projected figures, anticipating a migration program of the same order as the minister is currently administering, will see the proportion of Asians who would come under a non-discriminatory policy-assuming that they come at the rate of recent timesreaching about seven per cent of the Australian community. It is not appropriate to regard that as being swamped. One other myth is that Australia has run and is running a high immigration policy. The truth is that the last five years has seen immigration in this country halved over the postwar norms. The current government is running an immigration program based on the average of the last five years. The argument that there is a high immigration intake at the moment simply is not true. The high immigration period of Australia's postwar history has ended. This is an issue which requires leadership on both sides and requires continuing attention. The passage of this motion in this parliament will be of great healing.",92
126,Mr RUDDOCK,RACIAL TOLERANCE,"I am not pleased to participate in this debate today. It is the second occasion on which I have been involved in a motion to affirm our non-discriminatory approach to the selection of migrants in Australia, to denounce racial intolerance and to affirm that we wish to treat all Australians, all visitors, temporary residents and others who happen to be legally in Australia with equal rights and respect regardless of their race, creed or country of origin. I dare say it is not the have seen motions dealing with the circumstances of our indigenous people. It is the first occasion-and I am pleased that the terms are there-in which there is a reaffirmation of our culturally diverse, tolerant and open society united by an overriding commitment to our nation, its democratic institutions and values. I will come back to that as I make my comments today, because I think it is important to understand that the people who have come here to settle have the same regard for our constitution, the rule of law, parliamentary democracy, freedom of speech and English as the national language-all the substantial democratic institutions and values which have made this country one of the great democratic nations of this world. It is important to understand why it is necessary that we take this approach. The scale of immigration to Australia over the last 40 years has been very significant. It accounts for about half of our population growth. A remarkably high proportion of Australians are overseas born. Something like 20 per cent of people who were born in another country constitute Australia today. More than half of those people come from non-English speaking countries-from Europe, the Middle East, Asia and South America. Combined with their Australian born children, they constitute something like 40 per cent of our population. There has been a strong pattern of intermarriage between Australians of different backgrounds, and today less than half the population is seen to be of Anglo-Celtic origin. So less than half the population today are descended from those early British and Irish settlers. Over 60 per cent of Australians have at least two different ethnic origins and 20 per cent have four or more. It is also important to recognise that we have great diversity in our language skills. Something of the order of two million Australians, or 14 per cent of Australians over the age of five, speak a language other than English at home. This is part of Australia today. There was a reference to building a new nation. We have in fact built a new nation, and it is a culturally diverse nation. It is one to which we all ought to be very proud first occasion that we to belong. We can be a culturally diverse nation only if we treat each other with respect, if we accept that there are mutual obligations upon each of us to tolerantly accept others. We have to accept that they will have different views at times and different cultural values, but within the context of those overarching values that I mentioned before one should not be troubled about that. One should not be troubled that they look at all different or speak a little differently. How else would we expect people who have come to Australia from another land to be in their first years of settlement? The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) reaffirmed today, and I want to reaffirm, that free speech is an important value in this country but it cannot be used as a vehicle for needlessly insensitive and intolerant language and overt discrimination against other Australians. This is part and parcel of the nation that is Australia today. The approach that we are taking on these matters, which I think was set out so admirably in the national agenda for a multicultural Australia, reaffirms the right of all Australians to share and express their individual and cultural heritages, the right of all Australians to equality of treatment and opportunity, the removal of barriers of race, ethnicity, culture, religion, language, gender, place of birth, and the need to maintain, develop and utilise the skills and talents of all Australians regardless of their background. Together with those stated limits that they are based upon the premise that all Australians have an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia, those basic values that I have mentioned as well as the reciprocal obligations constituted a good expression of what it means to be a multicultural nation and one that is able to work and function very effectively. Today I want to speak about how effectively it has worked-and it has. When you think of the troubles and turmoils in other parts of the world, we have not experienced those difficulties here in Australia. We think of the tragedies that so many others have endured, and we think of the pressure that we have put some of our community under at different points in time and how they respond to that. The pressure that so many people are under in our Australian society today is of concern to me, but think of the time when we were involved in a war with many of the countries of the Middle East and the people who settled in this country from the Middle East were part of our society, functioning in our society, and were essentially good Australians during that very difficult period. If you think of the people that have come here from that tragic area of the Balkans, where families have seen their loved ones killed very tragically by those of a different religion, different racial group, we have here in Australia those same people able to live side by side. They do not always do it easily, but they do it. That is something that we have been able to achieve very significantly. One of the major factors in our winning of the Olympic Games for the year 2000 was the extent to which we were able to build on those linkages that so many parts of the Australian community had with so many other parts of the world to demonstrate our success as a multicultural nation. I have written recently about some of the myths-I am pleased the shadow minister for immigration referred to them-that are occasionally perpetuated about the nature of our immigration program. The shadow minister dealt with the issue of the extent to which we have an Asian cohort. One ought not to be, in any way, threatened by the numbers of people of Asian backgrounds who are here in Australia. One ought to be proud that we are able to have them amongst us. Today one of my colleagues gave me a report from a Brisbane newspaper outlining the success of a Taiwanese family who, having come to Australia as business migrants, invested something of the order of $30 million in Australia and have created jobs for some 250 Australians and, obviously, have supported their families. We ought to be proud that we have people like this come here and settle. We need to acknowledge that if we have tourism, if we have temporary residence, there are at times more people from Asia who are in Australia for other circumstances who are not permanent residents in Australia. This may give the impression in parts of Australia often frequented by tourists that we have more migrants than the statistics state is the case. It is also important to deal with the myths about unemployment, to deal with the myths about disease and to understand, for instance, that overseas born people in Australia have a lower hospital utilisation rate than Australian born residents. It is important to understand that migrants are, in the main, law-abiding and contribute to our Australian society. It is important to understand that migrants do come here and settle over time successfully. There is often reference to ghettos. I know that the places referred to as ghettos 20 or 30 years ago are now seen as part of the vibrant, cosmopolitan city that I belong to today. A place like Norton Street, Leichhardt was called a ghetto 20 years ago, but nobody regards it as a ghetto today. I have to say that, when I go to places like Springvale and Cabramatta, I find them very pleasant places in which to be with fellow Australians. I find that those who refer to them as ghettos fail to understand that, in municipalities like Fairfield, there is only 15 per cent of the population that might be born in one other country. They certainly do not constitute ghettos in any respect whatsoever. I am very proud to stand up and support this motion today, and I hope it will be carried unanimously.",93
127,Mr BRERETON,RACIAL TOLERANCE,"I am also pleased to be able to speak in support of this motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). This reaffirmation by both sides of the mainstream of Australian politics, this great reaffirmation of a true bipartisan commitment to the vital principles contained in the motion, is a matter of enormous importance to the parliament this day and, indeed, to the future of our country. I must say that I think it is a matter of regret that we have to have the debate at all. I do not believe it would have been necessary if there had been at the outset a united and absolute rejection of the views expressed by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in this parliament some seven weeks ago. It would not have been essential for the parliament to take this action today but for a profound lack of leadership on this issue-an issue that goes to the very heart of our nation's character and, indeed, to our nation's future in the world as a country with a tolerant, open, democratic and multicultural society. Some seven weeks ago it was my singular misfortune, as duty shadow minister, to be present in the House when the member for Oxley raised these matters. I do not intend today to dwell on that speech or on the similar views that the member has expressed subsequently; suffice it to say that I consider it to be one of the saddest contributions to parliamentary debate that I have heard in the course of my political career. In that speech the member for Oxley denounced assistance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as something which encouraged separatism and racial division. She called for a radical review of our immigration policy and for the abolition of multiculturalism. She declared that Australia was in danger of being swamped by Asians. Speaking in Melbourne on 10 October she called for an explicitly discriminatory immigration policy, saying that the number of migrants from Asian regions was simply too high and must be corrected. Indeed, she has warned that Australia is headed for civil war if these purported remedies are not adopted. For good measure, in what must be considered a sad exercise in low-grade popularism, the honourable member has called for the abolition of ATSIC, for the cessation of Australia's foreign aid programs and for the termination of our cooperation with the United Nations. The member for Oxley says that she is not a racist; that is her claim. I have no hesitation, nor should anyone else, in identifying these themes and these views as being racist in character. If a person holds racist views, I, unlike the Prime Minister, find no difficulty in reaching the obvious conclusion. To me, the views expressed by the member are absolutely objectionable and deserve the total condemnation of all in the mainstream of Australian politics. In the seven weeks since the first speech of the member for Oxley, we have seen an anti-Asian and anti-aboriginal debate run away like a bushfire through our community. No responsible member of this parliament can deny that. We have all seen and heard the evidence. The member for Oxley sparked a fire which has burned brightly in our media, where she has enjoyed a very real spotlight. It has flared on talkback radio where her statements have provided the trigger for some of the darker and more ignorant prejudices of elements of the Australian community to be given voice. In a world increasingly interconnected by the information superhighway, reports of those views and prejudices have been broadcast to our region and to the wider world. Why has this political bushfire spread so quickly? It has been suggested that it is a product of a sensationalistic media. Indeed, I would not for a moment suggest that the role of the media should be dismissed. That said, however, one cannot ignore the degree to which the scene was set during the last few years-indeed, in this parliament during the last term and in the months since the election-or the way in which we have seen, from time to time, sloganeering about political correctness, about the so-called Aboriginal industry and about the alleged Asianisation of Australia. I think it has been that sloganeering that has prepared the ground for the phenomena we have seen in the last seven weeks. I am very thankful of and welcome the efforts of the Prime Minister today. But it was the Prime Minister who, in the first instance, started the debate about political correctness and who allowed all of these elements to get started. He did, as he pointed out in the House today, place some real caveats on his remarks. But to me there is no doubt that the scene that was set created the circumstances for what I regard as a poisonous flowering of bigotry and a poisonous flowering of racist views that we have witnessed in recent weeks. I do not think there can be any doubt about that. It has been the PM by his persistentindeed, stubborn-refusal to directly confront the bigotry, confront the ignorance and confront the prejudice of the member and those who have voiced their support of her views that has allowed the debate to run away and to reach a point where the action that we are now taking today in this parliament is necessary-indeed, absolutely essential. Yesterday, in arguing his credentials for rejecting what he called 'ignorant criticism' of his public record on the issue, the Prime Minister reminded the parliament that he had repeatedly reaffirmed his commitment and the government's commitment to a non-discriminatory immigration policy. The sad fact remains that until today he refused to take action to kill this debate. The issue has certainly never been one of freedom of speech. As far as I am aware, no-one has disputed the obvious right of the member for Oxley and others to express their views. The issue all along has been one of leadership: the duty of the nation's political leadership to confront what is so obviously wrong and so obviously un-Australian. I think the failure has been a double failure. It has been a failure domestically and it has been a failure internationally as we have seen this country suffer some of the worse regional commentary that we have seen for decades. The reaction of foreign governments to the debate has to date been muted. I think that reflects the maturity of the relationships that have been built up over the past decade, and even before that. There can be absolutely no doubt that reports of a rise in anti-Asian prejudice and racism in this country and the conspicuous absence of an appropriate response until today have inflicted long-term damage on regional perceptions of Australia. The potential damage has certainly been recognised by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), who over recent weeks has made a major contribution to the debate. I think his intervention has been both timely and forthright. It has been in contrast with the silence of the PM until this week. The sad and tragic fact is that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) is now writing letters to regional newspapers denying that the Australian government tolerates racist views. Attitudes, it must not be forgotten, and I do not think anyone in this House would question, are quick to form; they are often very slow to change. It has been the PM's conspicuous lack of leadership that has unquestionably damaged our interests in this respect. His silence has provided the oxygen for this debate to flourish in. I was pleased to read the editorial in the Financial Review this morning from the columnist Malcolm MCGregor, when he said: This debate is not about freedom of speech. It is about the core moral and ethical issues that set the tone of our society. He also said: Leadership ... imposes a moral duty to confront socially destructive ignorance. I thought it was a very timely piece. Mr Abbott-He's a great mate of yours, Laurie-Malcolm MCGregor.",95
128,Mr BRERETON,RACIAL TOLERANCE,"He is not someone that I am prone to quote, but on this occasion I feel compelled .to. If time allowed I would also read a very great quotation of Robert Kennedy in 1968-all those years ago-on this very question of racism. Time being what it is, can I conclude by saying that I will instead recall some much shorter words. They were the words of a former member of this House, Barry Cohen, who spoke so eloquently when the issue was debated at length in the parliament in 1988. In concluding his remarks, he quoted the old maxim: All that is required for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing. All members of this House would do well to recall those words today and to apply them without hesitation.",96
129,Mr CAMPBELL,RACIAL TOLERANCE,"In speaking to this debate, I must say there is very little that I would take issue with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on, but not so with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). I believe his cant and hypocrisy was exceeded only by that of the shadow minister, Mr Gareth Evans. In listening to the debate, once the Prime Minister had spoken, we had a very quick decline from the facts. We had statements being made that are simply misleading. They will not stifle the debate. When you look at this motherhood statement, people in this chamber in their arrogance think that it is going to stifle the debate in the community. It will not. The truth is there has been a bipartisan policy all these years, and that is the problem. There has been no discussion on this issue. Bob Hawke said that one of his great achievements was to liaise with the Liberal Party and the ACTU to keep immigration and multiculturalism off the agenda. The truth is that the Australian people have never had the chance to speak or had their opinions valued. Mr Beazley said that he did not know what political correctness was if it was not what he described as the will of the people at the time. Of course it is not, and he knows it is not. That is hyperbole of the worse order. He knows that political correctness is the will of the elitists in society. What you have here today is basically a battle between Australian nationalists and the internationalists. I would say that everyone who has spoken in this debate so far has been, without reservation, an internationalist. I stand as a proud Australian nationalist with outward looking nationalism. It does not threaten anyone, but it says that we in this country have the right to decide. I tum to this quote: ""I don't think it is wrong, racist, immoral or anything else for a country to say we will decide what the cultural identity and the cultural destiny of this country will be, and nobody else. ""Just about every self-respecting country does, and I find the most extraordinary argument the one that says by talking about these issues we are offending our friends in Asia. That is bunkum. ""Those countries will make judgments based on their own hard-headed interests. Has anybody asked an Australian coal exporter about the rights of an Australian to immigrate to Japan before we sign a coal deal with the Japanese? What absurd nonsense."" I do not think there is anything there that anyone in this House would find fault withcertainly not publicly. Those are not my words; they are the words of John Howard in 1988. It is interesting to see that Cheryl Kernot recently has been attacking the Prime Minister, just as the Labor Party has. Let us look at what Cheryl Kernot had to say in 1995. I will quote from the Australian of 23 February 1995: Democrat leader Cheryl Kernot yesterday defended John Howard's controversial 1988 remarks on Asian Immigration saying they ""at least appeared to reflect a genuine concern"" ... Kemot also appeared to favour lower immigration for the sake of social cohesion ... She said Mr Howard's questioning of the levels of Asian immigration "" (seemed) to make space for a more legitimate debate about the social and economic impact of immigration"" . Oh hypocrisy, your name is Kernotl I might say that John Stuart MillMr Gareth Evans-On a point of order, Mr Speaker; I suggest that imputations of that degree of disgracefulness are out of order in this or any other chamber.",97
130,Mr SPEAKER,RACIAL TOLERANCE,I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The member for Kalgoorlie will not impinge on the reputation of a member so directly.,97
131,Mr CAMPBELL,RACIAL TOLERANCE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. John Stuart Mill, I believe, is so beloved of that side of the House that the Liberal Party is setting up a John Stuart Mill Forum. John Stuart Mill said several things of interest. He said if a country doesn't have the right to decide with whom it shares its people it has no rights at all. I think that is very true. In his Considerations on Representative Government he said: Free institutions are next to impossible in a country made up of different nationalities. Among a people without fellow-feeling, especially if they speak different languages, the united public opinion necessary to the working of representative government cannot exist. Mr Hockey-That was in the 19th century.",97
132,Mr CAMPBELL,RACIAL TOLERANCE,While that is from the last century and is a little out of date I think they are words of wisdom. You could of course use Professor Zubrzycki who is considered to be the architect of multiculturalism in Australia. Only about two years ago in the Australian an article about Professor Zubrzycki said he had grave reservations about his policy of multiculturalism; it wasn't working as he intended and it wasn't working because ethnic leaders put ethnic interests above Australia's national interest. What a surprise that is. Mr Hardgrave-Where is your quote?,98
133,Mr CAMPBELL,RACIAL TOLERANCE,"The quote is there and Professor Zubrzycki will not deny it because he conceded it on a television program in which I participated quite recently. It is quite clear that those were his words and it is just nonsense to pretend otherwise. I do have a concern for people from different backgrounds who have come to this country. Anyone who makes a commitment to Australia in my view is welcome. However, it will not take the heat out of the debate if by doing this you are simply screwing down the lid and turning up the heat. The government has no option but to reduce immigration numbers-and the Prime Minister, John Howard, recognises it even if the rest of you do not. I can tell you now that the Prime Minister will be pushing for lower immigration numbers. Another example from this paper says that we affirm our commitment to maintaining an immigration policy on wholly non-discriminatory grounds of race, colour, creed or origin. Those are fine words but the fact is that they are not true. I will tell you how we discriminate. It is quite simple and quite obvious. It is all done by government and it is a matter of where you put your offices. Firstly, if 50 to 60 per cent of immigrants currently come from Asia it is discriminatory against the bulk of the community. That is clear discrimina. tion. If you open an office in one area and close one in another, of course you get a change; and that is discrimination. It is also quite obvious how it has been done for years in Britain. A woman from Germany told me of the experience her sister had recently. When you go to the front office and apply, and the staff are so rude to you, people get turned away and say they will not bother. Then the immigration department can say that there is no interest when in fact the people have been turned away by rudeness. It has long been the ploy in the United Kingdom and apparently has extended to Europe as well. For various reasons to do with employing local people that does not apply in Asia. If you have points on the family concessional scheme it clearly is a discrimination. Ask yourselves this, you pious posers: if it is a non-discriminatory scheme, why don't we get large numbers of people from Africa? The reason we do not get them from Africa is that we discriminate; we do not open offices there. Nobody who knows anything about immigration will argue with any of those points. They know they are true and they are discriminatory. It is simply nonsense to say we do not discriminate. The policy is highly discriminatory. I just want to make a little comment about Aboriginal affairs because I represent more Aboriginals than anyone in this parliament. I get good support from them because I try to address their real issues. I might add that I have never seen much assistance from those Labor speakers. All they have done is give lip service to the Aboriginal industry. I might add that it is the Aboriginal industry, not Aboriginal people, that Pauline Hanson was attacking. Mr Hockey-Where is she?",98
134,Mr CAMPBELL,RACIAL TOLERANCE,"I am not Pauline Hanson's keeper so I do not know. I want to say that we have a lot of talk about cultural diversity. If you get out into rural Australia, you do not find it. You might think it is so in Melbourne and Sydney but for the great rest of Australia it is simply not so. The trouble is that we now have politicians in this place, some of whom have spoken today, who represent city suburbs with a very narrow focus. I would say it is quite clear that they are not representative of the whole of Australlao Let us just consider the policy of our neighbours. I am sure that you all know what the immigration policies of our neighbours are. Malaysia has the policy-and it has taken numbers of immigrants-that it will take culturally compatible people. This means, fundamentally, people from Indonesia. They speak the same language and have the same religion. That is their policy. The policy of the Japanese is to take people of Japanese origin. Until recently, they were sourcing them from Brazil. The policy of all our neighbours is race determined. I am not saying that we should do that but I do not deny them the right to do that; they have every right. When I was in Kuala Lumpur recently I was talking to a small businessman, an Indian running a hire car service, who said, 'We do not know what we will do if this present government ever gets defeated because if this government gets defeated we have nowhere to go.' Beneath the surface racism is entrenched and it is very real. During my election campaign I got a cheque and a letter from a Malaysian woman, obviously from a fairly affluent background. She said in a letter to me that she had never really encountered racism until she married an Englishman. His family accepted her but her family did not accept him, so they came to Australia. She went on to say, 'I would not like you to think I was racist, Mr Campbell. Some of my best friends are Chinese. But I am telling you that if they get the numbers in Australia they will do to you what they did to Singapore. ' It is nonsense to talk about any sort of united view in Asia-it does not exist. If you want to see racism alive and well and entrenched, Asia is the place to go. I get sick the back teeth of people talking about and deriding Australia. This is, by and large, the most tolerant society in the world, but it is a society that has to be consulted and which has not been consulted so far. You will not achieve anything by trying to screw down the lid. All you will show is that you in this parliament do not represent the people and that they are not having their voices heard through you. It is quite clear to me that politicians have failed this country. It is now up to the people to do something for themselves. I want to make sure that we do address this problem and we do not have a situation created where anybody in this society runs in fear. It is not a one-way street. In the election before last, I was campaigning in Sydney and a New Zealand TV team asked me if they could tag along. The journalist, a very large Maori whom I would not have liked to tackle, said to me, 'We have been filming in Cabramatta and we could sense the hostility; we were frightened.' That is not the Australia. I want, and it is not the Australia that I am encouraging. It is the Australia you will get if you go down this road of mindless bipartisan policy which fails to address the real issues. If you fail to address those real issues, there will be trouble in this country. It will be on the heads of all you bipartisan frauds.",98
135,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,RACIAL TOLERANCE,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (4.54 p.m.)I want to make a few brief comments. I do not intend to reply in detail to previous speakers, but as the last speaker for the government I am obliged to make some comments in reply to the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton). To the member for Kingsford-Smith I would say: how dare you accuse my leader of fanning this; how dare you accuse my leader of setting the scene for this to happen; how dare you accuse my leader of a conspicuous lack of leadership; how dare you use this debate for grubby party political purposes. I want to say two brief things. The first is that I have never done anything of which I have been more proud than to stand up in my country's parliament to give a maiden speech to as a representative. There is nothing I have got more pleasure from than being a local member of parliament. The seat I represent is quite a different seat from that of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). Unlike his seat, which has 6.4 per cent of people who come from non-English speaking countries, I have 22.2 per cent of my population coming from non-English speaking countries-one of the highest of any government member in the parliament. I have a very substantial Asian population that I represent-Malaysian, Taiwanese, Chinese. They display all the qualities that I admire in people-family, enterprise. I see how hard they try to be Australian. I see how much this country means to them. I see that the majority of them had no option about leaving their country. I see how much words can hurt them. I see how personally they take it to heart. As a representative, that hurts me incredibly. Words can be some of the most painful things in a human's armoury. There is an obligation on those of us who have the incredible privilege of being a representative in this place, and hence of having a platform from which to speak, to use words in ways that promote tolerance, not division and hurt. There is also an obligation on those people who have the privilege to report what happens to report it in a way that does not fan the situation but, rather, to use that position of privilege to perhaps moderate some things that otherwise could be very much against our country's interest. I stand up today as the last government speaker because the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) is in another place and I am his representative in this House. As a shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs for three years, I thought something should be said on Aboriginal matters particularly. I did not enter parliament to take a particular interest in Aboriginal affairs. It happened somewhat by chance when John Hewson rang me out of the blue and asked me to be shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs and then hung up. I was left sitting there wondering what on earth this meant. I got a lot of phone calls in the next 20 minutes, too many to recount here. But the one I remember was from the former member for Pearce, Fred Chaney. He said, 'Congratulations, you've got a very tough job; it will change you.' I had no idea what he meant, but it certainly did change me very dramatically-and it has changed me to this day. I guess the thing that changed me was trying to come to grips with a group of Australians who lived by and large in such incredible abject povertysomething I had never had to cope with-who had extraordinary disadvantage and who had, in many parts of the country, absolute mindnumbing boredom. The poverty was perhaps best illustrated by a place I visited on the Northern Territory-Western Australian border. When the 1991 census went through this community, the average number of people living in a two-bedroom house was 12; the highest was 27. I spent a brief period working as a doctor in an Aboriginal community just to try to find out what it was like, to learn something on the ground. I have to say that to go into a house of two bedrooms where 20 people are living is hard to imagine, hard to conceive. The disadvantage is institutionalised. In the south-west of Western Australia, at least back in 1993-they are the last figures I remember-three per cent of Nungas completed year 12. That is the lowest year 12 completion rate for any identifiable group of people anywhere in the OECD. What you have done to that group-not a traditional group of Aboriginal people but a group of people who are largely urbanised-is condemn them and the next generation to a continuing cycle of poverty. Of course, the mind-numbing boredom of life today on many out-stations, in many rural communities, is a major factor that we have no idea how to confront. If I had one surprising memory of that time, it was the bitterness that Aboriginal people felt. And it was not bitterness at what had happened 100 years ago, or 150 years ago; it was bitterness over what had happened to them in their lifetime. It was bitterness over the fact that people in their 40s were actively prevented by state legislation from attending primary school-and in many cases that was not repealed till the mid-1960s. It was fact that until 1963 people in the Northern Territory needed permission to marry or have a bank account. It was the fact that until the early 1970s in Queensland you actually needed a passport to leave a reserve, which meant you could not get work or education. I met a person in 1991, whom I shall never forget, who actually still carried what was effectively a green card with him. Because he had carried it for so long he could never get used to not carrying it. Of course, all these together mean that we have an Aboriginal population in Australia between 35 and 60 years of age that by and large is totally uneducated. I say 60 years because some people over the age of 60 did receive a mission education. But that 35 to 60 years age group, the Aboriginal leadership today, the ones that are trying to run the organisations, just do not have the skills. That is, quite frankly, why we need separate programs. In my own area of health, we have found by bitter failure that when you involve Aboriginal people in the design, implementation and ownership programs they have a better chance of working. Within a week of becoming shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, I met Lois O'Donoghue for the first time. She said something to me that I have never forgotten. She said, 'Look, white people have been mucking up Aboriginal affairs for over 200 years. We would like a chance to muck it up for ourselves for a while.' I have not actually found a reply for that. I have been trying to think of one for six years. In the end, unless you have specific programs to address the fact that three per cent of Aboriginal people in the south-west of WA are reaching year 12, unless you have specific programs to address the incredible health problems that we face, then you are going to condemn Aboriginal people to be a continuing underclass. I do understand the resentment some people feel, particularly when times are hard-and times are hard for nearly all people in rural Australia. But there is no way round it: this country did actively discriminate by law against Aboriginal people up until the late 1960s, early 1970s. And many of the people that are crying against us trying to redress were silent at the same time when this discrimination was being shown. This is not separatism. Overseas, those countries that have had the capacity to address the legitimate grievances and the legitimate hopes and aspirations of indigenous people have actually found that, if anything, it promotes national unity. It is when you do not address the legitimate hopes and aspirations that you get divisiveness. Again, in an area which has been so intractable and so difficult it would seem simple pragmatism to say, 'Well, we have found things work better when we allow Aboriginal people to manage, determine and run their own affairs. Let's do what works in an area where so much does not.' This motion will not go as far as many Aboriginal people will want. It comes down in a climate that many Aboriginal people are finding difficult, in a climate where for many years there have been raised hopes that have not been met. But there is a genuine desire by people of goodwill-and that is almost everyone I have met in my time in parliament-to do something about this. But it does need a message that we are prepared to be tolerant; it does need a message that perhaps we can try to lift ourselves above the party politics occasionally. And it does mean that in a culturally diverse society such as this there is also one small society that does have a special place as the first Australians.",99
136,Mr MELHAM,RACIAL TOLERANCE,"I rise to support the motion before the House. This is an ending and a beginning. It is the end of ambiguity on this issue. This parliament stands united today in clearly rejecting all and any forms of discrimination on the basis of a person's race, colour, creed or origin. It is the beginning of a renewed commitment to a strong, diverse Australian society, where difference between groups of people is celebrated and respected, not resented and resisted. Equal rights does not mean equal treatment. This is where the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) is so sadly mistaken. Australian society is diverse. There are many groups of people with many different needs and aspirathat tions. Equal rights means a fair go for all those different groups of people, and that means different treatment to ensure that all Australians live the kind of lives they want. The Australian fair go has to embrace that diversity, not seek to destroy it by applying the same blanket treatment to everyone. Facing up to our past is necessary if we are to find lasting solutions to the problems of today. As the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs I had the honour and the privilege of being in the audience on 22 August when the Governor General, Sir William Deane, delivered the inaugural Vincent Lingiari Lecture at the University of the Northern Territory, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Wave Hill walk off. This is what he had to say: To see the heart of the reconciliation at Daguragu as lying in Vincent Lingiari's pronouncement that thenceforth the Gurindji and ""the Whites"" would forward as friends and equals, is to do no more than recognise what must be the final objective of any reconciliation between the Australian nation and its indigenous peoples. This is what the House has recognised in reaffirming its commitment to the reconciliation process between indigenous and nonindigenous Australians 'in the context of redressing their profound social and economic disadvantage'. That is, the profound social and economic disadvantage experienced by indigenous Australians can only be properly addressed if at the same time attention is given to the historical experiences that are the root cause of that disadvantage. That is why a responsible government response to the 'stolen generations' inquiry would be to establish counselling services for people still desperately traumatised by the experience of separation and institutionalisation and provide funding to assist people to regain contact with family members who in many cases have not been heard of for 20, 30 or 40 years. This would be a simple, practical and relatively inexpensive way to enable indigenous people to take their places as productive, contributing members of their communities and of Australian society as a whole. By taking this stance against racism and intolerance, the House is not in any way limiting our respect for the principles of free speech. We are affirming the right of every Australian to free speech on the very sensible and practical understanding that with the right to free speech comes an obligation to exercise that right with great responsibility and caution. As the former Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Anthony Mason, said at a recent conference: 'Free speech must be balanced against other legitimate public interests.' What the House is saying today is that those legitimate public interests include the right of people to freedom from persecution or discrimination because of their race. We are also saying that it is in the broader public interest that the existence of a racist undercurrent within a small section of the community should not be used by politicians for their own ends-not for personal political gain, not for party political gain, and not as go a means of furthering a particular policy agenda. Those who make political capital out of the fears and prejudices of certain people in our community must not be allowed to use the very real problems faced by many struggling Australians to further beat up the prejudices and the hatred. For one thing, depriving indigenous people of respect and a chance to overcome disadvantage is not going to make things any better for the average nonindigenous family on a low income. That is a cruel, cynical hoax designed to draw attention away from the real problems that we face. No-one benefits, but indigenous Australians are forced to suffer. Both my parents were born in Lebanon. My father migrated to Australia with his family in 1926. I am proud of my Lebanese heritage. I am one of 10 children. I have seven brothers and two sisters. My parents' migration to this country has enriched this country. My father was a bootmaker and a market gardener. He raised 10 children, six of whom had the opportunity of a university education, four of whom are in the teaching profession, putting back into the community benefits to the community. That story is repeated in every municipality in every suburb in this nation. That is what migration has done to this country. It has enriched this country for all of us. The Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 is special to all of us. It is pleasing that all sides of this House have in their policy respect for the principles of this act. This act is our bill of rights. This act makes us all equal. As parliamentarians, we should at all times strive to maintain the principles behind this motion and every subsequent piece of legislation in this parliament should respect the Racial Discrimination Act. We must now give effect to this motion in every aspect of our considerations in this House for, if we do not, we are all diminished and the nation is diminished. In recent months it is fair to say that I for one, like many on both sides of this House and in other places, have been ashamed at the level that the debate has descended to. We cannot afford as a nation and as a parliament to be dictated to by the lowest common denominator. These issues are above party politics. These issues are deserving of cross-party support. It is a historic day that the parliament has finally moved to, as I said, 'rule off'. This is an ending and a beginning. We need to go forward, respecting one another's differences, acknowledging that we are different, not all trying to be the same and not attacking people because they are not the same as us. I commend the motion to the House.",101
137,Mr CADMAN,RACIAL TOLERANCE," Mr Speaker, I ask the House to grant me the privilege of continuing the debate for a short period until the House is in a position to unanimously carry this matter.

144,Mr MELHAM,PERSONAL EX PLANA TIONS,"In today's Canberra Times, at page 2, there is an article by Michael Bachelard under the heading, 'Hindmarsh Bridge legislation breaches Act, says Brennan'. Mr Bachelard says: The Federal Government's special legislation to allow the Hindmarsh Island Bridge to be built breaches the Racial Discrimination Act, Jesuit activist Father Frank Brennan, said yesterday. Further on, he says: It is understood that the Labor Party intends to move two amendments to the legislation, one at the second reading stage and the other an extra clause at the detail stage. It is not known what these amendments will contain. The Opposition spokesman, Daryl Melham, would not comment in detail last night, but has argued in the past that Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron could use his discretion in the Act to rule out the bridge development, without the need to legislate. I have spoken to Mr Bachelard today. He acknowledges that the article contains an inadvertent error in relation to me. I have not argued the position stated in the article. The position I have argued is that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, John Herron, could use his discretion in the act to allow the bridge development without the need to legislate.

148,Mr MILES,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (5.21 p.m.)-I want to continue the remarks I was making in regard to the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill prior to question time today. At that point I was saying that what is really of concern, particularly to people in regional Australia, are the payments for Austudy, which are now at levels which mean that people in regional Australia find it difficult to have real opportunities of getting education at a tertiary level if they live outside a university city or town. Certainly, in my electorate of Braddon in north-west Tasmania, there are many families who have to make a choice between which son or daughter can afford to go on to higher education. I was referring particularly to families on a taxable income of about $45,000. If they have two or three children who want to go on to university, it is well nigh impossible for them to ensure that their children can do so. The debate which has centred on the level of HECS increasing as the prime reason why people may not go on to university is not really valid. When HECS was first brought in by the previous government, levels dropped off slightly but then rebuilt in following years. If there is any slight decrease due to these changes to HECS, the levels will rebuild in future years. The real issue for youngsters in regional areas of Australia getting into university is Austudy and the eligibility cut-off points for the living away from home allowance. In my electorate, a number of young people have been very concerned about their opportunities. In particular, one person who has done a lot of work on the north-west coast of Tasmania for students at the Hellier College is Rachel Duncan. She has presented ideas to me about the needs of education in regional Australia, particularly the north-west coast. Mr Adams-Read the press releases.",105
149,Mr MILES,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I notice the member for Lyons is here. I know that young people in his area would suffer the same difficulties as people in my area, and the same applies throughout Australia. But at the end of the day when we came into government we had to find a coherent, integrated policy which recognised the financial limitations as well as providing good education. The slight decrease in funding to higher education is in the vicinity of $1 in $100 for the first year and may move up to $4 over four years. Changes can be made in the higher education area and those changes will come about. Some university administrators have spoken to me about it, saying, 'This will give us the opportunity to make the changes to make our university more efficient and effective.' So I am very supportive of the legislation because it provides a good education for a large number of our young people who want to go on to university and, at the same time, recognises the fact that the money has to be generated-and we had to address the huge debt which was left to us by the previous government. I commend this bill to the House.",105
150,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Regardless of whether a huge debt was left by the previous government, real questions have to be asked as to whether these policy decisions should be a priority. Fundamentally, today we are dealing with the decision by the current government to abandon the former single HECS rate of $2,400, institute a three-tier system as high as $5,500 and, concurrently, ensure that people who post-university earn a far lower level of income are compelled to pay at an earlier stage. After the interest of the honourable member  member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), I was persuaded to take a further interest in some of the contributions from the government side today. The member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) spoke about his university career and what it taught him about theoretical mathematics and statistics. He should talk to the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) because she put up two questionable statistical comments. Firstly, she asserted that there had been an increase in Queensland; and, secondly, she said it was essentially too early in the day to take much note of these statistics. The second point is only relevant if you come forward and posit a reason why there is this deterioration around the country this year. The fact of life is that if they are unpredictable one year then, similarly, the same kinds of conditions essentially affect the statistics year. Secondly, we are quite aware-the previous government was certainly aware and anyone who takes an interest in electoral statistics population movement in this country would also be aware-of the demand in Queensland. So it is quite rational that there might be an increase in Queensland over and above national trends. Similarly, despite any supposed increaseand let us assume, for the sake of argument, that we ignore her proposition that the figures are unreliable anyway-we also have a situation in Queensland where, even with this supposed increase in the number of people interested in enrolment, there has been a very systematic decrease internally in science, engineering and a number of other faculties in that state. The member for Braddon (Mr Miles) did a bit of pork-barrelling by expressing great concern about the fact that rural students are deprived from accessing university. He described that as a dreadful situation and said that he was there fighting for them, et cetera. Essentially, at the end of the day he was saying we do not really have to worry about things; when HECS first changed there was a bit of a decrease 'but it will all sort itself out', ignoring the fact that when the previous government introduced these changes, what was clear in the survey of who might be most affected was rural communities, rural students. That was fundamental to the analysis of what might have happened and, to some degree, did happen in the introduction of these fees. Equally, that survey of the possible impact said that socioeconomically deprived people, in combination with those in rural areas, were those who would be most ruthlessly hit by changes in the increases in HECS. So there is one sure recipe here to affect rural Australia and that is a significant decrease in the access of those people to university, and it is particularly pronounced when they come from poorer families in those regions. The other fundamental strain going through the coalition's contributions today has been: in Labor failed to markedly move equity, therefore, let's make it more inequitable. They this introduced measures to widen access and they brought in various schemes and some commentators said that they are more advanced than most countries in the Western world. All and of these things did not lead to an extreme, marked increase in access of students from western Sydney or northern Melbourne or, as I say, of most relevance, rural and regional Australia. Therefore, let's make sure that we put more barriers in the way of these people. Let's return, as some speakers earlier indicated, to the Fraser and pre-Fraser periods. Let's make it extremely difficult for those people to enter university. What is behind this kind of mentality has been most eloquently put for the coalition by the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). He commented in the James Cook University newspaper: By and large, the wealthy in the community are the intelligent in the community and they have intelligent kids. What he is really doing is trying to help Australia by making sure we only have intelligent people at university and, ipso facto, on the basis of Liberal Party thinking, they all come from wealthy areas. I think anyone who has done anything past third-class history at school might question how everyone in society obtained or maintained their wealth was by being the most intelligent. The dominant thinking behind this government's attitude is that it is really a waste of time trying to encourage people from the western suburbs-from Penrith, ParramaUa, Fairfield, et cetera-because they are, as the member for Herbert says, 'by and large the unintelligent'. That is what is behind this. I saw a similar comment in New Age-the same paper in which I saw the last quotefrom the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone. It was not quite as stark but it was going in the same direction. She says that there are no problems here: No-one asks people who wish to enter university, whether they are rich or poor ... There are no questions asked when they enter the door, so what is the problem? The problem, the opposition would maintain, is that there is going to be a very marked change in who goes to university through these mechanisms. People are going to be discouraged. Families are going to have doubts about whether it is of value. Families are going to ask whether they can afford to provide. Children are going to ask whether, if they are going to go to a university, they will get anything out of it. Some of us might have broader concepts of what education is for, but a lot of these people who do not come from families that had previous family members at university are going to very clearly ask whether there is a pay packet in it. They are going to question whether the gamble is worthwhile and they are going-it is quite clear already-to make a decision that it is not. Despite the reassuranMitchell ces of the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) that the figures are irrelevant, that they are not a guide and that Queensland is going well, and despite the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) saying that it is all going to sort itself out with no problems, there has been a national trend downwards and there has been an extremely pronounced trend on a regional basis in some universities. I take the University of Western Sydney as the main example I take any interest in. It is certainly one of the worse case scenarios because its academics and administrators have not been backward in saying this is a crisis. Whereas the national trend is an eight per cent decline in people interested in entering university, for the University of Western Sydney it is 22 per cent. That is right-22 per cent less than last year. We have not heard any reasons from those opposite as to why these figures are there. I have not heard any of the speakers opposite say, 'Well, it is because the member for Lindsay was re-elected and therefore people feel that the economy is going so well that they do not need to go to university any more. They are just going to walk into $70,000 managerial jobs.' I have not heard any real reason from those opposite as to why the University of Western Sydney's decline is so stark. There are other regional indicators in the same direction. Maybe in the North Kew branch of the Liberal Party they are not too worried about the reality of the University of Western Sydney, they are not too worried about those universities that are not as recognised, not as established, not as tied up to the corporate sector as universities increasingly become dependent upon that connection, but this university is of relevance to me-and it is of more relevance to some members from western Sydney than it is to me. As I have said on other occasions, transport patterns in western Sydney mean that students in my electorate have reasonable access to the University of Sydney and have better access than some areas to Macquarie University, but for students from a number of other electorates of members in western Sydney like Parramatta, and Greenway the university is vital. Some of the areas the previous government wanted to succeed in are characterised by the University of Western Sydney. That university is characterised by a significant regional concentration of students. They come from an area that is very distant from other institutions. They do not have alternatives and are basically dependent on a very pathetic private bus system. The university is characterised, in Australian university figures, by a disproportionate number of students whose background is non-English speaking. A disproportionately high number of its students come from families that have not had previous family engagement in tertiary studies. I think it has the highest percentage of non-English speaking background students of any tertiary institution in Australia. It is also important because it has a significantly higher proportion of female academics than other institutions. It is noteworthy that, despite the high unemployment in western Sydney, 50 per cent of the graduates from the University of Western Sydney found work in that region. This new institution is being undermined in a very real sense by the policies of those opposite. This is essentially part of a broader scheme-I did note the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) deplored the fact that one of our speakers spoke about industrial relations but it is part of a broader agenda-for Australia's options in the future: a lack of faith in this country's ability to go up-market, a lack of faith in education as a major ingredient of research development in industry and the Guatemalan-Honduran industrial relations solution is where Australia has to go, that a low wage, ill-educated population is Australia's destiny. One of the government's themes is that Labor has not had tremendous success; it sought to increase equity but its success has not been that great. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said about an hour ago that he recognised that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are the most deprived sector of our population. However, in its analysis of what has happened in this country, the Higher Education Council made it emphatically clear that one of the successes of the previous government was in creating access for those very people. It also indicated an increase in NESB proportions in universities. Obviously, that proportion would be affected by changes in NESB numbers in the population. While there would groups of people of non-English speaking background who still have an abysmal level of presence at tertiary institutions, participation overall would be affected by increased Asian migration and their participation in higher education. But the reality is that under the previous government, despite the fact that the low socio-economic category did not increase its participation marginally in regard to the overall university population, there were certain designated categories where there were successes-namely, Aboriginals, NESB and women in non-traditional areas of education. We are saying that the inability to move more strongly in regard to increasing low socio-economic group intake into universities will not be resolved by making sure that those people cannot get into university. That is not the solution. That is the way we cannot go. Unfortunately, because they are so ideologically driven, those opposite have the fundamental belief that things should pay for themselves. I heard the member for Petrie say that this policy shows the way in which we can get better contact between cost and purchase price. She assured us that people would be able to pay back their debt more quickly. She argued that there are thousands upon thousands of students out there, massing outside universities, whingeing and complaining that some people are paying more than others; therefore, we should increase the debt and make them pay it back more quickly. I have not seen that attitude reflected in the electorate. The trend in western Sydney is particularly severe. Other members have cited the situation in Victoria where there is a very pronounced downturn in the number of mature age students. People have spoken about Macquarie University which, to some degree, affects my region. Then there is the matter of tertiary admissions in Victoria as a whole. The situation is more worrisome and more obvious in some areas than in others, but this is certainly a national trend. It is generally going in one direction. There are no mathematical aberrations to indicate that what Labor is saying is wrong. There is a broad national trend. This matter is interrelated with the growing international reality. I will quote some figures on two fronts. Firstly, I want to deal with the allegation made by those opposite that Labor's policies over the last 13 years were the root of education inequity in this country. They ignore, in a very marked fashion, the fact that the downturn in participation is an international phenomenon. They ignore the fact that the UK has even worse indications for the same period of time. In a book called They Only Look Dead, E.J. Dionne cites figures that show that level of education is even more important in this day and age in regard to the jobs people get and the incomes they derive. He said: Between 1980 and 1990 the median income of all households in America rose slightly in constant dollars-from $28,115 to $28,906. Women continued to lag well behind men in their incomes, but while the average man working full-time, yearround lost more than $1,000 in real annual income between 1980 and 1990, the average woman gained $1,800. But these figures conceal exceptional differences by levels of education. Male college graduates saw their inflation-adjusted incomes rise by $1,560 over the decade to $37,553. Men who only graduated from high school saw their incomes skid by $4,266 to $21,650. And men who didn't graduate from high school dropped $3,904 to $14,439-they lost over a fifth of their incomes. He further states at page 41 of that book: The median college-graduate couple saw its income rise from $52;500 to something over $59,000 in the decade of the 1980s. But the income of the median non-high school couple dropped from about $25,000 to $21,000, the loss in male income far outweighing the tiny gain in female income. In other words, in a decade the earnings of the family without a high school degree fell from about half those of a college family to just a little more than a third. Is there any wonder why there was so much publicly expressed resentment of ""yuppies""? This article is saying that in America-internationally-there is a pronounced connection between income and educational qualifications, particularly at a tertiary level, but even at the secondary level. The government is saying that they will set that connection in concrete. The government will ensure that those already on high incomes will have an even greater presence at university. They will ignore the fact that the percentage of people of low socio-economic background did not rise markedly in universities in the period of Labor government. They will ignore the fact that of the actual expansion in university participation to 630,000 students, there was real growth in the numbers of those from working-class and lower middle-class backgrounds. The government will ensure that these people are disinclined to go to university because of the economic realities. They will further entrench the system whereby there is a direct and increasing connection between succeeding at tertiary level, earning high income and being able to produce a tertiary level student within the family. The opposition is totally opposed to these measures. They are a recipe for reversing what little progress we have made on the broad front for people on workingand lower middleclass incomes. They are a recipe for ensuring that the concrete advances we have made in regard to women, NESB and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders will be reversed. The government is copping out when it says that all these problems will all be solved, that the most poverty stricken and the most destitute will be saved, by a measly few thousand scholarships-the number of which will grow to the monstrously high figure of 4,000 for a student population of 630,000! In conclusion: this bill is a recipe for depriving people on lower and middle incomes of access to education. The government is going to entrench these provisions to make sure that this country goes down the low wage, low accomplishment road.",105
151,Ms MACKLIN,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I rise to oppose the changes proposed in the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill, particularly those relating to the higher education contribution scheme. I am particularly concerned about the likely impact of these proposals on access to higher education by low income groups in our community. This issue is certainly causing a great deal of anger in my electorate, and I have no doubt that I am not alone in that regard. If we look at a News Poll taken in August this year, we find that 63 per cent of the News Poll respondents were opposed to these increases in HECS payments. These proposed increases have aroused widespread concern and opposition throughout the country, and rightly so. They threaten to undermine some of the most noteworthy achievements of the previous Labor government and they have been generally recognised for what they area set of divisive and reactionary measures, the impact of which will be, and this is a very important statement, to reduce the cohesion and inclusiveness of our society by erecting financial barriers to higher education. This bill proposes to reduce the threshold for repayment from $28,522 to $20,701 regardless of individual circumstances. One does not have to be very perceptive to imagcare ine the hardship that such a measure entail for many of the people affected. A salary of $20,701 is hardly generous, especialdeter ly for young people who are establishing themselves for the first time in a career facing the additional costs associated with that. A tax surcharge at this time would be a particularly onerous additional burden. How much more onerous will it be for mature age students or those with family responsibility for whom no allowance is made in these proposals. Not only has the income threshold for repayment dropped, but the HECS obligation has increased, as a result of the legislation, at all income levels above the threshold. Everybody above the threshold will have to pay back their debts faster than would have been the case under the previous regime. Since HECS is essentially an interest free loan, students benefit by paying it off slowly. It means they enjoy the interest free loan for a longer period. Therefore, they are all disadvantaged by this measure. Particularly iniquitous is the decision extend the new repayment conditions for these courses. HECS to all HECS debtors not just newly enrolled students. There are about 750,000 existing debtors, all of whom took on their HECS debt in the belief that the tax surcharge would come into effect at a salary level of $28,000. Presumably, they made their finan25 cial arrangements on this basis. Such retrowomen. spective legislation raises fundamental issues with ramifications well beyond the legislation now under consideration. The likely impact of these measures will be to deter mature age people with family responsibilities from undertaking higher education courses. This has both an economic and social consequence. Many mature age students, especially women, are forced to cut short their education because of family or work demands. The opportunity to return to study often adds greatly to their self-esteem, their self-respect and their ability to contribute to the community. These people will face a double whammy from this government if they also have young children because their childcosts will go up-and that is a matter will which we are about to debate. I have no doubt that these changes wilJ also some young single people from low income families and those whose chosen and careers involve long additional training periods or low wages. These changes have to be viewed in conjunction with the announced changes to Austudy which will abolish or reduce eligibility for a quarter of alJ current recipients. In my electorate of Jagajaga, I calculate that more than 1,500 people will be affected by the Austudy changes. Data from the Victorian Tertiary Admission Centre indicated that, after applications closed last month, mature age students, mainly women, are the main group affected by the budget chang-s to HECS. Applications from this group fell by 13 per cent. An even more graphic example are the applications for the painting course in the School of Art and Design at RMIT. In 1996, there were in excess of 800 applications. For 1997, there are 307 applications. This trend is reflected in art schools around the country. With the certainty of drastic staff sackings to follow, to we will see even fewer being able to access Universities with high numbers of students in the mature age category are going to be particularly badly affected by these changes. Latrobe University in my electorate is a case in point. Over a third of its students are over and more than 60 per cent of them are At a time when it is facing a funding cut of $5.6 million, Latrobe University is also facing a decline in enrolments, which the university estimates at 560 students. It also expects to have to sack 250 staff over the next three years. A related HECS proposal causing concern to my electorate and to higher education institutions in the electorate is the introduction of differential fees for courses to replace the standard rate now applying. From 1997 there will be three different contribution rates. Rates will depend on the cost of the course provision. The danger is that poorer students will opt for cheaper courses irrespective of their interests and talents. This is nothing short of madness. It is madness for the students and madness for the community as a whole. This proposal encourages square pegs in round holes, rather than the more productive approach of ensuring as far as possible that students are equipped to undertake the work for which they are best suited. This is in the interests of both the individuals concerned and society generally. It is yet another typical example of this government's economic rationalist agenda of letting the market run the country. One day, hopefully, they will recognise that governments have a role and a responsibility for higher education. There must also be concern about the way in which particular courses are priced under the new arrangements. Students of science, engineering and agriculture are going to be charged $4,700 for their courses. This is likely to be a disincentive for some students and is particularly worrying at a time when enrolments in these subjects are already falling. It also has potentially serious consequences for Australia's longer term economic prospects. The rationale for the differential charging arrangements is flawed. They are said to reflect both the costs and the benefits of the courses, but in some cases these conflict. A very good example is nursing. It is an expensive course for universities to run. On the other hand, nursing graduates are not generally highly paid. Universities, in fact, are charging nursing courses at the lowest of the three rates, which means they have to crosssubsidise them from other courses. What I am concerned about is that the universities will be discouraged from offering these absolutely essential courses. Differential charging makes assumptions about people's earning potential and patterns of work force attachment that were probably never valid but are particularly invalid in these times when work force patterns are undergoing such rapid change. These proposals will allow universities to offer 25 per cent of their places to full fee paying Australian students from 1998, a move described by one commentator, Simon Marginson, as 'a safety net for the rich'. Can you believe the gall of this government that talks about protecting the disadvantaged? In this bill, we have a safety net for the rich. If implemented, this bill will have serious detrimental consequences both for universities and for our society more generally. It is an attempt to replace some of the funds previously channelled to universities through operating grants and discretionary funding and now to be withdrawn in yet another coalition broken promise. I feel like a broken record every time. I get up here to speak. Mr Abbott-You sound like a broken record.",109
152,Ms MACKLIN,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Every time. I get up here to speak, I raise yet another broken promise of this government. But this bill does not just contain one broken promise. It contains quite a few. This is what your government promised: · To maintain the funding levels of operating grants. Promise broken. · To maintain HFCS as students' main contribution to the cost of study. Promise broken. · To make no changes to HECS which will affect existing students. Promise broken. In their pre-election policy statement, they also said: The Coalition is committed to ensuring that financial, social and geographic factors do not act as a barrier to higher education for appropriately qualified students. They went on to say: The Coalition will oppose attempts by public universities to introduce pay-as-you go fees at the undergraduate level as an alternative to HECS. The coalition's real agenda, it seems, was more accurately portrayed in the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit than in its election manifesto. Maybe the voters should have a look at the National Commission of Audit before the next election. The audit commission's recommendations included the suggestion that: . .. the Commonwealth consider funding its educational responsibilities through a capped number of scholarships to students leaving year 12It continued: ... these scholarships should replace all operating grants to universities and TAFEs. The impact of cuts to operating grants will be exacerbated by the government's refusal to fund an increase in staff salaries. The ViceChancellor of Latrobe University, Professor Michael Osborne, described the combined effects of these circumstances as follows: The Higher Education Budget Statement ... makes significant inroads into operational funding in part openly by direct cuts over the next few years, in part surreptitiously by refusing to fund a long overdue and well merited salary increase... The combination of cuts . . . will mean that the true level of the cutback for institutions is somewhere between 10 per cent and 20 per cent. .. This can only cause very severe dislocation. Reduced funding to universities is forcing some of them to consider full cost recovery for some courses. The government has directed that undergraduate enrolments be quarantined from the effects of reductions. Universities will not want to cut enrolments in higher degrees by research, as students in this group attract additional sources of income. It is likely then that full cost recovery will focus on postgraduate studies undertaken by course work. Latrobe University, for example, is considering the introduction of full cost recovery for postgraduate courses such as psychology and social work. These are an essential part of these courses. Charges in these areas will affect students already enrolled, who could not have foreseen these charges when they began their courses. The combined impact of cuts to university funding will be devastating for some students. The government's proposals, as outlined in its higher education budget statement and which are to be given effect in this legislation, will in fact tum the clock back 30 years. The government is walking away from higher education and returning us to the days when only a few people were able to go to university. This point has been ably made once again by Professor Osborne, who said of the government's statement: There can .. . be little doubt that this set of measures represents a strong deterrent to studentsI do not know how the government can believe in such a deterrent. He continued: ... especially those from lower income groups. It is a step down the path to elitism on the basis of wealth and deserves on this account the severest criticism... These budget measures have potentially catastrophic implications for all but the most prestigious universities. While this measure will assist some universities financially, its impact will be variable between institutions, with universities in rural and low income urban areas having much less capacity to attract full fee paying students than will the well-established city universities. It will be divisive within universities as well as between them, leading to the kinds of tensions between publicly and privately funded Australian students that are now evident between privately funded international students and publicly funded Australian students. This is a very sorry day for universities in this country. This measure clearly advantages students from wealthy backgrounds. Poorer students will be unable to afford full fees, and unable to borrow them in the open market. In conjunction with the more stringent conditions applying to HECS as a result of this bill, these measures can be seen as both economically and socially regressive-returning us to a situation in which, increasingly, higher education and all that goes with it will be the preserve of the privileged. As I have said, and will say many times in future, this is both economically and socially indefensible. The damage inflicted by these measures will in no way be made up by the government's sop of 4,000 merit based HECS exempt scholarships over the next four years for students from target equity groups. While undoubtedly they will be valuable to the individuals concerned, they do absolutely nothing to counteract the general impact of the changes proposed in this legislation. They are damaging to the universities, to past, present and future students and, most importantly, to our wider society. If the government is truly interested in governing for all of us, it must withdraw this legislation.  pleased to get up and speak in this debate. I have always said that, of the things that I feel are really important in my electorate, the first is jobs and more jobs, and the second is education. Today education is the key to one's life chances. The more equitable our education system, the more the education system develops students to realise their full potential. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 will have a dramatic impact on my constituents and their ability to succeed in the longer term in the world of work. One of the proud achievements of the Labor government-and I know that government members have knocked the last 13 years of Labor-was that we increased the number of university places from something like 350,000 to 630,000, an absolutely phenomenal increase. As I have acknowledged before, one of the controversial measures that we introduced was the HECS charge: the idea that people who graduated should pay a portion of the actual cost of attaining their university degree. This measure was very controversial at the time, because it had been one of the great Whitlam reforms to make tertiary education completely free. When I went out to talk to Labor Party members or members of the community, I always justified it on the basis that every dollar raised would be turned into expanding the university sector. I repeat: we increased the number of university places from 350,000 to 630,000. By and large, most people now accept that the idea of using HECS money to expand the university sector was a very worthwhile thing. The other thing that I thought was very important during our 13 years in government was the notion that our nation's future really depended on the degree of success we had in educating and skilling our young people-that is, as a government and as taxpayers, it was really worthwhile to put a huge investment into particularly our younger people and, as a nation, we would reap that benefit through the years. The more skilled our work force was, then the better we would be able to succeed in trading and exports; the better we would be able to create jobs and have people taking up those jobs. I absolutely believe that is as fundamentally important in 1996 as it was then. The government members seem to have this naive view that it is okay to extract more money from university students; after all, the chances are they will be earning more than other salary and wage earners will. Perhaps there is some validity in that. In undertaking an inquiry into officer education, with a report entitled Officer Education: The military after next tabled in the last parliament, we highlighted the situation facing graduates today as far as ADFA was concerned. Previously, when you got a university degree it was a passport to an instantaneous job. There were employers clamouring to employ you. These days getting a degree does not necessarily guarantee that you will immediately get a job, let alone the job of your choice. Let me give you some figures, from 1988 and 1993, of the percentage of graduates employed in the April after they graduated. In the area of science and physics-86 per cent in 1988, 51 per cent in 1993. In the area of computer science-94 per cent in 1988, 70 per cent in 1993. In the humanities field, 18.5 per cent of graduates were still seeking full time employment in April 1989 compared with 22.5 per cent in 1990, 42.2 per cent in 1992 and 44.1 per cent in 1993. What this means, I suppose, is that graduates are not a natural cash rich cow in which to home in on. Even if there were an argument that we need to increase the HECS fees and to make the changes that the government has made-and I dispute that-even if I were to concede that argument, what is so bitterly disappointing is that it all goes to consolidated revenue. Not one graduate benefits, not one university, no expansion and no increased research-they get not one dollar of value for all these changes. I think that is an absolute tragedy. In this report on ADFA that I referred where we spend over $100 million on the most exclusive university in the land and where the cost of a graduate to the taxpayer is over $300,000-there is not one change being made. The recommendation of the committee that we replace the undergraduate program with an additional 1,000 places at universities right around Australia and introduce a scholarship scheme, which would have saved $50 million, has been completely rejected. So at that university, for the most expensive graduates we are producing in Australia, there is not one change, but for all other university students there are some changes. Perhaps the most disappointing change is lowering the threshold where HECS cuts in. Previously, you had to earn $28,000 before HECS cut in; under this bill it is now reduced to $20,000. There are three differential rates for HECS: $3,300 per year, $4,700 per year and $5,500 per year. What is the impact of these changes in my electorate? I am pleased to report to the parliament that, increasingly, people in my electorate saw themselves as being able to go to university and to succeed at university. I have had many cases where, for the first time in a family, someone has gone to university and obtained a university degree. I have seen situations where older women have gone back to school and then gone to university and succeeded in a university course. I congratulate them. But, tragically, it was predicted that these changes would be a huge tum-off. The University of Western Sydney-which I am pleased to say serves your electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, as well as it does mine-which especially aspires to serve the people of western Sydney and sees its mission as having a responsibility to the people of western Sydney, has seen a dramatic fall-off in applications to do university courses. You have to remember that over 65 per cent of all undergraduates at that university actually come from the western suburbs of Sydney. So two out of every three students come from the western suburbs of Sydney. When we talk about a fall-off in enrolments, we are talking about a huge drop-off to-- in the western suburbs of Sydney by young people. Enrolments have already fallen by 14 per cent. Let me go through the figures from the faculties: 41 per cent drop-off in engineering; 40 per cent drop-off in nursing and health, something that a lot of young women in my electorate and some men saw as a profession that they wished to aspire to; 39 per cent in humanities and social studies; 24 per cent in education; 14 per cent in science and technology; and 10 per cent in law. What this means for my electorate, as the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) said, is that we are returning to the days of the past-that is, you did not go to university because of your ability to succeed at a university course, you went to a university because of where you lived and what your parents did. That is a great tragedy. It is a waste of resources. Australia is the one that is losing out and in particular the young people in my electorate are losing out. We cannot afford that for our nation's future. I am bitterly disappointed at these measures and the impact that they are having in my electorate, particularly on the University of Western Sydney. I suppose the thing that signals that this government is a government of privilege, a government concerned to look after the wealthy and make sure that their children have a privileged place in this societynotwithstanding all the rhetoric or feigned disgust about $2 million salaries-has to do with the alleged freeing up of universities and allowing an additional 25 per cent of HECS paying places at universities to be set aside by universities so that they can charge full fees for them. The impact in my electorate is this: if someone does not get into a HECS place because they have not got the sufficient marks in their HSC-by the way, I would like to send a cheerio call to all those students currently under the grind of their HSC exams; I have some great empathy for themMs Ellis interjecting- if you do not do well at school, your mother and father are not going to be able to your way into a place. But if you come from one of those north shore electorates or eastern suburbs electorates, you do not actualtreated ly have to be serious about year because, if you miss out on a place, Mummy and Daddy are always going to be able to buy you that place. I ask you, Madam Deputy Speaker: how many families do you think there are in the western suburbs of Sydney which are actually going to be able to afford to buy a place for their children the way you would if you were in Vaucluse or St Ives or Rose Bay? Of course that is not going to be working class families. Already they find the impost of sending their children to university sometimes as much as the family can bear, particularly when they get a place in one the universities located well away. These measures will not impact on Sydney University; they will not impact on the versity of New South Wales. The oldest richest universities in Australia will have sufficient prestige-and, may I be crass enough to say, endowments-to survive these changes. The universities that are most at risk are ones like the University of Western Sydney, which we all fought so hard to get established, and the regional universities. These are the ones that will feel the full brunt, and particularly the students they going back to. sought to serve previously. The change to Austudy is not part of bill but it was referred to by the honourable member for Jagajaga. I was pleased to chair the House of Representatives Standing Comof mittee on Employment, Education and Trainunexploited ing, which wrote a report on student financial assistance. What we recommended in recomcan mendation 11 was as follows: The independent eligibility criteria for independent status for Austudy be reduced progressively to age 21 over the next four budgets. That was a bipartisan committee. I notice that some of the members of that committee still serve. Examples are Bob Charles; John Anderson, the Deputy Leader of the National Party; John Bradford; and Bruce Scott, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. We all put our buy name to that and the Labor government progressively introduced it. It is absurd to nice suggest that people who are 21 should be as dependants of their parents. At the 11 and 12 time, the age was 25. Under the changes to Austudy we are going to see the then government's implementation of this recommendation overturned. You will not be considered to have independent status until you are 25. How pathetic! What a turnoff for people doing a second degree and for people who may have gone to work after leaving year 12 and who have decided to have another go, to suspend for a time their period in the world of work, and go to get a available to university degree. Those on this side of the House have a passion about education. I am not saying that of over the 13 years we got everything right; clearly we did not. Clearly there can be improvements to the system-but we did do a lot of good. We certainly expanded the Uninumber of places and we certainly saw in and electorates like mine and yours, Madam Deputy Speaker-and those of other members on this side of the House-a significant participation in university courses. We got away from the situation where it was restricted to an elite number of people, when your place at university was not determined by your ability but by where you lived and what your parents earned. That is what we are The government is saying that, as a nation, this as we look to the year 2000 and all the opportunities that that presents, we can be such a lucky country; we can have thousands young people who can have their potential as far as this sector is concerned and we will still succeed as a country. We be a clever country but we cannot service one of the prime institutions that allows us to be a clever country. I am appalled at this approach. I really am disturbed by the impact it is having. I say to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who is at the table, that people in my electorate have read about this in the newspapers and I guess it has not really sunk in yet but I sincerely believe it will sink in over the weeks, months and years ahead. When people fully understand the way you are ripping off universities, ripping off university students and restricting entry into university, you will pay a price. They will not helieve that this is a fair country or a lucky country and they will not believe that you are acting in the interests of all Australians. After all, that was not an election promise but certainly a responsibility of any government of this nation.",111
153,Ms ELLIS,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"This is one debate in this House which, frankly, I wish we did not have to take part in-I wish it had never happened. We have alI heard from numerous previous speakers in this dehate the actual changes to the HECS fee arrangements that we are objecting to. I will go through them again very briefly because of the old adage, 'If you say things often enough, you may start to get sick of saying them but maybe people wilI start to hear them.' It is about time that a few people on the other side of the House, particularly on that huge back bench, started to realise what really is being done by this government to university education-the significant increases in the HECS contribution for all new students, particularly for those students studying courses that will attract the top differential HECS payment. Currently there is a single rate of HECS set at $2,442 per year. This is to be replaced by three higher rates of $3,300, $4,700 and $5,500. The other big change is lowering the repayment threshold to make students start paying their HECS debt at a much lower income-at $20,701 instead of $28,495. That is an enormous change and is going to impact heavily on many people. The other main change is allowing universities to charge full up-front fees for places over and above what they call the target number of Commonwealth funded places, subject to the institutions having filled their places for HECS only undergraduates. I am in a position, as are quite a few in this House, of being able to look back to the preand post-Whitlam days and the sorts of changes that occurred in our university structure in this country as a result of really understanding the need to liberalise, to open up, to remove the elitism from what had been a very elitist approach to university education in this country. As a result of that, we have seen enormous gains-many people in our community who have not been able to access a university education prior to this are now able to do so. I am fearful that we are seeing a return to that. This is the beginning of that whole process. The crucial issue in higher education policy is to operate a student contribution scheme that does not create barriers to participation of low income students. The impact of the changes we are looking at will be to inflict major damage to the equity of access that has been the cornerstone of what Labor's higher education policy has provided. As I have just said, that evolved over many years after a dramatic shift in policy and understanding of the need to do that. These changes are all the more remarkable given that the coalition promised-I hate to use that word, because it is becoming very cheap collateral-before the election to oppose changes to HECS rules after a student had begun study. That is not the case. HECS paying students already in the process are looking at these increases midstream. As I said a moment ago, I suppose it is yet another to add to that boringly growing list of non-core promises. When we talk about the regard in which the community holds the political process and those within it, what hope do we have when the new Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gets in on the basis of new standards of honesty to the community and to the parliament and we then get to the stage where we have core and non-core promises? What hope do we have in teaching our young people any form of respect when this place, through the Prime Minister, has this amazing attitude? The pre-budget announcement of significant cuts to higher education was a pathetic, a weak and a cheap attempt to convince students that not much had really changed, that the higher education budget had only been 'given a little nick', to quote the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone). What deceit! It is really holding the community in contempt to believe that by sliding in a policy change of this magnitude in the way that it has been done that you are acting in an honest fashion. There can be no doubt that the proposed changes to HECS and university funding will have a big effect on current students and an even bigger effect on those young Australians who hope to gain a university education in the future. The minister has quite outrageously sought to sell the introduction of a differential HECS charge as some sort of equity measure. The reality is that all students will face major increases, ranging from 35 per cent for students in relatively low cost courses up to 125 per cent for those in the top band. This will actually mean that some students will graduate with a HECS debt of $30,000 plus. This is just disgraceful! A differential charge has the potential to severely distort course choices for prospective students. Anyone thinking about attempting a course in medicine or law will have to think very seriously about the very substantial financial risk associated with their choice of study. The problem is compounded by the prospect for many of those people of having to start repaying a large debt with an income well below average weekly earnings. It must be stressed that the lowering of the repayment threshold from average weekly earnings removes one of the key measures in the fairness of the system-the system, that is, as it was. When you see a policy change of the dimension that we are looking at here, it is like watching cracks in a structure. There is no doubt that this is the beginning of a whole new philosophical approach to the way this current government believes it ought to operate tertiary education in the country. This is only the start and that is what is worrying me. I do not know where on earth we are going to end up. Make no mistake, the decision to move away from the average weekly earnings threshold opens the door to continued reductions in the future. Members opposite, in their successive speeches, can stand up with all the honesty they wish to muster and say that this will not happen, but I am really sorry, I and my electorate cannot afford to believe them. I do not know whether they are saying that this will not happen or whether their statement is a core or a non-core statement. It is getting to the stage where you do not know whether to trust what you have been told. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that this government will seek to raise extra revenue by further lowering the repayment threshold to, say, the level of unemployment benefit. We have no idea how far they are willing to go. In that case, any student who has a job will be forced to pay back their debt-not a job of a particular level of income, but any job. This may be of no concern to the rich--or should I say the more well-off parents?--or to the academic elite, but it is a huge concern to those students from the low income households who may be the first member of their family to attend university. The shadow minister for education and youth affairs is absolutely correct with this warning: a differential HECS will serve to further entrench certain professions as the preserve of the privileged. There is absolutely no reason why we should not believe that and see that coming. It is a return to the days when, as I can remember in my youth, most doctors, most lawyers and most professions of that ilk came from households that could afford to promote that sort of study in the first place. It has been a privilege in the last few years to see that not happen. It has been good for this country and it has been good for the families in it. I would deplore any action by any government that is going to begin the path back to that sort of situation. Cuts to universities will mean a reduction in the number of government funded places. As a result, many young Australians from ordinary families will miss out on places while those from the wealthier families will be able to buy a place if they miss out on a government funded place. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Chifley  for that particular occurrence. I fear that many students will find that paying full up-front fees is the only way to get a university place in institutions where this government has cut gross funding. Allowing universities to charge up-front fees at the same time as reducing public funding must lead to the slow replacement of HECS liable places with fee paying places. We have seen an outrageous attack on the general funding to universities already in this budget, let the BECS situation. All we need to do is see continuing cuts in the general funding to universities for them to be forced to survive by taking more private market or full market fee paying than publicly funded people. They will be in a position where they financially cannot afford to do otherwise. I say to the government: be very careful of what you are doing here. You are playing with the future of our tertiary institutions; you are playing with the future of many of our young people who aspire to getting what is now the norm-a university education. This country should be proud of the process we have had and should be doing all to enhance it, not to devalue it. The policy decision is anything but 'the provision of additional opportunities and choice for Australian students', as Senator Vanstone, the minister, would have us believe. She is conning us; she is not telling us the truth when she says that. But, unfortunately, anyone who dares to disagree with the minister on this subject cops quite a bit of abuse. It has been suggested to me that this is a classic piece of Aunty Jack politics: if you disagree with the minister, she comes out and rips your you-know-what arms off! I say that lightly but I say it honestly because that is how people out there are feeling. I represent an electorate where unemployment is unbelievably high, particularly for the young. As I said on a previous occasion not too far back, in the ACT we had a youth unemployment rate in September of 54 per cent. We also have a tertiary education process in the ACT, like in many other parts of the country, of which we can be extremely proud. We have, along with those two elements, a very high retention rate in our schools. What we should be doing is making certain that each one of those students who can progress through to university on a scholastic basis and a wish to better themselves has an opportunity to do so. It can be said by many that the ACT has high levels of average weekly earnings. That is true in many cases, but I assure this Bouse that the electorate that I represent is not full of families with higher alone than average weekly earnings as an income. I represent a very large number of families who are struggling on one income or two low incomes in a mortgage situation where the economy in the ACT, with the help of this government, is now declining at a rate that is quite appalling and where, for young people to get to university in the future, the last thing they are going to be able to do in the majority of cases is pay a fee. The other aspect of this is the merit scholarship scheme, which has been invented by this government. It is their grand attempt at equity. Let me tell you, it is far from equitable. The merit scholarship scheme will initially exempt 1,000 disadvantaged students nationally from having to pay BECS, eventually reaching to 4,000 similar students in the fourth year. Given that current university enrolments are around 630,000 nationally, this scheme will provide a scholarship for less than one per cent of the student body when it is fully operational-not now but in four years. That is a sham. It is totally misleading about the reality of the situation. It is a very poor and weak attempt to make up for what I believe they know: that they are putting in place with this bill a piece of policy that attacks, as I have said, proper equity of access for all families, all young people in this country, to the hope they should have, that is, a university education. There is no doubt in my mind at all that this is the beginning of a return to the old days, as many other speakers have said-and we cannot be blamed for having this opinion because we are yet to see any evidence that anything this government says it actually means and will carry out. We are heading backwards. We are going back to the days when people can get into university if they can pay. The number of people who can pay will continue to dwindle, and the people who need to-and wish to-get that university education will find it more and more difficult. If we talk about a just community and society in which to live, I am absolutely at a loss to understand how on earth this government can expect the community to believe that they wish that, that they believe in that, that they hold that as a philosophy when they start to impose these sorts of policies on our community. I can assure the government and this House that the people I represent in my electorate are not impressed at all and will continue, with me, to oppose in any way they can the policy that is being brought down by this bill. I very strongly repeat my initial comments, that is, my total opposition to the changes that are being mooted in the HECS arrangements.",116
154,Mr LEO MCLEAY,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The House is at present debating the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, and that innocuous title will be something that many young people in Australia and people who want to do mature age training will remember for years to come because this is the bill that has put an end to the chances for many young people to get a university education. The wide ranging effects of the budget cuts are already being felt by institutions of higher education. The National Tertiary Education Union has said that the federal government's changes to the higher education sector will make Australia the second-highest fee charging country in the world for students in public universities. The government's policy to increase HECS charges will also mean that many will not even be able to afford to go to university. Furthermore, government policies mean that by the year 2000 there will be a 15 per cent cut in funding per institution. Just last week, I received a reply to a letter I had written to the Vice-Chancellor of the University of New South Wales, Professor John Niland. I wrote to him about a matter that concerns both me and my colleague the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) which is the prospective closure by the University of New South Wales of the St George campus of that university. The St George campus, as the member for Barton knows-and he will be speaking on this matter at greater length than I-fulfils a vital regional need for the population of south-west Sydney, which is demonstrated by the fact that 70 per cent of the students in primary education at that campus come from the St George and Sutherland regions. Closure of this campus removes the only university facility in the St George and Sutherland regions. Some people will say that tens of thousands of students go to university from that region and there are only about 800 full-time places at that campus, but the reality is that it is the only tertiary education campus in our region and, because of the cuts that the government is making, it will most likely have to close. It is not necessarily the fault of the university that it is going to have to close; it is directly the fault of the government making these cuts to tertiary institutions. The graduates of that campus from programs such as teacher education and sports science are well regarded by the employment groups that take them in. But it is going to have to close and they are probably going to have to go to Kensington to complete their studies. Professor Niland said in his letter to me: As you will be aware, in its August Budget Statement on Higher Education, the Federal Government put major constraints upon national tertiary education outlays such that many universities, including the University of New South Wales, are facing significant cuts in their Commonwealth operating grants over the next three years. Other policy decisions by the Government, especially in regard to what have been normal supplementation and indexation arrangements, are also having a serious impact. That is the professor's view, and it is true. In seven months this government has put a very large stake through the heart of tertiary education in this country. The undermining of our education system by this government is eroding many of the gains that the Labor Party was very proud it made. While the Labor government was in power we invested heavily in creating an excellent education system. This investment saw the number of students in higher education rise over a 13year period from 340,000 participants when we came to office to over 600,000 at present, an increase of over 70 per cent. If our country is to take its place in the world as the clever country, as the country that can provide value added ability for the part of the world we live in through a flexible, clever work force, then people need to have good training. The decisions of this government for the purpose of short-term gains will put that at great risk. The Labor government recognised that creating university places was only half the task. The other half was to make sure that everyone had an equal chance of taking up a place at university and completing their course of chosen study. To expand the university education system we brought in the HECS scheme, and we make no denial about that. We asked people to pay some money. We said that we thought that people who went to university at the end of their course would usually receive a better income than those who had not gone to university and should make some contribution. We set that contribution at a reasonable 20 per cent of the cost of the course and poured the money back into creating more university spaces. However, people only started to pay the contribution once their salary had reached a minimum level of $28,495. We thought that was a way of saying: 'You will make a contribution, and that is fair, but you will not have to start paying it back until you are earning a reasonable income.' We thought that was fair too. We thought it was a scheme that was reasonably fair all around. But this government has now said that graduates will have to start paying their higher education contribution scheme debt from 1997-98 at a lower income threshold of $27,700, and that is not fair to a lot of students. It is not fair particularly to a lot of young families where the husband or the wife has decided to embark on a tertiary education program to improve their family income. Many of the people at universities now are mature age students. One spouse might be a low income earner and the other might be doing a university course. They may have children. To say now that they are going to have to pay that HECS burden back at $20,000 rather than $28,000 will dramatically reduce the amount of disposable income some of those families will have. All students will face major increases, rising from 35 per cent for the students who are lucky, in a sense, to be in a relatively low cost course up to 125 per cent for those in the top band of courses. So not only is the government going to make them pay the money back sooner or on a lower income level but the government is going to make them pay back more. We do not think that is fair at all. Two-thirds of the general student body at the University of Western Sydney, for instance, are the first members of their families to go to university. The HECS charges will undermine the role of those regional universities, which for some was the only access their family had ever had to tertiary education. The University of Western Sydney, as you so very well know, Madam Deputy Speaker, representing as you do a part of the area that that university covers, has had a reduction in the number of students applying to enter that university for the first time since the university was open. That is because this government in a sense is warning low income families off approaching tertiary education as a way to improve their position in life. We will now find that cuts to funding for universities will definitely decrease the opportunities for those without financial means. Only people from better off families will be able to afford to go to university. The government wants to assist that even more by allowing universities to sell places. One of the things we decided when we made some changes to allow universities to sell places to overseas students was to say that you could not sell places at universities to students who lived here in Australia. The reason for that was that we wanted to have an equal system. We wanted children from Western Sydney and children from the North Shore to have the same chance. We wanted the only test of whether you could get into university to be merit, not wealth. What this government has said now is: 'We will have wealth. It does not matter whether you are pretty good at school. It does not matter whether you have worked hard. If you did not get a good enough TER your family can buy a seat for you at the table and that is all right.' It is not all right. It undermines the whole egalitarian thrust that we wanted to put into tertiary education. It undermines that egalitarian value that Australians have always liked-I must sayan egalitarian value that the Liberal Party has never particularly liked. But you also wonder why the National Party is going along with this, because people from the country, farmers who have low incomes in cycles, will find that the regional universities that their children attend will slow down and the courses that are available at those universities will contract. The children of farmers will get back into that cycle where the only way they can get a good education will be to go to the big city, which is not what their parents would like. So one wonders why National Party members are supporting this piece of legislation. There will be less incentive for students from lower socio-economic groups, such as farmers and low income earners, to go to university. Aboriginals and migrants especially will be hurt when they know that the lump sum they will have to pay at the end will be quite significantly more than it is now and they will have to repay it quicker. Earlier this year I presented four students in my electorate with the Australian student prize for academic achievement. The Mayor of Canterbury, Councillor Griffin, was kind enough to put on a small ceremony at the council chambers so that we could give these young people and their families due recognition. All the four students presented with those prizes were either migrants or children born of migrants. One of them was a girl named Katherine Lieu. She arrived in Australia only in 1979 with her parents, who were refugees from Vietnam. She is now studying medicine at the University of New South Wales. These migrant families have struggled to make their way in Australia. This proposal that the government is putting before the House now will make the struggle for such families even harder. It will not be a struggle for people living on the North Shore of Sydney and in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It will not be a struggle for people who live at Peppermint Grove in Perth, but it will be a struggle for lower income earners. It will be a struggle for people who have merit but do not have the money. If we want to see this country advance in the way that it should, we should be saying to people who have merit that that is the test for getting into a university, not how deep your parents' pockets are. These HECS charges will have a detrimental effect on the number of students studying for science and engineering degrees. Just recently, members will recall that there was much to do made by the government about Peter Doherty, who brought great credit to this country when he won the Nobel Prize for Medicine. He discovered a breakthrough in immunology that will lead to many kinds of vaccines which will help a wide range of people around the world who have cancer, MS and other auto-immune disorders. Peter Doherty trained as a veterinary sur geon. On the calculations that the government would make, his degree would cost him $27,500. That is how much he would have to pay back as his HECS contribution. But everyone knows that research scientists do not earn much money. So a person like Peter Doherty, who might be a lecturer or part-time lecturer at a university earning $21,000, owes the government $27,000, which comes out of his tax every year and reduces his salary. People who fix dogs and horses get paid a lot more than that. So in the future young vets might have to decide whether they want to do work which will advance humanity or go out and fix dogs and horses and earn more money. What a terrible thing it would have been for Australia and for the world if Peter Doherty had decided that he wanted to fix dogs and horses. It might have been alright for the dogs and horses, but it would not have been much good for the people suffering from cancer and MS. This piece of legislation will put back the clock. During our 13 years in government we made changes which were generally applauded by the opposition at the time. We opened up the lives of a lot of people and we opened up chances for young Australians. We opened up chances for mature age students who went back to university because they could afford it and because they had the merit to get in. But that will now be very hard. Someone who might have great merit but no money, for example a science graduate who gained a PhD and who would have had to study for about seven years to do that, will find that their HECS debt will be $32,900. There will be a lot less incentive for someone to do a science doctorate in a research area which will not lead to a high income if they have to pay off $32,000. These increased charges will encourage people not to go into the research areas which will benefit humanity, but to go into the areas where they can make more money. The introduction of a differential charge depending on what course you decide to study will certainly entrench certain professions as the preserves of the privileged. I think that is wrong. The option to study medicine was available to anyone who met the requirements to get in. But now, when Jane Smith from Lakemba is filling out her UAC form next year, she might end up having to tum the clock back. Instead of having the opportunity, if she is a clever young woman, to study medicine, she might decide to do nursing because it is cheaper and it is all she can afford. The reality is that she should have been able to choose nursing or medicine, whichever she had the merit to do. The cost should not be the issue. The idea of relating fees to expected earnings causes a lot of problems, especially in the field of law. There are long waiting lists to get into the college of law. All of these things will add up to a lot of difficulty in administering these courses and a lot of unhappiness for the people wanting to do extra study. Postgraduate students will be hit. Everyone knows that in today's highly competitive workplace to get certain positions or promotions you need to have a postgraduate degree. The effects of these cuts will be that by 1998 access to masters degrees will have been irreversibly reduced. Fee paying undergraduates will be able to replace subsidised students by as much as 25 per cent of the total undergraduate enrolment at a university. Once again, the government is selling these places to those who can afford it, not having merit as the barrier to overcome to get into university. It was reported recently in the Sydney Morning Herald that there had been an 8.25 per cent decrease in the number of year 12 students from New South Wales and the ACT applying for university places. Students are already being discouraged from applying for courses by this government because of its mean-spirited approach in this legislation. Universities are becoming desperate. We now find that very important universities in this country like the Australian National University, to whose council this parliament appoints people, is resorting to soliciting for donations from former students to try to make up the shortfalls caused by the federal government cutbacks. Quality higher education will be severely damaged and will reduce the effects of the extra positions that we were able to createthe extra quality-when we were in government. We are seeing some short-sightedness on the government's part which, unfortunately, will tum the clock back in this area. In many instances getting into university now means that we are going back to the situation where what mattered was not how good you were but how well off your parents were. That will mean that people from my electorate, people from your electorate of Prospect, Madam Deputy Speaker, and people from the electorate of my friend the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) will find that their children will have a harder time. It is that sort of mean-spiritedness that the people of Australia would think better of us for putting aside. So I do not think we should pass this bill, and I wish the government would reconsider the unfortunate circumstances in which they have placed people.",119
155,Mr MCCLELLAND,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Barton) (6.54 p.m.)A little earlier in the debate, the member for  number of students undertaking their higher school certificate exams. He said his heart went out to them, as does mine. I remember that as a particularly stressful period. Indeed, in cross-comparisons of stress, it was far more stressful than even a Labor Party pre-selection. It is quite a traumatic time. The fact of the matter is that all students are undergoing equivalent stress. Next year that will be somewhat different-at least for 25 per cent of the students. Before this period of late October and November next year, the universities will want to know their funding base following year. They will want to know that they will be funded for the 25 per cent of paying places which they will now be allowed to introduce as a result of the Higher Educaon tion Legislation Amendment Bill. We can assured that those universities will admit students on the basis of their assessment prior to undergoing the HSC. So some 25 per cent of students will be able to breathe a sigh relief and feel a little less stressed because they will have secured a university place. Literally, those 25 per cent of students will those whose mums and dads bought their places. On 26 October at a Liberal Party convenof tion, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said that under the government's plans Australian students would be able to do what their larly overseas counterparts could currently do buy a university place, in addition to having access to funded places subject to HECS. But it is those 25 per cent of places which will bought that will give some students a signifiincreases. cant advantage or privilege in life. As the member for Watson (Mr Leo people MCLeay) said, not too many of those students will come from our electorates. They will come from the north shore, the eastern subsystem urbs and the wealthy areas. Regrettably, are introducing a significant demarcation based on privilege. The remaining of students will have what would otherwise be 100 per cent of places available to them reduced by 25 per cent, because those 25 per cent of places will be sold from underneath them. On any objective analysis, that is chronically unfair and, indeed, a significant retardation of the future and universal development of Australia's talent base. Most of us here are familiar with the background to the higher education contribution scheme. It was introduced as a result of a recommendation of the committee on higher education funding in April 1988. The principle behind the HECS was that education was not only to the public benefit but it also bestowed a private benefit in access to career opportunity and hence it was appropriate for students to contribute something to their own education. That has pretty well obtained for the universal acceptance. But the challenge, successfully met, was in fee keeping the HECS level at one which did not preclude or impose an undue financial burden students such that, provided all Australian rest students, as the member for Watson said, satisfied the merit test of academic achievement, they could access university and hence open the door to their dreams and career of aspirations. The repayments required under the Labor government's regime did not lock into place until those aspirations were realbe ised-until the student reached a level considerably above average weekly earnings. This government has reduced it to a level even below basic minimum award conditions today. Virtually as soon as a student leaves university, even if they have a particulow paying job, they will be required to and start locking into the repayment regime. The explanatory memorandum to the bill says that current students-those enrolled prebe 1997-will not have any unanticipated fee Their current costs will be frozen. That just is not the case. There are 750,000 with HECS obligations, together with about 400,000 current students, and perhaps as many users again of the higher education since 1989. Because the threshold has we been lowered from approximately $28,000 to $20,000, the obligation to repay is going to be 75 per cent locked in much earlier. The Australian National University has estimated that the obligation to meet the earlier payment deadline will cause increases of between five and 12 per cent to the HECS debt of existing students. It is unquestionably a misrepresentation to say that current students will not be affected. On pure numbers participating in this debate, the opposition would win hands down-there were only four speakers, together with the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), for the government. That is an indication in itself, one surmises, of the uneasiness many genuine government backbenchers have with the government's actions. The rationale for this bill, given by several speakers, including the Prime Minister, is what the Prime Minister said to the Liberal Party convention on 26 October: What is the social justice of saying to a person on $30,000 a year whose children don't want to go to university ... we are going to use your taxes to ensure that people on $150,000 a year don't have to make any contribution to their children's sity education. That is just a silly analysis in the first place because less than one per cent of wage earners earn $150,000. Presumably you are talking about less than one per cent of the university population. Fundamentally, the Prime Minister's comment is extremely short-sighted. People earning $30,000 a year would say, 'We appreciate that we are in a very competitive world.' Education has given Australia a very significant competitive advantage. We are all in it together. The interests of Australia are our interests. It is why our manufacturing base is based on technology and skill. It is why, if I become ill, I will have access to high quality and technologically advanced medical treatment and skilled medical practitioners. We have scholars teaching languages and the social sciences so that we can relate with the rest of the world and, hence, participate as a member of the international political community and the international trading community. It all arises from education. The more talented your people are, the more successful a nation has to be. Even though one's children may not be going to university, everyone benefits from other children going to university because of the effect it has on our overall skills base. Most Australians are intensely proud to see their next-door neighbour's children go to university. I frequently go to functions and am met by name-droppers-name-droppers in the most pleasant sense: aunties and uncles name-dropping their niece or nephew who has been admitted to university. They are intensely proud of that fact, and so they should be. The Prime Minister's comment that there is some sort of resentment on the part of lower income earners to make a contribution, however slight that may be when compared with the totality of overall government expenditure, to develop the skills base of other children, is extremely short-sighted. He is fostering-with respect-selfishness and, what is worse perhaps, it is the commencement of fostering division and resentment. That is an unhealthy thing to introduce into Australian society. It univer- has not existed up until today. The structure of the bill itself is based on an extremely complex banding system. The member for Watson went through that charging structure. Basically, HECS contributions will jump from $2,487 currently to $3,300. If a student is undertaking computing or a science course, that figure will jump to $4,700. If a student is undertaking law or medicine or one of the government's perceived high income earning courses, it will jump to $5,500 or the equivalent of $11,000 gross for a family's budget, depending on their income level. Whatever it is, in anyone's book, $5,500 or $11,000 over a five-year period, if they are undertaking law or medicine, it is a significant additional burden that a young person will have as soon as they finish university. That is a time when they are thinking about setting up a practice and possibly thinking about setting up a home. It will be a significant disadvantage for very many Australians. Again, it will not be for those who are fortunate enough to have their parents pay the HECS contribution-but there would be very few students in my electorate who would have that lUxury. The reality is, as a number of speakers have pointed out, that already there has been a decline of about 8.25 per cent in the number of students from New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory who have applied for university places. An article appearing in the Sydney Morning Herald of 4 October this year reported a spokesman for the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, as agreeing that that drop could be put down to the higher HECS charge. That was an astounding admission. It indicated the commencement of a fundamental structural change in the skills base of the nation. Effectively, in one year, the government has caused, by its cuts, an 8.25 per cent reduction in the potential future skills base from New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory alone. That will have a significant effect on teacher education, particularly on those in the expensive band subjects of science and computing. On 2 October this year, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, said that the government would begin a review of the university education of teachers. On 23 October he was reported on the ABC's 7.30 Report as saying that Australia would face a teacher shortage by the year 2005. Indeed, Barbara Preston, a researcher for the Australian Council of Deans, has said that there will be a 5,000 teacher shortage by the end of this decade. In that context, what is happening in my electorate of Barton with the St George Campus of the University of New South Wales is particularly alarming. As a result of the government's cuts-although we are still waging the fight-it looks as though the days of the campus could be numbered, and it is one of the premier teaching institutions in Australia, indisputably so in primary education and in the technology it utilises to assist primary teachers to communicate with their students. In a document prepared by the University of New South Wales called Options 2000, the university said: The issue of the Government's Budget statement higher education has dealt the University an enormous challenge to survive and prosper in the face of significant funding cuts. Lest there be any doubt that the government's actions have caused those problems, I can say that they certainly were not there until this government's budget cuts-some of which are to be implemented by this bill--came into force. The whole shift in the higher education policy has meant that universities will become effectively private enterprises chasing the dollar. Obviously, if you are going to attract the dollar, you need to market yourself. Hence, in this Options 2000 document, there is a reference to the need to attract high quality students. It says: The University of New South Wales' ability to attract high performing students will be reliant on its national and international image as a university of substance with high educational standards. Later in the report it says: It is the belief ... that students are attracted to a university which is seen to contain only the most prestigious faculties and the most able staff. The emphasis of these universities, of necessity-because they are being transformed overnight into private money-making ventures-will be prestige and image. They are not about educating our future talent base as required by our society generally; they are about concentrating on the glamour courses because the glamour courses attract those funds. Regrettably and, I believe, short-sightedly, the University of New South Wales does not see the St George Campus as a glamour course provider. Nonetheless, it is these cuts which has caused the trauma to the university system. By and large, it is the regional universities which will suffer in the short term but, longer term, the inequality being introduced into our education system and the reduction in access to training will affect the talent base of the nation as a whole.",123
156,Dr LAWRENCE,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Fremantle) (7.14 p.m.)I want to speak this evening not just about the specifics of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill but of the principles that underlie it. It is always important to try to on establish the context in which policy, if one can dignify this bill with that name, is made. It is important to recognise that before the government brought in these changes we had one of the most accessible higher education sectors in the world-one which was growing and one where more and more people were getting access to higher education. I remember in the early 1980s that we had only 350,000 higher education students. It has risen to 630,000 this year. That is a very significant increase which is driven partly by increases in funding but also by state governments putting their noses to the grindstone and ensuring an increase in school retention rates. We have seen a revolution in access to higher education and the retention of students to the point where they can contemplate undertaking higher education. What we see here is a clear reversal of that trend. I think we all want to ask why. Why is this happening? What is the philosophy that underpins this decision? Surely it is not possible that the conservatives want to reduce Australian citizens' access to higher education. I think it is an attempt to simply reduce access for some citizens. It is worth examining the ideology that lies behind the Liberal's cuts to higher education funding, particularly in light of today's debate on tolerance and inclusiveness. It is quite clear to me from listening to ministers responsible, to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on radio recently and to other members who have spoken in the House that the conservatives see education principally as conferring individual financial benefit and, therefore, it is more appropriately funded by the individual, regardless of their ability to pay, given the benefit that education is said to confer on their income earning capacity. As the last speaker, the honourable member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) indicated, the Prime Minister went so far as to say that those people who do not, for one reason or another, currently participate in higher education resent paying taxes that go to higher education. I must say that that is a sentiment that I have never encountered. Every family that I have encountered, rich or poor, irrespective of whether or not they have a history of participation in higher education, understands the importance of higher education, university education in particular, not just to their own family members-their children or indeed themselves if they were fortunate enough to find a mature age place-but to society as a whole. There has never been any doubt in my mind that this was a tax dollar that nobody minded going to this very important enterprise in our community. I think the government has overlooked the general public good that flows from higher education. It is a theme that I have outlined in recent days and will return to over and over again. It is missing in the government's thinking in terms of education-higher education or school educationhousing and health. General public good is derived from comprehensive and quality higher education. Individuals certainly benefit, but as a whole we all benefit more. When I was thinking about this it brought to my mind John Kenneth Galbraith's gloomy aphorism that 'policies of this kind lead to private opulence and public squalor'. The more you withdraw public funding from education, health and housing and insist that the individual pay his or her way the more you will end up with private opulence and public squalor. Reading between the lines-and it is interthe esting that so few members of the government wanted to speak on this bill-it is interesting to find that part of the ideology behind this legislation is not just about the individual contributing, the individual financial benefit and the ignorance of public good but an attempt to marginalise and scapegoat so-called minority groups. We have seen it happen with Aboriginals in this country. We have seen it happen with migrants. Another handy target are the unemployed. There was a lot of bashing of unemployed people when the government first got in. They have been silent recently. Students and academics also make a handy target. It is easy to stereotype the others in the community-the people who are not, according to the Prime Minister, mainstream. When I was thinking about the way this influences education and other policy, I was reminded of the notorious memo that Pat Buchanan, a far right wing presidential candidate until he was knocked out, wrote when he was a speech writer for Nixon. He sent a memo to Nixon saying, 'If we tear the country in half, we can pick up the bigger half.' In my view that is precisely what is underpinning, albeit in some cases unconsciously, the programs and the philosophies of this government. It has all the hallmarks of an exploitative and cynical attempt to divide and conquer. Dividing and conquering politics is very familiar. We have seen it in the United States. We have seen it in countries that have turned to totalitarian governments. I am not suggesting that it will go that far. But to tear the country in half and pick up the bigger half is really what the Prime Minister is talking about when talks about the mainstream and the rest. As Hughes put it in his excellent essay: To divide a polity you must have scapegoats and hate objects-human caricatures that dramatise the differences between them and us. Students make a handy target especially if, as the Prime Minister argues, they are children of the ratbag middle class. They are the children who run around with long hair, dirty clothing, look a bit worse for wear and shout and yell and thump on the Prime Minister's car. That is all the more reason to marginalise them. Again to Hughes's colourful imageryand I think this is a critical point in our history: Like fungal spores in the soil, these repressive tendencies are always therethat is, the repressive tendencies in the communityalways latent, always capable of fruiting overnight given the right conditions. In other words, if you encourage bigotry, separatism and division there will be people in the community who will respond to that vigorously. That is what we are seeing at this moment. In fact these latent spores that Hughes talks about, and which are in our community too, have a tenacity that tends to deflate one's optimism about moral progress in the 20th century. Listening to the Prime Minister today deflated any optimism I had about moral progress. A more limp-wristed, milquetoast response to such an important issue I have not seen in a very long time. This kind of reaction that we are seeing following the speech of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and the Prime Minister's halfhearted response to it, talkback radio's response to it and the encouragement that has been given to these fungal spores shows that this kind of reaction lives by personifying the social fears of others. It is handy to scapegoat someone: 'If I am frightened, it is better if I can put the label on someone else. If I am fearful of my future it helps to be able to say that it is the fault of the Asian migrants, the Aborigines, the ratbag students or the migrants.' It is somebody else's fault. It enables people to step back from the problem and not identify the real source of that problem. It gives human shape to the amorphous anxieties of our time. I tie this back to education because not only are they a target in this budget-the common good is being set aside-but the very tangible effects of these views are already seen in our education exports. I am sure many members would have heard the reports recently in Singapore, when our major institutions were holding an education expo. I was Minister for Education in Western Australia when we first started to export education places into the region. We were very proud to be at the forefront of that, but we knew that one of the things we had to do was to send a clear message that we did not in any way tolerate racism or bigotry in our country. We would do everything we could to make the people from the region feel at home. We acknowledged that in the past there had been policies in our own country; indeed, there remained attitudes that were hostile to people, particularly people of non-English speaking and of Asian descent. That message has been undermined to the extent that, at that education expo just a couple of weeks ago, former students who were alumni of Australian universities and prospective students were expressing a great deal of concern about how comfortable today's Singaporeans would feel undertaking studies in Australia. That is a great shame. It is a great disgrace that the current political debate has already produced that response. These are not unsophisticated or ill informed people, as the Prime Minister would have us believe many of the commentators in the region are. These are people who know Australia. They have lived here, and they understand that there are sentiments in this country which can be exploded into hostility. They do understand, too, that a leader can quell them; a leader can calm them; a leader can heal them. They also know the Prime Minister has actively and deliberately not done that. In my view, he did not do it today either. I think it is important that we look at the changes to education that we are contemplating here with an eye to those sorts of philosophies, principles-if you want to call them that-and certainly attitudes that sees education as principally for individual benefit and, therefore, to be funded by the individual, that ignores the common good and is prepared to marginalise students and academics as if they were the other. As I say, the strand of bigotry that we have seen emerge in our community in recent days will not give comfort to the future of higher education in our region either. It is one of the fastest growing exports that this country has and is dependent on continuing higher education standards being maintained for Australians-citizens of this country. I guess when you look at the attitude of the members opposite, the minister and many who have spoken, you detect what I would call a pattern of privilege. Perhaps it is not surprising when you consider the make-up of their front-bench. Many have had an elite private school education and parents who, even now, can afford to pay for easy access to university. I must say I was stunned by Senator Herron's comments. When one of the other senators asked who in the Senate had a HECS debt, he put up his hand and said, 'Well, I do. I am paying for my daughter'S HECS fees.' There are not too many Australians who can afford to do that. I think a ministry that contains ministers who do not understand that for most people HECS is a very personal debt which you will have to pay off over time and competes with other expenses in your life is someone who does not understand mainstream Australia. Socalled support for the battlers is undermined by these views. I think many of the members opposite fail to comprehend just how serious these problems are for people on low incomes. They speak the rhetoric of looking after the battlers, but hit them on every front. What I can see here is that the government is hoping that these battlers-'mainstream Australia' and the various phrases that are used-will believe what the government is saying but not what they are doing. These increases in HECS charges, the reduction of the HECS threshold, the differential HECS and the increase in debts overall will hit low income earners most-not only those who in the future are low incomes earners but those who are currently low income earners. Members opposite, the Prime Minister and his ministers, spend a lot of time talking about family values to the point of hypocrisy and cant. It makes a lot of people puke-to put it politely. Clearly their actions show that they value families little. They talk about family values all the time, but their actions show that they value families little-certainly not families who have not had a history of higher education, certainly not families who have to pay the higher costs of child care, certainly not families who will have to pay more for their medicines, certainly not the families who go to government schools. These families are being ignored. So which family values are being looked after here? We want to know from the government how they believe changes to HECS, increases in HECS, will assist families-battling or otherwise. I want to tum to the specific effects of these changes, the increases to HECS payments, the differential HECS, the lowered HECS repayment threshold and the cuts to university funding. These changes have been outlined by several speakers, so I will not revisit them. But I think it is important to underline the consequences of these changes, since members opposite appear not to understand them. In fact, apparently they care less about them. I think the fact that most of the members did not choose to speak on this bill means that the ones with good hearts are seriously ashamed of what they are doing, and the rest apparently believe the rhetoric of their government without intelligent examination of what this will do to our community. We will just look at some of those consequences for both individuals and the nation as a whole, because we need to look at both. Firstly, talent will be diverted from low paying occupations to high paying ones. Students who otherwise might have contemplated going i?to occupations that did not pay very much WIll suddenly have a big HECS debt to pay. Science and engineering are a classic case. That talent-the talent that should be devoted to mathematics and physics and medical research-will be diverted into areas where, while the HECS charges might be equally high, the income earning potential WIll be higher. That is a reasonable economic decision, and I would have thought the free market economists on the other side would understand that. Some of our brightest and best will be diverted away from areas where they should be studying into areas where they can make a quid. Mr Ronaldson-What rubbish! DrA WRENCE-People will subsequently be dIscouraged from entering areas of work where a degree of public service and selfsacrifice is required. If you have a big debt from studying law, for example, why will you turn around and work in a community legal centre, an Aboriginal legal centre and juvenile justice? Last week I had the pleasure of addressing the law faculty at Murdoch University. If you want to find a group of people who are extremely angry about these changes, go and talk to the students at Murdoch University. They understand that their choices for the practice of law are being severely restricted by these changes and that the students who co.me behind them will have an even greater pnce to pay. Those people will not contemplat- to the same extent those areas of public serVIce. Debate interrupted. NA",125
157,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Aircraft Noise",129
158,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"The member for Swan (Mr Randall) and I have had conversations in this place, and locally in Perth, about airport noise affecting Perth airport and the decision by the current government to stop and scupper any proposal for airport noise compensation for those living in suburbs most adversely affected ar-und Perth airport-in particular, those who hve South Guildford and Guildford. The historical facts are quite straightforward: the previous government promised that the compensation program which applies to Sydney (Kingsford Smith) would be extended to other airports-in particular, Perth-and that a scoping study would take place, and that was scuppered by the current government. This is a decision which the member for Swan endorses, supports and proselytises locally. I am pleased to see the member for Swan in the chamber. Mr Randall-Thank you for inviting me.",129
159,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"I am very pleased to be able to invite him here; I will come to invitations later. Since the last time we spoke about this matter, the member for Swan organised a meeting in his local area and wrote to residents in Guildford. His letter stated: As a result of inquiries from residents of Queens Road South Guildford about noise studies and - ir-raft operations in and around Perth Airport, I inVite you to a meeting to be held at my electorate office on Wednesday 25 September 1996 from 5.30 to 6.30pm. This meeting was the subject of a report in the local paper, the Midland Reporter, of 15 August. At page 8, under the headline 'Noise meeting waste of time', it stated: South Guildford Airport Action Group members have called a recent meeting with Swan MHR Don Randall over aircraft noise compensation a waste of time. Spokesman Pat Houston said residents did not learn anything they did not already know. It goes on: The federal government angered local residents when it announced in August an airport noise compensation package promised for Perth would not go ahead. But Ms Houston said the meeting achieved nothing. ""We knew before we went it would be a waste of time. We just went to put our point of view across. ""Don Randall has to say we're not going to be compensated to follow his party line."" That is the key point. Mr Randall, the member for Swan, stands up for those people who live in the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and who are eligible for the airport noise compensation regime, but he will not stand up for people in the seat of Perth or the seat of Swan. In the course of reading this very interesting article in the Midland Reporter, I saw this reference: Ms Houston was also upset that local people had to prove where they lived to attend the meeting. This triggered my forensic application, so I obtained a copy of the letter of invitation that Mr Randall had sent out to residents of Queens Road, South Guildford. I discovered in the penultimate paragraph of his letter that he said: This invitation is only being extended to residents of Queens Road South Guildford. To ensure this will be an orderly and informative meeting, attendees will be required to provide identification that they are residents or owners at Queens road. Those who do not qualify on this basis are asked not to attend. What a very edifying paragraph in the member's letter inviting residents to a community consultation! I repeat: To ensure an orderly and informative meeting, attendees will be required to provide identification that they are residents or owners at Queens road. Those who do not qualify on this basis are not asked not to attend. In this new era of free speech, if you are a backbench member of the Howard government and a member of the community wants to come along to your office for a community consultation, they are required to show their Australia card before they walk through the door or, worse still, they are required to show their mortgage number or their tenancy agreement number. You need your mortgage number stamped on your head before you can go to a local member, or an adjoining local member, and say, 'Excuse me, your government has made a decision that I do not agree with. You support your government's view that you can have airport compensation for Sydney, but you can't have it for Perth.' Before you get in the door, you are obliged to show your mortgage number stamped on your head. What does the member for Swan require from people who come in with a social security problem? Their bank account number? Come off it! The new era of free speech-what do you blokes want? An Australia card? I say to the member for Swan: if you are going to be serious about free speech and community consultations, let the people walk in the door without needing their mortgage number stamped on their head. Aircraft Noise",129
160,Mr RANDALL,ADJOURNMENT,"I do appreciate the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) giving me notice on this occasion that he was speaking on this matter. Mr Smith, in his own words, is a craven apologist for a government that took no action on noise abatement around airports. In fact, Mr Smith, as the member for Perth, does not understand his brief about airport noise. It is something that he is very astray on. If he understood ANEF contours and the footprints of noise around airports, he would understand that he is misleading the people of his electorate. I am interested in speaking to the people of Queens Road, South Guildford, because, if anybody around Perth airport is to be affected by the airport, they will be those most affected. If you look at the contours, you will see that there are a handful of houses that may be eligible for some noise treatment. I wanted to speak only to the people in Queens Road, South Guildford, because it is those people whom this most affects. In order to inform these people, I asked Mr Graham Muir, CEO of the FAC and general manager of Perth airport, and Mr John MCAleer-who is also the expert in this area-from Airservices Australia to address the concerned people in Queens Road, South Guildford. Given that I had been informed about some of the previous public meetings of the member Perth and the way they were stacked by troublesome people-in fact, it was referred to me that people left Mr Smith's public meetings crying-I wanted an orderly meeting where people would be informed. I invited the people who were best in place to inform them. I invited them to my office in a cordial atmosphere to get the facts-not the hype or the rhetoric that the member for Perth has been pouring into these people to upset them. The member for Perth referred to a Ms Houston who said that she got nothing out of the meeting. Can I inform this House that, after Ms Houston had been informed of the facts in the meeting, I said to her, 'One day, Ms Houston, if we can eventually look at this regime, you are the closest people to get some sort of compensation from this. You'll be the first in my opinion.' She said, 'I don't want any insulation treatment. I want to sell my place.' That is the bottom line. She was not really there to be informed; she wanted to sell the place for the best possible price. In my opinion, Ms Houston was not there in the first place to be informed; she was there to be one of Mr Smith's apparatchiks in the local area and to stir up the meeting. The member for Perth has no credibility on this issue because he does not understand his brief. He also does not have any appreciation for the people in the area. It was the member for Perth who, through his local Labor Party, asked the AEC to get that part of the electorate out of his electorate. He did not want the people of South Guildford in his electorate because it is a troublesome part of the electorissue. ate. It is affected by noise from the Perth airport. He tried to handball them over to me. I have got these people and I am going to help look after them and not give them hollow and shallow promises, as the member for Perth has done for some time. The people of South Guildford need far better representation than they have had on this. The member for Perth says there were promises about noise treatments to properties around the Perth airport. No-one promised it as far as I am concerned. The former transport minister did nothing about it. There was no money provided-whether you want to say the next budget was coming or not. It was such an important issue, like it was around the Sydney airport, that the Labor Party should have done something about it during its 13 years in office. But all they gave was warm, fuzzy promises and no absolute and actual help for these people. These people should feel cheated by a member who did not even try to help them out of their problems. The first stage in trying to help those people was to bring them into my office and inform them of the actual facts as to why they are not in the same regime as that around the Sydney airport. The Sydney airport is a completely different scenario from what Mr Smith is talking about around the Perth airport. When he finally understands his brief, he can have some credibility on this issue. But at the moment he must hang his head in shame. Iron and Steel Industry",130
161,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,ADJOURNMENT,"This afternoon in the chamber the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), in answer to a question from the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), made it clear that he does not intend to take any action at a national level regarding the future of the iron and steel industry in Australia. In a subsequent conversation that I had with him, he made his views known to me that he sees it simply as a Newcastle problem. Further, he told me that he had set up a consultative committee of parliamentarians to travel to Newcastle and have a look at the Such a committee was announced some weeks ago by Senator Tierney. The only problem was that it consisted only of Liberal Party members, most of whom were in the area anyhow. The idea of sending Senator Tierney to Newcastle to find out what is going on could be a good idea-mind you, he is not there very often; it might be handy for him to find out what is actually happening locally-but it will be of zero use in terms of BHP Steel. What is happening in iron and steel in Australia and in the world is of major consequence. We are seeing the biggest technology shift in this industry in this century. The shift to arc furnaces that direct produces iron has the potential for the first time since the 1960s to allow Australia to become an exporter of metal. Let me give the House the figures because they are absolutely critical. We export iron ore at a cost of $25 to $40 a tonne. Steel is worth $400 a tonne and more. The interim product, directly produced iron, costs $150 to $200 a tonne. In other words, for every tonne of iron ore we mine, we are getting as low as one-tenth of its value as metal. The shift in technology that is coming through now will allow us and BHP in particular to become a major exporter of metal, not locked in forever to iron ore exports. BHP will say that they are developing at Port Hedland a plant to produce hot briquetted iron-and they are. It is a $1.2 billion investment. That plant will produce 2.5 million tonnes, but passing through the same port every year is 55 million tonnes of iron ore; in other words, the amount they are converting to metal is less than one-tenth. It is tokenistic and it is unacceptable. BHP is reducing the Australian production of steel by 20 per cent. If any other industry in the country said, 'We're going to cut production by 20 per cent', it would be seen as a national issue. If the car industry said, 'We'll reduce production of cars by 20 per cent,' we would be hearing a lot about thator any other industry. BHP is saying that, because it is only in one plant, it therefore does not matter. The more important issue is that BHP is actually dropping exporting. They are basically saying, 'We can't hack it in the world. We'll cut out exports. We'll reduce production by almost two million tonnes and, within a few years, we will be a major importer of steel.' What is happening is that we are changing our profile. We have been exporting three million to four million tonnes of steel a year for quite some years now. Out there the market is tough, and we know that. But BHP is a big player, not some little tin-pot company. Who falls by the wayside in tough competition because of price cuts from other countries? One of the world's biggest companies. BHP is so big that it cannot stay in the game; yet it is also one of the world's biggest exporters of iron ore. This is more about protecting their iron ore exports than about steel production. The fact is that, by dropping out of exports, BHP drops out of the game. It means their best technology goes offshore into Asia and America; it means their best steel scientists will live in other countries. We will be using the old technology of Kembla, technology which is now getting well and truly beyond its use-by date. Unless BHP are competing in world markets on a regular basis, they will fall behind the game. This issue did not come up overnight. It has been developing for years. It is the old story of our companies starting to reinvest. The BHP crisis in 1982-83 was the result of a failure to invest in the 1970s. What we are seeing now is a failure by BHP to commit investment into the next century. It is a major issue of major importance. Of course, it is critical to Newcastle as well, but Newcastle, in the end, is a minor player-this is a much bigger exercise. I am disappointed that the minister does not see it that way. The fact is that we on this side of the House see steel as a major national industry.(Time expired) Singaporean Army Exercise in Rockhampton",131
162,Mr MAREK,ADJOURNMENT,"Capricornia) (7.45 p.m.)The Singaporean Army is presently conducting manoeuvres with the Australian Army at Shoalwater Bay in my electorate of Capricornia. Some 4,500 Singaporean troops are taking Rand R in and around the electorate before heading home to their own country. The Singaporean Army presence injects about $20 million into the local economy and is a big boost for business, which has been going through a very rough period due to the severe drought which has had a disastrous impact on all Capricornians. However, a number of nasty incidents have occurred in the past weeks, which disturbs me and a considerable number of my constituents. On Saturday night a couple of Singaporean soldiers were attacked and assaulted and robbed of their money. There have been other incidents of racial abuse, spitting and assault. While I denounce any form of racial or physical abuse on innocent people, I find it hard to accept one of our community leader's reported comments in today's Courier-Mail and on ABC radio that the attacks have been prompted by the speech of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in this House. If you listened to all the media hype you would think that the member for Oxley has been responsible for everything that is currently happening in this country, except for the poor performance of our cricket team and the Sydney Swans losing the AFL grand final. The member for Oxley did not tell those people to go out and attack the Singaporeans. I have nothing but praise for the Singaporean Army and its personnel. They have always behaved impeccably while in my electorate and are a credit to their country. I have visited the Singaporean Army Base at Rockhampton and have met with their leaders and many of the Singaporean troops; and I have found them to be most courteous and very well disciplined-and they have a very high respect for the Australian people. I do not believe the recent attacks on the Singaporean soldiers have anything to do with the member for Oxley's speech. It is just the result of putting thousands of foreign soldiers in one area-and out on the town-all at once. The law of averages says that incidents are going to happen. If we put 4,000 Aussie troops in a New Zealand town, for instance, there may be similar problems that would not normally exist. Yet we have a strong bond between the two nations, just as we have with Singapore. There are many ex-servicemen out there who fought alongside the Singaporeans during the Second WorId War. They are our allies and our friends, and are highly respected by the people of Australia but, due to racial comments in the media that we see on a daily basis at the moment, these incidents have all been blown totally out of proportion with reality. I am disgusted with those individuals responsible for the assault on our Singaporean guests. I hope and pray the police catch the culprits and throw the book at them. Their actions I condemn; they are unacceptable and un-Australian. But we cannot lay the blame for these incidents that have happened in Capricornia on the member for Oxley. Vocational Education",132
163,Mr MOSSFIELD,ADJOURNMENT,"I am pleased to talk in this adjournment debate about the work of the Blacktown Chamber of Commerce and Industry Workplace Learning Committee. This committee was set up in 1994 to support a number of vocational training courses in several schools in western Sydney. These courses include TRAC automotive and content endorsed courses in retail. The committee consists of representatives from the Labour Council of New South Wales, the Blacktown Chamber of Commerce and Industry, DEETYA, TAPE, state and Catholic school systems, as well as community and industry representatives. These vocational programs form part of the curriculum for years 11 and 12, and allow students to complete their higher school certificate and, at the same time, get hands-on experience in industry and commerce. In years 11 and 12 it is necessary to move away from the relatively unstructured subject courses that apply in earlier years to structured student training and pathways. Schools then have the opportunity to develop these structured programs that are then linked to partiCUlar industries. These programs require substantial learning and assessment to occur at the workplace, for which students receive school accreditation and industry recognition. The committee's role has been to ensure that industry understands and implements the principles of workplace training as distinct from work experience, and that students understand the relevance and requirements of vocational courses. During the two years that the workplace committee has been functioning, these programs have seen a building of bridges between the classroom and the workplace and have resulted in the young people involved being better prepared for the world of work. The committee has liaised closely with industry to ensure quality of training. Strong links have been developed between the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and local schools. Two successful award nights have been organised and were attended by the then Minister for Vocational Education and Training in 1994 and the Director-General of New South Wales TAFE in 1995. The attendance of such senior people in the field of vocational education has delighted the students and given the committee the encouragement to continue its work. Over the two-year period that the workplace committee has been operating, vocational education has grown considerably in the schools concerned. Excellent links have been developed with the business community and a database has been developed to further assist student placements for work based training. Funding was obtained from the ASTF and teacher-in-business programs to employ a teacher for a five-month period to develop stronger links with the workplace. This program also provided training to those workplaces on the procedures and requirements for certification of vocational courses, and liaison with schools and industry to broaden and strengthen the program. Currently, there are 90 students doing vocational courses in building and construction, retail, furnishing and hospitality. The program for 1997 is to further increase the number of students in vocational placements and to provide a service to other schools in the area that will be able to benefit from the experience gained by the workplace committee over its two years in operation. The committee will offer six separate vocational courses in 1997-TRAC auto, CEC retail, CEC furnishing, CEC hospitality and catering, office administration and building and construction. Deidre Matthews, a teacher from Loyola College at Mount Druitt, and Bob Dunn, a teacher previously from Seven Hills High and now Colyton High, have been the driving force behind the formation of this committee. I congratulate them both and the committee in general for the work they are doing in getting students in western Sydney ready for employment and wish the committee well for the future. I am pleased to have been a formation committee member of this group and will watch its progress with interest. Wanda Surf Lifesaving Club",133
164,Mr MUTCH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to congratulate members of the Wanda Surf Lifesaving Club on their club's 50th jubilee anniversary, which occurred on 13 October last. Since the first club patrol on 9 March 1947, Wanda Surf Lifesaving Club members have freely given of their time, amounting to thousands of hours annually to serve and protect the local community. The Sutherland shire is renowned for its beaches, and our bronzed Aussie lifesavers are renowned for their selfless dedication. Wanda beach surf lifesavers are among the best of the best. Wanda's tradition, with its motto 'Vigilance and service', has made our summers safe for those of us who love the beach and assisted countless others who get into difficulties in the water. The friendly and helpful nature of all club members, both in and out of the water, is certainly a trait that the club can be proud of. Wanda Surf Lifesaving Club's dedicated members have recorded many achievements. In 1981, Wanda Surf Lifesaving Club achieved a competition clean sweep never achieved before or since. Club members won the carnival point scores in the Sydney branch, metropolitan, New South Wales state and the Australian championships, which were held at Wanda beach that year. Wanda Surf Lifesaving Club members have carried out a total of 3,772 rescues and gained a total of 3,892 lifesaving awards, gaining 191 of these awards last season-the highest of any club in Australia. The name 'Wanda' is believed to be a local Aboriginal word meaning rolling white sand hills, which is exactly what the terrain was like at the club's founding in 1946. The club, which was founded by ex-servicemen during World War II, adopted the ribbon colours of the 1939-45 star-army red, air force blue and navy blue-as their competition colours. Wanda Surf Lifesaving Club celebrated this special occasion with a luncheon held on 26 October 1996 at the Cronulla-Sutherland Leagues Club. I would like to congratulate the club president, Trevor Elliott, the organisers of the 50th anniversary celebrations, including Aub Vial, the convener of the 50th year celebrations committee, and all club members who have worked tirelessly preparing the celebrations. To commemorate the event, a book entitled A club called Wanda, written by Brad Forrest, has been published. It tells of the heroic feats in the water, on the beach and in the clubhouse of ordinary people who became outstanding when called upon to do so. I would like to congratulate the Wanda Surf Lifesaving Club members, both past and present, on their successes as individuals and, most importantly, as team members of this legendary club. Teaching",134
165,Mrs VALE,ADJOURNMENT,"This government recognises in its policy documents that Australia's school teachers are facing greater challenges than ever before. The information revolution, which is taking place worldwide, has the potential to leave us behind unless our teachers are themselves not only well trained but also kept abreast of the changing technology. Our election document on education quite rightly spelt that out: 'It is our teachers who hold the key to shaping the future of our children.' We also applaud teachers for working to raise both their own standards and, subsequently, their status. In line with this, made a strong commitment to 'the provision of well-qualified teachers through high quality pre-service training'. We also acknowledged that the teachers' supply and demand cycle is turning. The surplus of the past decade is coming to an end. In fact, we are in danger of facing a severe shortage of trained teachers within a very few short years. Already in New South Wales, in the most sought after locations, casual teachers are not available. Schools are making 30 to 40 phone calls to find a relief teacher when someone is ill. Does this mean that we will go back to the days when this country needed to bring in overseas trained teachers by the plane load? Most certainly not ! Yet one necessary function of the government's planning for a better nation is being interpreted in such a way that it would undercut the very essence of our strong policies for the education of our future Australians. I refer to the proposals by the University of New South Wales to shut down its School of Teacher Education. This school is located on the St George campus of the university at Oatley, on the doorstep of my electorate of Hughes, and is attended by many of my constituents. It is of particular interest to me, as a former mature age student, that mature women students from my electorate attend the St George campus in their pursuit of professional teaching qualifications. This allows them career opportunities which would fit in with their commitments to their families. This campus is the only university campus in the southern Sydney metropolitan region. Should it be closed down, the students, particularly the mature age women students, may find themselves in circumstances which will prevent them from continuing their educational pursuits. It is true that our universities are facing budget cuts in line with many other areas, but to use those cuts as a pretext for closing one of this country's leading schools of primary teacher education is vandalism at its worse. This excellent purpose built facility and its funded student places were entrusted to the University of New South Wales in 1990. Now we it proposes to close down its total primary teaching program, put off the staff and use the funded places to avoid cuts on its main campus. The university would then like to go further and sell off or lease out the campus itself; thus it will also deprive the entire southern Sydney region of its only university facility. This is nothing less than an asset strip of the St George campus and one of the worse breaches of public trust that I can ever recall. Yes, it will be the teacher training facilitythe one place teaching the people who are at the very foundation of all learning-which will bear the brunt of the university'S budget cuts. The St George campus attracts some of the highest TER entrants of any teaching school anywhere. It also attracts them in growing numbers at a time when universities elsewhere are seeing their numbers fall. It is a campus which has led the way in programs, including its advanced level entry, which has attracted record numbers of applicants for 1997. St George also has a tremendous reputation for the work it does with mature age students and working teachers who use its computer resources and library facilities to keep abreast or even ahead of today's needs. I believe it is preposterous. given our commitments and given the teacher shortage we may face in a few short years, that any university could even think of closing down such an important and well-accredited facility. I call on those responsible to see to it that the St George campus, the only university campus serving the entire Sydney southern region. not be closed and that its primary cher education program and its other initiatives in teaching be given the support and the encouragement they so rightly deserve.",135

That privatisation is defying the national interest Let me just run through, for the benefit Main Committee, a comparison on the six comparison of Telstra, and our opposition to bill, and our support. The first test is: is Telstra, of course, the answer is no. Telstra market; some 80 to 90 per cent of the market a fully competitive market. With regard competitive, I am led to believe that there Australia, so that is a large competitive market. to 90 per cent of market share. The second test is: can private capital play Telstra, our assessment is no and, in the case understood on both sides of the parliament. The to contribute to the capitalisation of the public is no. Telstra returns a large surplus, which returned to the community in the form of cross-subsidies. public ownership with Telstra. Private ownership, sustainable those cross-subsidies would be. for the taxpayer to contribute to the capitalisation the terms of this legislation that the answer is yes. The fourth test is: is the market structure, such that public capital can be withdrawn? In Party believes, passionately, that the infrastructure should remain in public hands. That is one of the modem time. In the case of CFM, the market not necessarily have a consideration such The fifth test is: is the good essentially non-universal, offs for the community?

In the case of Telstra, the answer I believe both sides of politics are pleased to see That has been the past pattern of of course, raises the question of how In the case of CFM, and whether it is necessary of a public enterprise, I understand from its technology and public interest consideration the case of Telstra, the answer is no. The Labor for the so-called information superhighway the core responsibilities of the public sector in structure, technology and public interest do that it needs to remain in public ownership. without significant benefits and spinthe answer is no. The good that we are talking telephony in Australia, is of course universal, across the community. In the case of CFM, the NA Wednesday, 30 October 1996 MAIN COMMITI'EE good is non-universal. Again, we get a totally privatisation by the Australian Labor Party. By now, the member for North Sydney has probably The sixth test is: is the market without substantial answer is no.

Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Moorooka Electorate Office (Question No. 676) Mr Hardgrave asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 12 September 1996: (1) What are the tenns and conditions of the current lease arrangements for the Moorooka electorate office for the Member for Moreton. (2) How do these tenns and conditions compare to lease arrangements for other electorate offices. (3) How does the cost per square metre compare to other electorate offices. (4) Is he able to say why the former Member for Moreton chose this site. (5) Did officers of his department recommend against this site; if so, (a) why and (b) is he able to say what justification the previous Minister gave for overriding departmental advice. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Rental-$40,800 per annum; Rent review-l March each year; and Tenn-6 years commencing 1 March 1995, with a detennination clause which can be invoked three years after lease commencement. (2) Leases for electorate offices are usually arranged for a 3 year tenn to coincide with the life of a Parliament. However, leases may be negotiated for a longer period on the basis that they include a detennination clause which would enable the lease to be tenninated after a given notice period. (3) The cost per square metre is consistent with the average of electorate office rentals in Brisbane. (4) No. (5) This is a matter relating to the administration of a former Government. Casey House and Scarborough House (Question No. 788) Mr Nairn asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 19 September 1996: What are the Government's intentions for the future of (a) Casey House and (b) Scarborough House in Canberra. NA Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Government is currently seeking public expressions of interest for Casey House with the intention of leasing the building on a long-tenn basis conditional on its heritage values being maintained. Casey House will be leased in its current condition and at a fair market rent that reflects that condition. (b) Scarborough House is currently part of a construction project approved by Government in March 1995. This project comprises the construction of a new office building in Phillip (Discovery House) and the refurbishment of Scarborough House. Discovery House is under construction and due for completion in February 1997. At that time elements of the tenant of Scarborough House, Australian Industrial Property Organisation (AIPO), will move into Discovery House. Scarborough House will then undergo an extensive refurbishment which is due for completion by March 1998. The remainder of AIPO, currently located in Tuggeranong and several buildings in Phillip, will then move into Scarborough House. Questions Without Notice: Additional Responses Mr Jull-A correction to the answer by the Minister for Administrative Services to a question asked by Mr Georgiou in question time on 16 September 1996 is as follows: Mr Garry Nehl Acting Speaker of the House of Representatives Parliament House CANBERRA ACT 2600 Dear Mr Nehl During Question Time in the House on Monday, 16 September, I provided an answer to the honourable Member for Kooyong relating to ministerial staff numbers. I have since been advised that in two respects the information I gave was incorrect. The correct information is as follows: The staffing establishment for the then Minister,  the Member for Brisbane 2. Although a little lower than I earlier indicated, the total staffing establishment in the Defence portfolio in that period was 18, compared with the current figure of 14 for the present Minister for Defence and the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Senator Ray's and the current Minister for Defence's actual staffing levels were/are below establishment levels. In all cases the above figures do not include Departmental Liaison Office-s. I am advised that the staffing establishment of the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, was 32, not 33 as I stated. I also wish to clarify the staffing level of the Prime Minister, Mr Howard. The permanent allocation is 32 positions, of which two are unfilled. An additional junior position employed under the MOPS Act was assigned to the Prime Minister's office for a fixed term from 20 May until 20 September to assist with transitional arrangements. The Prime Minister also has two Departmental Liaison Officers assigned to his office for six months. This does not, however, alter the figures I provided of a reduction of 19% in the number of ministerial staff or the saving of 69 positions. I regret the provision of inaccurate information, and should be grateful if you would have the correct information drawn to the attention of the Member for Kooyong. Yours sincerely NA",170
