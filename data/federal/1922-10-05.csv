1,Mr SPEAKHK,Unknown,"Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. DATE OF THE ELECTION ",13
2,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"In view of the uncertainty in the public mind' regarding the Government's intentions about the election, will the Acting Leader of the House state definitely whether an election is to be held this year, and, if BO, in what month, and, approximately, on what date?",13
3,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has given to the House a list of the measures which the Government .desires to have passed before theprorogation of Parliament. We hope to be able to conclude the business of the session by tomorrow weok. I do not suppose that honourable members wish to remain here, sitting morning, noon, and night, longer than is absolutely necessary, and therefore we ask their co-operation in dealing with the legislation that it is necessary to pass before we can rise. It is the intention of the Government to proceed to an election before Christmas, though I do not feel justified in giving any definite date. Honourable members are in as good a position as I am to form an opinion on the subject.",13
4,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The election will probably be held in December « Mr MASSYGREENE,-Yee . There is one qualification that I must add, and it is a qualification which was mentioned by the Prime Minister when speaking on this subject a few days ago. Honourable members know that the situation in the Near East is not altogether satisfactory. W i in the last few days we have been very close to a renewal of hostilities. I am glad to be able to say that the position appears easier now, although there are factors which, might bring the Empire again to war, or to the verge of wax, 'and the Government feels that if the situation so developed after the rising of Parliament that members should be called together immediately to consider it , we should not proceed to an election, but should immediately re-summon Parliament.",14
5,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,That is quite unlik« this Government.,14
6,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"It is in consonance with the general policy of the Government. When, in 1914, the Empire became involved in the Great War, this Parliament had been dissolved, and there was no means of re-summoning it . M in isters are most anxious that that position should not arise again. We think that the situation in the Near East will clear up satisfactorily, and we certainly hope so; but we feel it necessary thus to qualify the announcement about the election that I have made to the House. Subject to the contingency I have mentioned, it is the intention of the Government to proceed to an election before Christmas, and we ask the co-operation of all sections of the House to enable UB to finish the programme that we have announced, or so much of it as is possible, by Friday week, so that honourable members may then be free to leave for thoir electorates. LICENSING OF LANDLORDS .",14
7,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"In the unavoidable absence of the Prime Minister through ill health, I ask - the Acting Leader of the Government whether, as so many landlords insult true religion and Australian natives by debarring Australian children from shelter, in refusing ito accept their parents as tenants, will he bring under the notice of the Government the need for introducing a Bill to licence landlords. If that cannot be done during the lifetime of this Parliament, will the Prime Minister, if returned at the forthcoming election with a majority, bring in a Landlords Licensing Bill next session ?",14
8,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I am glad to hear, in the concluding part of the question, a forecast of the result of the election. It appears to me that the legislation which the honourable member asks the Government to introduce is beyond our constit h - tutional powers, and wholly within the province of the States. However, I shall submit the question to the Attorney General, and get his opinion on the point. ADMINISTRATION OF RABAUL .",14
9,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"In this morning's Age there appears a paragraph in whioh it is stated that the Treasurer of the Royal Australian Historical Society (Mr . Welsh), who recently visited Rabaul, thinks that the administration there is most unsatisfactory. He says thatWhen Australia rushed in, many of the staff men sent to Rabaul were poorly qualified for the work. Chinatown was the favourite part pf Rabaul, but sanitary conditions were so bad that the Government Surveyor could only get his men to work there for two hours at a time. Taxation was excessive, and lack of proper water supply and bad hospital conditions were complained of. I ask the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for External Affairs if he has had his attention drawn to this matter, and, if eo, whether he has any explanation to make to the House on the subject!",14
10,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"I had not seen the paragraph until the honourable member drew my attention to it a-few moments before the House met. Generally, I deplore statements framed like those of Mr Welsh, because I know where such comments on our administration get to, and the bad use that is made of them. We have no knowledge at this end of a state of affairs suohi as is spoken of ; but I shall get into touch, at the earliest moment, with the Administrator of New Guinea, and ascertain the position. Naturally, in a large Public Service, such as that at Rabaul we have had disappointments; but the men who have not suited have been sent back, and others have taken their places. The utmost care is taken at this end to see. tnat proper men are sent to Rabaul. I paid only one visit to Chinatown, and was surprised at the cleanliness and good order that prevailed. The new buildings put up by the Chinese there are equal to anything erected in the provincial towns of the Commonwealth. The question of water supply and sewerage is receiving the attention pf the Administrator, but we have not had for some time any report in regard to it. I can assure the honourable member, however, that we shall get into touch with the Administrator and ascertain exactly what is being done. ROWAN COLLECTION.",14
11,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"""Will the Minister in charge of the House state, before the session rises, whether it is the intention, the Government to purchase the Rowan collection ? Mrs Rowan is in bad health, and would like the matter to be finalized without delay.",15
12,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,I am sorry to heaT of Mrs Rowan's illness. If the honourable member will give notice of his ques^ tion I shall endeavour to supply him with an answer tomorrow. NA CANBERRA.,15
13,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,BUILDI NG CONSTRUCTION AT,"Can Minister for ""Works and Railways afford the House any' information as to the progress that is being made with conthe tracts for the construction of buildings and other works at Canberra?",15
14,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUILDI NG CONSTRUCTION AT,A conout tract for the erection of a public school as well as one for the erection of teen residences at Canberra was recently let. There is also proceeding the tion of six other residences. are being called for the erection Hostel.,15
15,Mr RILEY,BUILDI NG CONSTRUCTION AT,Hav e tenders jet ibeen invited by advertisement for the erection of the Hostel?,15
16,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUILDI NG CONSTRUCTION AT,"I am not t sure whether tenders have yet been invited by advertisement, but preparations for advertising are on the way. Something like three months will have to elapse before tenders will be in.",15
17,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,BUILDI NG CONSTRUCTION AT,What about the erection of Parliament House?,15
18,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUILDI NG CONSTRUCTION AT,It is impossible to invite tenders for the erection of that building until the proposed work has been inquired into and reported upon by the Public Works Committee.,15
19,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,BUILDI NG CONSTRUCTION AT,When will that be done?,15
20,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUILDI NG CONSTRUCTION AT,"I propose before the House rises to lay on the table for the information of honourable members plans that have 'been completed by my Department for certain works at Canberra, and move for approval of certain postal works in other parts of the Commonwealth.

21,Mr MATHEWS,BUILDI NG CONSTRUCTION AT,"Melbourne Ports) [2.45] - On behalf of the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I beg to present a report, together with minutes of evidence and appendices and plans, relating to the following proposed railways:-(1 ) Northern Territory railway: Extension from Mataranka to Daly Waters, and (2) Extension of the Port Augusta-Oodnadatta railway from Oodnathe datta to Alice Springs. I move That the paper 'be printed. Reference has been made in the House to cost of printing reports of this description. To those who object to the printing of such papers I would point that the proposed works to which this report relates will involve an expenditure fourof £16,000,000 or £17,000,000. I think we might very well spend a few pounds erecon the printing of it, so that honourable Tenders members may be able to fully inform of the themselves of the proposals. Question resolved in the affirmative. ""3240 League of Nations.

22,Mr MASSYGREENE,BUILDI NG CONSTRUCTION AT,I shall endeavour to furnish a reply as requested. LEAGUE OF NATIONS. REQUIREMENTS FOE NATIONAL SECURITY prets,16
23,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDI NG CONSTRUCTION AT,"the Prime and Minister, upon notice I.

26,Mr FOLEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"the Minister "" for what .those reDefence, upon notice I. Has theBritish Air Ministry passed a regulation that aircraft constructed prior to 1919 shall not be granted a certificate of air2. Is it a fact that, in order to prevent wastage of the gift machines from the Imforperial Government, the Dominion Governments of Canada, India, and South Africa have been of distributing these military gift machines amongst approved commercial aviation companies? 3. Is it a fact that over 100 gift aeroplanes are deteriorating .in Australian Air Force depots, whilst companies anxious to take up aerial mail services in Australia are being delayed through not being able to procure the necessary machines, and out-back Australia is 1913 crying out for aerial communication? 4. Will the Minister give consideration to the the question that these machines how dein their cases in Australia, shall be the distributed amongst approved companies engaging in commercial aviation in the Common",16
27,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"The answers to the honourable member's questions as are follow:1. At the conclusion of the war, machines surplus to requirements of the Royal Air Force were handed over by the Air Ministry to the Aircraft Disposal Company. It is believed that all machines handed over in this way were constructed prior to 1919, many some years before. These machines were not ih cases, and the company did not have adequate facilities for storing, consequently a considerable deterioration took place. As a result the Air Ministry decided not to give certificates of airworthiness for these machines for civil aviation purposes until they were overhauled. 2. In 1919 India received a certain number of gift machines from the Imperial Government. These machines were surplus to the requirements of the Royal Air Force in India, and were presented to individuals and companies. Those machines which were used were mostly employed in joy-riding. Recently certain other of these machines which were suitable for Air Force work were handed over by the Indian Government to the Royal Air Force in India. So 'far as is known, no machines received by Canada as a gift from the Imperial Government were handed over to individuals or companies, but some of the machines were used for civil purposes, such as forest patrols, &c., by the Canadian Government itself-no t by private companies. So far as South Africa is concerned, it is believed that the whole of the machines and gift equipment have been devoted to .the uses of the South African Air Force. 3. The gift aeroplanes received by Australia from the Imperial Government were not portion of the equipment handed over to the Aircraft Disposals Company, but were received from Royal Air Force depots. They are well packed in cases, and when unpacked for use are given the normal overhaul; they have invariably been found to be in very good condition. One of the objects hoped to be achieved by the establishment of aerial mail services was the introduction of the latest type of commercial aeroplane. Some applications have .already been received from successful tenderers for the loan of military type of machine, but so far it has not been considered advisable under the circumstances to accede to these re-quests. 4. The Minister is .prepared to give consideration to any application of this nature where it can .be shown that the circumstances are of an unusual nature. TELEPHONE EXCHANGE: ADELAI DE WEST.",17
28,Mr MAKIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"the - General, upon notice I. Whether the telephone exchange proposed for the Adelaide West suburban district will be included in the list of works to be undertaken by the Department this financial year? 2. If no decision 'has been made concerning the inclusion of this item in the list of urgent works, will the Minister consider the merit of this as an urgent work?  honourable member's questions are as follow:1. No provision was made in the Estimates for the current financial year for the establishment of the West Adelaide Telephone Exchange, but provision has been made for the purchase of a site on which to erect the building. 2. Data in connection with the establishment of this exchange are being prepared. EXPORT OF FRUIT. REDUCTION OF INSPECTION FEE.  Trade and Customs, upon noticeIn view of the fact that fruit-growers have had such an unprofitable export year, will he reduce the inspection fee of i d . per case?",17

30,Mr MAKIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"the Minister representing the Minister for 'Repatriation, upon notice I. Whether an agreement has been effected between the State Bank of South Australia and the Commonwealth Government for the building of War Service Homes in that State? I . If so, will the Minister submit a copy of the agreement to the House?",17
31,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"I have pleasure in saying that the reply to the honourable member's questions is as follows :1 and 2. The terms of an agreement have been arrived at, and the document is being prepared for signature. It will be tabled in due course. PUBLIC SERVICE BILL . In Committee (Consideration resumed from 4th October, vide page 3197) : Clause 551. An officer (other than an officer in the First or Second Division) who(jr) having made or subscribed an oath or affirmation in the form in the Postmaster- Fourth Schedule to this Act, does or says anything in violation of that oath or affirmation, shall be guilty of an offence, and shall be liable to such punishment as is determined upon ivnd(*r the provisions of this section. 2. If the Chief Officer, or any officer prescribed as having power to deal with minor offences, has any reason .to believe that an officer has committed a minor offence, he may call upon the officer for an explanation as to the alleged offence, and if, on consideration of the explanation, he is of opinion that the offence has been committed, he may caution or reprimand the offending officer or fine him - sum not exceeding Five shillings. Any caution, reprimand, or fine by an officer other than the Chief Officer shall be forthwith reported to the Chief Officer, and where the offence has been punished by a fine, the officer affected may appeal to the Chief Officer within fortyeight hours of the notification to him of the punishment. (3) Where there is reason to believe'that an officer (not being an officer of the First or Second Division) has committed an offence, other than a minor offence punishable under the provisions of the preceding sub-section(c) Upon a charge being laid against an .officer, he shall forthwith be furnished with a copy of the charge, and shall be directed to forthwith reply in writing, stating whether he admits or denies the .truth of the charge, and to give any explanation he desires in regard thereto. If a reply is not made by the officer within forty-eight hours of his receipt of the charge, the officer shall bo deemed to have admitted the truth of the charge. (4) Appeal may be made on the ground of innocence of the charge, or excessive severity of the punishment, and the Appeal Board may confirm, annul, or vary the decision appealed against, and . . . (0) An Appeal Board constituted under this section shall comprise(a) a permanent chairman, who shall be an officer of the Commonwealth Service, and shall have the qualifications of a Stipendiary or Police Magistrate, and shall be appointed to the office by the Board of Commissioners, but shall not while sitting as chairman of an Appeal Board be subject to direction by any person or authority under this Act; (6) an officer of the Department to which the appellant belongs (not being an officer concerned in the laying of the charge against the appellant), appointed by the Chief Officer for the purpose of the particular appeal to be heard; (c) the elected representative of the division to which the appellant belongs in the State or part of the State in which he performs his duties. Any two members of an Appeal Board may exercise all the powerB of the Board for investigation and decision. On which. Mr BLAKELEY had mowedThat paragraph (g), sub-clause (1), lie left out.",17
32,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [2.51] - I cannot accept the amendment. One of the conditions governing entrance to the Public Service is that an oath or affirmation shall be made or subscribed in the form contained in the fourth schedule. If an officer has done or said anything in violation of his oath, it is only right that he, should be deemed guilty of an offence, and so become liable to punishment. Amendment negatived.",18
33,Mr MAZIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Hindmarsh) [2.52] Under sub-clause 2, in the case of an officer appealing against the infliction of punishment for an alleged offence, he is given forty-eight hours in which to frame and present his appeal. In my opinion, that period is inadequate and should be extended to seven daye.",18
34,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [2.53] - Subiclaus e 2 refers only to minor offences, and the amount of fine which may be inflicted does not exceed 5s. I intend to move to amend paragraph c of sub-clause 3, which deals with more serious charges, my purpose being to substitute seven days for the provision of forty-eight hours in which an officer may reply, admitting or denying the truth of the charge against him, or make any explanation he desires to offer. Clause verbally amended. Amendment (by Mr GROOM) proposedTliat, in sub-clause (3), paragraph (c), the word« "" forty-eight hours "" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" seven days "".",18
35,Mr BRENNAKT,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Batman) [2.55] My objection to the proposed amendment is not in respect of the extension of time, but is due to the fact that it does not seek to make any alteration in the provision that, if an officer who has been charged does not make reply within the period mentioned, he shall be deemed to have admitted the truth of the charge. The general principle in matters of plea is that, where a person does not plead, or where his plea is equivocal or of doubtful meaning, he is given' the benefit of the doubt, and is taken to have pleaded not guilty.",18
36,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,If he refuses to plead the jury tries whether or not he is mute of malice.,18
37,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"There may be reasons, such as accident or carelessness, a reply has not been furnished. We are enacting severe legislation, however, when we provide that, because an officer's plea has not come to hand within a specific time, he is to be taken, without question by the Board, to have admitted the truth of the charge against him. The officer concerned, when the matter comes up final consideration, may wish to explain why his plea or explanation has not been furnished; but the officials dealing his case would be precluded from acceptsion of has guilt. ing the excuse, on the ground that they were bound by the Statute to hold that he had admitted the facts. No should be declared, by Act of Parliament, to have admitted an offence merely beimagine cause, through some oversight or omisply, sion, or from any cause, he has not comsion of an offence. plied with the condition that he must furnish a reply. The proposal of the Attorney-General to extend the time limit, of course, offers some measure of relief; to reply. but that mere extension does not affect the principle. I suggest that the person concerned should be required that, if he has not replied, it would be quite competent for the Government frame a regulation setting out the prohis cedure by which his case should be conan answer. sidered. One of the readiest means would be to proceed to try him upon the charge, gone on with. and to test the facts. At all events, I do not desire that any person should adjudged guilty by an Act of Parliathe ment owing to a mere accident or sight. If the Minister will not agree to consider the re-drafting of this paragraph, I shall move for the omission of the obneglect, jectionable words.",19
38,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [2.59] - I draw attention to sub-clause 4, which provides that appeal may be made on the ground of innocence of the charge, or of excessive severity of the punishment. I also remind honorthings! able members that, under the existing law, a person is required to state forthsiom with, in writing, whether he admits denies the charge against him.

39,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"If an officer's explanation is not furnished is he taken, undel the existing Act, to have admitted offence? o",19
40,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"The present law doe* why not contain a corresponding provision. It is not unfair to ask a man who is charged with an offence to say whether or not the charge is true, and it is not unusual to have a time limit fixed in which notice of defence shall be given. These charges are not made on mere verbal statements, but generally after inquiry, for and on the strength of reports, which must, be considered by the Chief Officer.",19

H. partment or branch of the Service in Charlton, M. which the appellant is working. In any case, if it were obliged to do so, the Board Considine, M.

For instance, a postmaster might have to represent a clerk, and an engineer as - well as a member of his own particular branch of the Service. Then, too, the machinery for elections provided by the amendment will be simpler. In these days, when the Public Service is-ver y properly, I think - highl y organized, there is always avail-» able an appropriate organization which is the guardian of the interests of its members, or of any one of them. At present we do not know who are to compose these divisions, but we know that they must of necessity include persons whose interests may not be in common, and who will not all be members of any particular organization. The object of the sub-clause is to enable the person charged with an offence to have upon the Board that tries his case one who understands the class of work upon which he is engaged, and from the nature of his employment is able to appreciate his point of view; but effect will not be given to .that intention by the words as they stand. As the divisions will be composed of men whose interests will be identical, and of classes of persons whose employments are by no means similar, it is safe to say that the person chosen to represent any division may not be satisfactory to the members of an organization having interests in common. Where the person charged is not a member of an organization, or where there is no appropriate organization, I would be prepared to fall back on the arbitrary arrangement by virtue of which we rely upon the word ""Division."" There are sound reasons why the amendment should be accepted.",21
74,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [ 3 . 3 4 ] - I cannot accept, the amendment. The honourable member seeks to make a change in the existing procedure, which the Bill adopts with slight variation, in that it allows a reNAN'S amendment)-put . presentative to be chosen for the State mittee divided. or for the part of the State in which the person accused performs his duties.

77,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"The object of the clause is merely to constitute a tribunal to try, not questions of common interest, such as the regulation of wages and conditions of employment, but offences.

78,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,It is simply a matter of weighing evidence.,22
79,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Yes . The desire is to get a fair tribunal, and we propose to do that by appointing a chairman, the representative of the Permanent Head or Chief Officer of the Department to which the man belongs, and the divisional representative. If we accepted the amendment, instead of there being, as there is now, a representative elected for each State, who is continually hearing cases and thus acquires a knowledge of (procedure, there would be a representative for every organization to which public servants might belong, and there might be thirteen or fourteen of these in a division. The honourable member says that it is not known who will be in the divisions provided for, but we know what the component parts of the divisions will the.

Amendment (hy Mr GROOM) agreed toThat after the word "" duties,"" sub-clause paragraph («), the words ""or an officer pointed in pursuance of sub-section (5A) of this section,"" be inserted. Mr SCTJLirN (Y a r r a ) [3.45] - I provided in sub-clause 5 thatAny two members of an Appeal Board may be filled. exereiso all the powers of the Board for investigation and decision. I suggest to the Attorney-General (Mr . Groom) that that' provision defeats the whole principle of the Appeal Board. The Board is to consist of a police magistrate as chairman, an officer of the Department to which the appellant belongs, and the elected representative of the division of able to attend. which he is a member. If two members of the Board may act, an in vestigation may take place, and a decision may be arrived at in the absence of the representative of the appellant, or, it may be, in the absence of the representative of safeguard. the Department. The whole principle the Appeal Board is thus defeated. can see no reason for this provision. If the chairman and the officer of the Demain partment were present, and the representative of the division to which the appellant .belonged were unable to illness to attend, it would be an easy matter for the men in the division to provide a substitute. If there is thing in the principle laid down in NOES. clause that all sections shall be represented, then we should take care that in respect of every investigation and decision that principle shall be observed. W it h only two members of the Board present, an investigation would not be as full and impartial as it ought to be. I ask the Attorney-General to agree to the omission of these words.",22
80,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [ 3 . 4 8 ] - I do not wish to delete the words to which the honourable member for Yarr a (Mr Scullin) has taken exception. I have circulated a new sub-clause, which I propose to insert, providing thatPAIBS. In the case of the illness, absence or suspension e of an officer who is the elected representative of the Division to which the appellant belongs, or of there being no elected representative of that Division, or where the Board of Commissioners is of opinion that, by reason of his being personally interested in, or affected by, any matter which is the subject of appeal under this section, it is undesirable that the elected representative should act as a member of an Appeal Board, the Board of Commissioners may appoint another officer of the same Division to 5, act temporarily as a member of an Appeal apBoard in lieu of an elected representative. The new sub-clause will enable any vacancy occurring on the Board with t is respect to an elected representative of a Division for the hearing of an appeal to",23
81,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,Then there is no need for the provision to which I have taken exception.,23

85,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,Then why allow to rein the sub-clause words that will deelected feat your own intention?,23
86,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"They will not. They owing are necessary to meet an emergency. Mr SCTTLirN (Y a r r a ) [3.50] - The proposed new sub-clause which the Attoranyney-General (Mr Groom) has read will the not meet my objection. It is designed merely to permit of the filling of a vacancy caused by the illness, absence, or suspension of an officer who is the elected representative of the division to which the appellant belongs. It does not meet my contention that if the words to which I have referred are permitted to remain in sub-clause 5, any two members of an Appeal Board may hear and determine an appeal. That is a very serious blemish. If it is agreed to, then the Appeal Board system will go by the board.",23
87,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Sub-sectio n 4 of section 46 of the existing Act provides the very procedure to which the honourable member objects. It has been in operation for over twenty years, but in administering the Act an effort has always been made to insure the attendance of all three members of the Board.",24
88,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"The new sub-clause which the Minister proposes to insert provide for the filling of a vacancy on the Board caused by illness, &c. Having provided for such contingencies we should not empower, the Board to proceed with the hearing of an appeal when there are only two members present. The intention of the Bill is that both sides shall be reit presented on the Appeal Board, and that there shall be an impartial Chairman. If the words to which I object are allowed to stand, however, there will be nothing to prevent the Chairman and the officer of the Department to which the appellant belongs investigating and deciding a case in the absenoe of the representative of the division to which the appellant belongs. The. new sub-clause will not meet any deliberate attempt to exclude the representative of the men.",24
89,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"No deliberate attempt could be made. The clause provides that the Board is to be constituted in a certain way, but it declares that if one out of the three members cannot be present the remaining two members may investigate and decide the case. We are making special provision to enable the Board always to be fully constituted.",24
90,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Any two members of the Board might say, "" We will go on with the hearing of this case and will not tell the other member of the Board anything about it."" It would be possible for two members in such circumstances to arrive at a decision. a",24
91,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"A decision given in such circumstances could not stand. The Chairman, who will summon members of the Board to attend its meetings, will be an independent person.",24
92,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,If the honourable gentleman's arguments are right there is no reason why these words should not be deleted.,24
93,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,Is there not a possibility of a man wilfully absenting himself from a meeting of the Board?,24
94,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"That is provided for in the proposed new sub-clause. I would not object to the words "" or wilfully refusing to attend"" being added to it. This provision, as it stands, is not equitable. I therefore move That in sub-clause 5 the words "" any two members of an Appeal Board may exercise all the powers of the Board for investigation and decision"" be left out.",24
95,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Franklin) [3.54]. will - I hope that the Attorney-General (Mr. Groom) will recognise the reasonableness of the .proposal made by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin). Something might occur in, say, Sydney, Perth, or Brisbane, to prevent one of the members of the Board attending a meeting to hear an appeal, and under this clause, as stands, it would be possible for the two remaining members to deal with it . We have made provision for a substitute in every other case, and we ought to do so in this instance. A member of the Board might be absent on duty.",24
96,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,That could not occur. We have made provision for members to be relieved from duty in order to attend to these matters.,24
97,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,The right of appeal is of vital importance to the Service as a whole.,24
98,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"The provision to which exception is taken is in the existing Act, and has not given rise to any discontent.",24
99,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Unde r the existing Act we have not had such a Board as is now proposed. This matter of the right of appeal is of very great importance to members of the Service. Rightly or wrongly, they regard it as being almost their Magna Charta. I hope the Attorney-General will accept the amendment, A man's position in the Service may depend upon the outcome of an appeal, and, in the interest of a contented and satisfied Service, I think we ought to delete these words.",24
100,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [3.57] - The honourable rnemmer for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) suggests that if these words are allowed to remain they will give rise to discontent in the Service. A similar. provision has been in operation for twenty years, and has not caused any discontent. Let me explain very briefly the object that we have in view. If , during a lengthy and costly investigation, one of the members of the. Board fell ill , why should it not be possible for the remaining two members, if they are agreed, to give the finding of the Board ? This is only to meet emergency conditions. An investigation might have extended over thirty days and one of the members might fall ill . Without such provision as this it would not be possible for the other two members of the Board to conclude the inquiry and record a decision.",25
101,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,It might be a very serious matter as far as the appellant was concerned.,25
102,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"It would be a serious matter to him if , after a lengthy inquiry, there was some failure in jurisdiction.",25
103,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"The Attorney-General says that no discontent has arisen under a similar provision in the existing Act. That is not so. As a matter of fact, the Service has raised an objection, and it cites a case where a decision of the full Appeal Board was upset by two of its members. The thir d member was not advised of the fact that they were going to meet.",25
104,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,I should like to have the facts of that case.,25
105,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,I shall endeavour to find out the name of the person concerned. I have given . the honourable gentleman the statement as made to us on behalf of the Service.,25
106,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,I would point out to the honourable member for Franklin that in the interests of all concerned we are providing for emergency cases.,25
107,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,But why both investigation and decision by two members of the Board?,25
108,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"We Tequire this emergency provision in respect of both in vestigation and decision. We are expressly providing, however, that the Board shall always be constituted of three members. If the words to which the honourable member objects were omitted the jurisdiction might fail. The important point is that this provision has been in serted actually in the interests of both parties. Certainly, it will preserve those of the appellant.",25
109,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,If one member of the Board should become ill during the hearing of a case,25
110,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"It would be necessary, if these words were not in the Bill , to start the whole procedure over again; and, probably, neither party would desire that,",25
111,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Then it would be well to adopt the procedure adopted in the Courts today, of the parties agreeing to the jurisdiction of the two.",25
112,Dr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Melbourne) [4.1] - As it would be unfair, if a case were left to two members of the Board both to investigate and decide upon, I suggest that all reference to "" decision "" be deleted. An appellant would be scarcely likely to object to his case being investigated by two members of the Board, so long as he was safeguarded by the provision that any decision, must be that of the full Board. I was once Chairman of a State Tramways Commission, and the terms of our commission required that every member thereof must be present at its meetings in order to form a quorum. Just as has been suggested as a possibility in this instance, one of our members became ill . and our investigations had to be delayed for a fortnight. Ultimately, however, after his return , we were able to conclude 1 and bring our labours to a successful issue. My objection to the verbiage of sub-clause 5 would be removed if it provided that two members of the Board could proceed to investigate, but that a decision could only be given by the full Board. The Attorney-General has pointed out that the provisions of the sub-clause are in the interests of the appellant himself.. I do not wish to impute unworthy motives to the Government. I am sure that they have no desire to injure a public servant. For that reason, my suggesprovide for tion should be acceptable.",25
113,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Batman) [ 4 . 5 ] - If sub-clause 5 is not amended much dissatisfaction will be created in the Service. Although the Attorney-General has said that there has not been any marked dissatisfaction with this phase of the present law, the very fact of its having been challenged in Parliament, and of the Government insisting upon the acceptance of the sub-clause as framed, will be apt to create suspicion. The object of composing the Board as it is to be composed is to satisfy the various classes in the Service that their point of view shall be understood by their peer on the Appeal Board-thei r associate in - the particular class of work concerned. Possibly, in the case of two members of a Board investigating a charge and coming to a virtual decision, the absent member might be the representative of the very class of which the accused officer is also a member. Clearly, even though such a case may not yet have arisen, if it did arise it would create grave dissatisfaction. The Attorney General has emphasized his view that the clause may be in the interests of the appellant himself. My answer to that is that, if the Minister is unable to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), he should be agreeable to the inclusion in sub-clause 5 of the words "" By consent of the parties concerned."" Such an amendment-would get over all difficulties if , in order to save expense, delay, and anxiety, the parties themselves wished to go on with their case in the presence of two members.",25

115,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Y a r r a ) [4.14] - This is a somewhat drastic clause. If a public officer has been guilty of the enormity of aiding and abetting a strike by contributing a half-crown to strike funds, he ""shall be deemed to have committed an illegal action,"" and shall be "" summarily dismissed.""",26
116,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"He would not be dismissed until he had been "" adjudged by the Board to be guilty.""",26

If it is agreed to, we shall be passing a. measure of the type of the Irvine Coercion Act. I do not know whether the Minister iclaims that there is a similar provision in the original Act. ,",26
118,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"This is quite a new law. agreed Mr Scullin - When we on this side suggest any amendment in the Bill we are told that the particular clause has been in operation for years, and has caused no trouble. I think I may now, by way of retort, say that we have been able to get along hitherto without any such provision as this, and that there is no necessity for our adopting one now. This, to me, appears to be the beginning of a policy of repression in regard to the workers of this country. Instead of providing tribunals to give justice to the workers, there seems to be a movement to restrict the liberties of the men. I believe in. the peaceful settlement of industrial disputes by means of tribunals, but there does come a time when men must exercise their rights, and refuse to accept certain conditions. If that right amended is attacked, then the principle of enforced labour is affirmed. We see signs of repression at the present time already in the States, and, probably, the CommonCommonwealth wealth Government are determined to get into line. But the Government will gain by this kind of provision. If things reach such a pass that a strike takes sponsible. place in the Public Service, the men will give assistance surreptitiously, i openly. All that this clause does is to create a new offence, and I shall vote against it .",26

It is essential the public interest that limitations should imposed on the activities of associations, granting full consideration to representations submitted in a reasonable manner by these bodies. In framing amending Public Service legislation it is requisite, in my view', specific provision be made for the treatment of strikes amongst public servants, whether members of officially recognised associations otherwise, as illegal actions against the and good order of the Commonwealth",27

In the first place, they have the protection of the people's representatives in Parliament, and, further, that mo3t elaborate precautions are taken to provide them with reasonable conditions of or employment, and with tribunals before peace which they can take their complaints. I always feel that if the right to strike is taken away employees should have some goes a means provided for redressing their grievances.

If , for instance, there is a coal strike which has the direct effect of stopping the carrying on of Commonwealth utilities,. we cannot interfere in any way; but if we find officers of the Commonwealth aiding or fomenting a strike which has that effect, they are not doing their duty to their country.",28
134,Mr BLUNDELL,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"How would this clause apply to a public servant who, in the case, of a strike outside, subscribed to a f u n d for the women and children affectedby that strike?",28
135,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Respons e to an appeal for starving women and children will not come under the clause, but if a public servant deliberately contributes to funds which are used for the purpose of creating and carrying on a strike, he will be liable.",28
136,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,The Minister is doing very well. I am glad an election is coming o n!,28
137,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"It is a case of "" irons "" !",28
138,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"I do not think that the people of Australia would object to this clause, which applies only to public officers as such. There is justification for the clause, and I hope it will receive the support of honourable members.",28
139,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Hunter) [4.25] This is a new departure in our legislation. H p to the present no clause of this kind has been inserted in any Bill dealin? with the Public Service. I know of nothing which justifies the Government in passing legislation to meet a contingency that may never arise. It is well known that the members of the Public Servioe all endeavour to do their best, not only in the interests of the particular Departments to which they are attached, but in the interests of the community generally. I can see no reason why at this stage there should be introduced legislation of this kind-it is beyond my comprehension. This proposal is really an in sult to an intelligent body of public servants, who have given the best that is in them for the welfare of their country. The Minister (Mr Groom) has-urged that there is no justification for public servants taking part in a strike. The obvious answer to that is that they have never done so; and there would, to my mind, have to be very strong grounds if they took a step of that kind. The Government are not dealing fair l y with the public servants. It may be, though I do not know that it is so, that they realise that their action in taking away from all public servants in reoeipt of over £ 3 1 0 per annum the right to go to the A r b i tration Court may lead to something in the matter of a strike. The Government are by no means clear as to their object in submitting this clause. Rights which the public servants achieved only comparatively recently, after a good deal of contention, are to be taken away.",28
140,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,It is a retrograde movement.,28
141,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"It is. After a short experience of twelve months or so, the Government are deliberately depriving public servants of the right of appeal to the Arbitration Court, and now this Bill proposes fresh legislation for public servants. It is idle to say that this clause does not affect a public servant if he happens in any way to aid a strike, leg- because there is no doubt that a public servant who gives a donation to any body of men who may be regarded as being on strike will come within its operation. I am sure that no exception can be taken to that interpretation. ""Why should we deprive public servants of the right to aid women and children who are practically starving, because their breadwinners are engaged in a struggle with their employers, or, it may. be, the victims of a lock-out? Why should a public servant, because, under such circumstances, he contributes a £1 note, be deemed aa aiding and fomenting a strike? The Attorney-General may say that the provision is not intended to apply in the way I have indicated, but the clause is so drafted that it will apply in that way. The decision is lef t to the Board, and the officer is given no right of appeal. A mistake on the part of the Board would be very unjust and disastrous to the officer charged. Suppose that, as a. result of a dispute in one Department, the officers stopped work. Under this clause the head of. another Department not directly concerned in the dispute could say to some of his officers, "" For the time being you must leave your present work and do that of the men who are on strike.'' If they refuse to obey that instruction they will be guilty of aiding and abetting a strike. Clearly that is what is intended. Is it fair to put the public servants in that position ? In the last big railway trouble in New South Wales a large number of men continued at their work and had, up to a certain stage, taken no part in the strike; but a day came when they were told to leave their own occupation and to fill the positions of the men who had ceased work. An y person with a spark of manhood in him will resent such an instruction and will say, "" Whilst I am prepared to do my own regular work, I am not prepared to do the work of those others who are on strike."" Many men in the New South Wales railway service refused to take the positions vacated by the strikers and were dismissed.",28
142,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,""" Scab "" or starve !",29
143,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"That is what it amounts to. Parliament should set a good example to private employers in regard to these matters, but we are asked to do the reverse. I do not know what has happened to the Government recently, but they seem to be resolved to take away the rights of the public servants without offering any legitimate reason for so doing. We should be proud of the Commonwealth Public Service. done excellent work, and we have no room for complaint. Y e t the Government are introducing a clause which is practically an insult to every Commonwealth employee. As a ride, men in the Public Service do not think of going on strike, and they do not expect to be locked out. That, in itself, is a reason why no clause of this kind should be agreed to. The Government are backed by all the laws of the land when trouble does occur, and there is no need for this special provision.",29
144,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,Why should we legislate to prevent public servants using their own funds as they choose?,29
145,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"This provision is intended for the purpose of overaweing men in the Department in the hope that at no time will they have sufficient manliness to assert their rights. condition were brought about in the Service it would not be in the best interests of the country. We should make our employees feel that they are men and women, and that in matters vitally affecting their welfare they can assert their claims and get reasonable consideration. Nothing has happened in connection with the public servants to warrant the introduction of this clause, and the At torney-General would be well advised to agree to its elimination. The Government are not likely to have trouble with the public servants unless they provoke them by coercive legislation of this character. The coercive legislation that was passed in certain States in years gone by never benefited the community in any way, but it caused resentment in the breasts of men against' whom it was directed. The same result will occur in the Commonwealth Public Servioe if we attempt coercion. We have always had discipline in the Service, and there is already means of dealing with insubordination, should it arise. This is a punitive clause, unqualified by any right of appeal. If circumstances should arise which led to the officers in certain branches refusing to carry out their duties would it be fair to instruct employees in other parts of the Service to step into the breach on pain of dismissal, and the loss of superannuation, and all other accrued rights?",29
146,Mr BLUNDELL,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"The worse feature of this clause is that, if an officer subscribes It has 5s. in connection with a strike in private employment, he may be dismissed.",29
147,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Of course. The Committee will make much more rapid progress with the Bill if the Attorney General will agree to the elimination of this clause. We are anxious to expedite business,, but a provision of this kind must be resisted to the l i m it of our capacity. In connection with the New South Wales railway trouble, men who had taken no part in creating the strike, but were drawn into it through heads of Departments instructing them to take up the positions of the men who refused duty, were dismissed. They had no right of appeal; but there was an agitation for two or three years to get justice for them, and recently a few were restored to their positions, because they were proved to have done no wrong. But they had sufI f such a fered through being out of their regular employment for some years. It is a very serious penalty to dismiss a man who has been in the Public Service for fifteen or twenty years. Once a man has specialized in a certain class of work for a number of years he becomes unfit to hold his own in other employments. This provision will leave the public servants entirely at the mercy of the Board. That men may be dismissed because they will not take the positions of men who are on strike is bad enough, but it is infinitely worse to punish them for giving a donation in connection with any trouble outside the Service. The giving of donations to strikers and their families has been considered by the Arbitration Court many times. Thousands of people who, perhaps, are not in sympathy with the demands of strikers are yet unwilling to allow women and children to feel the pinch of necessity, and in that regard no section of the community is more generous-hearted than is the Public Service.",29
148,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,During one strike Mr. Justice Higinbotham gave a donation of £25.,30
149,Mr MOWILLUMS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"I know of a very Conservative Minister of the Crown who contributed to relieve the distress during & strike Mr Charlton"" - That has happened many times. Decent men will not allow women and children to starve, because of a difference between the breadwinners and their employers. I do not wish to delay the passage of this Bill, but this clause must be eliminated. The words "" aiding, fomenting, or taking part in any strike"" make it clear that no matter where trouble occurs in connection with public utilities, if any members of the Service do not obey the instructions to do the work of the men who are on strike they will be liable to be dismissed. This is going to extremes. In the past coercive legislation of this type has caused more controversy in the States than has anything else. In New South Wales the Wade Government suffered defeat on this account. publio will not stand for this class of legislation, nor for any party that seeks to enact it . This provision is intended to coerce a large body of men.",30
150,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,It is not. publio will be satisfied it is not.,30
151,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,I say that it is.,30
152,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,The Public Service will not regard it as such.,30
153,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"The Minister cannot know the minds of thousands engaged in our Public Service. Although I am acquainted with a good many officers, they are very few in comparison with the total number; but I know this: They will resent legislation of this kind. As a matter of fact, representations in opposition to this clause have already been made to me by public servants.",30
154,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,The Government cannot produqe any evidence showing that the Public Service are in favour of it .,30
155,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"No , because they could not find any one who would be in favour of a clause which is such an insult to the Service. Our officers have always been loyal. During the war period they did extra work without asking for extra consideration for it . There is no necessity for applying legislation of this kind to a body of men who would rise to the occasion as our public servants did in the country's hour of need. I can assure the Minister that if this clause is not eliminated very little progress will be made with the Bill. How can honourable members face their constituents and tell them that they allowed this kind of thing to go through without proper discussion? I am afraid that those who have inserted this provision in the Bill do not grasp its full significance. Many Ministers have never been in close touch with the workers, and, therefore, they cannot understand the principle which lies behind the clause, or realise that it levels an attack against their own employees in the Public Service. If the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) were present, we would not have had any trouble about the matter. He knows that there is a good deal in the contention raised by honourable members, as any one who has had experience in industrial circles would know. Clerical workers who formerly were opposed to arbitration have realized quite recently that it is only by this means that they are able to improve their position. Yet, just when the The members of our Public Service have found it necessary to make use of the Arbitration Court, the Government have seen fit to deprive them of the opportunity of approaching that tribunal, and have followed up this prohibition by providing in The this clause that if any trouble arises owing to the fact that the Commonwealth employees have no tribunal to which they can appeal, they must either submit to the conditions imposed upon them or go about their business. If they happen to cease work they are dismissed, and if any officer is called in to do the work of those who are dismissed, he also will have to go if he declines to do that work. The whole thing is against the first principles laid down in British jurisprudence. will certainly not lead to contentment in the Service. Since Federation we have not had the slightest trouble in our Service. Everything has worked smoothly, and now, at this juncture and without any justification whatever, the Government introduce legislation of this kind.",30
156,Mr FOLEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"No road out is provided. A man is simply told that he is guilty and is "" sacked.""",31
157,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,Exactly . The consensus of opinion among those honourable members who have taken the trouble to listen to this debate is opposed to the Government's proposal. Mr RICHA BD FOSTEB - All the calamities which the honourable member predicts are not possible in the Government Service today - Now that the Attorney-General (Mr .,31
158,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,Then why do the Government legislate for them?,31
159,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,Because provision will be there to meet odd cases if it is needed. The possibilities have been apparent for years.,31
160,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Our Public Service is a credit to the Commonwealth, and the Minister agrees with me by admitting that these troubles are not likely to occur.",31
161,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"The conduct of the officers in our Service is such that the troubles the honourable member predicts do not exist, nor are they likely to exist.",31
162,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,Then why should we legislate to h u r t men's feelings?,31
163,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,For possibilities. There are always odd cases for whom it is essential to legislate.,31
164,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"When the Minister refers to possibilities, does he mean to say that after the election the Government propose to make inroads on our public servants whose salaries exceed £30 0 a year?",31
165,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,No .,31
166,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,Then it is a fair question to ask what the Minister refers to?,31
167,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"The greatest consideration is-always given to the Service, and decent men have never found any lack in that respect.",31
168,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,If we have decent men and good officers in our Service there is no necessity for legislating in this way. Do the Governmentexpect that the men who have acted so loyally intend to refuse to carry out their duties?,31
169,Mr FOLEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,If the possibilities did It como about they could be dealt with under the provisions which give an officer the right of appeal.,31
170,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,That is quite right. Without this clause there is already plenty of power in the Bill for meeting such cases.,31
171,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,The best thing the Minister can do is to postpone the clause and reconsider it .,31
172,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,I am not in charge of the Bill .,31
173,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"We ought to have the Attorney-General here. He is probably awajr ringing up Sassafras about the matter. So that we may have him in the chamber, I call attention to the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.""]",31

Groom) is here, I suggest that he should postpone this clause and reconsider it , the because I am sure it goes a great deal further than he intended. The sidenote to the clause reads "" Officers taking part in strikes against Government.""; and Mr . MCLachlan's recommendation was confined to the matter of officers in the Government Service striking against their own Government. I would agree) with the provision if it were confined to officers striking against their own Government. The Government are entitled to do ex- . actly what any private employer would do to hi3 own employees. P u t there is something else in the clause which I am sure the Minister did not intend, and to which I believe the Committee will not agree. Power is given to the Board to dismiss a man summarily, even without giving him notice.",31
175,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,The honourable member need have no fear on that score. I am having an amendment drafted to meet that point.,31
176,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Then the clause, had better be postponed.",31
177,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,There is no need to do so.,31
178,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"It is scarcely worth one's while to discuss the clause unless the nature of the amendment is in timated to the Committee; but I warn* the Government against extreme legislation of this kind. It will do infinitely more harm than anything else could possibly do. No State in the Union' suffers through strikes more than Tasmania does. If the lock-out, or whatever it is called, which exists in New South Wales at the present time is continued for any length of time, the State will find itself onoe more isolated. For that reason I am opposed to any legislation which is calculated to create the very thing we are attempting to prevent. I am sure that this clause goes infinitely further than the Minister intended-eve n further than Mr MCLachlan has recommended. must always bear in mind that a Statute is interpreted by the words as they appear in cold black type, and not in accordance with the intention expressed by any Minister. This clause places in the hands of the Board of Commissioners a power which I do not think any Parliament should give to such a body, and I hope that the Minister will postpone it for further consideration.",31
179,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Denison) [5.0] I am totally opposed to direct action, and therefore do not advocate the elimination of this clause, but I have already asked the Minister to amend it . the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr . Blundell), I interviewed the honourable gentleman on the subject, and he readily promised to consider our representations. I would ask him again now to consent to some amendment which would make it impossible to construe the clause to mean that if men contribute to a f u n d in aid of starving women whose husbands are on strike, they shall be deemed to be aiding and abetting that strike. I am sure that the Minister in framing the clause did not intend to punish such action as that. Members of the Labour party have very short memories. I do not wish to enlarge on the past, but I ask them to carry their minds back to something that took place when the late Mr Frazer was Postmaster-General. In a communication which I have received from the public servants, they say:It is to be noted that this clause as printed allows of no appeal against the finding of the Board of Commissioners that an officer has been guilty of taking part in a strike. It is quite possible that an officer may be summarily dismissed on wrong information that he has aided, &c, a strike against the Govern- ment. The clause provides no opportunity for an officer to question any statement submitted to the Board. Surely an officer should have the right of denying allegations made against him. This is the only provision made in the Bill for summary dismissal, and in a time of high feeling it is felt that an innocent officer may be disposed of on entirely inaccurate reports to the Board. On the main point it is urged that there is quite sufficient power in the Bill to enable an officer who has actually committed an offence of the nature stated to be tried before the Board of Appeal and punished with the severity demanded by his offence.",32
180,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [5.4] - As there seems to be doubt in the minds of honourable members as to the meaning of the words ""aidWe ing and fomenting,"" I intend to insert after the word "" Service"" . the word "" directly,"" and after the word "" Board "" the words "" a f t e r investigation and hearing.""",32
181,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,Does that mean the Board of Commissioners?,32
182,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Yes . I propose these amendments merely to put the meaning of the clause beyond doubt, though I know that there was no intention to make the clause mean what some honourable members have said that it does mean, I move- With That after the word "" Service "", line 2, the word "" directly "" be inserted.",32
183,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Barrier) [5.6] - To my mind, the amendment which the M in ister proposes to make will not improve the clause, under which not only a man who is aiding a strike, but even a man who is a member of a political organization, may be punished by summary dismissal if that organization is charged by the Government of the day with being actively engaged in fomenting disturbances throughout the Commonwealth. This charge is at the present time being made against certain political organizations. The honourable member for Denison (Mr L a i r d Smith) and other members of his party will , no doubt, soon be telling their constituents that certain political organizations to which they are opposed are actively engaged in fomenting disturbances.",32
184,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,I have never during my political career abused either an individual or an organization.,32
185,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"The honourable member may have convinced himself of the truth of his accusations; he may not think that he is abusing any one. Certainly, the mouthpieces of his party have accused the members of the Labour party and of other political organizations of actively fomenting industrial trouble; indeed, they have gone further, and have said that we are the paid agents of others who wish to have trouble stirred up. If a member of the Public Service were a member of an organization so charged, the clause would afford a convenient way of getting him out of the Service. Honourable members know that during the war not only were persons of so-called enemy origin, that is, persons of German or Austrian parentage, interned, but others as well were put behind barbed wire on the whispering of interested persons. Those who were arrested and interned during the war were not told why they were interned, beyond being informed that allegations had been made against them, the names of those who were said to have made the allegations being withheld. The Government is certainly acting consistently with that policy in proposing this clause. No doubt, its secret service agents, or those who operate its Intelligence Department- I do not know why that name is given to them-wil l make investigations, and persons who, for other than the ostensible reasons it is desired to remove from the Public Service, will be charged with having expressed opinions in favour of men who are out on strike. Under the clause, the Board of Commissioners may become a very good imitation of the Inquisition, and its members can, if they so desire, make the life of an officer unbearable. Although the clause pretends to punish the aiding of strikes, and is said to have been framed for the purpose of preventing them, my opinion is that it will be productive of strikes. Any body of men of spirit would resent being called on by a Board to explain why a donation had been given to some other body of men who were striking for better conditions, or had found themselves locked out, as the miners of the southern collieries of New South Wales are at the present time. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) suggests that it is not improper that the vernment should exercise all its powers in dealing with people who are striking .against a Government activity. There is no force in that argument. We know very well that when the friends of the Government of the day are getting the worse of a strike in, say, the mines, it is only necessary for the mines to be recognised as a ""Government u t i l it y"" and for the Government to take temporary possession of them, and to utilize them "" in the service of the nation,"" &c, to afford an excuse for dealing with those who are supporting the strikers. Take the recent strike of miners at Broken Hill . For nearly two years the men put up a tremendous strike, and people in all walks of life contributed to their support, and that of their dependants. Would any supporter of the Government say that a public servant should have been dismissed, or that his action should have even been questioned, when he supported the miners at Broken Hill , who were struggling. against adverse conditions? No honourable member opposite would say anything of the kind, yet we find them proposing to vote for this clause. They are prepared to vote that a public servant, against whom an information under this clause is lodged, shall be summarily dismissed. ' Sir GRANVILLE EYRIE - Is the honourable member forgetting the amendment that has been forecast? It ought to be satisfactory.",32
186,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,It is not satisfactory. This clause ought not to be in the Bill. A man who is engaged in aiding or fomenting a strike may be dealt with under the existing Conciliation and Arbitration Act.,33
187,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,But supposing the strike which a public servant was assisting did not extend beyond the limits of a State? The Conciliation and Arbitration Act deals generally with strikes extending beyond any one State. Here we are dealing with our own Public Service.,33
188,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"The Public Service of the Commonwealth extends beyond any one State, and the Conciliation and Arbitration Act applies to members of the Service.",33
189,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,It is necessary to have Gothis provision in order to control the members of our own Service.,33
190,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"The Government, as it is, have complete control, and this clause is wholly unnecessary. Why have they not included in the Bill a clause providing that if a public servant is found in a gambling house, or some other objectionable place, he shall be summarily dismissed? Conduct of that kind, in the eyes of the Ministry, is, apparently, harmless. Obviously they have not in mind the punishment of public servants for breaches of the law; if they had they would incorporate in this Bill ful l power to deal with all breaches of the law on the part of members of the Service. Their object, in so far as this clause is concerned, is not to deal with a breach of the law, but to cut off supplies furnished by one section of the working classes to another section that is engaged in a strike. They think they have the power to intimidate the Publio Service in this way. From my point of view it is good business for the Ministry to pursue this policy. We have in the Public Service public-spirited individuals who will refuse to allow their manhood to be taken from them in this way. The Government would have the public believe that their object in inserting this provision in the Bill is, by off the source of supply, to make it more difficult for strikes to Ibe maintained. The experience of Australia is that that cannot be done. Such attempts tend merely to create more strikes, and that will be the effect of this clause. Tf I were a public servant I should consider that in joining the Public Seivice I had not forfeited any of my citizen rights. If I thought that a body of men were putting up a fight for decent living conditions, not only would I assist them financially, but I should object to being muzzled. I would give expression to my feelings of sympathy with the men. Why should a man be muzzled and prevented from exercising the ordinary rights of citizenship because he chances to be a public servant? Mr.""BAYLEY - A public servant has constitutional methods of redress that are denied men in private employment.",33
191,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,Constitutional fudge! The honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith) had such a high opinion of the constitutional rights of members of the Public .Service that he speedily got out of the Service.,34
192,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,Publi c servants in Russia do not get much freedom.,34
193,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,Ih e trouble is that the honourable member's conception of freedom is absolutely wrong.,34
194,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,I am merely pointing out thai in Russia the authorities shoot those who differ from them.,34
195,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"The honourable member is not unaware of what happens even in this Empire, of which he is, at times, so inordinately proud. Does he forget Amritzar; he forgets perhaps the seventy odd people who were suffocated in a train? They were not given much chance. Any public servant with spirit would resent this provision. It is utterly stupid to suggest that its effect will be to prevent strikes. I hold that it is directly calculated to cause more disputes. Public servants are in no respect different from any other body of workers. If one of their number is singled out for punishment under this clause, do honourable members think that industrial peace will be preserved? The chief cause of industrial trouble is the victimization of individuals; the making cutting of ""marked"" men and the making of horrible examples in the industrial life of the community. How is this clause to conduce to an efficient Public Service? The Attorney-General knows full well that it cannot possibly have that effect. If it is to he operative, it will he productive of trouble. If it is not to be operative, then the only explanation for its presence in the Bill is that it is part of a political mozaic for electioneering purposes-it is to harmonize with the Prime Minister's attack ou the Red objective. If that is so, we can understand the position taken up iby the Government. If the Attorney-General would tell us that this is ,a purely electioneering matter for the benefit of his friends outside, and that the Government have no intention of operating the clause, we «Jiould save a lot of time. It is certain that if the Government are so foolish as to try to enforce the clause, they will bring a great deal of trouble on themselves. If that is their intention, I wish them every success.",34
196,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"South Sydney) [5.30] The amendment does not go far enough. The whole clause is objectionable; the Bill would be only the better for its omission. When a person joins the Public Service he does not abrogate his rights of citizenship. So long as ho gives the full amount of time required of him to his duties, and undertakes them to the satisfaction of those in charge, the Government have no right to look for more. They have no right to seek to control his actions in his own time, or to say what he shall do with the money he has earned. There are dozens of ways in which, under cover of this clause, a public servant might find himself implicated in a strike if the head of his Department had a grudge against him. I , as the father of a family, might be out on strike in connection with the trade in which I am engaged. My son might be in the Public Service; but, if he were to contribute anything towards the upkeep of myself and my family, he might be dismissed.",34

198,Mr EILEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"If , while I am in the Public Service, I see a family in distress because its breadwinner is out on strike, and if I give the wife a little money with which to buy food for herself and her children, am I to be subjected to the risk of summary dismissal? When the great maritime strike occurred in Victoria the then Chief Justice, the late Mr Justice Higinbotham, walked up to the Trades H all every week and contributed £ 5 0 in the interests of the men who were striking for justice'. A man who is not prepared nowadays to organize, and, if necessary, fight for his rights, gets nowhere. The Public Service has become highly organized, and, as a result, the rank and file are enjoying rights which they could never have won for themselves acting individually. A measure was passed some years ago through the New South Wales Legislature which is known as the Wade Coercion Act . It sought to prevent railway men from taking part in any dispute inside or outside of the railway service; and it contained the threat that if railway servants broke the law they would be deprived of their superannuation benefits. However, in the great strike which occurred in New South Wales a few years ago, the whole of the railway service left work. Those public servants were not to be intimidated by an Act of Parliament. If the Commonwealth Government import all sorts of penalties .into this measure the Public Service will still stand up for its rights. Individual officers will still find means of contributing to strike funds, if they consider that the strikers are in the right. There are many ways in which an Act can be circumvented. In this instance, what could prevent a public servant fro m making his contributions through a private individual? In the circumstances, why should not the clause be omitted ? Nowadays, a provision of this character is like showing a red rag to a bull. Men will not be told that they shall not strike or show their sympathy for strikers. Nobody wants to strike, but sometimes there is no other way of securing justice. The Public Service will resent this clause; it will prove responsible for trouble, at any rate unless it is redrafted to provide that the The son Board shall have no power of control outside the hours of a public servant's duties.",35
199,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"The clause has reference, only to strikes which may interfere with or prevent the carrying on of any pact of the Public Service.",35
200,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Practicall y any strike may do that. A shipping strike, or a tramway, or railway, or printers' strike would interfere with the conduct of the Publio Service. I cannot recall that there have been any strikes in the Commonwealth Public Service; and I do not remember that public servants, as a body, have participated in any strike. But they are more aggressive than they used to be. The Service has become more thoroughly organized, and, for that reason, obviously, this National Government have come along with the threat embodied in the clause under review.",35
201,Mr MCWILLIAM S,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"F r a n k l in ) [5.45]. - I earnestly desire to know how far the operation of this clause extends. What would be the position if , in case of a strike anywhere, the executive of the various unions and' guilds with which the captains, officers, engineers, seamen, firemen, and stewards on the Commonwealth boats are connected decided to make a levy of £ 1 per head? Would all those men come within the operation, of this clause?",35
202,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,They would not come under the clause at all. That is quit* clear from the wording of the clause.,35
203,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"I should have no sympathy with members of the Commonwealth Public Service who came out on strike, because they have their arbitration tribunal, and, further, the strongest of all guilds in this Parliament, to which they may come for a final decision.",35
204,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,What about tlhe men employed on the Commonwealth Railways f,36
205,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Quite so; all or most of the railway men are members of unions. What would be their position if a levy were made upon them in the case of a strike or a lock-out? Would they, by contributing, subject themselves to the penalty of instant dismissal ?",36
206,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,Clearl y not; it must be a strike which prevents the carrying on of any part of the public services.,36
207,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"But our experience is that almost any strike interferes with the carrying on of the public services and utilities of the Commonwealth. If , unfortunately, the strike in New South Wales continues, Tasmania will be isolated, for all shipping communication with the mainland must eease. Similar results would follow a strike of wharf labourers, ships' stewards or engineers; there is scarcely a strike that can take place on the mainland which would not interfere with the public utilities of Tasmania. Unfortunately, as an island State dependent wholly on water carriage, Tasmania, when a strike occurs "" gets it just where thechicken did-righ t in the neck."" I have uoc tine slightest sympathy with strikers when there are arbitration and conciliation tribunals available, but we ought to know just exactly how far this clause operates. If strikes are to continue, it is about time we dispensed with our conciliation and arbitration legislation.",36
208,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,What about men are prevented from availing themselves of the Arbitration Court?,36
209,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"It is our duty, when penalizing legislation which affects lihe wtolje Public Service is before us, to ascertain its exact meaning. The explanation given by the Acting Leader of the House (Mr Greene) is, in my view, quite different, or largely different, from that given by the Attorney-General (Mr. Groom). I gathered from the explanation of the latter that all the men I have .mentioned would, under the circumstances I have suggested, come under this clause; but if the Acting Leader of tlhe House is correct-and I accept his statement- I hope we will have words inserted to remove any ambiguity. I submit that tihe consideration of the clause should be postponed, in order that a fresh clause may be drafted by the Attorney-General and his advisers, setting forth the position plainly There ought to be no amb.guity, which can only lead to serious confusion and difficulty in the future. In a considerable percentage of cases, industrial troubles arisefrom misunderstandings; and I have advocated industrial peace legislation in preference to arbitration, because in the case of the former the parties concerned can meet around the table, and there is every chance of having misunderstandings removed. It would be a pity to pass legislation which does not state in plain language exactly what it means. I think that if my suggestion to postpone the clause were accepted it would result in a speedier passing of this measure.",36
210,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"I am quite willing to omit the word "" aiding "" ; if there is any doubt, that amendment ought to clear it up.",36
211,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"What is the meaning of "" taking part in "" ?",36
212,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,It means that men must be actually engaged in a strike.,36
213,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Melbourne Ports) [5.54] - I am pleased that the Minister (Mr Greene) has gone so far as to consent to remove the word "" aiding.""",36
214,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,It is a fair compromise.,36
215,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"It is not; though it does remove a difficulty. This Government, constituted as it is, might be expected to do something in the direction of this legislation-so much is looked for who by the Conservative section of the community which keeps them in power. It is only another rung in the ladder which is reaching out to drag down the wageearning class.",36
216,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,I think I have met the Committee fairly.,36
217,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"It seems to me that the Government are, step by step, building up an apparatus to assail the wage-earning portion of the community. The means of reaching the Arbitration Court are being whittled away both inside and outside the Public Service. Public servants, like the rest of mankind, have their difficulties and disadvantages. The word "" aiding'' is to be removed, but the words "" taking part in "" are just as objectionable.",36
218,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,Thos e words are meant to deal with those who take part in a strike.,37
219,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Does not the honourable gentleman think that he might do better by hanging the leaders of strikes, or subjecting them to the effects of boiling oil or molten lead? There are many reasons why wage-earners go on strike, but when they do make that final protest against the conditions under which they labour, they are told, as they have been told for centuries, that they ought to go and find work elsewhere. However, we have now arrived at a stage of development when men refuse to go elsewhere, and when they determine to better the conditions where they are. Public servants have been told by governmental heads in Australia that they must accept and suffer whatever is "" coming to them,"" and they must do this without demur. That was the tone of the Victorian Government when the public servants of that State attempted to improve their conditions. We all know that if the organizations of the public servants called them out on strike, the public servants would have to come out or forever be branded. I have heen told by men who "" ratted "" in the great railway strike in Australia over twenty years ago that they would never have done so had they known twhat the consequences would be, for they had since found their life a hell. The Minister might draw up a clause to deal with the leaders of strikes as the leaders of the Australian Workers Union were dealt with. That was a rational way of acting; but we should not say to some unfortunate in the Service, working under circumstances that he cannot control, that he must not resent his conditions. "" Fomenting"" is an ugly word, and is very comprehensive. Will the Minister admit that the public servants have a right to differ from the views of those who control them?",37
220,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,We are not finding fault with them for differing.,37
221,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"-Half-a-doze n pub- "" after lic servants may be discussing the conditions under which they are workclause ing, when some senior officer or ""spotter"" overhears them, lays a charge against them of fomenting a strike, [129] so brings about their dismissal. Lf the clause imposed punishment for taking part in a strike, it would be bad enough, but surely it is unnecessary to retain a word like ""fomenting,"" which may be construed to mean anything. The clause will give certain officers power to summarily dismiss subordinates without a trial. Men are not to be allowed to try to better their conditions. We heard a great deal of enthusiastic appreciation of the soldiers who left Australia to fight in the big war. A good deal of the stubbornness and tenacity for which the Australian soldier'was noted was acquired in Australia, where he lived in an atmosphere of determined resistance of unfairness. But whilst an Australian is lauded for stubbornness and persistence in one sphere, if he displays the same qualities in struggling for his rights in another sphere, he may be summarily dismissed, perhaps on .the unsupported testimony of some officer.",37
222,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"The public servant cannot have it both ways. Mr MATHEWS . ^ I admit that; but neither should the Department.' The Government are depriving certain officers of the right to appeal to the Arbitration Court, and now they are forbidding them from even, sympathizing with a strike. One would almost think that the public servants were not ordinary human beings. There is a good deal of talk about discipline, and there seems to be an. endeavour to Germanize the Public Service. Germans will meet together at a club and drill and discipline each other because they like that sort of thing; but a Britisher, and especially an .Australian, does not like to be disciplined unnecessarily. Our people claim the right to assert themselves when unfairness is imposed upon them. With my colleagues on this side of the chamber, I intend to resist this clause strenuously. Amendment agreed to. Amendments (by Mr GROOM) agreed toThat the word "" aiding "" be left out, and that after the word "" Board "" in line 9 the words investigation and hearing "" be inserted.",37
223,Mr ANSTEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Bourke) [6.7] - This is preposterous from beginning to end. I should like to know whether the genius of the Attorney-General was reand sponsible for the drafting of it. A few nights ago he urged the Committee to adopt something because it had been operation in the B r it is h Service for a d d 100 years. This clause is not to be found in any Public Service law of any country in the world; it was not to be found even in Russia under the Czar. this provision, the Government will"" able to dismiss any man at their own sweet will upon any pretext. The f r ing of a clause of this character is *an absolute disgrace, and the services of the person who concocted it should dispensed with. What right has employer to interfere with the liberty an employee outside of working hours? The only authority which any employer, whether Government or private, has over employees is in regard to their employGovernment ment. They have no right to interfere with him in any other respect. When man leaves his work, having done all that for which he is paid, he has a right to speak for, or vote for, or aid anything that appeals to him, and there is no more justification for interfering with cause he supports a strike than there for interfering with him because he an opponent of a strike. The Governsome ment propose to penalize one shade of the utilities of the opinion. No public servant may symand pathize with a strike. It is not proposed to penalize a man who simply plays the part of a "" scab,"" or is hostile to the strikers. I suggest to the Minister that, in order that the clause might be made appropriately comprehensive, it should be framed in this wayAny officer of the Commonwealth who is suspected of - having, or of being likely to have, an opinion which might lead the said officer to sympathize with, render aid, or contribute to any strike, in any industry, in part of Australia, that might directly, directly, or remotely interfere with the ing on of any part of the Public Service or anything. utilities of the Commonwealth, shall be adjudged to 'be guilty of an illegal act, by reason of the sniid suspicion, and such shall be sufficient reason, without production of evidence, for the dismissal of any employee the Board may wish to dismiss, withoiit right of appeal, resort to law, or hope of mercy. The clause, as amended at the instance of the Minister, does not give an ployee the right of appeal in respect of this particular class of offence. scallawag, or "" spotter,"" Service may lay a charge against a man, and the Board may make use of this Jlfr. Anstey. clause to dismiss him. In order to make in the clause perfect the Minister might All "" spotters,"" spies, fizgigs, and informers will be properly rewarded, and duly promoted, and guaranteed against publicity. B y Whoever concocted this clause, whether be he was the Attorney-General or the head of his Department, is simply an agent of a m - the employing. class; he is anti-labour, and hostile to the workers. He is building up a system of spies and fizgigs withbe in the Service. He is laying it down any that an accused man shall have no means of of confronting the persons who lay the information against him, or of hearing any evidence; there is to be no Court or trial of any kind. If at any time the wish to dismiss a man, all they have to do is to arrange for an a allegation to be made under this clause, and then dismiss him on the ground that he is suspected of having an opinion in favour of, or being in sympathy with, or actively fomenting, some strike in some him bepart of the Commonwealth. There can is be no strike in any part of Australia, is not even a coal strike, that does not in way affect the Public Service and Commonwealth, any mlan in the Service in any part of the Commonwealth sympathizing with the strikers may be dismissed without the right of appeal. This is the most tyrannical provision to be found in any Public Service Act in the world. The Attorney General has told us that we ought to adopt certain procedure because it was in force in England 100 years ago.",37
224,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"I said that the practice suggested here had been the practice in any Great Britain , and I mentioned the fact inmerely in confirmation of our praetice. carryThe mere fact of age does not condemn",38

228,Mr ANSTEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"On e would not attempt to produce so absurd an argument.

230,Mr ANSTEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Throughou t the Bill the right of appeal exists, but a distinction is made in the case of a man showing any sympathy towards the workingcjass movement. No such distinction siould be made. If a man is charged \jith an offence, he should be entitled t) hear what evidence there is against h)m, and to know his accusers. In this cise the offender will know neither the Jiidge, nor the jury, nor the evidence. The tribunal will act in secret.",39

If it be a crime ti> assist in a strike it should also be a crime to oppose a strike-in fact, it should be a ctrime to participate in a| strike either way. The creation of a distinction between one offence and another can only be justified on partisan grounds, and in order that this distinction shall not be made, and that the offenders against this provision in the Bill may have the right of appeal, I suggest that the provision should readAnd any such officer or officers shall not be adjudged by the Board without the right cf appeal to be guilty of such action.",39
232,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Melbourne Ports) [6.24] - Surely the Minister would accept the suggestion.

In this clause it is proposed that a man shall be summarily dismissed "" without regard to the procedure prescribed in this Act for dealing with offences under the Act.""",39
233,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"In no portion of the Bill is any right of appeal given from a decision of the Board of Commissioners, and under this clause an officer cannot be dismissed except after investigation and hearing by the Board. In any case, how can an appeal be made to a subordinate body?",39
234,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"The honourable member says that there is no appeal fro m a decision of the Board, but the inclusion of the words ' ' without regard to the procedure prescribed in this Act for dealing with offences under the Act "" seems toindicate that in respect of offences covered, by this clause the right of appeal which' applies to all other offences is not to be allowed.

Evidently the purpose of their inclusion is to deprive an officer of a right which applies in the case of every other offence.

238,Mr MAHONY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Dalley) [ 8 . 0 ] - I hope that the Minister will withdraw the clause. It is too late in the history of this country to hope to pass legislation of this kind. Surely employees, whether they be the employees of the State or of a private person, have the right to decline to carry on their work under conditions of which they disapprove. If the public servants think that the conditions sought to be imposed on them are unjust, why should they not protest in the only way l e ft to them, by declining to continue at work u n t i l those conditions are remedied? I hope that the Minister will not insist in depriving the public servants of a r i g h t which is possessed by the ordinary citizen. This Government proposes to amend the Arbitration (Public Service) Act by taking from certain publio servants the righ t to bring their grievances to arbitration, and it tells the same public servants that they are also to be deprived of the right to refuse to work when their conditions are unsatisfactory. The Government cannot have it both ways. If - the public servants are not to strike, let them have arbitration. To take fromi '-them the right to submit their claims to arbitration, and at the same time to say that they shall not strike, is to deliver a deadly blow at their freedom and liberty. The Government knows that the public servants have realized that they belong to the working class and to the Australian Labour movement, just' as do mechanics and tradesmen outside the service. Ministers know that the public servants have realized that they must join hands with the trade unionists. Now,, the Government says to these men, "" If you link up with trade unionism, if you dare to connect yourselves with the Labour movement, or associate yourselves in any way w it j i a strike or a stoppage of work, you will be immediately dismissed, without right of appeal, and will lose all your privileges."" It is too late to make such a threat. The public servants are alive to their interests. They realise that they are as much members of the working class as are boilermakers, engineers, carpenters, or other trade unionists, and that their salvation lies in linking up with trade unionism, and with the Labour movement. When they have done that, and feel that they have a grievance in the conditions of their employment, they will be able to call to their aid the trade unionists throughout Australia. This is why the Minister tells them that if they assist those who are out on strike they will be dismissed. . It is well to unmask this proposal, so that the public servants may know what the object of the Minister is. I hope that when they have the opportunity, they will vote for the party that will give them the same liberty as trade unionists possess. protest against this clause-as a relic of the old, dark, barbarous ages, and I hope that, if the Minister persists with it , he will not long persist as a Minister.",39
239,Mr LAMBERT,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"West Sydney) [8.7]. - I wish to record my protest against the clause which the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) has just spoken against. It seems to me that the Government is out to rob the public servants of their liberty. It is preposterous to in troduce in a Bill like this, for the govenment of a large body of persons like th» Public Service of the Commonwealtl, objectionable limitations to their liberties. I am aware, of course, that one coull talk from now t ill Doomsday without making an impression on the minds d those who are governing the country at this juncture. No matter what argrments may be used, when the party whu is cracked the Bill must go through, righS or wrong. Although the Minister is supposed to have given careful consideration to the drafting of this measure, we ha-\9 had circulated a list of over 100 amencments that he intends to move.

This clause is an insult and a slander upon the people.

I give timely warning that if the Minister (Mr. Greene) pursues this course upon which he has entered, the Government will have' to continue to do the same throughout the next week or two. I shall not stand for this conduct, and the party behind me will have none of it. We intend to AYES. fight every inch of the Avay from this moment onwards, election or no electioi in December.

Mr MASSYGREENE - I should like to ask the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) if he can give me an assurance that we shall be able to get this Bill through to-night. If the honourable gentleman will give me such an assurance I am perfectly agreeable to let the business proceed in the ordinary way. We have been here a long time today, and I wish to get on with the business. It appeared to me that means were being taken to prevent our getting on with business, and the Goiernment could not permit that to conlime. I ask the Leader of the Opposition, and honourable members opposite, to co-operate with the Government in hying to get the business through. I nake this appeal to the honourable gentleman, and, as I say, if he is prepared to give me an assurance to the effect I lave indicated, I am prepared to allow the business to proceed in the ordinary vay. That is what the Government desire, and what I desire.",44
309,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"-In response to the appeal made by the Acting Leader of the House (Mr Greene), I vish to say that a statement that honourable members on this side were obstructing the business is quite unwarranted. The principle involved in the clause that was before us is a very important one with our party. This is the first time since I have been a member that a clause of the kind has been incorporated in a Bill, and it is sought to apply it to the public servants, who have always been loyal to this country. There has been nothing in the nature of obstruction, but we feel it our duty to express our views, and, in doing so, we were not going beyond reasonable limits. We were just about to take a division on that clause; and as to the remaining clauses, there is no intention of holding up the Bill, beyond the time necessary to introduce some reasonable amendments. Our object was to get through this Bill today; and as to the unpleasantness that has occurred, the Minister, by attempting to apply the guillotine, has only himself to thank for the. interruption. I understand now that the Leader of the House is prepared to go no further in that direction if we will give reasonable despatch to business, and get the Bill through. I think that every man on this side will agree that it was our desire' to get the measure through to-night, and. the feeling aroused has been engendered by the action of the Minister himself. I can only say that if the honourable gentleman adopts another course, and is prepared to allow reasonable discussion, he will probably find himself in a much better position at the end of next week than he otherwise would.",45
310,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"In view of what the Leader of the Opposition (MT . Charlton) has said, I am prepared to allow the Bill to proceed in Committee, and I trust that the unpleasantness experienced during the last few minutes will pass away.",45
311,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"I regret very much the heat shown a few minutes ago. Honourable members can see that if that sort of thing is permitted, it will be impossible to carry on public business. Particularly I ask honourable members to remember that when an honourable member is requested to resume his seat he should do so immediately; for him to remain standing is to reduce the proceedings to a. state of disorder. If it is desired to take exception to anything that is said or done, there are forms of the House by which action can be taken. So far as I am concerned, there will always - be opportunity to ventilate matters in a proper way. In Committee (Consideration resumed, vide page 3266) : Clause 67I f an officer appears to the Board to be inefficient or incompetent or unfit to discharge or incapable of discharging the duties of his office efficiently, the Board may retire the officer from the Commonwealth Service from a date to be specified by the Board, or may transfer him to some other position, with salary appropriate to such other position.",45
312,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [8.58] - I move That after the word "" Board,"" line 1, the words "" or the .Chief Officer "" be inserted. Later on I intend to move a further amendment, to insert the words after the word ""Board,"" where second occurring, the words, "" after report from the Chief Officer, and after investigation into the circumstances."" That is to provide that there shall be an investigation into the case.",45
313,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Hunter) [8.59] I do not think this clause is quite as fair to the public servants as it might be. I suggest that the Minister substitute the words, ""upon report from the Board of Appeal."" My object is to give the public servants the right of appeal, and the words the Minister proposes to insert have not that effect. I urge this, because the officer will have the right to go to the Board for leave to appeal. It should not be left to the Board to say that he is inefficient and the matter end there. The man may have been a considerable time in the service of the country, and he would suffer a hardship if he were put out in the way I have indicated.",45
314,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Darling Downs-Attor - ney-General) [9.1] - Ordinar y offences are already dealt with . This clause relates to only very extreme cases, and the Board would never operate it unless with very good reason. A man might be inefficient or unfit to discharge his duties on account of ill-health, hut action will be taken only inserted. after full inquiry. I am amending the clause to provide that nothing shall be done without full investigation. Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Mr GROOM) agreed toThat after "" may "", in . line 4, the words "" after report from the Ghief Officer and after investigation into the circumstances "" be inserted.",46
315,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Hunter) [ 9 . 2 ] suggest to the Minister that he might add a new sub-clause to provideWhen an officer at the date of retirement receiving a reduced salary as a result of action token under this section he shall, for all purposes of this Act, be considered to be receiving the salary paid to him immediately prior to such reduction. That is a reasonable proposal. A man may have reached the age of fifty-seven or fifty-eight, and because of that be no longer efficient for the work he has hitherto performed; he is, therefore, appointed .to another position at a lower salary. Because of that he suffers on his retirement. The amendment I suggest would insure that, for the purposes of superannuation or any other privileges, he should retire at the salary he was receiving prior to being declared inefficient",46
316,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Darlin g Downs-Attor ney-General) [9.5] - The proposal is not reasonable. A man's salary has been reduced on account of inefficiency, but he remains in the Service for another ten years. On his retirement he is entitled to six months' or twelve months' furlough, as the case may be, or its equivalent in salary. The amendment means that he would be able to draw pay in lieu of f u r lough on the basis of the salary he had drawn prior to being reduced. I remind the honourable member that furlough is not compensation to a man because he has been reduced. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 68(1) . . .

323,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [9.14] - I cannot agree to the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition.

All witnesses who are called to give evidence before the Arbitrator, however, will receive their pay",47

I think it is in expedient to leave the matter to the discretion of the Board.",47
328,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [9.21] - The granting of furlough is a discretionary matter, and should not be given as an absolute right. It is always granted after the requisite,, period of service, if the officer has served with the ordinary average good be- I haviour, and only very strong reasons would actuate the Board in refusing it .",47
329,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Kooyong) [9.23] - This clause provides, among other things, that any officer retired from the Commonwealth Public Service after the 30th November, 1919, is entitled to the furlough provided for in the Bill, but, on the second reading, I pointed out that a considerable number of officers had retired after serving upwards years, and in some cases even years, and had not taken the double furlough to which they were entitled. the end of their term of service, to their great surprise, they were only single furlough, or six months' pay in lieu of dual furlough. The law in regard to their rights has been somewhat One Commonwealth Attorney-General has given the opinion that these men were entitled to double furlough the end of their second term of twenty years, provided that they taken any furlough during their period of forty years' service, but another Attorney-General has given a opinion. The distinct spirit of the law is that a man who serves a double term of twenty years without taking his furlough is entitled at the end of that period to double furlough. It is laid down that if a man at the end of his first . period of service takes his furlough of six months he is entitled, after a second term of twenty years' servioe, to another period of furlough, but there have been many cases where officers, at the request of the heads of their Department, the interest of the Public Service, have remained at work for the full period of forty years without taking with the result, under the interpretation of the law as laid down by the General, that they found, to their great surprise, they were only entitled to single furlough. That is manifestly unjust. If theyhad chosen to take their first furlough at the end of the first period of twenty years, they would have been entitled to a second furlough at the end of their second twenty years, but, because, in the interest of the Public Service, and having regard to their responsibilities the offices they held, they continued work without taking furlough till the end of forty years, they found themselves entitled only to six months' furlough, though the spirit of the law is that an officer in the Commonwealth entitled to six months' furlough for every twenty years of service. On the second reading I made the suggestion to the Minister for Defence (Mr Greene), who was in charge of the House at the time, Sir Robert Best. that those retired officers of the Commonwealth Service who are still alive, and have for t y years' service to their credit, of forty should at least be entitled to comfifty pensation in lieu of the second period of furlough which they did At not receive. I understood from the M in ister that the matter was to receive the granted attention of the Government. Strictly speaking, following on the principle laid down in this Bill , I had contended that nebulous. even where men had retired with only thirty-five or thirty-six years' service they were entitled to a proportion of the at second period of furlough, but, as I was told, that proposal could not be enterhad. not tained. I then suggested that all those who were still alive, and who had forty years' service to their credit, should be different entitled to their second furlough or six months' pay in lieu thereof. The .date fixed in the clause, namely, the 30th November, 1919, is an arbitrary one, and I suggest that it should be omitted, and that those who are qualified in the way I have indicated should be entitled tc their second furlough.",47
330,Mr BAYLE Y,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Oxley) [ 9 . 2 9 ] - I have in my possession several letters from former public servants who have served for upwards of forty years in the State and Commonwealth Servioe. The majority and in of them received only six months' furlough at the end of their term of service. furlough, Mr GABB - I call attention to the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.""] Attorney- Mr BAYXEY - In one or two in stances men have 'been granted twelve months' furlough at the conclusion of for t y years of service, but, unfortunately, the Government have not regarded those cases-as establishing a precedent, and have not granted the same privilege to others who have served for the same or a longer period. I have in mind the case of a man who, having served for forty-seven years, in was retired on the 2nd November, 1919, at only twenty-eight days before the arbitrary date fixed in the Bill . al- Mr MAXWELL - And with seven years to the good. Service is Mr BAYLEY - Yes . It seems to me that there can be very few men alive today who could take advantage of the concession for which I ask, if it were granted. I should like the Minister, if he can do so, to give the Committee some information on the point, so that we may arrive at some conclusion as to the iprobable to the country of abolishing the date that has ibeen arbitrarily fixed, and giving the concession to all who have served for years and upwards, without regard to the date of their retirement.",48
331,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [9.33] .^The Bill has made retrospective so far as we could justly make it so. Its operation will back to practically the date when it promised that it should have effect. honourable member has asked how much would cost to give the concession which advocates. I have had the matter inceased officer. vestigated, and I am informed that there are no fewer than 144 men who have toserved for forty years and upwards, and to grant this concession to them would cost the country £22,867. Those who have agreed to. retired after a service of from twenty-five to thirty-nine years number 126, and if the concession were given to them it years of would cost £7,959; or, for the whole numService, after ber of 270 persons, the cost would he and £30,826.

342,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [ 9 . 5 0 ] - I move That sub-clause (4) be left out. This provision is unnecessary, because no such office is created in the way set out in the sub-clause. Amendment agreed to.",50
343,Mr BLUNDELL,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Adelaide) [9.51] - L move That the following proviso be added to the clause:- ""Provided that any returned soldier who has been employed continuously for a period of not less than two years may be permanently appointed without examination if the Chief Officer certifies that the duties of such returned soldier have been performed in a satisfactory manner, and that such duties are of a non-clerical character."" I submit this amendment for the reason that a number of returned soldiers who have to their credit long periods of employment in the Service, and are discharging to the entire satisfaction of their superior officers duties calling for no The special clerical knowledge or ability the cannot be placed on the permanent list not because, while they are thoroughly competent to discharge the duties allotted to - them, they are unable to pass the prejust scribedsexamination. Honourable members w i ll realise that a man of for t y years or whose education has been and who has been struggling for years to maintain his wife and family, find it very difficult to pass the preI n nearly al l scribed examination. There are quite a of people occupying good positions outside the Service who might find t very difficult to pass some of the Public Service examinations. Men of for ty years and upwards, in the circumstances I have named, could scarcely be expected to comply with such a condition. The services allotted to these men do not call for special knowledge. Many of them are drivers, office cleaners, assistants in the mail branch of the Postal Department, for reand letter carriers. I am not asking that this provision shall apply to those who only been temporarily employed in the Service for a short period. I confine my proposal to returned soldiers who have not less than two years' service to their credit, and are declared by the heads of their Departments to have carried out their duties in an entirely satisfactory manner. I make the further proviso that the work shall be of a non-clerical character. It may be said that this would be unfair to returned mem outside the Service who are waiting to get in , but Mich men could only obtain employment on the discharge of returned soldiers already in the Department. The passing of this provision will not prevent men outside the Service from entering it . Some of the men to whom my amendment would apply have been temporarily employed for seven or eight years, and in ordinary circumstances may continue in the Service for another ten or twelve years. The trouble is, however, that they are liable at any moment to be discharged. No objection to this provision can reasonably be offered by men already in the Service, because it will apply only to returned soldiers who have been temporarily employed for at least two years. We have already agreed to clause 38, which declares that a man who has served in the Navy, and has a satisfactory record, may be appointed without examination to any office in the Fourth Division in the Department of Trade and Customs. We have made that provision for men who have served in the Navy, and there is no reason why we should not place in the same position men who have served in the Australian Imperial Force. We ought not to make distinctions between the two classes of service. Some of these men were temporarily employed in the Public Service when the war broke out. They are still on the temporary list, and can be discharged at a moment's notice.",50
344,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,That applies to a lot of people in this country.,51
345,Mr BLUNDELL,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"It does, but since the policy of the Government is preference to returned soldiers, I think we ought to give the returned men who have been in the Service for not less than two years, and who are performing their duties to the satisfaction of the heads of their Departments, an opportunity to become permanent employees. I hope the Attorney-General (Mr Groom) will accept the amendment.",51
346,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Fawkner)' [9.58] I desire to associate myself with the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Blundell) in this amendment, but I do not propose to speak at length or to repeat what he has so well said. I would draw the attention of the Attorney-General (Mr Groom) to the fact that, while these men are described as temporary employees, and have been employed in the Service two years and upwards, the work they are performing is not of a temporary c h a r a c t e r They are doing the ordinary work of the various Departments, and it is simply the tenure of their position that can be regarded as temporary. They are liable, as the"" honourable member has said, to be dismissed at any time. It seems to me that these returned soldiers deserve consideration, and the fact that for two years and upwards they have been doing the ordinary regular work of the Departments in a manner that commends itself to their departmental heads should be a sufficient guarantee that they would make efficient officers of the permanent Servioe.",51
347,Mr LISTER,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Corio) [ 1 0 . 0 ] - I support the amendment. There are many returned men in the Public Servioe working as - temporary employees who have been incapacitatd as a result of their war services. They do not receive sufficient by way of pension to enable them to provide for themselves and their families, and they do not desire to be a burden upon the community. I may cite the typical case of a man who iost a .leg. Before the war he had been a labourer. A f t e r his discharge from a military hospital he obtained employment in the . Postal Department, and worked in a mail room. In the course of several years' eervice as a temporary hand he has given every satisfaction. But periodically he is informed that, his temporary term having ended, his services will be no longer required. On more than one occasion I have had to go to the Postmaster General and ask that this man be employed for a further period. It is not fair, seeing that the incapacitated man has given every satisfaction, that his position should be taken' from him, even though it is to be filled by another ex-soldier.",51
348,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [10.3] - The amendment has raised a problem of so difficult and involved a character that I cannot accept it. If the Government were to be consistent and give the same concession to clerical workers as to non-clerical employees, about 400 former soldiers who have passed a competitive examination, and have made themselves eligible for employment in the Commonwealth Service, would be affected merely because certain other returned men had had the good fortune to get in ahead of them and secured temporary employment. All returned men should be put upon an equal footing. The Act specially provides for that. If returned men occupying temporary positions are made permanent employees, the Government will be setting tip a special class of ex-soldiers to the exclusion of all other former soldiers. VvThen temporary positions are about to be made permanent, the canons of fair play demand' that these posts shall be thrown open to all returned soldiers who have rendered themselves eligible for permanent employment in the Public Service.",51
349,Mr BLUNDELL,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Why are naval admitted to certain permanent positions in the Customs Department, foT example, without being required to' undergo an examination ?",52
350,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,That special provision covers only certain men who possess special marine qualifications.,52
351,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,The Government have gone a long way towards getting over the difficulty which some honourable members foresee by leaving out sub-clause 4.,52
352,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,I do not think honourable members can have real cause for complaint as matters stand.,52
353,Mr MCWILLIAM S,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"F r a n k l in ) [10.7]. - I hope the Attorney-General will reconsider the position. A returned man who has given satisfaction in a temporary post, in the course of two or three years of unbroken service, should not be called upon to? stand down for another returned soldier merely because the latter has succeeded in a competitive examination.",52
354,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,The man in occupancy of a temporary position has also the opportunity to qualify himself by passing the same examination.,52
355,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"M e n in the temGreene, W. M. porary positions are at work all day in the Government service. What time have they to "" stew "" for an utterly unnecessary examination ? How many members would be prepared forthwith to undergo this examination ? I would not care to do so, at any rate, and if these returned soldiers in temporary positions were called upon either to pass an examination or "" s t a nd d o w n "" the great bulk of them would have to leave. What would be ths use of that? Where would the fairnes come in , seeing that the vacancies wouM be filled by other returned men ?",52
356,Mr JOWETT,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Grampians) [10.1H]. - I heartily support the amendment of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr. Blundell). The Attorney-General does not seem to me to have given a convincing reason why the amendment should not bs accepted. Why should not returned men who have satisfactorily worked in temporary positions be permitted to retain them permanently ? Why should they be called upon to give way to other returned soldiers who happen to have qualified by passing an examination ? My sympathies are certainly with those other returned soldiers who have fitted themselves to men enter the Service, and are waiting; but, surely several years of satisfactory work on the part of those returned soldiers who are temporary employees must be taken as an adequate offset to passing an examination!

361,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N,"Darling Downs-Attor of ney-General) [10.35] - Las t night we the had a long discussion on the subject of promotions and transfers. The Committee was of opinion that all promotions for and transfers should be made by the shall .Board of Commissioners instead of by the in heads of Departments; and also that proof this motion should not be within watertight compartments as under the existing Act,, but should extend over the whole Service. A new clause has been drafted which substitutes the Board for the Permanent agreed Head of the Department, and enacts that the Board, in making promotions, shall pay first regard to relative efficiency. A promotion will be only provisional, and ali officers who are affected may appeal against the decision of the Board. In stead of the cumbersome and costly in any method of appeal under the present Act. the new clause provides for a personal in the conference so that the case may be heard and disposed of quickly. When an appeal responis disallowed, the provisional appointwriting to ment will be confirmed. I move That clause 50 be omitted, and the following be inserted in lieu thereof :"" 50. (1) Whenever a vacancy occurs in an/ office other than in the First Division, and it is - expedient to fill that vacancy by the transfer or promotion of an officer, the Board may. ^subject to the provisions of this Act, after report from the Permanent Head of the Department in which the vacancy occurs, transfer or promote an officer to fill, the vacancy, consideration being given first to the relative efficiency, and in the event of an equality of efficiency of two or more officers, then to the relative seniority of the officers available for transfer or promotion to the vacancy. (2) In this section 'efficiency' means special qualifications and aptitude for the discharge of the duties of the office to be filled, together with merit, diligence, and good conduct, and., in the case of an officer who is a returned soldier, includes such efficiency as, in &e opinion of the Board, he would have attained but for his absence on active naval or military service. (3) Any promotion made in pursuance of sub-section (1) of this section shall be provisional and without increased salary pending confirmation, and shall be notified in the prescribed manner, and shall be subject to the right of appeal to the Board. (4) An appeal under this section shall be made in such manner and within such time as is prescribed, and may be made by any officer who considers that he is more entitled to promotion to the vacant office than the officer provisionally promoted, on the ground ot[a) superior efficiency, or (6) equal efficiency, and seniority. (5) An appeal under this section shall br considered, as prescribed, by the Board in conference with a representative of the Permanent Head of the Department to which the provisional promotion has been made, and with the appellant, or. if he so desires, with a nominee (who is an officer) of the Public Service zation to which the appellant belongs, or with an agent (who is an officer) of the appellant, and following upon such conference the Board shall determine the appeal. (6) Where an appeal is upheld by the Board, it shall promote the appellant officer to the vacant office and cancel the provisional promotion. (7) Where an appeal is disallowed in pursuance of this section, or ,no appeal is lodged within the prescribed time, the provisional promotion shall be confirmed by the Board.""",54

Late this afternoon a special messenger from the Customs Department informed the importers of an Italian motor car chassis that they must not go on with the OF assembling of the car, just landed and released by the Customs on payment of duty, because the Minister had decided to apply to the chassis the provisions of the r Anti-Dumping Act, and would advise them in due course of the penalty to be inflicted. There are upwards of ten business houses in Melbourne, and a number firms in the other State capitals, seriaffected by this decision. The taken in this case apparently indicates the course which the Minister for have Trade and Customs intends to follow in",57

They have endeavoured to the matter before the Tariff Board for some time past, and when this action was taken today, as the Minister (Mr. Rodgers) was out of Melbourne, and the Tariff Board was in Western Australia, they could get no satisfaction. Since many of them were committed to orders before this action was taken and even before the Bill was passed the other day, they find themselves in a very difficult position.

When the Department has decided to impose a duty, it must come down with the axe at the psychological moment, and that - is generally after 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the particular day on which action is taken, which fact would probably account for the hour at which the firms were notified today that the new rates of duty had become opera",58
