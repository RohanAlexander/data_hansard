NA WOOL-SELLING BROKERS. Sir GRANVILLERYRIE asked the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Has he been informed that the National Council of Wool-soiling Brokers, at their annual meeting at Adelaide, decided to adjourn the question of settling the roster of wool sales for the 1024-25 season until August? 2. Is it a fact that this action was taken to omphasize the anxieties experienced by woolbuyers in the past season in obtaining credits? .'1. Is it a fact that the National Council of Wool-selling Brokers were advised by the trading banks that the credit anxieties of the past season could only be relieved by the issue of more notes by the Notes Board? 4. Has be informed the National Council of Wool-selling Brokers that the question of issuing more notes is one for decision by experts ? 5. Is it a fact that the Associated Banks have requested an issue of £3,00.0,000 to £5,000,000 more notes from the Notes Issue Board in addition to currency for seasonal requirements?",12

5,Mr MAOKAY,ORGANIZATION OF DAIRYIN G,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Whether he is acquainted with the scheme for the organization of the dairying industry presented for the consideration of the dairy farmers of Australia by the Honourable W. Massy Greene (then Minister for Trade and Customs) on behalf of the Hughes Government ? 2. In what important particulars does the scheme referred to differ from the proposals outlined by the Interstate Conference of representatives of the dairying industry held at Melbourne on Dth April, 1924, and submitted to the Government for approval?  member's questions are as f o l low :1. Yes. 2. I understand that the essential difference between the two schemes is that the scheme submitted by the dairying industry provides for the fixation of the price of-butter for sale throughout Australia by a board consisting mainly of producers, whereas Mr Massy scheme does not make any provision tor the fixing of prices. QUARANTIN E STATION, Sir GRANVILLERYRIE asked the Minister for Health, upon notice 1. Whether the Government is prepared to do anything in respect to the urgent and oftrepeated requests made by the honourable member for Warringali in ""connection with the question of the removal of the quarantine station from Manly? 2. Is such a large area as 000 acres necessary for quarantine purposes? 3. Pending a decision as to removal, will he have the necessary steps taken to make available to the public one-half of this area-abou t 300 acres.  honourable member's questions are as f o l low :1. The Government has this matter, under consideration, but no satisfactory solution of the difficulties in the way of removing the Quarantine Station has yet been suggested. 2. The present and future requirements of the Commonwealth in other directions render it necessary to retain this area. 3. See answer to Xo. 2. COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL. Mr 0.

6,Dr EARLE PAGE,ORGANIZATION OF DAIRYIN G,"Whil e preparing the bill, I had frequent conferences with the Acting Governor of the bank. It is not considered desirable .to make public the views of individual officers on this important subject. NA CLASSIFICATION.",13
7,Mr MAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"the Prime M in ister, upon noticeIs it the desire of the Government, having due regard to the relative purchasing power of money, that the Public Service Board, in the classification now proceeding,, should lower the standard of the Public Service below that prescribed by Parliament in a schedule to the Public Service Act of 1902, and relatively firmed by Parliament in the Public Service Act of 1911?",13

11,Mr BRUOE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am having inquiries made, and shall advise the honourable member as early as possible. WIRE NETTING. BBITISH EXPORTS.  for Trade and Customs, upon notice Whether, in view of the statement, made in this House by the honourable member for Perth, that the Premier of Western Australia had received advice from the Western Australian Agent-General that .British manufacturers of wire netting export 70 per cent, and sell locally 30 per cent, of their output, which figures are the reverse of those supplied by Sir Austin Chapman, formerly Minister for Trade and Customs, he will take immediate steps to ascertain which contention is correct, and in the event of its being proved that Great Britain exports the major portion of her output of wire netting, will he regard that as conconclusive evidence that no dumping is taking place, and remove the dumping duty?  is portions of B ritish wire netting exported used for home consumption vary from Gotime' to time. In May of this year the British W i r e Netting Manufacturers Association themselves stated to the Department of Trade and that the proportion of their output which is exported varies ably from year to year, that in 1923 it was 52.83 per cent. The exact proportion of wire netting exported is not an essential factor under the section boing operated (section 4 ) . Under that section, goods may be liable to dumping duty whenever they are sold to an i m porter in Australia at an export price which is less than the fair market value of the goods at the time of shipment, aud detriment may result thereby to an Australian industry. PORT CHARGES.  Minister, upon notice I. Did lie, when in England recently, promise to reduce port charges wherever possible? 2. What charges are now imposed on shipS iug under the authority of the Commonwealth avigation Act? 3. Wliich, if any, of these cliarges have been imposed since his return from England?",13
12,Mr BRUCE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. '2. The only charges made are for services rendered, viz., in connection with surveys for certificates of survey or loadline, or for carriage of wheat in bulk and the like. These will be found set out in the Navigation (Survey and Equipment) Regulations, and the Navigation (Loadlines) Regulations. Similar charges are made in the United Kingdom by the British Board of Trade. The Australian charges are, however, in almost every case, lower. Apart from lighthouse dues, which have been collected for the last thirteen years, no Commonwealth dues or charges are made on shipping other than thoso already mentioned as for services actually rendered. 3. Eor the survey of repairs or rc-conditioning of a vessel which has sustained damage by stranding or otherwise, charges for visits by surveyors, after the first day which are made without charge, varying from 10s. to £2, according to the tonnage of the vessel. Eor the survey of a vessel for the carriage of grain cargo, charges varying from £1 ls. to £5, according to the quantity of grain which it is proposed to load. For the survey of a magazine for the accommodation of explosives on a ship, £1 ls. per visit. For the survey of the hold ventilation of a ship for the accommodation of inflammable liquids or coal, £1 Is. per visit. SOLDIER MENTAL PATIENTS .",14
13,Mr LISTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Has the agreement between the Commonwealth and State Governments in respect to the treatment and caTe of soldier mental patients afc Bundoora and Mont Park been signed? 2. If so, was any amendment made in the form which he furnished to this House on or about the 1st April last? Customs 3. If any alterations were made, will lie indicate tlieir nature? consider- Dr EARLE PAGE - The answers to and the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. Minor amendments have been made in respect to the formal conditions relating to the property and structures. The only amendment relating to treatment is one which provides that the two official visitors shall be nominated by the Eepatriation Commission in lieu of one being nominated by the Inspector General for the Insane and one by the Commission. 3. See answer to 2. STEAMER PORT LYTTLETON. DISPUTEWITH SEAMEN'S UNION .",14
14,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"for Mr BAMFORD) asked the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon noticeIs it a fact that he has been successful in arranging a termination of the dispute recently existing between the owners or charterers of the Port Lyttleton and the Seamen's Union, and whether any assistance of a valuable nature was afforded him by the honourable member for Dalley?  ney, I interested myself unofficially, as did the lionorable member for Dalley, in an endeavour to bring closer together the conflicting interests in the dispute existing between the owners or charterers of the Port Lyttleton and the unions concerned. I had two unofficial interviews in connection with the matter, and both the honourable member for Dalley and myself are hopeful that the position has been materially improved, and that the way has now been opened up for f u r ther negotiations by the parties in terested. NA REGULATIONS.",14
15,Mr BRENNAN,WIRELESS BROADCASTIN G,"the Prime M in ister, upon notice I. What is the cause of the delay in completing the wireless broadcasting regulations? 2. Is it a. fact that grave injury is being done to certain individual traders by the delay arising, particularly out of the fact that purchasers cannot be found for the discarded sealed sets, nnd the sale of open sets is not in the meantime permissible? 3. Is the Government or Amalgamated Wireless Limited, its co-contractor, exerting or proposing to exert influence on the smaller traders to join the larger combine of which Amalgamated Wireless is said to be a member? 4. Does the Government favour competition amongst various broadcasting agencies?",14
16,Mr BRUCE,WIRELESS BROADCASTIN G,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The question has been exceedingly volved, and all means have been investigated with a view to securing the most satisfactory scheme. No undue delay has arisen, bearing in mind the complications which be confronted. The matter will be settled at the earliest date practicable. 2. Ifc is widely known that a change of policy is inevitable, and in the interim it cannot be expected that sales oE apparatus could be effected as they might be under settled conditions, j t would not be wise for people to buy sealed sets in existing circumstances; but under the new conditions dealers wil l doubtless clfcct small modifications of any stocks they may hold of sealed sets in order that they may bu available for various wave lengths. 3. No. 4. The Government have throughout the investigations endeavoured to find a basis which would ensure the best possible broadcasting services for the community; but I am unable to disclose at the moment the precise form in which it is hoped to secure this result. ANGLO-PERSIAN OIL COMPANY. EMPLOYMENT OF HUNGARIANS.",15
17,Mr COLEMAN,WIRELESS BROADCASTIN G,"the Prime Miuister, upon notice I. Is it a fact that two Hungarians were recently imported by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company under contract to work in connection with the oil exploration operations of that company ? 2. If so, have tlio provisions of the Immigration Act in relation to contract workers been complied with ; and 3. Will the Government bring pressure to bear upon the company concerned to give preference to Australians in making appointments in connection with their operations?",15
18,Mr BRUCE,WIRELESS BROADCASTIN G,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Two Hungarians were recently allowed to land in Australia for transhipment to Papua, where they arc to be employed in connection with the boring operations at Popo, which the. Anglo-Persian Oil Company is conducting on behalf of tlio Commonwealth Government. 2. The provisions of the Contract Immigrants Act 1005 do not apply to these men. 3. Permission for the engagement of these men was granted on an assurance by the company that competent British or American drillers, familiar with the system of drilling likely to overcome the difficulties of the formation encountered in Papua, were not procurable. REPATRIATION COMMISSION.",15
19,Mr BRENNAN,WIRELESS BROADCASTIN G,"the Treasurer, upon noticeWith regard to a memorandum laid on the tabic of the Library on Wednesday last, being a reply by the Commissioner of Kepatriation to certain charges recently made against the commission and its officers, does he consider that such roplv comnlctclv cjrrmp™+e s the commission and the officers concerned?",15
20,Dr EARLE PAGE,WIRELESS BROADCASTIN G,"A regrettable inaccuracy occurred in one portion of the ininformation supplied by the commission; but, on the whole, it is considered that the reply furnished in regard to the have had to charges is satisfactory. JUTE GOODS.",15

It has been ascertained from India that last season's jute harvest was normal. The rising prices are attributed hy Department of Commerce of India to a greater demand from Australia on account of good season's prospects, and to some extent to speculative buying. CUSTOMS TARIPP.

I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following reply:The information desired is not obtainable from official sources, and in view of the reference by the Prime Minister to the Tariff Board of the question of the bearing of the duty on agricultural implements upon primary production, it is not desired to anticipate the report of the Board or to duplicate this work.

22,Dr EARLE PAGE,WIRELESS BROADCASTIN G,"Cowper-Trea surer) [11.16] - Wit h the permission of the House, I should like to make a statement on the financial position. I am happy to say that, owing to the efficient work of the treasury staff, I am able to present to the House an approximate statement of the accounts disclosing the financial operations of the Commonwealth during the past year. These figures are approximate only, and have been built up largely by telegraphic advices from the other states and from London, and obviously can be compiled at this early date under general heads only. The figures may be slightly varied when the acoounts of the year are complete, but they are now made available as being substantially correct. The expenditure of the past year was £63,357,150, which may be compared with the expenditure of the previous year of £63,700,485 , and the estimated expenditure of £61,896 098. 4 The revenue was £66,014,243, which may be compared with the receipts of the year 1922-23 of £64,720,635, and the estimated receipts of £61,943,250. The transactions of the year 1923-24which show a surplus of receipts over expend the ture of £2,657,093.

The principal increases in the revenue ever the estimate were: Customs aud excise ... £6,100,782 Post office ... ... Estate duties ... ... Other increases and decreases-ne t increase .. Decreases occurred under the following heads: Income tax ... £1,942,511 Interest on loans to states for soldier land settlement 479,673 Net increase ... £4,070,993 W it h the large increase in the import trade which has developed during the year, the increase in Customs and excise revenue was anticipated. crease in the income tax revenue may be largely attributed to the delay in assessing the tax, following, on the amalgamation of the Commonwealth and State Taxation Offices. The decrease under interest on loans to states for soldier land settlement is caused by some of the payments being withheld pending a further discussion on the terms of the loans.

The services of 531 officers of the Federal Taxation Department were able to be dispensed with or absorbed by other departments at 1st April, 1924, as a result of the amalgamation. Additional resulting economies, however, are continuously becoming evident, and it has been found possible in New South Wales, on the 30th June, to provide for the retirement of 48 additional taxation officers, of whom 27 were federal and 21 were state. The delay, however, in completing the amalgamation, and the inevitable disturbance of the transition stage made it necessary to provide the additional amount of £205,000 to cover the actual expenditure of the Commonwealth during the year.)

Act 1913-21, the following work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for its investigation and report thereon, viz. :-Establishmen t of an Automatic Telephone Exchange at Elstemwick, Victoria. It is proposed to erect a telephone exchange building on a site which has been acquired at the corner of Selwyn-street ana Davis-street, Elstemwick, and to install therein an automatic telephone switching system, having an in it i a l capacity of 5,700 subscribers' lines, with provision for extension to 9,500. That will afford accommodation for prospective development. In addition it is intended to install a heating, ventilating, vacuum cleaning, and air Elstemwick, which is one of the most populous suburbs of Melbourne, is served telephonically from the Windsor, Malvern, and Brighton exchanges. The cost of line plant required to connect subscribers in the district to those exchanges is unduly great, and economy in this respect can be secured only by opening an exchange in the telephonic centre of the area. The net value of the line plant required to serve the 63,357,150 Elstemwick area if the exchange be opened in 1926, will be approximately 2,657,093 £85,000, but if the establishment of the exchange be deferred, and the practice 7,428,574 of connecting Elstemwick subscribers to adjacent exchanges is continued the value £10,085,667 of line plant required to serve subscribers in this area will be about £123,000. It is stated that in a multi-exchange network, such as that of the Melbourne metropolitan area, the exchanges should of be automatic. So far as the sub-station equipment is concerned, there will be no change in the apparatus of subscribers now connected with the Malvern and The anticipated annual revenue of the new exchange, based upon the estimated number of line connexions on the dates mentioned, is30th June, 1926, the proposed opening date, £44,216; 30th June, 19ol, £63,000. The proposed building will be a single story brick structure of simple design. The details of the estimated costs are:Site, £1,000; buildings, £7,000; heating, ventilating, vacuum cleaning, and air conditioning plant, and electric light and power, £ 4 , 7 0 0 ; automatic telephone equipment ancl external plant, £155,175: total, £167,875.

24,Mr STEWART,NORTHCOTE TELEPHON E,"Wimmera-Minister for Works and Railways) [11.35] - I move: - That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-21, the following work be referred ta the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, for its investigation and report thereon, viz. :-Establishmen t of an Automatic Telephone Exchange at Northcote, Victoria. It is proposed to erect a telephone exchange building on a site which was acquired by the Commonwealth at the corner of Bay View-street and High street, Northcote, Victoria, and to install therein an automatic telephone switching system, having an initial capacity of approximately 3,800 subscribers' lines, with provision for extension to an ultimate capacity of 9,300 lines. This will afford sufficient accommodation to meet the anticipated development in the Northcote exchange area. The proposal also in cludes the installation of heating, ventilating vacuum cleaning, air conditioning, & c , plant, electric light and power. The subscribers in the Northcote area are at present served by a manual (magneto) switchboard, but the ultimate l i m it to which this can be extended in the existing building will only suffice for service to intending subscribers u n t i l about June, 1925. It is also stated that in a multi-exchange net-work, such as that of the Mebourne metropolitan area, the in terests of economy and efficiency are best served by the installation of automatic telephone exchanges. The revenue based cn the estimated or actual number of line connexions at the undermentioned dates is as follows, viz.: Actual, 1922-23, £15,016; estimated, June, 1926, £ 2 5 , 6 3 1 ; estimated, June, 1931, £42,347. The proposed building is to be a brick structure of simple design.

26,Mr STEWART,NORTHCOTE TELEPHON E,"Consideration is ment,the being given to the erection of a post office on the same site, and that proposal will be introduced when evidence is being opposed given before the Public Works Committee. I produce plans and other information quired in accordance with the Public Works Committee Act.",22
27,Mr BRENNAN,NORTHCOTE TELEPHON E,"Batman) [11.39] - I am very glad that the Minister has intronecessary duced this proposal. Few districts in metropolitan area, and certainly none amongst the northern suburbs, are prolia's gressing so rapidly as are Northcote and Preston. In the past they have been very ill-supplied in regard to both postal and telephonic facilities. The site mentioned by the Minister is a fine one, being elevated and healthy, and commanding a splendid view of the whole of the metropolitan area. I had hoped that the construction of a post office would have been commenced ere this. On several occasions I have approached the Minister regarding the matter, and have been told that plans are in course of preparation. I hope that the* telephone exchange, at all events, will be proceeded with speedily, because it is urgently needed.",22
28,Mr FENTON,NORTHCOTE TELEPHON E,"Maribyrnong ) [11.40]. - I understand that the automatic telephone equipment involves certain patent rights, and I should like the Minister to inform the House at a later date what, amount the Commonwealth has to pay in royalties for the use of such patents.",22
29,Mr STEWART,NORTHCOTE TELEPHON E,"I suggest that th© honourable member should place a question upon the notice-paper. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA (ADMINISTRATIO N) BILL . annual Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. COMMONWEALTH BANKBILL . SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 2nd July (vide page 1794), on motion by Dr EARLE PAGEThat the bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr Charlton had moved, by way of amendment That all the words after the word "" That "" be omitted, with a view to the insertion of the following words in place thereof:- "" in order to preserve the Commonwealth Bank as a national institution, and to extend its operations for the purpose of controlling credit exchange, it is desirable that financial experts, to be fully employed in the service of bank, should be appointed to its managethe proposal of the Government to appoint persons representing squatting and commercial interests, who are diametrically to national banking, being designeel more in the interests of private financial inrestitutions than of the people's bank.""",22
30,Mr WHITSITT,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"Darwin) [11.43] While I congratulate the Treasurer upon the introduction of this bill, I find it to criticize certain of its prothe visions. There is a good deal of irony in the fact that, notwithstanding Austraenormous production of wealth, including over £600,000,000 worth of gold, the public debt today is £900,000,000, and all the banks in the Commonwealth ara not in a position to finance the coming wool clip. A good deal has been said in the course of this debate regarding the wonderful advances made by the Commonwealth Bank, but I ]>ropose to lift the l i d off the pot, and show that there is nothing in it but political gas. The Treasurer has stated that the bank has received from the Commonwealth during the last nine years an average of £12,000,000 per annum free of interest. At 5 por cent, that money should have earned £5,400,000, but the profits of the bank during the whole period have been only £4,500,000, notwithstanding the great volume of business which was given to tha bank in connection with the war. If the Commonwealth Governmeut had handed to me £12,000,000 per annum for nine years, I should have undertaken to return a bigger profit than the bank has yielded. The water has boiled out of the pot now! I wish to discuss the note issue."" The Labour party was responsible for taking control of it away from the associated banks.",22
31,Mr GAUB,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"Hear , hear!",23
32,Mr WHITSITT,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"The honourable member for Angas will be sorry for that "" Hear, hear,"" in a moment. In acting as it did in that respect the Labour party deprived the people of Australia of the right to demand gold. The associated banks held £200,000,000 in deposits, and the Labour party by making the notes legal tender deprived the people of Australia of the right to demand gold for them. The Notes Issue Board, however, has issued so many notes that the £1 note has no.w a gold backing of only 9s. 6d. When the associated banks were in control, £ 1 uote3 had behind them £ 8 in gold, but since then the Notes Issue Board has turned out notes ages from a sausage machine. about the "" He a r , hear "" now? I do not hear it . The people of Australia were denied the right to demand gold for notes. Shame on the party that deprived them of it . It has been said that the Commonwealth Government advanced money to the states, and so assisted them. That is so. It has even borrowed £3,000,00 0 itself. But there is no gold to back up the notes that were issued in connection with those loans. The notes have only a mythical value, and the sooner those for which there is no gold backing are withdrawn the better it will be. Gold is the citadel of power; it is the backbone power of a nation; without it wealth becomes the plaything of the savage and the sword of a demoniacal socialism. Mr E . BILEY - The honourable member should take an aspro. ' Other honourable menibers mterjecting,",23
33,Mr SPEAKER,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,Rt. Hon. W . A. W at t ) . - Honourable members must restrain themselves from interjecting.,23
34,Mr WHITSITT,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"I have heard honourable members, both inside and outside of this House, say that wheat should be made legal tender. It would be very pleasant for us to be running round the streets with a bag of wheat on our back trying to buy a "" smoke.""",23
35,Mr YATES,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,What about making hops legal tender ?,23
36,Mr WHITSITT,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"G o l d is the only thing that can be used. It is the symbol of power. It keeps England afloat. The Mother Country will not allow it to leave her shores at present. She requires it to back her currency. Australia cannot get a single "" y e l l ow b o y "" from England. Every 1,000,000 sovereigns represent £21,000,000 of trade per annum. Some honourable members say that it is all right so long as we get goods in exchange for gold, but I do not agree with them. England will allow as much of her merchandise as we like to come here, bnt she will not allow her gold to be taken away. If we could get gold we should not be suffering from the stringent financial difficulties that we are now facing. The B r i tish Government should be requested to remove its embargo on the export of gold. If we could get more gold we could paddle our own canoe. We have lost £600,000,000 worth of gold through our like saus- silly legislation, arid ib is time that we ""What put our house in order. The argument thab £1,000,000 worth of imported goods is just as good as 1,000,000 sovereigns is foolish. Let us suppose that we obtain £1,000,000 worth of wearing apparel from abroad. Twelve months later the clothing is worn out, and more is necessary. By that time we have lost both our money and our goods. I want sound finance. Issuing notes without gold backing is folly, and the power to so issue them should be taken away from the Government. What does the Secretary to the Treasury know about world finance relative to the business and settlement of exchanges of the various banks trading, say, in Australia with South Africa , the United States of America"", Franoe, Japan, or anywhere else? He knows as much about them as a child knows about trigonometry. A little learning is a dangerous thing, and some honourable members opposite have very little learning about finance. Honourable members interjecting,",23
37,Mr SPEAKER,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,On account of the number of interjections and the noise of conversation in the chamber it is almost impossible for me to hear the honourable member. I ask honourable members to restrain themselves and exhibit traditional parliamentary reticence during the debate.,24
38,Mr WHITSITT,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,I am dealing at present with the note issue.,24
39,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,Y o u are presenting a good vaudeville show.,24
40,Mr SPEAKER,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,I shall name the next honourable member who interjects.,24
41,Mr WHITSITT,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"I am pleased with the proposal that the power to issue notes shall be taken from the Notes Issue Board and given to a board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank. The menibers of the proposed board should be gentlemen who are well acquainted with financial affairs, and who know the facts about our Australian trade and industry. They should not be subject to political control, and should only issue notes for gold. It is ridiculous that the Notes Issue Board should have refused to issue notes on the security of sovereigns. A sovereieu will always buy a note and a little more, but a note will not buy a sovereign. New notes should be issued whenever new gold is offered in exchange for them. people should be able to demand gold for notes at any time, but they cannot do so at present. Why should the associated banks be compelled t.o lodge reserves with the Commonwealth Bank? They should be allowed to retain their money and invest it as they desire, provided thab their notes are backed sovereigns. Gold to back all the notes should be in safe custody. Commonwealth Bank at present has its clearing house at the Bank of New South Wales. That bank is much stronger than the Commonwealth Bank. sociated banks as a matter of fact have built up Australia, and their system of exchange has been altogether to the benefit of the people. What honourable member who had £ 1 0 0 to collect in Tasmania would think of going across the Strait to get it when he could do so by paying an exchange rate of £ per cent, to the bank ? The system is an excellent one. I go across to Tasmania every week and pay £ 2 8s. for the trip , but I assure honourable member's I would not suffer seasickness for the sake of collecting money that I could obtain on the mainland by paying \ per cent, in exchange. Honourable members should not decry the associated banks, for they have done a great deal for Australia. They have made possible the investment of money in outside districts ancl so have promoted development. I have borrowed money from them at 7 j>er cent, and have made 50 per cent, on it. Will honourable members say that that is not good business? I do not deny that the Commonwealth Bank has done some good, but I think it could have done much more. Money must be made available for the development of Australia, but only under proper conditions. The sane way to conduct financial affairs is to permit the banks to do their own business. The Notes Issue Board should not have been permitted to act. a3 it has done. Some honourable members say that it has made Australia blossom like a rose. I would say, like a rose in a bottle of mixed pickles. Men who control financial affairs have to be properly trained to look at things from the bankers' stand-point. When an ordinary man goes toa banker, and ask3 for a loan, the banker says: "" What is your security? We do notadvance money on enthusiasm, but Our on security."" That is a proper attitude. It is time we got back to sound finance. The sooner we call a halt in our present practices the better it will bb. I do not agree with the suggestion that it will not be necessary for Ihe board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank to sit more frequently by than once a month. If it is to do its work properly it will need to sit two The and even three times a week at some periods, for it must keep in close touch with the exchange conditions of the world and the trade and commerce requireThe as- ments of Australia. The menibers of the board must give their whole attention to their work. It is impossible to make a banker in a week or two. Ten or even fifteen year3 are, not too long for a man to acquaint himself with the intricacies of high finance. Bankers must be trained like othei"" professional men. If we are ill we want a doctor to treat us, and go to a doctor. If we require surveying done we go to a trained surveyor. If we expect expert banking service we must go to expert bankers. They understand currency affairs aud general business practice. Shrewd and capalble gentlemen ought to be appointed to this board, and they cannot be picked up in the streets. The board should bend all its efforts tn restore the gold standard.",24
42,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,Does the member think that it should control the note issue?,25
43,Mr WHITSITT,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"It should be compelled to issue notes for all the gold that is offered as security, and it should require gold before it issues notes. That is the only way to overcome our difficulties. Bankers should control the currency, for they understand it . It is almost, laughable that they have been unable to obtain uotes on the security of sovereigns. Notes should be issued whenever gold is forthcoming. The associated banks should be permitted to control their own business. The directors of the Bank of Australasia, the English, Scottish and Australian Bank, the National Bank, and so on, know their own business better thau the officers of the Commonwealth Bank can know ib, and they should have power to demand notes for gold at any time. They may be trusted not to call for more notes thau are required to provide a proper currency. At present our notes are issued on an absolutely wrong basis.",25
44,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,Would the honourable member give the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank unlimited power to I issue notes?,25
45,Mr WHITSITT,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,I would to issue all the notes that were asked for in exchange for gold. Gold is far more valuable than notes.,25
46,Mr GREGORY,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,But does not the honourable member think that the Commonperiod wealth Bank sliould have control of the note issue?,25
47,Mr WHITSITT,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,It should be comthat pelled to issue notes on the security of gold.,25
48,Mr SPEAKER,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"The honourable menijob, ber for Darwin must address the Chair.",25
49,Mr WHITSITT,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,W h e u our notes have a gold backing we shall be safe. Gold is the only satisfactory basis for trade between the nations. Mr E. RILEY - It was necessary to issue notes during the war.,25
50,Mr WHITSITT,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"We are uot at war now. The money that was advanced to the states through the Commonwealth Bank is purely and simply a mortgage on Australia. Let us put it to the test. Notes to the value of £57,000,000 have been issued, but there is gold for only £24,000,000 of that amount. What becomes of the balance ?",25
51,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,P u t the banks to the honourable same test with respect to their current 3iCC0TJ.Il t s,25
52,Mr WHITSITT,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"That is a silly interjection. Current accounts are not. legal tender. Notes are the first claim on the assets of a bank. Before the establishment of the Notes Issue Board, there was not a man in Australia who, if the bauks went smash, could not get a sovereign for every note in his possession. Today, of the £57,000,000 issued as notes, at least £27,000,000 is not represented by gold. What is to become of that £27,000,000 which is missing? It is not here, but is invested in the various states; and - if gold were demanded the Commonwealth Bank would have to put its shutters up.",25
53,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,The current accounts could not be touched.,25
54,Mr WHITSITT,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"I am not talking about current accounts, but about notes. We cannot make something out of nothing, as that is contrary to the law of nature. Every penny possible should be applied to the redemption of the notes which are not backed by gold, and the British Government should be asked to permit a free currency of gold. f that were done, the people of Australia would not find, as at present, the rate of oblige them exchange against them. Mr E . RILEY - There has never been enough gold in the world to meet requirements.",25
55,Mr WHITSITT,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"During the war Australia's commercial interests were sacrificed : and it appears that we are to pay even more during peace. It is time we realized the position, and began to look after ourselves. There is no sentiment in business. England knows her and to keep people in England employed, our interests are being sacrificed. It is proposed to build two cruisers i u England, in order that work may be provided for the unemployed there. people of England prefer to do that rather than allow the vessels to be constructed here. The more we import, the worse will be our position. In time the mortgage will strangle us. The sooner Australia ceases borrowing, the better it will be for her people. H r . PARKER MOLONEY (Hume) [12.4] - The honourable member for Darwin (Mr Whitsitt ) who has just resumed his seat, is entitled to his own opinions, but I shall endeavour to show how absolutely misleading soma of his statements are. People who have no time to study the intricacies of finance, can bo forgiven for not understanding the position, but for an honourable member in this House to make use of the statements contained in the speech of the honourable member who has just sat down, is unforgiveable. The honourable gentleman led off by saying that this country owed nothing to ths Commonwealth Bank. . Such a statement can be brushed aside without comment. It impresses itself on no one's mind, and certainly not on the mind of the Trea surer (Dr Earle Page). Throughout his speech the Treasurer paid a tribute to the work of the Commonwealth Bank. The honourable member for Darwin, by way of showing the private banks in a more favourable light than the Commonwealth Bank, said that the private banks used to hold eight sovereigns for every note they issued. The absurdity of that statement is apparent on the face of it .",25
56,Mr WHITSITT,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,It is true.  sorry that the honourable member persists in the statement.,26
57,Mr WHITSITT,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"It was true in 1910.  show the honourable member how utterly ridiculous his statement sovereigns included all the gold held by the banks against all their liabilities. The liabilities of the banks in respect to notes represent about one-fifteenth or one-twentieth only of . tlieir total liabilities. If we accept the view of the honourable member, that the gold held by the banks was a backing for the notes they issued, they would have no backing at all for their other liabilities. view of that, does the honourable member still persist in the views he has expressed? He should take the trouble to look into these matters carefully before The making such loose and wild statements. The honourable gentleman asked what would happen if the people with current accounts were to draw cheques and demand payment. He said that, so far as the private banks were concerned, everything would be all right. Let me refer to the Treasurer's speech, and we shall see what would happen if those people presented cheques to the full value of their current accounts. The Treasurer saidWe find the percentages of total legal tender as compared with liabilities not bearing interest have been :In 1886 ... ... ... 46.2 per cent. In 1888 48.4 „ „ In 1892 01.1 „ „ In 1894 81.9 .. ,. Tn 1901 45.6 „ „ In 191.3 56.8 „ „ In 1914 55.8 „ ,.

58,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"Thaf c represents liabilities at call.  so; ancl if all the people with current accounts presented their cheques and demanded payment at once, they would get 38.7 per cent, of the amount they were entitled to ask for. Ifc is surprising that any honourable member in this chamber is unaware of a simple fact like that. No private bank in this country would be foolish enough to say that it could immediately meet all cheques so presented to it , ancl nobody with any knowledge of the position seriously thinks it could be done. I am surprised that the honourable member ""for Darwin should be so innocent. Mr E . RILET - Speeche s like that of is. Those the honourable member for Darwin injure this country.  should not be made in regard to the Commonwealth Bank as they tend to damage au institution which has served this country well. No one will deny that, even with the unsympathetic administration which has prevailed afc times, the Commonwealth Bank has served AusIn tralia well.

Mr E . RILEY - If c saved the other banks as well.  true. During that period of stress the greatest steadying influence in this country was that of the Commonwealth Bank.",26
59,Mr WEST,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"The Commonwealth Bank kept interest low.  carefully considered the speech of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), and the first thing in it which struck me was the statementWhen the question of a Commonwealth Bank was first mooted, it was generally pected that a truly national bank would be occasion. established- a bank of deposit, issue, discount, exchange, ancl reserve. When the B i ll was introduced, however, expectations were not lized, and when the bank began to function, it became perfectly clear that a national bank national bank should do. had not been established, but merely vernmental institution in competition with the private banks. The Bill the Government brings forward is designed to carry out original expectation. I cannot help thinking that that statelost ment was a cunning attempt by the surer to conceal the real purpose of bill. The answer is provided by even surface examination of the bill. passing of this measure will not effect, i anything which could not bs done under the original act, excepting the appointthe ment of a board of directors; yet the Treasurer would have the people believe that that for which they are longing now at hand, namely, a truly national bank. Another answer which appears on the surface, ancl which is proBank bably the most effective < answer which could be given, is that if this bill were to effect what is claimed for it the Treasurer, a howl would go up the private banking institutions of country. Instead of that, the private do banks have, with one accord, given the bill their benediction. When the Comto do. monwealth Bank was established by a Labour Government in 1911, there was an outcry against it on the part of private bankers, and by the Opposition of that time. If the Labour party in power today, and made the statements which have been made by the Treasurer, the banking institutions of Australia would heap curses, and not blessings, upon it , for well they know that a Labour Government would extend the bank for the people's good. The fact is that since the establishment of the bank determined opposition to it has been displayed by the party opposite. I will not say that the Government proposes to wipe out the bank altogether, but there is only one reason why it does not clo so, and that is because the bank has been such a huge success, and has done so much useful work for the people of this country, that honotable members opposite dare not wipe it out. They know that the people would not tolerate any such thing. But the Government does the next best thing it can do from its point of view, and tries to ham-string exthe Commonwealth Bank on every possible The principal feature of this bill is submitted with the intention of ao reahampering the bank as to make it one that will never function as a really It can safely a Gobe said that the Commonwealth Bank has now prospered, not because of sympathetic the administration by the governments that have been in power since the Labour party office, and not because of sympathetic Treaadministration of those at the head this of the bank, but in spite of their a unsympathetic administration. One can The imagine what its success might have been f it had been given a fair deal. If , for instance, it had been allowed to handle all moneys that pass through the state departments, municipalities, and other local authorities, which, in the State of is Victoria alone, I venture to say, amount to several millions, it is not too much to say that the Commonwealth would be one of the greatest institutions in the Empire. Surely the people's bank should handle the public funds. But by instead of the state departments feeding from the Commonwealth Bank with public this funds, as they had a perfect right to",27
60,Mr LAZZARINI,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"As it is their duty  Instead of that, what do we find? Not the a penny of the money that courses through the state departments finds its were way into the Commonwealth Bank. On the contrary, they put all their money through the private banking institutions. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) has already mentioned, the State Savings Bank of Victoria has £10,500,000 deposited with private banks at rates of interest ranging from 1 per cent, to 5 per cent. I can only say that this is a shameful use of public funds in order to bolster up the pronts of wealthy shareholders in private banking institutions. Quite contrary to what has been said by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, the Commonwealth Bank may be said to have triumphed in spite of the dead weight of its opponents. Up to the present time it has made nearly £5,000,000 in profits for the people. It exerted a steadying influence which, during the war period, saved this country from anything in the nature of a financial panic. honourable member for Darwin (Mr ' Whitsitt) represents a primary producer's constituency, and a knowledge of what the Commonwealth Bank did during the war period, when the primary producers were largely cut off from their overseas markets, should have prevented him from making the slanderous statements he has made against that great institution. Mr E. RILEY - No one notice of tire honourable member.  may be so, but such statements are repeated outside, and it is just as well that a reply to them should be placed on record. Wlieat was the first great staple product of this country dealt with during the war period, and the first compulsory wheat pool was handled by the Commonwealth Government arranging with the Commonwealth Bank, and to a lesser extent with the joint stock banks, for advances to be made on wheat certificates. Every one knows what was the result of that arrangement. It extricated the primary producers of this country from the dilemma they would otherwise have been in through being cut off fro m their pre-war markets?",27
61,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"It took them out of the hands of the food speculators.  so, and at the same time it eased to a great extent the local financial situation. The same system was followed in subsequent harvests during the war period, but after the first wheat pool the Commonwealth Bank, as a Government institution, was placed in the paramount position. It acted as the distributing bank at every capital centre. Although honourable members are aware of the facts, it is just as well that a few figures should be given, to indicate the colossal nature of the work in the performance of which the Commonwealth Bank was the chief instrument. From 1915 to 1921 the wheat yield amounted to 640,000,000 bushels, and realized £185,000,000. So that wheu I say that the work in this connection performed largely by the Commonwealth Bank, was colossal, I am not using the language of exaggeration. Throughout the war period it was the great steadying influence of this bank that relieved the primary producers of this country from the very difficult position in which, bufc for the assistance it The rendered, they would have been placed.",28
62,Mr STEWART,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"The honourable member will surely recognize the very important part which the private banks played in the matter.  already mentioned the part taken by the joint stock banks, but I say that except m the case of the first compulsory wheat pool the services they rendered took a takes any very secondary place when compared with those rendered by the Commonwealth Bank.",28
63,Mr HILL,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,Thaf c is not so.,28
64,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"Ha d it not been for the Commonwealth Bank the primary producers would never have received the same consideration from the private banks.  only the Commonwealth Bank that held the private banking institutions in check during the war. If the steadying influence of the Commonwealth Bank had not been exerted we can imagine what would have happened during the war period from our experience of the private banking institutions in pre-war days, aud when the Commonwealth Bank waa not in existence. Speaking of many with whom I have come into contact I can say that the experience of the man on the land of private banks has, is in many cases, been a very sorry and sad one. Before the Commonwealth Bank existed they turned many of them out on the roads of this country. If the private banks did anything for the relief of primary producers during the war period it was because of the existence and influence of the Commonwealth Bank. As one who represents one of the biggest wheat producing electorates in the Commonwealth, I say that there is today amongst primary producers, and especially wheat farmers, a - lasting sense of gratitude to the Commonwealth Bank for what it did for them during the war period. What I have said about wheat cau be said also about the handling of wool, meat, butter, f r u it , and most of our primary products. This work was done by the Commonwealth Bank as the recognized central authority and pivot for the financing of our primary products during the war period. Apart from what the Commonwealth Bank did in the interests of primary producers we know what it has done in connection with the floating of war loans. The statement has been made, but it will stand repeating, that it saved the people of this country £6,000,000 on the commission charged on the floating of loans. The rafce charged by the Commonwealth Bank was 5s. 9d. per £100 as against a rate of £ 2 7s. I d . per £100 charged by private banking institutions. This represented on Australia's internal war loans a saving to this country of £6,000,000. Yet there are people who today will stand up in this chamber and decry the Commonwealth Bank as an in stitution which the country wonld have been better without. I did not think that there was a member in this House who would not appreciate the work of the bank, and would not have a kind word to say for it . The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), throughout his speech, indicated that the countiy owes much to the Commonwealth Bank. what is to become of it now ? already said that one does not need to read the bill to know what is intended by it ; one has only to remember the acclaim with which the measure was received by the. private banking institutions of the country. Ifc is proposed to hand the Commonwealth Bank over to a board that will certainly not be in sympathy with the expansion of its functions in the interests of the people. is safe to sayfchafcthe intention of the bill is that the Commonwealth Bank should in future function not so much in the interests of the people as in the interests of the private banks. The bill is intended as a prop for private hanking institutions. As the Treasurer, who introduced the bill, and many members of his party, do not believe in the extension of public utilities we can hardly expect the bill to be designed to develop a national bank in the interests of the people.",28
65,Mr SCULLIV,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"They would sell all public utilities.  Treasurer said that he would sell the railways if he had his way. He, at least, could not be expected to bring down a bill to develop a truly national bank, and I am not satisfied that his attitude towards the bank is more favourable than it is towards the railways. Tliere is a great difference between the treatment of the primary producers by the Commonwealth Bank and their treatment by the private banks. In view of that, one wonders how any one claiming to represent the interests of the primary producer can laud the private banks and decry the Commonwealth Bank. I remind honourable members of the Country party that when a proposal was made fro m this side of the House during the 1921-22 harvest to provide a cash payment of os. a bushel for wheat, an amendment wa3 moved by a Countiy party member that half the amount should be paid in certificates. The amendment was agreed to against the wishes of the Labour party, and there are mauy men on the laud today who can inform the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Whitsitt) that when they took their certificates to the private banks fchey were charged an interest rate of 7-i per cenfc. for discounting them. Again, what were men like the honourable member for But Echuca (Mr Hill ) told a few weeks ago I have when the question of financing the next wheat pool was under consideration? They were told that the private banks had ""finished with them."" I do not know whether the honourable member for Echuca would endorse what the honourable member for Darwin has said, but when he placed the private banks on a pedestal he must have had in his mind the fact that a few weeks It ago they would not take part in financing the wheat pool. In so far as the private hanks have displayed any willingness during late years to help the primary producers, it has been because of the existonce of the Commonwealth Bank. What hope of assistance could be held out for the primary or secondary producers if the Commonwealth Bank did not exist? And yet it is interesting to know the extent to which the private banks hold the people's money. amount at call on which the banks pay no interest is £123,819,000. only do they pay no interest on this large sum, but they charge for keeping the accounts of it. .The amount on fixed deposit, on which the banks pay only a very small rate of interest, is £164,725,000, making a total in current accounts and on fixed deposit of £288,544,000. about half of that large sum of money the banks pay no interest. Yet, what happens when the banks are asked for an overdraft? ""When the request is granted the person requiring the accommodation is charged 7 per cent, and even higher. Surely, considering that the people, as a whole, provide the banks £2SS,544,000, half of which is free of interest, they deserve better treatment than to be charged 7 per cent, for overdrafts. Even when an overdraft is arranged it merely means that the customer is given the privilege of writin g a cheque to the extent of the credit arranged in his favour, and no money passes over the counter.",29
66,Mr FENTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"And even then the customer may have to hand in important title deeds.  so, and the banks will probably advance at the most, only half the valueof the property, and it is the general opinion that they extend their own credit on the balance. I have in mind scores of people, notably in the electorate of Indi , which I once represented, who have been forced off their holdings by the depredations of private banks. I have in my mind afc present the case of a man who, in a period of drought in New South Wales, lost about half his stock. E v il days came to him, as they come to many others in this country. He went to bank, which allowed him an overdraft. The drought did mot break as soon as was expected, and after being threatened by the bank, he was given a certain time in which to meet the overdraft. There was only one thing that saved him- a Labour Government was in power, and it threatened to introduce moratorium regulations to protect him and others similarly placed. The threat proved effective, and it was the sole reason why he was allowed to remain on his land. His subsequent career shows that he was at h r if t y , deserving man, and an asset The fco this country. The short extension of time allowed to him enabled him to reNot cover, and he is now prosperous. I quote that incident to show that the struggling settler owes very small thanks to the private banking institutions of this country.",30
67,Mr FENTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"Ha d the bank foreclosed on the case mentioned by the honourable member, they would probably have sold On the land to one of their friends.  very probably true. At the last election the Country party, to which the Treasurer belongs, went to the countiy knowing all these things. It knew also that there was a strong feeling in the country districts against the policy of private banks. It with was expected to do something, and it framed a platform of fourteen points. I shall refer only to the thirteenththe unlucky point for the primary producers. Tho Treasurer said during the election campaign that if the Country party had any influence in the government of this countiy decentralization would be the order of the day; secondary industries would be established in the country, raw materials would be worked up near the place of production, and a system of rural credits would be established. The primary producer said, "" That is what I want,"" bufc while he asked for bread, the party that claims to represent him gave him a stone. This is what was promised in the thirteenth point of the Country party's election platformThe establishment of a Commonwealth land bank and a system of co-operative and rural credits as an integral part of its savings bank department. To arrange advances upon broad acres. To assist co-operative finance in primary and secondary production. To assist in land settlement and development. To establish a. grain and fodder reserve a private against periods of drought. There was not much left for the primary producer to desire.",30
68,Mr ANSTEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"Surely those things are provided in the bill !  thirteenth point represents the bread that was promised-the bill represents the stone the producers will receive. I have searched in vain for this thirteenth point in the bill. Menibers of the Country party said that centralization was the curse of the country, but they are now supporting a bill to centralize credit. This is the opportune moment for the Minister to redeem the promise he made at the last election to the men on the land. But clearly the man on the laud is to be sacrificed so that the wealthy shareholders in the private banks may be coddled. disappointment will also be felt throughout Australia when it is realized that the Government has not seriously dealt with the exchange problem. bill offers no relief whatever in that respect, although the exchange rate is a great handicap to primary and secondary industries. The Treasurer, in his speech, suggested three remedies. The first was that there should be an adjustment of credits due to Australia in Loudon by the liquidation of the Government securities there in lieu of importing goods. Secondly, he suggested a return to the gold standard, bufc finally he rejected the two foregoing suggestions and submitted a third remedy, which he said he favoured. l i e remarkedThe Government recognizes that both internal and external borrowing should be arranged as judiciously as possible. . . The establishment of a central bank on the lines proposed would place independent expert advice at the disposal of the various Governments, and assist in harmonizing, and, if necessary, in curtailing tlieir loan operations. The only remedy to which the Treasurer pins his faith is the curtailment of public borrowing. In the last twelve months, however, two loans have been floated abroad, one of £8,000,000, and one more recently of £4,000,000. I submit that the Government should set an example to show that it is sincere in its contention that public borrowing should be curtailed, lionorable members expected the Government to bring down some concrete proposal on the exchange question, but the speech of the Treasurer was indefinite and hesitating to a degree. The Minister evaded the issue by saying that he would leave the matter in the hands of the experts to be appointed to the board. In - the event of these experts having no solution to offer the position will be as unfavorable as ever. The. Government has merely expressed the pious hope that there may be a curtailment of borrowing. If that is the key to the situation, arrangements should have been made long ago, to have only one borrowing authority in Australia. Should the states take notice whatever of the Treasurer's advice the position will not be altered i least. I propose to discussanother phase of the operations of the Commonwealth Bank. I have taken gilt-edged propositions to the bank and they have been rejected. Three or four weeks ago a wealthy municipality required a loan for Great the installation of an electric light system. The whole of the assets of the municipality would have been offered as security, but I was told by the ActThe ing Governor of the bank that there was no money available. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin) informed us a few days ago that he knew of cases in which the bank had declined to advance money, not on the ground that funds were not available, but because it did not wish to compete with the private banking institutions. Several cases in which a similar answer was given have come under my notice. This class of mismanagement is a violation of the very principles on which the bank was established.",30
69,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"The bank is carrying out the Government's policy.  may be so, bufc it is not "" playing the game."" If those in charge of the bank study the interests of the private banks instead of permitting their sympathies to run along the lines of the bank's progress, they are not fit for the positions they hold. The Commonwealth Bank has made fair progress, saddled though it has been with unsympathetic administration, and oue can imagine what progress would have been made under sympathetic control. In my own electorate are many flourishing centres, and yet only two branches of the bank are established there. I believe that most other country electorates are even less favoured. I could name twenty flourishing towns in my electorate where a branch of the bank would thrive, but no steps have been takeii to extend the operations of the institution there. Mr A . GBEEN - There are only three branches in the whole of Western Australia.",31
70,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"I have not one in my electorate  demonstrates that the bank is hamstrung by the very people who ought to be exno tending its ramifications. When the authorities explain that they have no n the money, they demonstrate their own incapacity and prove that they are not launching out to obtain the new business which would provide fchem with the funds which they say they lack. The managers of some of the branches in the cities and elsewhere are in sympathy with the ideals of the founders of the bank, but those in supreme command are not acting fairly.",31
71,Mr BLAKELEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"They are acting under instructions from the Government.  is so, a very serious charge can be laid at. the door of the Government.",32
72,Dr EARLE PAGE,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"The statement absolutely contrary to the fact.  the Acting Governor is adopting his present attitude of his own free will, his sympathies must lie with the private banks, in whose service he ought to be. When gilt-edged propositions are submitted to those in command they display about as much activity as a petrified elephant. They say either that there is no money available, or that they are not looking for the kind of business submitted. It is deplorable that the bank has been kept stationary in country districts where the people are most anxious to have the facilities that new branches afford. Any development that has taken place, has been brought about despite the unsympathetic administration. If the leading officials have moved slowly in the past, the bill now before us is calculated to make them proceed more slowly still. One can only read into the measure the intention to maintain the Commonwealth Bank as a prop to the private banking institutions. It is not the desire of the people that that course should be followed. Those who originated the bank hope to see a truly national bank established, and developed on national lines. In my opinion, the time is ripe for the whole of the banking in this country to be done through medium of a national banking system, acting on behalf of the community.",32
73,Unknown,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.  people of Australia would like to see a real national hank established without further delay. I want to see a national-ized banking system brought about with a mobilization of credits not only in times of war, stress, or trouble, but also in normal times. Prior to the war, people would have ridiculed the idea that Australia could raise the amount of money which was spent on sending troops overseas and on the various activities in which the Government engaged during the war. It was the mobilization of credits that enabled Australia to discharge its obligations; and nowadays no one wonders how it came about. It is not, therefore, too much to expect that the same thing should be done to develop the Commoni n peace time to the greatest possible advantage. The mobilization of credits is not surrounded with that is mystery that some people seem to attach to it . A f t e r all, credit is the veiy basis of banking. Banks may have whatever backing they like in the shape of bullion, but it is of little or no use to them with out the further backing of public confidence. Credit is simply public confidence. It is depressing to think that in a country in which so many persons are dependent for their very existence upon the sweet will of private banking institutions, in stance after instance can be quoted of people being forced out of their holdings because of their inability to get from banking institutions the accommodation to which they were entitled. The absurdity of the position is easily seen when a comparison is made between ordinary traders and ordinary banks. The difference between them is that in the case of the trader the public supplies the business and the trader supplies the goods, whereas in the case of the bank the public supplies not only the business but also the goods in the for m of public confidence, without which the bank would have to close its doors. In these circumstances I can see nothing wrong in having a mobilization of credits in a country like this so that the what the people create may be used for and on behalf of the people. This can only be done by bringing about a comprehensive nationalized system, of banking. I cannot conceive why so many persons should be at the mercy of private bankinstitutions. These institutions could not prosper but for the fact that the public supplies that confidence or credit which is their very life-blood. The time is over-ripe for giving the people the control of the banking system of the Commonwealth. The bill offers no measure of relief in this direction. It simply places the people more firmly in the grip of private banks.",32
74,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"Did the original Commonwealth Bank Bill, as framed by the Labour party, provide such relief?  sure the honourable member will agree with me, if he has gone carefully through the bill, that nothing can be done under it, except to appoint a board, that could not be done under the original act brought into existence by a Labour Government.",33
75,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"Unde r the original act the other banks could not be compelled to effect their daily exchanges through the Commonwealth Bank.  could very easily be provided for. Mr. Andrew Fisher, who moved the second reading of the original bill, definitely said that the object of establishing a Commonwealth Bank was to set up an institution which would function on the lines I am now advocating. If a Labour Government had continued in office such an institution would have been created long before this, and until a Labour Government comes into power we shall not have a real national bank. This bill offers no hope to any one but the private banking institutions. This is but another proof that the Government are simply out to help only the very wealthy sections of the community.",33
76,Mr SPEAKER,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,The honourable member's time has expired.,33
77,Dr MALONEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,This debate is so portant that I think we should have a quorum. [Quorum formed.'],33
78,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"Pawkner) [2.25] - I engage in this discussion with fear and trembling, because I make no pretensions whatever to be an expert in finance or banking. At the same time one has to take as intelligent an interest as one can in important matters of this kind, and I have read the bill very carefully and listened attentively to some of the speeches that have been delivered upon it. I was particularly curious to learn exactly what is the gravamen of the charge which the Opposition has to bring against the bill, and I find, upon a careful perusal of the speech' made by the Leader of - the Opposition (Mr Charlton) that his main complaint is that the measure represents a dastardly attempt on the part of the Government to kill the Commonwealth Bank. He says that the effects of the amendments proposed will be to enable [76] the directors of the Commonwealth Bank to assist private banks in which they are interested to such an extent that it will be discounting their bills and leaving itself without any security. Mr E. RILEY - I do not think he said exactly that.",33
79,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"To the best of my recollection, the Leader of the Opposition said that the bills of the private banks will be discounted by the Commonwealth Bank, and that that will lead to an accumulation in the private banks of a mass of notes for which the Commonwealth will have no security. It is difficult to understand what the Leader of the Opposition means by that charge. Therefore, I have carefully considered each amendment contained in the bill, asking myself, "" How can this proposal possibly have the effect which the Leader of the Opposition predicts? How will this amendment tend to kill the Commonwealth Bank? . How will it tend, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) so weirdly said, ' to scientifically strangle' the Commonwealth Bank?"" Whilst the Leader of the Opposition says that the object of the bill is to kill the Commonwealth Bank, the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) says, "" On the contrary, the Commonwealth Bank is not fulfilling the functions for which it was originally Resigned, and my amendments are intended to enim- able it to do so."" In order to judge between these conflicting contentions I have referred to the speech of the then Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Andrew Fisher) when moving the second reading of the original bill in 1911. The gist of the right honourable gentleman's remarks was this, ""We see from the prosperous returns of the private banks that there is room for another bank, and we think this a favourable opportunity to establish a Commonwealth Bank that will transact the Government's business, and also engage in ordinary banking."" Then Mr Fisher proceeded to express the hope that the bank would develop into an institution dealing in ordinary bills of exchange and other such liquid securities, and eventually become a bank of banks, and not a mere money-lending institution. Certainly it was in the interests of the people that the bank was to be established, and if there was a tendency on the part of the private banks to charge excessive rates of interest the Commonwealth Bank, whose main object would not be to make pronts, would be a wholesome check. At the same time there is on record the expressed hope of Mr Fisher that in time the Commonwealth Bank would become a bank of banks. There is the slightest doubt that the framers of the original bill, in setting before them that ideal, had in mind the Bank of England; they evidently looked forward to the time when the Commonwealth Bank would become practically what the Bank of England is today, an institution which by its very constitution gives stability the whole banking system of the country. That is what I found when perusing Mr. Fisher's speech. The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) said that the object of the Government in submitting these amendments is to carry out the intentions of the framers of the original bill, and to bring the bank one step nearer the ideal the original founders-to make it a bank of banks. In discussing this question, Mr Fisher did not anticipate the time when the ordinary private banks would be dispensed with and a national bank substituted. He certainly did not use the term "" national bank "" or "" people's bank "" in any such sense; but looked to the time when the Commonwealth Bank would really be a central bank-as the Bank of.England is-giving stability and unity to the whole banking system of the Commonwealth. I now wish to deal with the amendments proposed by the Treasurer, and to ask this question in regard to each one of them: ""How can this particular amendment in any sense upset or strike at the foundation of the Commonwealth Bank, or tend in any way to strangle the bank's operations?"" It is exceedingly difficult to discuss a somewhat intricate and important problem of this nature without the aid of notes, and I have to depend upon my memory to keep the amending proposals in their consecutive order as far as possible. members of the Opposition say that their charge is that the Government are introducing amendments the object of which is to strangle the bank, the only fair way in which to meet such arguments is by taking the amending proposals separately in order to see in what way any single one tends in thatdirection. The first proposal is the substitution of the board of directors Jfr. Maxwell. for a governor to control the Commonwealth Bank. How can that amendment, if carried into effect, tend to strangle or in any way curtail! the operations of the bank? I return to Mr Fisher's speech again, and I find not that when discussing the question of the management of the bank, he said, in effect, that the future of the bank would depend upon the Governor and the way in which he shaped. He said, in effect, "" We make the constitution o? the bank, we place the Governor there as director, and upon the to manner in which he acts depends the future success or otherwise of the bank."" I quite agree that the success of such an institution depends entirely upon the governor in charge. The same process of reasoniug must be applied to the proposed substitution of a board of directors, which is to include the acting governoi. of If we are to assume that the Government, are fatuously going to place upon the board either idiots or criminals, there is no hope for the bank. If , on the other hand, we admit that in the interests of the country and of the bank the Government will make the wisest possible selection, and secure the services of men representing various interests, there can be no objection to the proposed alteration. I assume that the Government will make a wise selection. What has been said by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), and those who think with him? As I understand their utterances, they believe that the men representing the pastoral and agricultural interests will in some way get at the bank. I believe the charge in this connection is that these men will dishonestly use their positions as directors to obtain from the bank financial assistance for institutions and undertakings in which they are interested, and for which they will offer no sound security. If Dr MALONEY - The honourable member says that.",33
80,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"No , that is what was said.",34
81,Mr A GREEN,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,A piece of specious pleading.,34
82,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"No , that is one of' the objections raised against the appointment of a board of directors. I understood the Leader of the Opposition to say that on the score of expense the number of directors should not be so great, and that the control of the institution should be in the hands of nnanciai experts. Mr E . RILEY - Of men in the bank?",34
83,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"M e n in the bank! The Leader of the Opposition admitted that the private banking institutions Australia are being conducted on a sound basis, and if those institutions on whose directorates are representatives of i m portant interests are well managed, there can be no objection to representatives similar interests being included in the directorate of the Commonwealth Bank. I fail to see how, in regard to the first amendment, which relates to the substituwould tion of a board for a governor, it can shown that such an alteration would strangle the bank. A f t e r all, if it means that the directors are going to lend the money of the Commonwealth Bank without security-it seems that is about all it can mean  that?",35

89,Dr MALONEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,We should all deem it proposal. an honour to read out marked passages for the honourable member.,35
90,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"The part of the speech to which I am referring deals with the proposed substitution of a board of directors for the Governor. The Leader of the Opposition used words to the effect that the board would discount bills for the private banks, and that that would of lead to the accumulation in those banks of paper currency, for which the Commonwealth Bank would hold no security.",35
91,Mr ANSTEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"I do uot wish to interrupt the honourable member, but may I of be allowed to point out that the Leader of the Opposition said that, unlike any other central bank, the Commonwealth Bank, under the provisions of this Bill , not have a safety f u n d such as a be central bank should hold in reserve.",35
92,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"I was not dealing with that aspect of the question. The second amendment proposed is that the capital of the bank shall be increased. Under the original bill provision was made for a capital of said £1,000,000, but in 1914 an amending bill was passed in which power was given to increase the capital to I £10,000,000. That power has never been exercised. This bill leaves the capital at that £10,000,000. How can it be said that that will tend in any way to strangle the bank or hamper its operations? It seems me that it will put it in a better posito fulfil the functions which it was That point surely requires no elaboration. The next amendment proposed is that the Commonwealth Bank shall have power to I memsupposethat that power exists now, although no act of Parliament definitely I have no doubt that the Treasurer has proposed this amendment as a step towards ultimately making memthe bank a really central bank in the every sense of the word. The practice in the Bank of England is, I to understand, for the court of directors to meet weekly on Thursdays to fix the rate of discount for the coming week.' The Commonwealth Bank will follow that best practice if this amendment is agreed to. have I do not see how it can be suggested that we shall even hamper the bank, much less k ill or strangle it , if we adopt the The fourt h amendment provides that the private trading banks shall be compelled to effect their exchanges through the Commonwealth drawing cheques and paying into it. is another step towards making it a central bank. "" The present system of effecting exchanges is a pooling system. balance is made, and adjustments by the giving and taking of certificates. The proposal in the bill is that the private trading banks shall furnish Commonwealth Bank with regular returns. It will then be in a position to know exactly to what degree it can help the private banks by giving them accommodation from time to time. This power will also help it to function more effectively. The last amendment that the banks shall furnish statistics to the Commonwealth authorities now do to the state authorities. also will tend to centralization. examined these amendments and I must confess that I cannot see how they can do other than increase the usefulness of the bank. I certainly fail to see how they will diminish its usefulness or curtail its operations in any way. Mr. Andrew Fisher stated, in the speech to which I have already referred, that he hoped the day would come when Commonwealth Bank business would be largely dealing in ordinary bills of exchange and liquid securities of that kind. If the bank, by having a large fund at its disposal, is able to help the private banks by rediscounting their bills of exchange, it will do a great deal to assist the country. The private quently bold bills which to convert into cash, and"" if Commonwealth Bank can them and give accommodation will be altogether to advantage. That will render them more efficient, and stimulate their activities. have listened carefully to the speeches that have been delivered by members in this debate. Those by the honourable member for Macquarie Manning), the honourable member Perth (Mr Mann), and the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) interesting and instructive, and so was the speech of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page). But when honourable are asked to deal with plain, suggestions such as are contained in the bill, I cannot understand why they should think it necessary to discuss the general Mr Maxwell. Bank by question of exchange, the advisableness That of a return to the gold standard, the effect of our fiscal policy on the exchange situation, and like matters. Those are i m A daily portant and interesting subjects, but they follow do not affect the bill. When I was giving consideration to the plain, simple questions in the bill, I asked myself, "" Do I the believe that the effect of these amendments will be to increase the usefulness of this fine institution?"" I have come, after a careful consideration of all the facts, to the conclusion that it will be, and, therefore, I shall support the second reading of the bill . provides Dr MALONEY (Melbourne) [2.54] When I interjected while the honourable as they member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) was That speaking, and said that honourable memI have bers on either side of the House carefully, would feel it an honour to read any marked passages that he might desire to have read, I am sure I was expressing the mind of honourable members generally. I know that when Mr MCKenzie, a former member of the Victorian Parliament, who was afflicted like the honourable member for Fawkner, the wished to have such passages read, his colleagues felt it an honour to be able to read them for him. If the honourable member will permit me, I shall be glad at any time to read his extracts for him.",35
93,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,T h a n k you.,36
94,Dr MALONEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"That there may be honest differences of opinion on this banks fre- important measure no one can gainsay. they wish I intend to vote for the amendment of the my leader (Mr Charlton). The Comrediscount monwealth Bank started as no other bank it in the world started. I refer honourable Australia's members to the valuable report of the commission that inquired into banking I problems in the United States. I believe that, with the exception of myself, honourable the only other honourable member who has read the evidence and finding of that (Mr commission is the honourable member for for Bourke (Mr Anstey). The commission inquired into the banking systems of the were world, and dealt exhaustively with the constitutions of the Banks of England, France, Italy , Spain, and Russia, not members one of which is constituted in quite the practical same manner as the Commonwealth Bank. The Bank of England enjoys certain privileges, including the issue of notes, for the management of the national debt. J was called upon to finance the debt A created by Charles II . , of anything but sacred memory. The history of banking is almost a romance for those who care to study its pages. On a former occasion I pointed out how, at an early period in the history of banking in Victoria, it was possible for any money-spinner who could command a sum of £125,000 to start a bank in this state.",36
95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T, Does the honourable member in tend to use that incident as an illustration ?,37
96,Dr MALONEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"Absolutely. already appears in Hansard, in the report of my speech on the original banking bill. I pointed out then that any moneyspinner with the sum of £125,000 could have started a bank in Victoria and obtained authority to issue an unlimited number of notes. Those honourable members who, like my&elf, are getting on in years will remember the position when all the associated banks in Australia/there were no fewer than 87 different banks then-ha d authority to issue notes. Very few people could give, off-hand, the name of the bank whose notes they carried in their pockets. I recollect, on one occasion, walking down Collins-street with a friend, and putting questions on this point to a number of persons whom we met. Not one person in the twelve whom we questioned could say what bank had issued the notes which he was carrying. All they knew was that they held bank notes of a certain denomination. As a result of all this confusion, after the Australian-European Bank failed, the notes issued by that bank were passing as currency throughout the back-blocks of Australia for over 25 years. Honourable members will , I am sure, agree that with so many different banks of issue, it was much more difficult than at the present time to detect forgery in notes. The practice of the Bank of England is never to allow a note returned to the bank to go back into circulation, so that if any forgery is attempted the authorities know at once. When I was in the note issue department of a private bank the practice was for officer to call over the numbers of the notes returned to the bank, while another officer checked the call in the ledger. If the same number reappeared, the practice was to examine the note carefully under a microscope and ascertain if it was genuine or a forgery. . If it was genuine, the presumption was that the note of the same number previously returned must have been a forgery.",37
97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,I am afraid the honourable member is not confining his remarks to the amendment before the Chair.,37
98,Dr MALONEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"Perhaps not, Mr . Deputy Speaker, but Mr Speaker ruled that honourable members should be permitted a fairly wide range in the debate on this bill. If you rule that I must confine my remarks strictly to the amendIt ment, I shall have to develop my argument at a later stage.",37
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"I did not hear Mr Speaker's ruling on the point raised, so I must ask the honourable member to comply with the directions of the Chair.",37
100,Dr MALONEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"I shall endeavour to do so, Mr Deputy Speaker, but you and I are too old in parliamentary experience to be prevented from developing our argument in the way we desire. W it h your permission, I shall direct my attention to the amendment a little later. If honourable members desire the information concerning the position in Victoria during the time of which I speak, I refer them to my remarks in Hansard. I claim credit for having been the first to reveal the danger of one bank being able to issue an unlimited number of notes. Section 12 of the Banks and Currency Act 1890 readsNotes payable to bearer at sight or on demand issued in Victoria by any banking company, firm, or individual banker, in the hands of any bona fide holder thereof for value who has received the same in the ordinary course of business witliout notice that the same has been issued or dealt with contrary to the provisions of this Act and has not subsequently dealt with the same otherwise than in the ordinary course of business shall in the event of such company being wound up or such firm or banker being insolvent or bankrupt be a first charge on the assets in Victoria of such company, firm, or banker, not being the subject of any mortgage, pledge, lien, charge, or other security in favour of any other creditor I specially direct attention to the signifione cance of the concluding sentencenot being the subject of any mortgage, pledge, lien, charge, or otlier security in favour of any other creditor. When we transferred to the Commonwealth Bank the right to issue notes, the note issue of that bank became the safest in the world. No other for m of security had a prior claim on the assets of a bank in this state. I would prefer to see the note issue under the control of the Government, but probably this House, in its wisdom, will decide to leave them imder the control of the Commonwealth Bank. If the recommendation of the Public Works Committee, which has done splendid work in other directions, had been followed in connection with the building of the noteprinting office, probably upwards of £40,000 would have been saved. Section 14 of the act from which I have just quoted readsNo banking company, firm, or individual banker shall issue notes payable to bearer at sight or on demand unless such company or firm has a subscribed capital of not less than Two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, and a paid-up capital of not less than One hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds, or unless such individual banker has a capital of not less than One hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds, and any company, linn, or banker issuing notes contrary to the provisions of this section shall be liable to a penalty amounting to Twenty-five pounds per centum of the amount of the notes so issued, to be recoverable with full costs of suit by any person who may sue for the same. That is not possible today, because one of the greatest arguments in favour of the Commonwealth Bank is that we have taken away the right of the other banks to issue notes. The result is that the credit of the community is uow much higher. I have seen in crowds of people waving bank notes, and threatening to go' to the banks, to deof mand payment in gold. 1 was able stop the base desire of one man who thereto wished to ruin the banks. At that time a the directors of the banks were trembling for fear of what might happen. But such a state of affairs is impossible There is no Australian but has in the Commonwealth Bank. nothing for the returns of the Bank of England, where the note issue is placed in ment one column, and the gold issue in anrically other. Back of the notes, there are the signed huge amounts represented by the current accounts, deposits at call interest, We can rightly claim that the quorum. Commonwealth Bank has worked didly, and that it has avoided the dangers chairand pitfalls of the past. In this chamber, on a previous occasion, I drew attention to an iniquitous provision in relation. Dr Maloney. to the savings bank whereby a wife has no claim on the bank if her husband steals her bank-book, forges her signature, and obtains her money.",37

102,Dr MALONEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"So far as I am aware, this is the first time in connection with an important bill when only one amendment has been moved, that latitude has not been allowed to an honourable member speaking on the second reading.",38

107,Dr MALONEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"It was, perhaps, a misunderstanding on my part, Mr. Speaker, but I was under the impression that, in view of the importance of this bill, and the fact that only one amendment has been moved, a certain amount of latitude would be allowed to honourable members when speaking. I was referring to the fact that if a husband stole a savings bank pass-book belonging to his wife, forged her signature, and obtained her money, the bank would not be the loser, whereas if a forgery were committed in connection with a current account with any of the associated banks, the bank would be the loser, even if the forgery were cleverly done. When the bill for the establishment of the bank was before Parliament, this House had to consider an amendment made by the Senate to clause 48^A*llcre a person fraudulently represents self to be a depositor, and presents a depositor's passbook, and complies with the rules of the bank, and thereby obtains any money belonging to the depositor deposited with bank by way of savings bank deposit, bank shall not be responsible for the loss tained.

112,Mr FOSTEB,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,It was K in g O'Malley's suggestion.,39
113,Dr MALONEY,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"That is so. experience of banking, gained in the United States of America, was of great assistance in framing the Bill . If perment mitted, I shall quote from his scheme for adjusting the nnanciai relations of the Commonwealth and the states. The extract is not long, and I shall give it to the House as a monument to K in g O'Malley's great work, this being the first opportunity of doing so as the Commonwealth Bank Act has not previously been brought before honourable members for amendment. It indicates, i u many ways, the unfortunate position existing in Victoria, New Soutli Wales, and every other state where the state savings bank is in absolute competition with the Commonwealth Savings Bank. Had Mr. O'Malley's scheme been carried out as he desired, there would have been no competition whatever between them. In addition, the erection of splendid buildings in himElizabeth, Swanston, and Collins streets, all carrying on the savings bank business, would not have been necessaiy and the the states would have been partners in the the profits made by the Commonwealth Bank. susThe following was Mr K in g O'Malley's proposal for a national postal bank: In order to facilitate and economize the ) . carrying out of the financial transactions of the Commonwealth and of the States, and especially those connected with the conversion, renewal, and issue of loans, it is to establish a national bank of deissue, exchange, and reserve. It is pro(1) that this bank shall be conducted purely as a Government Department, absolutely free from political control; (2) that it shall be so constituted as to possess all the powers and immunities requisite to its security, to the recovery of its debts, and to the disposal of its property; (3) that its capital be represented by 12,000 shares of £100 each, of which at least 6,000 shall be in the hands of the Commonwealth Government, and of the balance no State Government shall hold more than 1,000 shares. Six separate states would find half the capital required. They would each have a representative on the board, making the be personnel of the board seven. The repreof the Commonwealth would have a casting vote, in addition to his the ordinary six votes, so that there would be complete unanimity in transacting busi(4) Tliat the shares of the bank shall be transferable only to the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States; that the failure of any or all of the State Governments to H is subscribe shall not prevent the bank from commencing operations; and that in the event of a State Government desiring to dispose of shaTes in the bank the Commonwealth Governshall have the first option of purchasing. That was to prevent any shares from getting into the hands of private companies or individuals. Continuing(5) That the Commonwealth and State Governments holding shares shall be jointly and severally liable in respect of all transactions of the bank; (6) that the bank shall act as the agent for the Mint in the purchase of raw gold and silver and the issue of coins; (7) that the bank shall be empowered to issue notes which shall, throughout the Commonwealth, be legal tender at all places except the head office of the bank in each State; and that at such head offices payment of the value of notes presented may be made in gold or Commonwealth consols, at the option of the Comptroller-General of the Bank. That was to prevent a recurrence of w h at to o t place in the U n it e d States of America. A f t e r the C i v i l W a r the Gov e r n m e n t of the U n it e d States of A m e r i c a were compelled to borrow at r r e at loss money in L o n d o n to meet the issue of greenbacks.

The f o u n d at i o n of the n n a n c i a i c r e d it of F r a n c e was l a i d in the "" Rentes "" system. The great N a p o l e o n , in those days, allowed the issue at 4 per cent, of s m all bonds, each equal in our money to £ 4 , and w h i c h on one occasion f e l l in value to 50 f r a n c s . B y following the splendid example of F r a n c e, at h r if t y n at i o n , and of the United a d o p t in g as i m i l a r system of bonds here the people w o u l d have the o p p o r t u n it y of saving money in s m all amounts. In conn e x i on with the savings b a n k b r a n c h of Such a p r o v i - the bank's operations, I should l i k e to make one more q u o t at i o n from Mr K in g O ' M all e y. He saidThe I have for years advocated that there should be a Commonwealth Bank, and drafted the scheme adopted by the Brisbane Conference. Well, we have got a start-w o have a Commonwealth Bank, thanks to the Labour partybut I want more. I want that bank to be' an institution which will help the farmer with cheap money, and will not call in the loans when times are bad and ho needs the assistance most. This is no visionary idea. It has been done in othor countries. In New York, for instance, they are adopting the rural credits system to give cheap money to farmers on longtime overdrafts. In order for the bank to become great a Board of Management should be appointed, consisting of the Governor, representing the Commonwealth, and one representative from each of the subscribing States, who should represent the States Savings Banks, the Governor possessing a casting vote. Thus wo preserve banking equality of Commonwealth and States. In France and Germany the small farmers can borrow all the money they require at 3 per cent, to 5 per cent., payable by small instalments over a term of about 50 years, or sooner if they wish. The greatness of these countries is - largely due to the prosperity and independence of the small farmers, and ' l want to see a similar state of affairs here. The land and the : workers of a nation are its real source of Governments wealth, and are entitled to more sympathetic treatment than they have had in the past. Not only should they be assisted to produce, but to market their produce. I have given my meed of praise to a great man whose financial acumen was exercised for the benefit of Australia. His endeavours to secure the establishment of a national bank for the Commonwealth were unceasing in the party to which he belonged, but to which I am sorry to say he does not now belong. That party adopted his views, and carried them to fruition under the leadership of Mr . Andrew Fisher. There is one flaw in the existing Commonwealth Bank Act, and attempts were made in this House to rectify it . We should have consolidated the savings banks of the states with the savings bank of the Commonwealth. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) meets with my full approval. a youngster I served in a bank for about seven years, during a period of eleven years. In the case of au ordinary bank, in selecting its directors the first man looked to is the biggest shareholder of the bank, and then any man of wealth, squatter, or merchant may be called to the board. But, after all, we know that the conduct of a private bank is left to the manager. In nine out of ten private banks it is the practice of the directors to say, "" Yes, Mr Manager."" I remember that on one occasion Mr Murray Smith, who was a bank director here for 20 or 30 years, attended a meeting of bank clerks held in the Temperance H all . He did not know that the clerks in his bank were called back to work at night. I told him so from the platform of the hall, and I said, "" If you will walk down to the bank with me we shall find them working there."" He was astonished to find them at work, and he said, "" I never knew they came back."" We need financial experts on the directorate of the Commonwealth Bank. It differs from any other bank in the world. It is a bank of issue and deposit, and at the same time a savings bank. I can remember that 50 years ago there were penny savings banks in the Old Country, and at one time there was a post office savings bank in Victoria, but never so far as my reading goes, has there been another bank like the Commonwealth Bank, at the same time a savings bank and a bank of issue and deposit. Leader of the Opposition has given a great deal of thought to this subject, and I am sure he will agree with me that we [77] should have on the directorate of the bank, an expert in savings bank business, who should have control of that department, subject, of course, to the governor. The directors should give the whole of their time to the work of the bank. They should not be half-time men. I hope we will not appoint to the directorate ""guinea pigs,"" such as are many of the directors of the private banks. I have little doubt that the Commonwealth Bank w i ll ultimately become the greatest banking institution i u the world, unless other nations follow our example in the establishment of similar institutions. The Commonwealth Bank is certain to in crease in power and influence in the community. The directors should be finanAs cial experts, and where in Australia can we better secure such men than from amongst those trained in our banking system? Who could be better fitted to be a director of the bank than one who has successfully passed through the different grades in its service? There could, of course, be no objection to the appointment of a heaven-born, genius of finance, wherever he might be found. Very few merchants dealing in bills of exchange know very much of the intricacies of the law pertaining to such instruments. I remember that.as a youthful officer of a bank I was somewhat of a favourite with the merchants, probably because I was so small, and ou many occasions they wrote questions which they asked me to give to the accountant to answer for them. I mention this to show that as a class, merchants cannot be regarded as financial experts, though there are, of course, amongst them men of great financial knowledge. That can be said of every calling. We know that many pawnbrokers become financial experts, but they are uot the type of men we want on the directorate of the Commonwealth Bank. Although the Leader of the Opposition has submitted an amendment on the motion for the second reading of the bill, that is not to say that there is no good in it. I think there is much that is good in the bill, but honourable members on this side quite definitely desire that the Commonwealth Bank should be an institution not only for the conduct of higher The finance, but for the benefit of every erson in Australia. The great Bank of ranee in the old days used often to have in reserve, two, three and four times the amount of gold deposited in the Bank of England. Yet the Bank of France used to discount half-crown bills, for even two weeks, or sometimes for one week. officers of the bank would go around and collect the money, deducting a very small rate of commission. The rate of the discount of the Bank of England go up and down like a see-saw, while the rate of the Bank of France was steady. I am speaking, of course, of pre-war days. Paris was the steadiest market in the world, not even excluding the wealthy New York change, because the Bank of was based upon the interests the common people of the Members of this House, although possessing good securities, have been refused overdrafts. No one knows how much money has been lent to private firms. Parliament should stipulate that not more than £100,000 should be advanced to any firm or individual. ""We know how Lord Rothschild defeated a great house that up to a certain date held sway in England. He was chairman Bank of England, and the whole thing was settled as if it was a very matter, but even the Bank of England had a severe shaking. A proposal to limit the amount of advances to individuals and companies would be endorsed by a board of experts. People who knew something of the inner working Denison Miller's mind say that he had good margins of securities. A large sum of money should be advanced to assist the states, the municipalities, and the Commonwealth. The Commouwealth should assist the Commonwealth ment as it did in the war years. Denison Miller said that if called upon by the Commonwealth Government would be prepared to organize the finance of Australia in peace time as he had done it in war time. It will be remembered that during the war bonds amounting to £350,000,000 were issued. not better to lend £100,000 families than to lend it to one individual ? Cheap money distributed over a large number of people will do more good than if placed in the hands of only a few - It is the duty of honourable members to improve the bill if possible. I understand Dr Maloney. that the Treasurer looks upon it as hi3 pet ewe lamb. The greatest stumbling block to the development of the Commonwealth Bank is the competition between The its savings bank branch and the state savings banks. Those two banks pay different rates of interest on savings bank deposits, and a f u rwould ther difference is introduced by the Commonwealth Bank giving 3 per cent, on deposits of £1,000. In former days the rate of interest in the state savings bank money o? Victoria was kept low to force depositors to use the associated banks. Even Ex- the State Government, which in a France few hours will be no more, has lodged of a sum of £10,000,000 with the associated country. banks. I would make it compulsory that all municipal, state, and Commonwealth funds should be deposited in the Commonwealth Bank. A directorate such as is suggested would probably agree to all the gold in the country being lodged in that bank. I hope to have the assistance of honourable members in inserting a clause to prevent nepotism. One firm opposition should not be allowed to do all the architectural work for the bank. If the object of the is to adorn the big cities of Australia with beautiful buildings, we should hold small competitions in which all Australian architects can compete. If that is done correctly-designed buildings will in the future decorate the cities of this beloved Australia. of Sir Question-That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Charlton'S amendment) stand part of the question-put .

114,Mr BRUCE,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"Flinders-Prime Ministo ter and Minister for External Affairs) [3.52] - In movingThat the House do now adjourn, I desire to inform honourable menibers that the Government is now in a position to announce the names of Australia's presentatives at the next Conference the League of Nations, which is to be held in September. those representaI tives will be Sir Littleton Groom (Com10,000 monwealth Attorney-General), _ Charlton (Leader of the Opposition), and Sir Joseph Cook (High Commissioner for Australia in London). I think NOBS, that the delegation that it is proposed . to send on this occasion will command the very greatest confidence of the whole of the people of Australia. Its composition will demonstrate that the part taken by Australia in the League of Nations is not influenced by political considerations, and is not a matter upon which there is any division among the people. In addition to those three delegates, it is also proposed to send Mrs. PAIRS. E. F. Allan as a substitute delegate. I also desire to make a statement to the House with regard to an application made recently by the Australian Meat Council to be granted a bounty on the export of beef and live cattle. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr. Manning) raised this matter two days ago, and I then said that I hoped the Government would be in a position shortly to make an announcement. PAPEES. During the year 1922, bounty to the extent of £123,000 was paid on frozen and - canned beef and live cattle exported, and during 1923 the sum of £141,000 was In regard to the h bounty on beef exported, inquiries showed that the prices which the growers were obtaining were liigher this year without a bounty thau they were last year with the bounty. The difficulty specially brought under notice by the council related to the meat exported from the Wyndham works in Western Australia, from which place the freight in was £d. higher than it was from other a parts of Australia. Under all the circumstances the Government has decided that it is unable to approve of a bounty on beef exported, or of special treatment given in regard to any particular port, and it is suggesting to the Australian Meat Couucil that they endeavour arrange for a reduction of freight from Wyndham. It has been made plain, however, that there is an opening for the establishment of a satisfactory trade in the export of live cattle, and as the Government is anxious to safeguard aud inrecrease this trade, it has approved of the of payment of the bounty of 10s. per head to be continued this year on the terms that have operated during the last two years. t is estimated that the export will total head of live cattle, on which the _ Mr bounty to be paid will amount to £5,000.",43
115,Mr A GREEN,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"Kalgoorlie) [3.55] - I desire to call the attention of the House, tintl particularly of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page)_, to the serious industrial positiou that has arisen in the important town of Kalgoorlie. Without any previous intimation a cablegram was recently received from the London directors of the Ivanhoe mine announcing that it was proposed to amalgamate that mine with the Lake View and Star mines and shut down the Ivanhoe mine. It was, of course, beyond the power of anybody in Australia to prevent that being done, and the result is that 500 men have been thrown out of employment. For every miner in Kalgoorlie four other people are kept employed in various avocations there. If no employment can be found for the miners a loss of 2,000 in the population of the town will be sustained. Three hundred of the 500 men are married. The Western Australian Government has done everything it possibly can to alleviate the situation. The Premier visited the gold-fields, and 100 men were given work along the water supply main. Fifty more were absorbed in other mines, leaving a balance of 350 still unemployed. Kalgoorlie, through not having any surrounding wheat-growing country, is in a particularly unfavorable position to provide work for such a large number of unemployed. These men have their homes established in Kalgoorlie, and they naturally require employment in the district. Acting on a teiegra.ni I received from the Premier of Western Australia, I interviewed the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr . Stewart), and suggested that the men should be employed on the ballasting of the transcontinental railway. The M in ister pointed out that the £50,000 allocated for that work for this year had already been exhausted. I therefore proached the Treasurer to find out whether a further sum could be made available, and he replied that he could not see his way clear at the present juncture to make a further grant. I wish to phasize the point that not more than half the ballasting work has been done, and it is essential that the whole of the line should be ballasted. At the present rate of progress it will take nine years complete the work. Seeing that honourable menibers on the Opposition side of the House have on various occasions assisted the Government to relieve other industries, I hope that a sum will be promptly set aside to enable these men to secure employment near their homes. Only Y0 men are now employed at the Woocalla Quarry in connection with ballasting operations, and about 30 men are engaged in rail-lifting. They are all employed at the eastern end of the line, while none are employed at the Kalgoorlie end. The State Government is doing all that it possibly can in the matter with its limited resources; and, seeing that the ballasting work must be done, I hope that the Government will make a sufficient sum available for the purpose. The men for whom I speak do not ask for soup kitchens or food; they are industrious people, and they simply want work. The present time of the year is ideal for ballasting operations. It would not be necessary to ballast the whole of the line immediately, but if the work is put in hand for t h with these men will be placed on their feet and the fear of starvation will be averted.",43
116,Mr FORDE,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,"Capricornia) [4.0] - I have to bring under the notice of the Government a letter that has been received by Mr T. Walsh, general president of the Federated Seamen's TJnion of Australasia, regarding the treatment of native labour on the New Guinea Steamship Company's vessel Eavu, now in Sydney. The letter readsI have to bring under your notice the condition of sixteen New Guinea natives at present engaged on the New Guinea Steamship Company's vessel, the Kavu. It would appear that these men do not receive proper food, housing, &c. It seems that some days they only receive two meals comprising rice (without sugar, &c.), and bread without butter. Perhaps every third day a 2-lb. tin of meat is given to be divided among the sixteen, Now and then tea is given, less milk, and with very aplittle sugar. There is no proper sleeping accommodation provided for them. Some sleep on deck beneath an iron enclosure (enclosed on three sides), others sleep in the holds. They have about three blankets each, very poor ones at that, and complain bitterly of the cold. em- Thcy state that the vessel "" makes plenty water,"" and appear very much afraid of her. They are emphatic on this, and say they want to go back on the Burns, Philp Mataram. As far as I am able to gather they receive about 7s. per month. The Kavu is anchored alongto side Ford's boat building shop at Berry's Bay. I hope that this matter will be investigated. If the natives are being exploited as is suggested, the Government should see that those responsible are brought to book.",44
117,Mr BEUCE,SEAT OF GOVERNMEN T,Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [4.2] - The representations made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr. A. Green) will receive the consideration of the Government. I shall discuss the  and the Minister for Works and Kailways (Mr Stewart). I appreciate the great anxiety that the honourable member feels over the matter. The question raised by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) will be brought under the notice of the Minister for  Question resolved in the affirmative. 1 House adjourned at 4.2 p.m.,45
