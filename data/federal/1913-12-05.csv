Does he in Coloured tend to do so?",12
9,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am afraid that I cannot meet my honourable friend in this matter. I am making earnest inquiries into the statements of the honourable memI sent ber for Herbert, and find that a number of considerations in connection with the construction of the line appear to have been entirely overlooked by him.'

12,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether he is in communication with the Inter-State Commission, and whether he expects to receive a report from the Commission before the session closes ? If the honourable gentleman does not expect to receive a report this session, when does he expect to receive a report? If a report is received, will it be made public property, and will the Minister introduce a Bill providing for certain alterations in the Tariff to give effect to the Commission's recommendations ?",12
13,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Commission has received a number of requests, and has notified that it is desirous of obtaining evidence regarding them, those who wish to give such evidence being invited to do so. The members of the Commission are working very hard. They are at present in Queensland, and have been in South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales. The Commission will take evidence, and when it has done so, it will present reports to the Ministry, whose duty it will be to take action in accordance with the spirit of the legislation passed by this Parliament.",13

[139]",13
17,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Moreton) [10.41] Last week I attempted, on the adjournment, to reply to some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, but Mr Speaker rightly ruled that as they related to a matter which was under discussion in Committee, I could not refer to them on the motion for adjournment. I pointed out at the time that the regulations issued by the Queensland Government under the Queensland Sugar Act were framed with a view to the tapering off of the employment of coloured labour in the sugar industry. Something like 6 per cent, of the labour employed in the industry is coloured, and the growers who have employed coloured labour have had to do without the bounty given by the Commonwealth Parliament. In attempting to abolish coloured labour altogether, the Queensland Government is facing the difficulties of the position in the only way possible. That the State is sincere in its expressed desire to give effect to its compact with the Commonwealth is shown by the legislation which has been passed, which makes provision for the buying out of vested interests. The difficulties in the way of abolishing coloured labour cannot be overcome in a few days. For one thing, the Commonwealth is part of a nation which is bound by treaties with other nations, and the conditions of these treaties must be observed. I do not think it would be said that an Indian, Chinaman, Japanese, or other alien who had a crop of cane growing should be prevented from harvesting it . The regulations have been framed a view of getting coloured labour out of the sugar industry as quickly as possible. The honourable member for Maribyrnong read an ex parte statement from a Labour journal published in Cairns, but that is not sufficient to go on.  black grower should not reap his harvest.",13
18,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"He complained of the regulation which is framed to allow the black grower to reap the harvest. He did not know enough about the case to be able to express an opinion, but read an BUDGET. ex parte statement, which was taken of by the Labour paper to flout the Denham Government. I am to note that the Minister of Trade and Customs is able to verify what I have said. I desire now to draw the attention Preof the Government to some remarks I made in this House some time ago with regard to honourable members' allowances. It is quite possible that within the near future this and another place will once again have to face their masters. It appears to me that the only solution of the present political situation is an appeal to the people. At the last election considerable rush was experienced owing to the short period between the dissolution and the elections, and the oflicers were unable to do their work as it should be done. The shortness of the period was due to the fact that when the House is dissolved, honourable members no longer draw their allowances.",13
19,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"He a r , hear! is outrageous!",14
20,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am under the impression that the present Government will let that fact weigh with them in deciding what the period shall be between the dissolution and the election. They will , I think, endeavour to give the Electoral Oflicers as much time as possible; but, at the same time, I am sure that they have no desire to deprive honourable members of that allowance on which some of them have to depend. In my opinion the cure is to amend the law so that members may continue to draw their u n t i l their successors are appointed.",14
21,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The same as in Queensland.,14
22,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes , and I feel quite sure that the general public think that that is the course pursued at the present time. The newspapers very often tell us that we are drawing £ 6 00 a year, but so far as I am concerned it does amount to £5""00; and if we are to have an election every twelve months the ance will be further reduced very conother trunk lines. siderably. Even though it should involve a sacrifice on my part, I am prepared end this very unsatisfactory state of venue ? affairs in Federal politics today. My advice is that we go to the country as soon as possible and let the people decide. There has been considerable discussion about country telephone facilities, as pared with the facilities of the town. large cities are, I think, very well up date in this regard, and the rates are fairl y cheap in both town and country. miles long. There is a difficulty, however, in.the fact that the regulations are so inflexible apparently, they cannot be varied, b must be applied in exactly the same way all over Australia. Very often country residents are asked to guarantee telephone lines, and this means that a few publicspirited men in the locality find the guarantee. If there is any deficiency, those men are responsible, and, I have no doubt, in many instances, have to dip their hands into their pockets in order to pay for facilities of which other people take advantage. The rate for 15 miles is l d . per call, and the officers in estimating the revenue naturally base it on that rate. This appears to me to be hardly sufficient to pay for the cost of switching a subscriber on where there is only a small scattered population. I am not advocating an all-round increase in the rates, but merely tryin g to show that It where the people themselves are prepared to pay a higher price in order to have telephone facilities they should be allowed to do so, or at least the Department might meet them in some way by making the charge 2d. in particular in stances. Deputations in my own electorate have told me that the people in certain places are prepared to pay even 6d. a call on condition that, if the revenue proves to be more than is required to cover expenses, the rate shall be reduced.",14
23,Mr SHARPE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,How would the honorpay able member suggest raising the money for additional telephones'?  the mismanagement.,14
24,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member for Maranoa has, I think, h it the nail on the head. The rate on the trunk line from Helidon to Brisbane is l s . for three minutes; and if the line were connot tinually used for even every five minutes of the day, it would return an enormous allowrevenue. The same remark applies to",14
25,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"What does the honorto able member call an ""enormous"" re",14
26,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I should say that 100 per cent, over the cost of construction of the line would be an enormous revenue. I find that in the case of most comof tliese trunk lines they are hung up The practically for the whole of the day owing to to the congestion of traffic for 25 miles of one end of the line, which may be 100",14
27,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Can the honourable memthat, ber tell me any country in the world u t where the telephone rates are cheaper?",14
28,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am not 'complaining about the rates, but about the mismanagement; and in reply to the honourable member for Oxley, I say that the u n t i l 6, and are supposed to carry the money for the new telephones is in the business already, if the business were ducted on common-sense lines. Perhaps the whole of the necessary money is not there already, but this country cau afis ford to pay for telephones, and the people deserve some consideration, particularly those in the back country.",14

31,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I agree with what the honourable member says, but the idea is to ru n the Department on a business basis.",15
32,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The proper business basis would be to get some good man, men, to see that the congestion does occur.

33,Mr SHARPE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Department can be put on a proper basis if there is a decent supply of money.,15
34,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It is not altogether money that is necessary, but there are lines which ought to be earning interest, and are not doing so.

The fact is, however, that we have a hardare and-fast regulation that there must be a continuous service, or an eight-hour unsuccessful so far. service. If we had a twelve-hour service ing turned out very slowly. on some of the trunk lines it would give enormous relief, and I think the Departt ment ought to be able to pay for the extra attention necessary.

I have had a fair conamount of experience with machinery, and I think that the best way to make it pay-and this applies to telephonesto wear it out by continuous work. In stead of having these lines hung up for, say, sixteen hours, doing nothing, let them be earning money. the lines where the The honourable member for Frankl in , and also the honourable member for Bendigo, made out a very good case for, at least, calling a halt in regard to our defence expenditure. I am there are appalled at the amount that this nation is called upon to pay at the present time, with every prospect of the expenditure increasing; and we ought to look around for some means to curb it . This matter has already been dealt with by others, and I shall not refer to it further, except to warn this, or any Government, that, or so far as I am concerned, there must be not some curtailment. The defence of Australia belongs to the people of Australia, and the Defence Act was framed to suit their requirements, and not merely to suit the requirements of the officials. If I those officials take the view that they are ex- "" bossing the whole show "" in their own interests, they will find me ranged on the side of the civilian, who has to find the money for this costly insurance.

I regret to learn that either our Small Arms Factory has been so The rifles are beI do not know what the quality is, but the quani t y is very disappointing, and I hope the Government will endeavour to get a hustle on in regard to that factory. There are one or two matters brought is, up by previous speakers to which I wish I know the old adage that those who live in glass houses should not 9 throw stones, and that is' one of the reasons why I refrain, as much as I can, from criticising other honourable members, but I was compelled to have a 'few interesting moments with the honourable member for Brisbane some time ago, and I think it did him good, seeing that he has been remarkably quiet ever since. However, he is beginning to kick over the traces a little, and it may be necessary for me to deal it out to him again later on. listening to the speeches of honourable members opposite, I have been thinking that they are hardly consistent. member that in 1911 a provision was in serted in the Electoral Bill by the Labour party, that all electioneering advertisements should be headed "" A d vertisement,"" and I think that to be consistent honourable members opposite should advocate heading their speeches in Hansard "" Advertisements,"" seeing that most of their speeches during this debate have been made for electioneering purposes.",15

If honourable members opposite were sincere in . their desire to crush trusts out of Australia, they would be urging the taking of action against trusts which already have a grip of the Commonwealth.

112,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"When the honourable member for Brisbane interjects as he has done, he must expect such an answer. While the honourable member for Oxley is sending forth a wail of lament for the poor people of Australia, who, he declares, will be taken down by the Beef Trust, I ask him to listen to the patter on the pavement of the bare feet of those who have been taken down by a class of ""people with whom he has associated himself for a number of years.",19
113,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Order . I am your afraid that the honourable member is now getting way from what may be regarded as fair comment. I must call him to order.,19
114,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I confess that I do not feel myself any the better for indulging in such criticism. But when I am attacked by the other side, I am not going to sit here without hittin g back occasionally. It is very seldom that I do so. I wish now to make an appeal on behalf of a section of the community who should be regarded as Australians, but who have no voice in the government of the Commonwealth, and but little voice in the government of the Territory in which they live. The British people pride themselves, and justly so, I think, on being good colonizers. We have two large territories under the control of the Federal Parliament, and some effort should be made to give the people there every facility for developing the country. I refer more particularly to Papua than to the Northern Teritory. My views with respect to the Northern .Territory are fairly well known in this House. I hold that it can be developed only by giving facilities to those who are prepared to occupy the land and to put it to its best possible use, and that is for pastoral purposes. Residents of Papua, however, have no representation in this House, and are justly entitled to complain of the treatment they have received at the hands of this Parliament. Some time ago we established a wireless station at Port Moresby, but for some unaccountable reason the station was not made available to the people of Papua for something like a week after its completion. A . friend of mine writes to me on the subject as followsI must tell you what appeals to me as Papua's one joke. Mr Fisher was the mill-stone round the neck of Papua-and yet when belated wireless connection was given with Port Moresby the public were not permitted the privilege of sending messages for the first week. No one knew whir but it eventuated that it was reserved for the first message to be a synopsis of Mr Fisher's policy speech at Maryborough-word s of wisdom from the Great Panjandrum. The writer of this letter takes a great interest in Papuan affairs. I have also received the following extract from the Papuan Times of 13th A p r i l lastWe have received a communication from External Affairs to the effect that the press rates to Papua have been fixed, and are very much surprised ""to learn they are about 650 per cent, over and above the Australian rates, which are ios. per 1,000 words all over the rest of the Commonwealth. The press rates to Papua are 13s. per 100 words. Why we should be so disgracefully treated we leave to the imagination of our subscribers, but the fact at the bottom of it all is that we have no vote, and are, therefore, treated as rabbits or other vermin. politician would dare to fix such rates if we had the franchise. The cable to Tasmania cost a hundred times as much as the wireless here, yet the Tasmanian public get their cables at the same rates as the rest of the Commonwealth; but they have got a vote! It seems an exceedingly short sighted policy on the part of the Federal Government to single out and penalize the unfortunate Papuan white citizen, making him pay such exorbitant rates. the press rates should be, we think, uniform, as the news which comes by cable is of interest to all, and the public should be served at reasonable rales. I do not know that those conditions prevail at the present time, but if they do, it is certainly unreasonable to ask the people of Papua to pay 13s. 6d. per 100 words, while the rest of Australia has to pay only 10s. per 1,000 words. However, I am sure the Postmaster-General will give the matter every consideration, and . that these people will be granted facilities equal to those enjoyed by the Mr Sinclair. rest of Australia. If we want to develop Papua and the Northern Territory, we must give the inhabitants every advantage possible. The previous Government, I think, hardly kept f a it h with some of our Australian citizens in the matter of the development of the Papuan oil-fields. A Mr Charles Priddle, whom the honourable member for Maranoa knows, went to Papua aboub twelve years ago, and spent ten years exploring for oil and minerals. He was given to understand that if he made a discovery he would get a lease. He did make a discovery, but when he applied for a lease the late Government, instead of granting it to him, said he would have to wait until they sent over experts to test the country. He has risked his life on many occasions, and has been carried out of the Territory by natives almost in the last stage of exhaustion. He was always, however, buoyed up by the hope that he would be rewarded by getting, at least, a lease or royalty. I believe the late Minister of External Affairs paid £500 to a Mr Thomas.",19
115,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,We paid Let t and Thomas. I never heard of Priddle.,20
116,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member did the righ t thing in compensating Mr .Thomas, although even he was very poorly paid for the work that he did. I believe there are difficulties in the way of compensating even  hanging these things up ' indefinitely. If he had been told three or four years ago No that there was no hope of reward, he would have gone elsewhere. He had tempting offers from German syndicates to explore German New Guinea, but he preferred to work in British territory, and went on, hoping that the matter would soon be settled.",20
117,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"We hear a lot of yarnsIn any case, like this.",20
118,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I regret to hear the honourable member treating the matter with ridicule. It is a very serious thing for men to spend twelve of the best years of their life doing exploratory work, and facing danger, only to find their case laughed at when brought up in this House. I am surprised at the honourable member being so callous as to laugh at men who risk their lives in this way. If he will ask the honourable member for Maranoa privately what he thinks of this man's case, he will get the facts. 1 do not expect the honourable member done them properly. for Maranoa to state them publicly in and lose them, according to this House.",20
119,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,They did not tell me for Melbourne Ports last night. anything about Priddle discovering of over there. Did he discover it?,21
120,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes , he did ; and the honourable member sent a borer over  simply told that he could not get a lease even of four acres. 24th July, 1913, published the following:There are rumours in Melbourne that Donald, who reports so positively against existence of oil on the Victorian River (Northern Territory), was able to spend only a day cr on each of five areas. If this be true, to the Commonwealth to hire an expert to quire thoroughly into the probable existence of oil on the Victoria River. might go to Vailala River, Papua, and find why it took six months to bore 250 feet through soft strata. The finding of oil in Australia - too important a matter to be set back or delayed by the adverse report of only one oil-driller, whatever his qualifications-especiall y when oil-driller has done no drilling. In the same paper of 31st July, 1913, this appearedGlynn, the new Minister in charge of Papuan affairs, says he is quite alive to the importance of the oil prospects in the Dependency, and 'Start the business right he intends to :from America just the very best expert procurO'Malley, able. All this sort of thing takes time. I the present Minister is pushing on with the matter as fast as he can, and I hope the Government will lose no time i .coming to a decision as to what they intend to do with the oil resources of Papua they do exist. There is plenty of capital waiting to be invested in the field i can only get the right to operate, and the Government are not prepared to on.",21
121,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I have no doubt the Standard Oil Company would do it .,21
122,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,We do not want them to do it . We have Australian capital waiting to do it .,21
123,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Don' t you think Austerrace, tralia could do it herself?",21
124,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I think Australia eould, but if it is done at the rate that Christians in this Parliament. has been followed for the last three when will the field be opened up? Are these prospectors to waste the best years of their life for nothing simply because do it . honourable members believe in some Socialistic fad? We have tried do lots of things, and We make trousers the speech made by the honourable member We do l not seem to be able to look after our own affairs, and if private capital can develop the oil fields it should be allowed to do so. The Government can protect themselves against monopoly or abuse, and at the same time receive a very handsome The Bulletin of return by way of royalty. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [11.40] - The great mistake we make in Macthis House is that we are continually at the tacking each other. The honourable member two for Moreton went into the history of a matit is up ter that was discussed in this House some inyears ago. I do not like going into personal matters at all. Some years ago I Incidentally, he out purchased properties in Melbourne. I do not think that was a crime because I was is a Labour man, and I spent £ 8 0 0 on one block to put it in form . Por years it had the not been fit for habitation, yet after I had spent all this money in turning a virtually useless property into a valuable asset, putting in all the conveniences of modern civilization, a clergyman attacked me about it . He had passed it every day to previously for five or six years, and never get out said a word about it , but directly a Labour man, got it , he suddenly discovered that it was a crime know against civilization, and his attack was repeated in this House. My friend went down there and saw it . It covers a whole n block, and. it is quite true that there ought to be more ground space, but if an if owner puts in every convenience that Is required, this does not leave much room f it for back yards, and I do not know that if men spend a great deal of time in their go back yards. I am not much in my own. yard, because I have no time to spare.",21
125,Mr SINCLAIR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,1 did not mention the honourable member.,21
126,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"But the honourable member spoke about different terraces, such as Tudor-terrace, RobertsPage-terrace, Thomas-terrace, and Pearce-terrace. Honourable members will notice that I called them after the Dr years, Agnew went through my properties, and said they wore in fine shape. I told him that if anything required doing I would I hear great condemnation of landlords in this Chamber. I do not say to that landlords are perfect, nor do T say have not that tenants are infallible, but 1 do say that we lose a lot of rents. There ought to be in Australia a law to prevent further buildings going up unless comply with all the sanitary conditions that are essential to the building up of a trouble. great people. When we have to condemn or criticise tilings that people may have it does not mean that the people conthey put me out. cerned did not do their best, but there are more modern ways of doing things now, and these are what we should adopt. The fact that the honourable member for Bendigo dealt with the question of fence last night does not mean that was condemning Senator Pearce, nor the fact that the honourable member for Herbert had a go at the big staff of the Home Affairs Department mean that he was condemning me or the present Acting Minister, the honourable member for Wentworth. He was simply pointing out that in his opinion the Home Affairs partment was over-staffed. It may be. But the idea in America is this, that when you are going to create a great activity you should put them all in shove her through, and get your capital to work.",21
127,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Whateve r the cost? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The point system ? is this: If it takes five years a building costing 1,000,000 dollars, you are losing interest on your capital over a long period. It would be better to get the building put up in three months, so that it would commence to earn a return. We had to create a staff in the Home Affairs Department for the construction of a line of railway 1,063 miles in length. The Engineer-m-Chief pointed out to me that this was essenwhich tial. A lot of young men are employed preparing reports, and typing, and sendmakes the trouble. Money talks all ing out statements. There is a crowd engaged merely in supplying information to Parliament, and in connection with the Chinn Inquiry. You must have a staff. But as soon as its Business isfinishedyou can dismiss the staff. There are no manent hands there. I do not say that affairs, there has been no over-staffing, but later, when the Minister can adjust things, i will be for him to get rid of those who are not wanted. The men are not there for life; they are not pensioners. I sent for every man about whom there was any doubt, and said to him, "" Underwho stand you are not a pensioner here."" The great idea about Public Service ployment is that it will last for ever; that it is a close corporation; and if ¥ any had sixty sons I would start them in the> they Public Service, and say "" Climb."" They would have a sure living without much>",22
128,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It is not sure. I wasdone in the Public Service for seven years and Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - I was in it. for three years at the. top of affairs.,22
129,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"And got the sack. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - But you. dehave seen no tears. I have not wept: he over it . I had a fair innings, and I does want now to give others a chance. But. I left the Department organized, so that, all they have to do is to touch the button', and she works. It is a wonderful tributeto the Fisher Administration that our friends opposite have made no changes. The bi-monthly schedule, the digest, andi Dethe costing system-the finest in the world-ar e all there. For the first time in the history of Australia it can be ascertained in regard to a Government, and job what materials, labour, and management are costing, and a balance-sheet canbe prepared every two weeks.",22
130,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Who discovered that to put up Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - I do note like to claim credit for everything. I suppose the honourable member thinks= the officials discovered ' it . Instead? of always abusing each other we should try to hatch out a business system, and help to make the country progress. No one will say that Governments: are run on the scientific business methodsthat are adopted by private corporationspay dividends, but they should' be so run. It is the party system that 1 languages, and turns a corner when, nothing else will. The money questionis the biggest in the world, and yet, for the last five months, it has seldom beentouched upon in this chamber. We very perrarely get down to the rock basis of the financial system of the nation.. I congratulate honourable members, who, t yesterday, pointed out the iniquity of throwing away millions on the defencesystem, and going beyond the actual necessities of Australia. What has happenedhas reminded me of three Englishmen came to Western America, and' bought a mine when I was there. They embrought their machinery and experts at. high salaries, but when they started? operations, they found that the only gold there was some that had been brought from Mexico by certain buncoeteerers, and shot in with guns. wasted £80,000, or 400,000 dollars, before they ascertained whether there was a reef to work. The Defence Department seems to be suffering from a similar madness. It is not the faul t of the Minister at the head of the Department. Both Senator Pearce and Senator Millen are able men. When we get up here and criticise, we are told that we are against defence. Like the honourable member for Bendigo, I give my meed of praise to the Age for having directed attention to this matter. The Age was one of the first newspapers to advocate a big scheme of defence, and it is still - in favour of defence, but it is not in favour of mortgaging the future generations of Australia for the purpose of - creating a fighting machine so expensive that when there comes to be need for using it we shall have no money with - which to fight. This is the flying period. At the great Labour Conference held in Brisbane in 1907, several of us endeavoured to persuade the meeting that the flying period had arrived, and that our defence preparations should consist in buying flying machines and submarines. Many differed from us, however, with the result that Mr Watson, who as a very able man, and prominent in the Labour cause, was strong enough to get his way, and the system that has since been followed was adopted. opponents of Labour vied with us in preparations for a defence such as is not required by an isolated country like Australia. One party has been bidding against the other, instead of both parties combining to study the interests - of the shareholders. Australia hitherto has been governed, not for the shareholders, but for the directors. not the directors. It is the four men sitting with the Prime Minister in - Cabinet, the Prime Minister having the casting vote, that are the directors. The Treasurer knows that there is only one job worth having, and he has always said so. I remember him in the West. There were no stoppages the n ; the works always went on. Nowadays we have flying machines travelling 1,000 miles at the rate of 50 miles an hour, and the progress in these matters is being accelerated. John B u l l is hard to move, but he has voted this year £1,000,000 for airships. Yet Australia is continuing to build Dreadnoughts. Mr Hayes Hammond, They the son of a great multi-millionaire in America, has invented a wireless system that will enable him to blow up a Dreadnought which is 8 or 10 miles away at sea. His invention has created a sensation i u America.",22
131,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I do not think he can do that yet.,23
132,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"He has done it . He gave Tom Edison the surprise of his life. Tom did n ' t believe him. Vickers now is building an airship factory. The time has come when we must recognise the advantages of aircraft, but when Senator Findley and myself were fighting the battle in Brisbane, we were ridiculed, even when walking in the streets, as the air-ship men. Years ago I advocated the building of Commonwealth offices in London, and that suggestion was ridiculed. To show that my views on defence are not new, I propose to quote something that I said in this chamber in the first session. If we go on as we are doing, the time w i ll come when every man in the country, poor and rich, will be taxed out of house and home to pay for ships and war material that has been on the scrap heap for generations.",23
133,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,We shall not. go so far as that.,23
134,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I let my honourable friend have his say, and I am Then the entitled to my own opinion. I have never hesitated to express my views, and they cannot beat me. It was our friends opposite that bought the machinery for the Lithgow factory, but it does not matter who did it . What we have to do now is to vote each year a limited sum for the Government to spend as they like on defence. We are Mr SAMPSON - Not as they like. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They will do as they like, anyhow. I travelled through the southern States of America after the war,- and I was told by the women there that the soldiers had cut down the trees to get the f r u it . We know all the disastrous effects of a military army crossing the country-whe n militarism gets into the saddle. A soldier does not even weave his own knot of glory, or bake his own bread. We want no permanent army here, but only a citizen army. Some years ago I proposed that there should be purchased 200,000 rifles, stamped with the Commonwealth stamp, so that they could not be bought or sold, and that they should be distributed amongst the farmers' sons, who, on a compulsory basis, should be drilled on a .Saturday afternoon. There musb be compulsion to that extent, but it is not necessary to take boys out of their offices. They should start drilling at a specified age, after they have gone through the schools, and they should be taught to shoot. ""What is the good of a man on the battlefield if he cannot shoot? Future wars will be fought, not with the solid phalanx, but from behind hedges and briars, as the Boers fought. spoke on this subject thirteen years ago I dwelt on the necessity for a uniform railway gauge. Are honourable members aware that if we desired to transport even a small army from here to Brisbane it would occupy sixty days with the present break of gauge ? I went on to sayEvery great democracy that has been crushed has been crushed by military despotism-b "" man on horseback."" I admit that war the accumulation of the people. grow into great opulence, and wealth, and importance, but it casts a great gloom over vast multitude of the people. They recognise that they have to pay the taxes. want a military despotism, or the "" man on horseback,"" in Australia. We have no room for Napoleons in Australia. Why should we not do away with the feathers and dress, so that a man can go out and d r ill in his ordinary clothes ?We could have our drill-masters going out into every town and teaching the young men on twelve or fifteen afternoons a year, and it should be compulsory for the men to close up their places of business and to go out and drill on the squares on those particular afternoons. To spend millions on an army and a navy is the greatest economic waste. In 1905, as reported on page 1657 of Hansard, saidThat is included in the matters I have mentioned. If the sum which it end upon defence were handed over to the § tales Treasurers for the purpose of enabling . them to place people upon the land, the railways of the Commonwealth would pay. we should pension off our military men. them come and dance with the young ladies of the town, and enjoy themselves. But we should waste no more of the taxpayers' money upon these military phantoms, which are conjured for the specific purpose of creating a scare which does not .exist. Great Britain has confidently withdrawn her fleet from the Eastern seas-according to American newspapers-and Mr King O'Malley. to trust Japan and France, her allies. America has not yet withdrawn her fleet from Manila, but now that peace has been concluded between Russia and Japan she will doubtless do so. I claim that it is not necessary to waste money upon the maintenance of an army in Australia. I went on to say that if the £4,000,000 we were proposing to waste were handed to the States, we should have closer settlement, increased population, in creased production, and a big bank balance to come back to the Treasurer of Australia. In* 1906 I uttered similar sentiments.",23

It take £200,000 a year to maintain it England, and I suppose it will cost out. £300,000 a year in Australia, for which sum we could almost put a line of craft along our coast and maintain them. We could also send scientific men up into the air to study the air currents, as they are doing in America now; and we could submarines in almost all our harbors where the enemy could effect a landing. The question is, not what we have done, or what some one else has done; it is what we are to do in the future, and how we are going to arrange to l i m it the tremendous expense that is growing so fast. I heard an honourable member yesterday reading a list of officers in the Northern Territory, but I would like to know What would they do if they did not have their us officials on the spot to meet immigrants? My own opinion is that the Northern will never be settled u n t i l Ausare talking tralia has 25,000,000 or 30,000,000 and then Only when the overflow from the south will start for the north, the same as took place in connection with development of Western America. the Every one I met said there would never any population in that area, but now the 20,000,000 people have settled there. German and French scientific farmers came into New Hampshire and Vermont, and bought out the young American farmers, and the latter, in turn , went west to that district where the United States Government had established i m The Central Administration of the United States had for asked the State authorities to meet them it in the matter, and this was done, with the result that a unified system of irrigation was created, and land which could be got for almost nothing is now worth anyFleet thing up to 500 dols. an acre.  friendly relations between the Central Goand vernment and the States? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Certainly ; said bewhile I am here I belong to no side. I to be straight. the right movement according to my I do not imagine that a bull'sthe present Government can start in that and cut things down suddenly; but durTake a ing recess they oan sit down and have a will Christian, heart-to-heart confab on the in matter and see where they can cut things I have always held that we cannot carry out in their entirety the schemes of airAdmiral Henderson and Lord Kitchener. It is not required that we should do so. The trouble is that a Minister seeks to do the very best, but his advisers have ideas that are suited to the great British Empire, and not to a little part of it. Our population is not as much as New York City. It is 2,000,000 behind London. It is not as much as that of the State of Ohio. It is 2,000,000 behind Illinois, 3,000,000 behind Pennsylvania, and. 5,000,000 behind the little State of New York. We have not the population. We should pick out two or three Naval Bases and limit ourselves to them, gradually making them complete. Can any honourable member point to me any fort in Europe that stood a siege when the besiegers had sufEcient time to keep it up? Paris, Vienna, Berlin, Moscow-al l had to fall before the conquering heroes. General Pemberton said that Vicksburg impregnable. General Grant simply came and said, ""Come out,"" and out she came. General Pemberton said, "" Y o u will have to catch the rabbit before you cook it "" ; but Grant said, "" I have got you""; and Pemberton had to come out with 33,000 men. General Bazaine, with 140,000 men, was shut up in Metz, and the German Army marched by him, leaving him there, and went on to pulverize MACMahon at Sedan. Port Arthur had to surrender to Nogi. General Todleben, the Russian general, so fortified Sebastopol that it was said that it was impregnable ; but "" John B u l l "" marched in over his head. It matters not what we spend on forts; they have to go. When men get in them, they are surrounded and starved out. If we have to fight, let us fight in the open, as Washington did. Though Washington ran away, and lived to fight another day, he lived and fought until finally he got Cornwallis at Yorktown. In a great sparsely-settled country like Australia we require no forts, yet every big general who comes out from Europe wants us to build forts and mines to keep out the enemy. In days gone by, we used to build forts to keep out people, but now we are building ships to bring them here. When the methods of unionism have reached over the world, there will be a Christian fellowship, and German, French, Austrian, American, and Australian workers will meet and say, "" There shall be no more war.""  that already in Australia, is there not? Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - Ah ! They are in a primitive stage. From that will get into the intellectual and Christian stage. We should have a Defence Committee, a real Defence Committee of the House, composed of a few men who are not military men. I would rather get men who are managers of a Presbyterian Church. I have a great faith in Presbyterians; they are such good business men. The Committee should have power to deal with all military questions that came forward. I would not pay them fees, but they should have their expenses paid. They would go and look at certain sites. They would be trustees of the people, and would not waste money. I have always had the greatest confidence in members of Parliament. They are the trusted trustees of the Australian people. was Mr. JOSEPH COOK - When we come to think of it, we are a lot of fine fellows. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The only trouble is that the present system makes us hate each other. It is not real hatred; it is only un-Christian hatred; it is not real scientific hatred. A Committee such as I have suggested could say to the Prime Minister or the Treasurer, "" This is the amount you will spend this year."" It was a recognised rule in America, even where they are clever in finance, that the Military Department was a sink. There has never been an abler Minister of Defence in Australia than Senator Pearce; and Senator Millen is an able man, as every one recognises. They are both able men; but, Lord, they cannot tell what is going on in their Departments. I was an animated rubber stamp for three months. I used to tell the Department to work me, to come down and get the stamp working. A Minister must be a rubber stamp until he' has his Department so systematized and so digested that he can pick up a matter quickly and say, "" Hold on; what are you spending on barracks? Um!"" The secretary of the Department may be the most honest man in the world, but he is a sympathetic man-h e does not want to do anything that is wrong; he will not do anything wrong; and he can bring down a statement that looks all right until it is thoroughly investigated, and then it looks, all wrong. The Defence Department needs to be tackled; but it could not be tackled in the first stages when we were creating it. Now it will need to be gone into very carefully, and they we ought to have a Committee. I would not l i m it itte membership ;to Presbyterians. I was at one time the director of a company in America, on the board of which we had quite a number of Presbyterians and they were good business men. I should like a Committee to be appointed from all sides of the House to go carefully into this matter. I come now to the Tasmanian mail service, which is a question of great concern to the people of the island State. At the present time 200,000 people in Tasmania are dependent upon one shipping corporation.",25
149,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Where is Tasmania? Mr KING O'MALLEY - In centre of Australia, intellectually. populated Victoria, and gave her her genius and her snap. I would urge the Government to establish a line of steamers of its own to ru n between the mainland and Tasmania. We intended to establish such a service, but had not time to do so. The Government need not interfere with other companies. I would not make the Commonwealth service a monopoly, but I would reduce fares andfreights, and so enable the Tasmanian farmer to place his produce on the market on equal terms with the farmer on the mainland, who reaps the benefit of the State-owned railways. If the Labour party had been returned to office, that is one of the first things we should have done. Burnie, because of its geographical position, is the natural distributing centre of Tasmania. Mr .JENSEN - It comes second to Launceston.",27
150,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not want to get into trouble. I thought that my honourable friend was outside. I am glad, however, to see him fighting for his own city. At Burnie we have a splendid harbour. Thousands of pounds are being expended in extending the breakwater, and the"" largest ships in the world can be accommodated there. We ought to have a fast line of steamers running between Victoria and Burnie, where the mails could be rapidly distributed. They would leave Melbourne today, and be distributed all over Tasmania tomorrow. At the present time, we have only a slow train travelling between Launceston and Burnie. to another subject, I think the Government ought to follow up the system that we laid down, and which we were gradually advancing, by giving better remuneration to those employed in our contract and allowance post-offices. I am filled with righteous indignation when I see that millions are provided for preparing a defence scheme, which will never be required, while throughout the back-blocks of Australia, where the producers have to live, even short telephone lines and reasonable postal accommodation cannot ,be secured. There are women working for sweated wages in contract and allowance offices, and many of the mail carriers are also underpaid.",27
151,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Le t the Department in crease the telephone rates. the Mr KING OMALLEY - W h e r e you It have an extensive business concern, the great point is to make the profitable section pay for the unprofitable sections. We ought to encourage in every way our primary producers, on whom depend the people of our cities. Burn down your cities and keep your men on the land, and the farmers will rear up even grander cities in their stead. But burn out your farmers, and you will soon see the people of the large towns swimming in their own stew. The city resident has all the comforts of civilization-libraries , theatres, picture shows, and motor - cars. He does not appreciate how hard is the lot of the man in the back-blocks.",27
152,Mr ABTHUB,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Nearl y all the farmers now have motor cars. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Goo d luck to them! They ought to have had them a long time ago. I notice with regret that our revenue is declining. I wonder what is the reason ? Can it be that the Lord is punishing the present Government for some unspiritual act? The members of the Ministry are fairl y good honest men, and mean well; but without revenue a Government must be crippled.",27
153,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The revenue of the Postal Department is going up.,27
154,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes ; because we gave her a fair start. Whilst the Labour party was in power, revenue was pouring in . The people in far-off countries' said, "" There is a Labour Government yonder. We can trust them, and therefore we will pile in our Turning goods, and so swell their revenue."" Whether they have lost confidence in the present Government, I cannot say. Some time ago, in the United States, a British duke was making a fine speech about the land of his birth , and concluded by saying that he belonged to an Empire on which the sun never set. lawyer, named Kearn, who was present, replied that he was thankful that the Lord had sumcient confidence in America to allow the people of that country to sleep in the dark. I am unable to account for this falling off in the Customs revenue. From the point of view of Protectionists-and I am a Protectionist - it is a good thing, but I am sorry that there should be a decline in the revenue, because we need more revenue to carry on our great activities and enterprises. the other day of a member of the Government who spoke of our extravagance and profligacy. I would remind him that when we took office we found post-offices, military barracks, rifle ranges, and various public buildings in a state of almost hopeless decay. From the inception of Federation successive Governments of the Commonwealth had vied with each other in returning their revenues to the States, whilst, for years before Federation, many of the States had neglected to repair the great national assets which were to be taken over by the Commonwealth. They handed them over to us, in many cases, in a state of ill repair. When we took office we were constantly being advised by honourable members on all sides of the House of Commonwealth properties that were in disrepair, and were urged to take action in regard to them. My natural business mind would not allow me to let this state of affairs continue. We spent millions in repairing various public buildings and improving numerous public works, and I am sure that honourable members generally must have approved of our action. At the same time we saved Australia some millions of money. venture to say that the Department of Home Affairs saved the country £200,000 in the purchase, repair, and renewal of properties. Whilst I was Minister of Homo Affairs I kept what I called a savings book. It is still in the Department, and any honourable member may apply to inspect, and learn from it the savings we made. The Treasurer has determined to consolidate the State debts. Before he attempts anything of the kind he ought to convene a conference of the State Treasurers and Premiers.",27
155,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,He could not ceed with his scheme without doing so. Mr King O'Malley.,28
156,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Q u it e so. By the way, I desire to congratulate the A honourable member for Franklin on the speech that he delivered yesterday. Save in one or two respects, it was the utterance of a statesman. The Treasurer, I repeat, should call a conference of the State Premiers and Treasurers, with their State actuaries, to discuss with the Commonwealth Government the consolidation of the debts of Australia, irrespective of party politics. This conference ought to try to draw up a financial scheme upon which the consolidation of the debts might rest. It should also deal with the quesI read tion of a uniform railway gauge. The Commonwealth Government, in my opinion, ought to bear the whole cost of securing uniformity. The States put down their railways with due regard to the conditions that were then obtaining. They borrowed money to build them, and if the Commonwealth desires to unif y the railway gauges of the several systems for the benefit of the whole of the people, then the whole of the people ought to bear the cost. The conference should also agree upon a system of national irrigation, as well as national water conservation, national afforestation, and a scheme to encourage immigration, provided that immigrants can be placed on the land. I am strong for that, but I do not believe in bringing people to Australia merely to dump them down in our great cities. As a matter of fact, T have sixty or seventy people waiting to get into one of the terrace of houses to which the honourable member for Moreton has referred. I may say, in passing, that I have not raised the rents of those places. I hope that this conference will take place at an early date. There is a vast difference between attempting to do something for yourself I and calling in the others concerned and asking them to join with you. The Commonwealth Bank could be utilized for carrying out the scheme agreed to by the Brisbane Conference.",28
157,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Is the honourable member satisfied with the bank's operations at present?,28
158,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No ; but I think we could not have done more in making a start. The Bank, like other institutions, has not stopped growing, but its growth must necessarily be gradual. It can be made a great institution for the proCommonwealth, the States, the municipalities, and the various public trusts. My original scheme, as adopted hy the Brisbane Labour Conference was, ""That the board of management of the bank shall consist of a Comptroller-General representing the Commonwealth and a representative from each of the subscribing States."" That was on 15th A p r i l , 1908. It was further proposed that- "" A brancli of the bank shall be established in London ; at the London office and at the head office of the bank in each State Commonwealth consols shall be obtainable in sums of £ 1 0 and upwards."" Our idea was to give the bank a start, and then let it develop. In 1913, £15,978,430 of debts mature, and these have to be met. Under the present system of financing the States are in the market competing with <!he world. They are often not in a position to carry on and meet their obligations, with all these debts maturing, and, consequently, have to go on to the market and pay higher rates of brokerage, high rates of discount, high rates of bank commissions, and high rates for all kinds of other commissions. The Commonwealth Bank ought to be in a position to finance the States until money is cheap in London, Paris, or New York, and they could then go on to those markets and float their redemption loans. The intention of the bank is to convert, to renew, and to issue inscribed stock for the Commonwealth, the States, and municipalities. If the bank is not going to do those things there is no room for it in Australia. It will simply become a competitor with the other banks. The Bank of New South Wales has £34,000,000 of deposits, and the Commonwealth Bank has about £5,000,000. Of course, it has done very well in the circumstances, but it ought to he the right hand of the Commonwealth, and it ought to be in a position to give rural credits to help the producers of this country. In 1914, £2,864,061 of debts fall due, and in 1915 debts to the amount of £21,662,945 mature. All these loans will have to be refloated, because I do not imagine that any of the States are yet prepared to liquidate those obligations. The Treasurer has now one of the great opportunities of his life-the opportunity to create a financial system in Australia that will make it impossible for the States to have to go cap in hand to the Hebrew children of London and put-their watches up. The net profits of the twenty-three banks, including the little Ballarat Banking Company, for the past year were £3,227,827. All that has to come out of the pockets of the producers and traders of Australia-thos e who t ill the land and do the hard toil in this country, because we in the cities produce no wealth. The dividends paid amounted to £1,748,723 for the same period, while £1,066,500 was added to reserves, as compared with £819,700 added to reserves during the previous year. I believe in the building up of these reserves, because I want to see strong institutions.",28
159,Mr AHEBN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Y o u say these profits were taken from the Australian producers. To whom did they go ?,29
160,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,They went to other investors.,29
161,Mr AHEBN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Would not many of them be the same people 1,29
162,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I am afraid I do not do any producing myself.,29
163,Mr AHEBN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Then the honourable member is a holder of bank .shares),29
164,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have some somewhere. What I claim is, that that money was taken out of the pockets of the Australian producers and traders in order to enable them to exchange their commodities and properties. This country today is ru n by three classes, bankers, doctors, and lawyers, and all the rest of us work for them. Extravagance and poverty-particularl y extravagance, whether in the individual or in the nation-ar e the things that sap the life of a community. That is why we want in Australia a great bank of re-discount, and the Commonwealth Bank can never become this, or become a self-liquidating in stitution until the States join in . I shall show the Committee why. First of all, millions of the Australian people's money is out on call loan. The balance-sheets of our great financial institutions show that they keep thousands of pounds on call loan in London.",29
165,Mr AHEBN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Why is that ?,29
166,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"C all loans are let on stock exchange collateral security, because that is the second line of defence. We have in Australia no financial institutions like the Bank of England, or the Bank of France, to enable our resources to be mobilized for the benefit <pf our people generally. That was the cause of the failure of the Australian banks in 1893. If the Commonwealth Bank was made a re-discount bank to handle, in addition to other functions, the securities of the Commonwealth, States, municipalities, and 'various public trusts, it would k n it together the reserves of Australia, and reinforce them with the resources of the Commonwealth through the national treasury. Those reserves could then be mobilized by the Commonwealth Bank for the benefit of the Australian producers. One finds in talking to most men that they have never bothered about the question of finance, yet it is the great question of the world today. Whether we like it or not everything is a matter of boodle, and boodle is the machine that keeps the show moving. The money let on call loan is taken out of production, out of its legitimate channel, but the banks have to do it , and I have no doubt that the Governments do the same. The reason is that the various Australian Banks and financial and fiduciary institutions have no re-discount in stitutions to which they can go with their collateral securities and say, "" We want a re-discount to enable our clients to carry on their activities.""",29
167,Unknown,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,30
168,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have said that the reason why banks have to lend on call loans is that they are the second line of defence. If we had in Australia a re-discounting bank, the other banks would not be forced to lend on call loans. In my opinion, to have large sums of money lent on call loans produces an element of danger, and is unsound banking. The loans are on stock exchange collateral security, and at call. It is because there is no great bank of discount in Australia, in which other banks and financial institutions could liquidate their securities if they wished to do so, that our banks have to lend on call, and millions are thus taken out of the natural channels of trade and commerce that might be used to increase the production of Australia. Hundreds of people who have in vestments out are involved. It is not safe for banks to lend a large part of their funds upon private corporation securities, because these securities do not tend to liquidate themselves when that is desirable. If we had a big banking institution, such as the Commonwealth Bank will be when the States have become our partners, the activities and finances ^.of Australia would pass through it , and it would be in a position to immediately utilize its great national financial power for the benefit of the individual. The reason that the other banks are not in that position* is that the securities are for loans made> on bills receivable, and these bills cannot be liquidated until they haver matured. If there is no re-discounting, bank, and you want to get a bit of capital, you must go to one of the Hebrew children, but they take all your profits. Mr BOYD* - The banks will discount bills.",30
169,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The bankshave not the money. The Commercial Bank would not have closed its doors in 1893 if it could have got £50,000.",30
170,Sir ROBERT BEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That happened at the time of a crisis.,30
171,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"What is the central bank for but to prevent crises? In 1857 the Bank of England had only £358,503 worth of gold, and under Sir Robert Peel's Act of 1844 the moment that a certain sum was out it had to stopdiscounting. It stopped discounting, and there was one of the greatest financial crises ever known in the history of England. The very Government that had passed the Act authorized the bank to break it . The Bank of England is the repository of all the gold of England, Scotland, and Wales, and of most of the gold of Ireland. It is also the British Government's bank of deposit. The reserves of England are only credits on the ledgers of the Bank of England. If gold is wanted anywhere in England, Scotland, or Wales, it is withdrawn from the Bank of England, and, in the natural course of business, comes back to the bank. In 1857 the bank had only £358,000 in gold, and that represented all the gold in the United Kingdom, yet it discounted £8,000,000 worth of credit-circulating notes for the business men of London. The other banks did the same, and i m mediately the gold in the Bank of England increased to £1,000,000. That is what we want in Australia. A private banking corporation has only a limited amount of capital. Our largest financial institution, the Bank of New South Wales, has a capital of only £3,500,000, and deposits amounting to £34,000,000. How could it carry on the business of the Australian nation? What we want is a central bank where the other banks and the great lending corporations of Australia could re-discount a certain percentage of their commercial paper, and thus help the producers.",30
172,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No central bank could stand if there were a collapse of credit in the country. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - No central bank would allow a collapse of credit. Eventually the Commonwealth Bank will have the note issue. It will become the repository of the gold of the Commonwealth, and of the gold reserves of the other banks.",31
173,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"And would prevent a smash. Mr KING O'MALLEY - How could there be a smash ? We have £225,000,000 of deposits in Australian banks. There is £87,000,000 in the commercial banks drawing interest, and £62,000,000 not drawing interest. In the savings banks there is £75,000,000. Against all that is only £51,000,000 worth of gold. The total interest on the £225,000,000 is £2 3s. 7d. per cent., so that the corporations and banking associations, and others handling Australian finance, pay only £4,914,000 per annum for the £225,000,000 that they have borrowed. The private and public debt of Australia, as nearly as it can be calculated, is £650,000,000. The public debt is £300,000,000, not including the municipal debt, so that my figures are certainly under the mark. The people of Australia, public and private, pay not less than 6 per cent, for the money they have borrowed, which means that they nave to produce £39,000,000 every year to liquidate their interest obligations. The corporations that hold the £225,000,000 will not lend any of it for less than 6 per cent. I come now to another point. There is no institution in Australia, public or private, that has the power to stop a financial crisis. Why do not the banks stand together? Had not Sir George Dibbs made bank notes legal tender in New South Wales for six months, enabling the banks to withdraw their gold from the State, not one of them would have been able to resist crossing Jordan. As it was, we had institutions closed up holding £60,000,000 of the deposits of the people. That caused hatred in England, and frightened the English capitalist from putting out his money in Australia. I know, because I have relatives in the "" boodle "" business.",31
174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"And the honourable member has been in it himself. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am a small man. The Prime Minister has a great chance to settle this matter. When you have a great re-discounting bank, it becomes a self-liquidating institution, like the Bank of France. From 1890 until the present time, the discount rates of the Bank of France have varied only between 2 and 4 per cent. During the Boer war the rate went up to 4 per cent., and it has-gone to 3 per cent. For seven years it stood at 2 per cent. Why should the people of France be able to get their paper re-discounted at 2 per cent., and why should the Australian farmers, upon whom we all depend for our existence, have to pay 6 or 8 per cent, unless they give a mortgage? Why should a farmer give a mortgage any more than I have to do when I want £200 or £1,000? Why there should not a farmer be able to get an overdraft from a bank, as in Germany, or in France? The Government should ascertain by absolute investigation why the lands of France and Germany produce twice the crop per acre that is produced in Australia. It is because the German and French producer can get money at from 3 to 5 per cent, for a term of fifty years, and can repay the principal at the rate of J per cent, a year, or in a lump sum, as it may suit him. Money is advanced to him to buy land and to improve it . The German Government backs up associations that lend money to the farmers at low rates of interest, making these institutions its special pets. Does any one say that the land of Germany is as rich as the land of Australia? In Germany, I suppose, they have been ploughing the land for 2,000 years; but theirs is scientific farming. The Australian farmers are the men on whom the wealth of the nation rests; and yet the financial men-the manufacturers of bonds, mortgages, shares, debentures, stocks, letters of credit, and bills of exchange, are those whom Australia favours. For years and years the great banking corporations have discriminated against the farmers in favour of the producers of lists of securities, which, after all, are only the title to the profits from the land, and the labour of the Australian workers. For millions of years the masses have stood with their backs bent, and the great army of gatherers have marched to glory and. affluence over those backs.  impossible to regard the present Estimates with any very great measure of equanimity. The expenditure involved is very large, and I j as one sitting behind the Government, will be very grievously disappointed if , when in due time they submit' their next Budget, a very different tale is not unfolded. I am quite in agreement with the honourable member for Darwin that there is too much fighting one with the other in this House, and that we ought to unite forces to meet the national conditions and promote the betterment of the people. That honourable member devoted considerable time to the question of the defence expenditure. When the present defence scheme was entered upon I do not think that any one of us fairly apprehended thab the expenditure would be so enormous in such a short space of time; and it certainly exceeds very largely that anticipated by Lord Kitchener. This is one of the matters to which the Government will have to give very serious attention during the recess. There will have to be modifications in some directions in order to meet the case from the financial point of view. Much has been attempted in the way of Socialistic enterprises; but each experiment seems to demonstrate more and more that the Socialistic system of Government control is not the best for the country. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It on the manager.  ber had charge of a Department for three years, and he knows the difficulties of management under Government control.",31
175,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"O p e n the Public Service, and let business men into iti  able member propose to get the business men there?",32
176,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"B y paying them a good wage.  thinking that we are paying good wages to men of capacity and power. I regard the report on the Small Arms Factory as disclosing a p it if u l state of things. Here we have a factory erected at a capital cost of £288,000 , and yet, up to the present time, it has turned out only 1,000 rifles and appurtenances, valued at about £6,600. That cost is surely outrageous, and would never be tolerated for a moment under private enterprise; in deed, no Government could stand it if they had not the power of taxation. For the support and upkeep of all these huge, unnecessary, unprofitable ventures we have ultimately to f all back on the taxpayer. The question of defence, however, has been traversed at considerable length, and I shall turn my attention to the Northern Territory. It is in regard to defence and the Territory that we shall be forced to alter our policy, or the people will rebel. I question whether there is a single bond fide settler permanently established in the Territory. In 1911-12 the Administration showed a debit balance of £363,000 , and in 1912-13 a debit balance of £393,000 , while the present Estimates anticipate a debit balance of £531,000 . Ver y largely this amount is made up of the salaries of the 216 officers who have been sent there. The estimated expenditure on salaries and contingencies is shown under fourteen heads, and the increase this year, as compared with last year, is no less than £57,000. For this huge expenditure we ought to anticipate a speedy settlement of the country, but in this connection the last report from the Administrator tells a doleful story. It appears to me, on reading the report, that there is an entire absence of policy so far as the development of the country is concerned. The only indication I can all depends see of any policy is a determination to conduct the administration on Socialistic lines, which, in the light of experience, we are justified in regarding as foredoomed to failure.",32
177,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Rubbish !  tance ! The Administrator admits that private enterprise has done much in ascertaining the capacity of the lands. On page 6 of his report, he says. . . it says mucb fox the hardiness and intrepidity of the stockmen and bushmen who explored it seeking cattle country in the early days, that little of it is, in a general sense, totally unknown. Private enterprise has been good enough to investigate the merits of the country, and apparently private enterprise has "" turn e d it d o w n "" as not good enough for practical men. Anythin g would commend itself to a highly-paid official, whose position is determined by the reports he submits; but it is a different story with a practical person. The Administrator goes on to sayThose men who traversed the country in search of stock lands had an excellent idea of wh;rt was suitable, so much so that today the best and most accessible first and second class pastoral (which includes agricultural) lands are held under long lease or yearly permit, and at a rental so low as to be almost negligible. For example, we find nearly seventy million acres held under leases which do not expire for nearly thirty, years, in the majority of cases, at a rental of is. per mile, or o.2d. per acre, the most that can ever be charged for the best of it being o.ld. per acre, while another twenty-five million acres are held on yearly permit at a rental of is. per mile. It is further safe to say that the whole of this vast area, comprising the picked lands of the country, does not contain a white population of more than one to the thousand square miles. This is described by the Administrator as the picked land of the country, and the value of the leases to those men is shown by a further statement on page 8I do not anticipate that such resumption will at any time be a costly matter. We have seen how Messrs. Lawrie and Co. viewed the possibility of a Government settlement near their Elsy run; it was welcomed so much that they handed over the area we desired without compensation, although the leases had about another thirty years to run, and I confidently anticipate that other large leaseholders' will equally see that it may be to their advantage to have some comparatively close settlement in their vicinity. Whatever virtues there may . be in private ownership and private enterprise, I do not think that those interested can be accused of any magnanimous or anxious consideration for the welfare of other people. Generally, people are led into a new country by the anticipation of doing good for themselves; but here we find men prepared to throw up these vast areas in favour of the Government. Even in the matter of poultry, the A d ministrator, while saying that the in dustry is very good, points out that it is troubled by various diseases. horses, he saysAs I have already reported, horse-breeding in the past has been but indifferently carried on, partly because of the absence of fencing and provision of proper food during the long dry season for the young growing animals, partly because of the absence of care in the selection of stallions, and to a considerable extent owing to the presence of a disease known as "" W a l k about."" To give a further insight into the beautif u l condition of this country, I take another quotationThere is, of course, no paddocking whatever, and often there is no good grass at certain periods, either through burning or through soil poverty, within anything like reasonable distance of the station. For example, when at Borroloola, I found that the police horses were being perforce herded twenty miles away from a station. Further, as the horses are grass-fed solely, they are rarely in a condition to do long forced marches. This is a valuable report, as showing the splendid asset we have for our enormous expenditure, running into millions of money.",32
178,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member is sarcastic. Does he not think that the Territory is a splendid asset?  evolved for developing the country by a railway from Oodnadatta northward into the hills, gradually, as a preliminary, developing the grazing areas, some good might be done; but no one but a highly paid Government official would have approved the course that is being followed. We have a lengthy report upon the Batchelor Farm, and there are one or two beautiful illustrations of how they do things there. The other day a question was answered in the House, showing that there was a loss of something like £19,000 on these farms. This is the way in which Government officialdom works. This is what the report of the Administrator saysOwing to the fact that operations at this farm were commenced in the midst of the wet season and that no horses suitable for haulage could be procured for many weeks, a great deal of work in connection with temporary buildings and yards had to be undertaken, and it was not until the dry season was approaching that an area of 20 acres had been cleared, fenced, and ploughed' for the trial of crops. If it was the wrong season in which to commence, why did they commence then? Private enterprise and common sense would not have acted in that way, carrying out a fixed duty impressed on them, As to and then making a complaint about it afterwards. But this is the inevitable outcome of Government control in matters which rightly and properly private enterprise alone can accomplish. We have in this report furnished by the A d ministrator one or two explanatory tables showing how the costs of clearing are arrived at. One clearing of 75 acres was undertaken by day labour, with the aid of a traction engine, and the work occupied twenty-eight weeks, at a cost of £ 7 13s. per acre. Is that not a beautiful picture? Further, there is a paragraph dealing with an area of forty-five acres which was cleared by contract, and the means adopted were the use of a forest devil and hand grubbing. This work was done in five weeks at a cost of £ 5 15s. ' per acre, I am glad to see that the Administrator has awakened to the fact that there are other considerations than those of a Socialistic nature. Another paragraph says The dealing that will prove of most interest to the average settler is that now being done by contract-trees , saplings, and old stumps removed to a clear 9 inches. The area comprises two paddocks. of 80 acres each of what may fairly be described as moderately heavily timbered land-ver y much more heavily timbered than any wheat land in the south, but not nearly so heavily timbered as the coastal hardwood forests of New South Wales, Victoria, or Queensland. Probably the number of trees per acre in the Territory is greater, but the trees are invariably smaller in diameter. let to a party of men who had previously worked f o i a short term on the farm, is at the rate of £ 5 15s. per acre, the work to be completed and the land left in perfect order for ploughing within eighteen weeks. This report of the Administrator contains a good deal of valuable information, but it all goes to demonstrate that we have committed the great folly, and the great sin, of seeking to develop the Northern Territory without, first of all, determining on a solid policy to be pursued. agree with the honourable member for Darwin that we shall never successf ully settle the Territory except by the process of gradual expansion back from our settled areas. The only sound policy to be pursued is that of extending the 3-ft. 6-in gauge railway north from Oodnadatta into the hilly country, in order , to give those areas favoured by a larger raiufall, and well adapted to the production of beef, a chance to produce what the land will produce there, and so that what is produced may be brought down to the markets of the south aC a reasonable cost.",33
179,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The proposed line from Pine Creek to Katherine River is not inconsistent with that policy.  is that we are building from north to south. We have already paid for the survey of a line from Pine Creek to Katherine River, but that line should not be persevered with, because it would be a wrong policy to build it. To begin with, it would be wrong from a defence point of view, because if there is any possibility of enemies coming into Australia they could make use of the railway to our - disadvantage. In my opinion, any railway extension should be from the south, northward, in order that, if the land is brought to profitable use, what may be produced can be brought into consumption among the population in the south. That is a sound policy, and I commend it to the Ministry. At any rate, I hope we have heard the last of the Pine Creek to Katherine River project for some time to come. Of course, eventually, when we have a population of 40,000,000 or 50,000,000, we should have a railway running across the continent from north to south, but in the meantime, from the defence point of view, and from the point of view that the proposed line is unnecessary, and is likely to be unprofitable, we would make a huge mistake in building it. It is a mistake that I hope will not The contract, be perpetrated by the present Government. Sitting behind the Ministry, I am desirous that they should have a fair trial, but I shall be grievously disappointed if the next Budget is not vastly different from the present one. I recognise that the figures in the present Budget are not of the present Treasurer's choosing. They are the outcome of a condition of things which developed when his predecessors were in office. Therefore, what I ever I have said in condemnation of these figures-and I do condemn them, because the expenditure is abnormally large for our population- I am not condemning the present Treasurer. At the same time. I do not wish to take up too antagonistic an attitude towards honourable members opposite. They have a belief that it is a good thing to develop on Socialistic lines. Our policy is altogether opposed to that. To develop the country on Socialistic lines it is necessary, first of all, to plank down oflicer after officer-highly-pai d men - and some of them now in the Northern Territory are there, not because of their qualifications, but because of their Socialistic predilections.",34
180,Mr ABTHUB,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is nasty.  it is true. What about Ryland? Can any one justify his position?,34

"" Mr ABTHUB - Why listen to these nasty whispers?  from the Treasurer whether in the draft Estimates there were not considerable additions proposed for these men who went up to the Northern Territory at a fixed salary, and for fixed terms of office.",34
182,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is so.  sures me that it is so. Men who put is a claim for increased salary, knowing the Territory is a hugh financial loss and a loadstone about the neck of the people of the Commonwealth, should be relegated to private life again because of their attempt to get to the other side of their agreement. I would like to ask the Treasurer whether these increases were recommended by the Administrator. Sir JOH N FOBBEST - Yes .  ment of the Treasurer that were recommended by the Administrator. If the Territory was a paying proposition, if these officers were doing good work in developing the country, if they had succeeded in inducing one single permanent settler to go to the Territory, there might be some justification for these increases, but "" failure "" is written over the whole project; the Northern Territory is a huge, lamentable",35

I shall be grievously disappointed if the next Budget does not show a different complexion, and if there is not a very great alteration in many things which, from a financial stand-point, can only be regarded as unsound.",35
184,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Darling) [2.58] - The honourable member need not have reminded us that there is a very big difference between Ministerialists and the Opposition in policy. We are Socialistic, as the honourable member says. We consider the interests of the community on the social side as being of the first consideration. Apparently the honourable member for Echuca stands for the in terests of individuals. He wants the Government to do something in the Northern Territory by means of contractors. Surely ifche honourable member must realise we would have to pay a pretty big price to induce a contractor to go there, and take a team of men with him. W h at sort of competition would there be in the Northern Territory, where there is so little work except what is being carried out under the Administrator? The honourable member must realise that, in the absence of competition, the contractor would have the Commonwealth at his mercy. I cannot understand the honourable member proposing to have things done in any other way than they have been done in the Northern Territory. We cannot settle the land without having it surveyed, and without having a staff. It is absurd to complain of the cost before we have had time to get the thing under way. The honourable member must remember that South Australia controlled the Northern Territory for forty years, and was getting further into debt, and ,yet no! .progress was made. When we launch out on a new enterprise we must they have a big outlay at the beginning before it comes to the point of paying a dividend. We all know, except, perhaps, the honourable member for Echuca, that, the Commonwealth is developing the Northern Territory for other reasons than profit. We seek to develop it , and to settle the place permanently, and to do that we have to go slowly. It is not to be said because a certain policy does not prove profitable at the outset that it is necessarily wrong. I recognise the general feeling of the Committee is in favour of the session being; brought to a speedy termination, and, therefore, I shall not speak at any length. We have been doing our utmost to induce the Government to go to the country before Christmas, but that now appears to> be hopeless, and honourable members are anxious, I think, to conclude the business of the session as soon as possible. The Government, perhaps, will make an appeal to the country next year. I hope that they will do so. My own view is that they are waiting anxiously to hear the result of the election in New South Wales tomorrow. I should like at this stage to call attention to certain remarks made by Mr Winston Churchill, who, in proposing the toast of the Commonwealth at a recent Western Australian dinner,, said Australia's development had been grand, but it was different from any other community in. the world. Sometimes, when he saw populations of millions trodden in the slush of great cities, or forgotten and famished on vast expanses of territory, he considered that Australia was wise in following collectivist rather than competitive ideals, and watching with care over the fortunes of the rearguard and the weaker portions of the army of labour and industry. T would commend these thoughts to the honourable member for Echuca. Mr. Winston Churchill is a keen observer, and is not the only eminent man who has spoken thus of some of the ideals of collectivists. The honourable member for Echuca, however, has been swallowing some of the misrepresentations that we hear from time to time in regard to Socialism, a word, by the way, which conveys different meanings to different minds. I started some time ago to examine the Budget carefully with the object of discovering whether there was any justification for the tremendous increase in expenditure proposed by the Government, but as there was no reasonable prospect .of an opportunity to deal with the question in a thorough manner, I did not push on with my investigations. being so, I do not propose today to criticise the Budget statement to any extent. It must be clear to those who have read the Treasurer's financial statement, however, that some of the bogies that were trotted out during the recent election campaign have been safely laid to rest by him. They were even strong enough to cast a shadow of reality. Every statement made by the Labour party, when before the electors, regarding the growth and development of the Commonwealth under its administration has been proved by the Treasurer himself to be true. The right honourable gentleman's figures prove up to the hilt every claim made by us. For years past it has been the custom of our opponents at election time to warn the people that if Labour were returned to power the country would be ruined. Experience both in the Commonwealth and State Parliaments has shown that such statements were wholly without warrant, for the country has never been more prosperous than it was under the Labour regime. The people have been told that there could be no confidence in Labour rule, and attempts have been made to show that the world's money market is affected by the kind of Government in power at any given time. If such a suggestion were true, then the present Government would stand condemned. When the first.Watson Government took office there was an immediate rise in the price of Consols, whereas, according to a cable message from London the day after the present Government took office, Consols «losed at 72£, or a fall of £ per cent. Mr Spence. since the previous day. The cable stated further that this quotation was the lowest on record since Consols were converted into their present form. It would be just as reasonable to say that the coming into office of the present Government had affected the price of British Consols as to utter some of the misrepresentations that have been made in regard to the effect which the coming into office of a Labour Government has on the prosperity of the country. The truth, perhaps, has been given by Mr Teece, one of the ablest financiers in Australia, who is connected with the Australian Mutual Provident Society. He said recentlyAustralia's credit in London is not interfered with because of the part played in politics by the Labour party. Policy doesn't count. The That whole business of money raising is done by brokers, and the Labour Government will get a loan as readily as a Liberal Government. Either party will have to pay the same. That is the sensible statement of a reasonable man, and why politicians should indulge in the wild talk which we sometimes hear in regard to matters of this kind is beyond my comprehension. It not was asserted, when the Federal land tax was brought in by the Labour Government, that it would ruin the country. When it was found that the prediction had not been verified, it was said that it had failed to achieve the chief object which we had in view-the breaking up of large estates. As to that point, here is a quotation from a report of a speech made by the Chairman of Directors of the Scottish Australian Provident Society, which should be of interest to honourable membersThe chairman of the Scottish Australian Investment Company in London stated that owing to the operation of the Federal land tax they would be obliged to sell their freehold properties in Australia, "" but he had no doubt that they would find other outlets for their capital, because Australia, with a ll its faults of Government, was a great country, with a future before it . "" Such a statement by the chairman of a Scottish investment company - and Scotchmen have the reputation of being particularly shrewd business men-shoul d be sufficient to lay to rest another bogy This investment society finds it necessary, because of the Federal land tax, to sell a portion of its freehold estates in Australia; but it proposes to re-invest its money here. It has absolute faith in the country. Statements have also been bandied about by our opponents as to the alarm which the coming into power of a Labour Government has occasioned in vestors. The Labour Government were alleged to be responsible for the tightening of the money market, but to show how ill-founded is such an allegation, let me quote the opinions expressed by Mr . French, manager of the Bank of New South Wales, and a man who is in the very forefront of bankers. He is a banker of vast experience, and his opinion, I dare say, would be taken as against that of any other financier in Australia. He has given the following reasons for the tightening of the money market(a) The large expansion of the advances made by the Australian banks during the previous twenty-one months, from ggi million on 31st March, 1910, to 121^ millon on December 31, 1911. (i) The ever increasing demands made for the financing of the wheat harvest. (c) That the farmers would not sell for ready money, but preferred to hold for a rise. (d) That bankers were throwing away the caution and restraint engendered by the crisis of 18Q3. (e) The purchase of properties for speculation. (/) The increasing imports, especially those caused by the people spending money on luxuries. The annual increase in the production of wealth during the administration of the Labour Government was double that for each of the previous nine years. increase of trade in two years was more than the increase for the previous nine years. The deposits in our banks of issue increased' nearly three times as much per annum, and their assets by six times as much. Savings banks' deposits increased two and a half times as much, and the marriage rate and birth rate by four times as much as before. We have reached a stage in the political life of when the opponents of the Labour party must reconsider their attitude towards They will have to look for new bogies. The Labour Administration in Australia instead of resulting in in j u r y to try, has been marked by unprecedented were prosperity. During the late election paign the Fisher Government charged with extravagance.",35
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Is there any chance of our dealing with the first item in the Estimates this afternoon?,37

Prime Minister's attention to the enorpartmental mously increased expenditure proposed by his Government. While, on the one hand, the Treasurer estimates that the revenue will f all short of last year's returns, he has enormously increased the expenditure of the Commonwealth as compared with that for 1912-13. The estimated revenue for the current year is £21,462,000, which, with the surplus of £2,653,223, gives a total revenue of £24,115,223. The total expenditure will exceed the revenue by £5,733,223.",37
187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,How ridiculous it is to put loan moneys against revenue.,37

189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Entirel y wrong. The Labour Government's Budget last year, if we include loan moneys, was a £25,000,000 one.",37
190,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member is wrong. The fact remains that the Government are proposing a vast in crease of expenditure, and have not explained how they justify it . They have not told us why they have not carried out the pledge given by the Prime Minister in his manifesto, in these words, "" We will give you honest, sound, and economic government."" They are giving it to us by The spending all the available surplus, and by issuing a loan for another £3,000,000 in addition. Where does the honest, sound, and economic government come in ? It may be honest, but the Committee ought to know what they are spending the money on, as it is very difficult to find out from the Budget-papers.",37

192,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"A good while ago, the us. Government tried to make out that the money was for commitments, but some very able speeches, notably that of one the counwho is unfortunately no more with us, made from this side to show that the campresent Government must be held responwere sible, because this is their Budget. It strikes me, from what has been let fall by Ministers, that the Government took the departmental heads' suggestions for expenditure-, one of which, at any rate, was the initialed as being. "" submitted for the I consideration"" of the previous GovernThat is a very different thing Every dehead naturally asks for as much money as he thinks is needed to make his department efficient; but all these suggestions have to be finally reviewed by the Cabinet, and certainly by the Treasurer. It looks to me as if the Government had simply taken suggestions, and put them all into the Budget, saying, "" These are the commitments of the Labour party."" so, they cannot shelter themselves hind that excuse. The only commitments which can be honestly pleaded are those which were admittedly made, such as those of the building of the Navy, and other defence works, about which there is a general consensus of opinion that we must not be too parsimonious. pears to me, however, that there is a serious increase in the general ture on the part of a Government claimed that they were going to make a change in the financial administration of the Commonwealth. If this increase is essential to the welfare of the Commonwealth, why do they not propose increased taxation to meet it? would be a fair way of doing it; but, instead of this, the Commonwealth to drift into the position of a seventh borrower for Australia. This is the first to start on that business. frequently hear quibbles about the Fisher Government having started the borrowing policy, simply from the fact that, in taking over the Northern Territory, had to take over the loans already incurred by South Australia. They cannot be charged with borrowing for that purpose, nor can they be honestly with borrowing in connection with the valuation of transferred Hitherto, the Commonwealth without borrowing a penny, and now the present Government, instead of following our policy of trying to meet our obligations out of revenue, or increasing the taxation if the revenue is not sufficient, are embarking upon a borrowing I believe that the people are quite willing to pay increased taxation if it is necessary. The Commonwealth has undertaken a large and costly scheme of defence, and I do not see why we should not come down on the richer man to meet the cost, as England does. We have avoided the imposition of direct taxation, the single exception of the land tax, which applies only to very big estates. want money in the centre of the Empire, they raise the income tax; but our wealthy Mr Sfenct. classes in Australia are going scot-free of responsibilities which they could well afford to bear. I do not think there has ever been a time when things have been so good for the capitalistic class. There these has been a tightening of money, especially in New South Wales. The banks will not advance on more than 50 per cent, of If that is valuations, and yet this has not stopped be- building operations in the least. Six million pounds were spent in one year on buildings, proving that, without borrowing money from the banks, there is plenty of wealth available, coming mainly, I believe, from the great wool trade. In this prosperity there is a great field for It ap- additional taxation, especially among the wealthier classes, whose property the expendi- masses would have to defend if we were that ever unfortunately involved in war. The Government have been threatening to make a very dangerous departure in enormous another' matter. How far they have done it , I do not know, because we do not seem able to get any That exact idea of what they are doing. I refer to the deliberate introis going duction, as a serious policy, of the contract system as against day labour. The Government Labour party never tried to do everyWe thing exclusively by day labour, but they adopted the day-labour system, as any good business manager would, wherever it meant a saving to the Commonwealth. they The present Government, judging by their public utterances, are going to adopt the contract system out-and-out, whether it suits or not. Some of their followers seem charged to have a fixed idea that the day-labour system is the most costly, but that is enproperties. tirely contradicted by the experience of has done Liberal Governments in the various States. I commend to them the actual experience of the Liberal Government in Queensland. The report of their Railway Commissioner has already been published, showing that many thousands of pounds were saved policy. through the Railway Department building its own lines. New South Wales has had a similar experience. A saving of £13,000 on the lowest tender submitted was shown in the case of the line just finished from Moree to Garah. The honourable member for Echuca looks surprised, but I would recommend him, and others with who worship the contract system fetish, to get hold of the report of the EngineerIf they in-Chief for Victoria, wherein the most convincing figures are given, to show how: it is possible for the Department to do Work for itself at an immense saving.  member deny that the lines done by conexpect tract were all through heavy, hilly try?",37
193,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have seen the official report, and the comparison that induced the Liberal Government in Victoria to adopt the day-labour system. That comextra parison was between lines in the same kind of country. It could not be a comficult parison unless the conditions were similar. They are most careful to compare lines similar country; and the report shows the work was done for £900 per mile cheaper under their system than under the contract system. Let honourable memmission, bers imagine what a saving of £900 mile would mean in the construction the transcontinental railway. I should like to know whether the present Governlet by contract. ment are going to do that work by conthe Forbes' tract? It will be a most serious matter if they are, as the work was started proper way by the iate Government. Conone sider how many miles of railway could be built out of a saving of £900 per In addition to the facts I have quoted, the Engineer-in-Chief for New South £400. Wales railways shows that earthworks cost 37 per cent, less under day than under contract, and on one of deviations on the mountains the ComAn missioners saved £10,000. They would never dream of doing work of that kind in New South Wales by contract. Ancase, other advantage in constructing a railway line under departmental control is that the work can be begun at least six months under the contract system. earlier than would be the case under the contract system, where every care to be taken in regard to specifications, that there may be no charge for extras. New South Wales had one experience cured them of the contracting habit, where they had to pay £127,000 odd on six lines for extras, and to settle law cases. Since that happened, they have been constructGovernment, ing their lines for themselves at an mensely cheaper rate than they ever paid for similar work under the contract system. Some of it in good and level country is costing them only £1,800 mile. Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria-al l of them under Liberal Governments-woul d not dream of letting - ontracts for railway construction; and this House certainly ought to know, the it passes the Estimates, what the Government are going to do in this matter. No one objects to their letting contracts for the construction of buildings. We do not them to have the whole of their counwork done by day labour, but we do object to their adopting the contract system for big works like railways. It looks as though they have put a few millions extra into the Budget to meet the cost that"" will be incurred by doing large public works by contract. The difwork of tunnelling the streets of Sydney for the Postal Department was in done by day labour at a saving of that £40,000. I know the late Sir William Lyne was opposed to day labour, but when that matter was investigated by a Comof which he was chairman, the per evidence converted him. No one could of know how much would have to be paid for extras if work of that nature were In the case of drainage system, the lowest tender was £1,693, and the work in the cost only £1,380 by day labour. For section of the Long Cove storm-water channel, the contractor asked 50s. per mile. foot; the work was done by day labour at 45s. per foot, showing a saving of For another section, the contractor asked £5 per foot, and the labour work was done for £ 3 5s. per the foot, showing a saving of £1,200. earthworks cutting, for which the contract price was ls. 6d., was done by day labour for 8d. a yard. There was, in one a saving in concrete of from 10s. to 15s. per yard, and, of course, the work was done more honestly than it is ever done The day labour systemguarantees efficiency; the has contract system means inefficiency and so increased cost. It has been said during the electoral campaign now proceeding in that New South Wales that the North Coast Railway has cost more than it was estimated to cost, but the explanation is that prior to the advent of the Labour there was an alteration of imthe specifications. The line that has been made is a much better one than the line that was originally intended to be made, having heavier rails, lower grades, per and wider curves. Similar explanations could be found in many other cases if the trouble were taken to look for them. I could quote many other examples, in Australia and from the practice of municibefore pal councils elsewhere, to show the advantages of the day-labour We are not justified, because the party in power has ceitain ideals, in allowing the taxpayers' money to be spent to boost up certain individuals. In the old days it often happened that the man who got a railway contract thereby made his fortune. Those days have gone by. days public expenditure is more closely watched, and we ought to adopt whatever methods common-sense dictates as being best in the public interest. not be carried away by an idea. those who are interested in the subject to read the report of the Victorian in regard to the abolition of the contract system. Where a contractor has not permanent work, and does not own a large plant, he adds to his price the cost of his plant. Then, again, if he has not a large working capital, and must pay interest on borrowed money, he adds the interest to his price. Of course, where contractors are continually engaged in the erection of buildings, and have permanent staffs and plant, the prices are much more reasonable, and supervision better. But now that the Commonwealth is entering on railway construction on a big scale, it can afford to secure plant and to organize a staff, and the staff will work better when it has been a little time in existence. We shall be very foolish to have our work done by contract wheu we can do it more quickly and more cheaply ourselves. It has amused me to hear one or two members, who seem to have never done' any work:, criticise the labour of men whom they have watched for ten minutes or so, and whom they accuse of loafing, perhaps because one of them had a pipe in his mouth. I have had good opportunities of knowing what is in the mind of many working men, having been largely trusted for many years in connection with big organizations, and I have known a man who would not assert that he had to work harder for the Government than for a private contractor. it is impossible to judge of what, a man is doing unless his work is measured, and regard is had to the time lie has been employed. To make compnrisons of this kind, experts are needed. A mere on-looker cannot form any reliable opinion. The Labour party the doing of as many things as possible under Government control. We have established Government dockyards, clothing, and ammunition factories, and the present Government has departed Mr Spence. system. from its great and sacred principles sufficiently to recognise that these institutions must be supported by it . We say that they do not cover the whole field of Government activity. To call these enterprises Socialistic means nothing, because a Socialistic enterprise is only an enterprise Nowa- undertaken for the social welfare. In today's A.rgus, the Sydney correspondent of the newspaper quotes from the report of We should the Auditor-General upon the operations I ask of the State brickworks, quarries, timber-yard, and other enterprises. engineer What the Auditor-General's report shows, and the point I wish to make, is that these enterprises are not entered upon for profit, but for saving. The State brickworks, which have only recently been established, have shown a total saving of £6,678; in the case of the bluemetal quarries, which supply the Government and municipalities, there has been a saving to the former of £4,600, and to the latter of £2,000, while the net profit earned is £4,322, or a total benefit of is £10,832; the State joinery works, in a period of thirteen months, show a net profit of £ 2 , 0 7 5 . The total benefit from three enterprises, with the odd figures, is £19,685 18s. 7d.",39
194,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"What do the Government charge per 1,000 for bricks?",40
195,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Government charge 10s. per 1,000 less than do the Brick Combine.",40
196,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is not so; the Government are charging £3 per 1,000.",40
197,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I know what I am talking about. In the case of a building in which I am interested, the Brick Combine thought they had us under their never thumb, and failed to carry out the contract, but we were able to get bricks from the State brickworks at 10s. But per 1,000'less, taking 20,000 per day. These questions ought to be discussed carefully quite free from party bias, in order that we may discover which is the best method of procedure. We do not hear any grumbling because the railways and the favours Post Office, and many works connected with defence are carried on by the Government. The Railway Department and of New South Wales, under the Liberal Government, stopped the manufacture of trucks in order to square accounts, and the result is that the Commissioners are not able to take from the State brickworks all the bricks needed on the railways. What they have taken, however, haa resulted in the saving I have in dicated. Of course, no Government is justified in fooling with the people's money in order to carry out some fads of their own; but the State Labour Government are working on sound business lines, such as are adopted by large business firms, who have their work done under their own supervision. The Prime Minister, in his manifesto, informed the country that his Government were going to secure industrial peace, or words to that effect; but it would appear that there are still some industrial troubles. notice that the Liberal party and Government have deservedly given public thanks for, and expressions of appreciation of, the work done by the Women's National League, notably in Victoria ; and, in this connection, I think I may turn the tables on the Government, and accuse them, as they have often accused us, of being governed by outside bodies. The stateother. ment is equally true in either case; but I should like to draw attention to the words of one or two of the ladies at the recent conference of the league at Ballarat. One lady said that the man or woman who originated a strike should be either fined or imprisoned, and that picketing should be made an offence against the law, while strike committees sliould be dealt with "" l i k e any other robbers."" I wonder if that is the idea of the Government? It means the prohibition of strikes, and yet, no doubt, this same lady has, during h<=r life, refused au offer of marriage. A strike is only a refusal to accept conditions offered, so that we have strikes every day in buying and selling, and other business. Another lady, Mrs Moss, suggested that strikers should be penalized by taking away their franchise for a stated period of time. That, of course, would be an excellent idoa for the Government, for they would only have to foment a strike on a large scale, and then hold a general election.",40
198,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Government also tur n a member out of the House when they wish to.,41
199,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Apparentl y the seed of this kind of thing is sown in Ballarat. The Prime Minister told the country that he and his Government stood for "" indust r i a l peace and the reconciliation of all classes."" The ladies outside do not stand for that ; and there are troubles both existent and threatening. I want the Prime Minister to live up to his promises in his manifesto. These people who we are told promote strikes are the only people trying to prevent the very serious consequences arising out of the New Zealand trouble. Of course, they do not get any credit for that kind of thing. They have had conferences, and have thrown in the weight of very big unions to prevent the spread of the trouble, yet they are denounced because they are unable to control certain wild spirits, very many of whom are not Labour supporters. If I they vote anything at all they vote for Liberal candidates; they are what we term the ""red-raggers""; they are men we have to fight against. Yet we have to bear the brunt of their action. Another matter is the attitude ""of the Liberal party generally towards rural workers, and the trouble that is now likely to spread from one State to anThe rural workers, before their amalgamation with the Australian Workers Union, tried hard to get a conference with the farmers, but their requests were refused. Then the presiding Justice in the Federal Arbitratio n Court tried to conciliate, but the officials of the Farmers and Settlers Association declined, saying that no trouble had arisen. Afterwards, when they were cited to the Federal Arbitration Court, the door was shut, because there was no time for the hearing of the case. Afterwards they amalgamated with the Australian Workers Union, and we tried to bring about a conference with the Farmers and Settlers Associations in the different States, so that we might meet in a friendly way, and talk the matter over, and thus avoid trouble. References have been made to agitators, as if the agitator were a person to be condemned, but coming from Sydney last Monday night I discovered quite a number of agitators on the train. They turned out to be Federal members who had been over tn New South Wales to help their political friends. There has never been a bigger agitator than the Prime Minister. However, the progress of the world is due to agitators. The representatives of the Farmers and Settlers Association declined to come to any settlement, so that if any trouble arises it is of their own seeking. It is a fact that the log has been raised, but it bad to be raised, owing to the fact that farmers were voluntarily paying more than was originally claimed. There is ample room for settlement between the two parties if they would come together. Why should the Liberal party block the door to settling this question? In New South Wales the Liberals in the Upper House threw out the proposal to have a Wages Board for rural workers, and Mr Wade and his party opposed it in the Legislative Assembly; in Victoria the Liberals have refused to have a Wages Board for rural workers; the present Commonwealth Government have in their programme a measure to shut the rural workers out of the Federal A r b i tration Court; and yet there is complaint about industrial trouble. Liberals are forcing these men into the old method of the strike, instead of carrying out what the Prime Minister says in his manifesto-securin g industrial peace. I ask the Prime Minister to reconsider this matter. H is attitude wards the rural workers is a departure from the settled policy of Australia-to have Courts to settle industrial disputes.",41
200,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"What is the difference between the wages paid in New South Wales, and those asked for?",42
201,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"A Judge of the High Court adjusted the wages of shed hands, reckoned as unskilled labour, at 37s. 6d. a week with rations, and a guarantee of full work, no time being deducted for wet weather. Y e t I know of a case of a married man working on the Great Western vineyard for 25s. a week, and having to keep himself. Even a quarter of a day was stopped from his wages in wet weather. He was asked when the ploughman was sick to do the ploughing for 25s. a week, but he would not do so. He was eventually given 5s. a day to do the ploughing, which he did for three days.",42
202,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,You pulled the men at Wagga on a difference of 4d. a day.,42
203,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am merely quoting eases of low wages, and it is quite fair to point out where men are being paid such miserable sums. I admit that it is only the minority who pay these wages. No one would charge the farming class with being unreasonable, but it is quite fair to have the wages fixed at a reasonable rate, and have a tribunal to settle differences between the men and .their employers. Quite recently, in conversation with a clergyman who was bemoaning, as many unthinking people do, the feeling between employers and employees, I said that a b it of feeling and opposition was a good thing. I pointed out that there had been complaints as to the friendly terms existing between the contractors and workmen in Chicago and San Francisco, by which the unionists got top wages, and the contractor passed it on to the public. There is no competition there among the bosses, and they so fleece the public that the man who wants a house built is taken down.",42
204,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is absurd.,42
205,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It is a fact, and I say that one of the advantages of our posiThe tion is due to the fact that there is a feeling between the two classes, and we have set up a Court to settle it . An y departure from that system is going to force on trouble.",42
206,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"We musthave at r i tobunal that has the confidence of both sides, and not of one side only.",42
207,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member is fighting tooth and nail to prevent any tribunal dealing with this matter. If all the unionists came together in one bi g powerful body they would be as much a combine as any combine now existing. We are pledged to support the principle of conciliation and arbitration for the benefit of all classes of the community, but honourable members opposite would not extend that principle to a section of the community that cannot help itself. I could quote figures as to the low wages paid in the dairying industry which would astonish honourable members. Those low rates are not generally paid, but in the interests of fair and reasonable employers the industry should be regulated just as other industries are. Why should one particular class be exempt? The Liberal party are forcing on trouble. I had intended to refer to some other matout ters connected with the Budget, and the growth of expenditure, but at this late hour shall not do so. The Government have failed to give us any explanation of .their proposed increase of 'expenditure, nor have they told us what they intend to do in regard to the development of the Northern Territory, and other matters of importance. Apparently they propose, as soon as possible, to sneak into recess, where they will be able to do as they please. Progress reported. NA POWELLISED TIMBER.

The report is as follows : The stock sheets referred to are not connected - with anv audit report. They are lists of stores in stock as counted by ordnance employees at ithe ordnance dep6ts in South Melbourne last December for the purpose of checking stock with the books at the ordnance stores in St. Kilda-road. When asked for in Parliament some checking had been done, but recounts of articles shown as deficient or surplus have vet to be completed. Pending the return of these sheets to the Department, this work of checking cannot be proceeded with. After these stores have been further checked it is not anticipated that any serious deficiencies will be disclosed. The final result will be dealt with by the Audit Department officials in the usual way. Certain audit reports on other matters are at present being dealt with by the ordnance staff, but there is nothing in them which calls for special reference at this juncture.",43

215,Mr THOMAS,SELECT COMMITTEE ON,"Barrier) [4.9] - A day or two ago I put a question in the House as to certain moneys which had been paid into the funds of the Liberal organization in Queensland. In reply, I was informed that a statement of the money so received had been sent into the Department, and that such returns were available for public inspection upon payment of the prescribed fee of ls. in respect of each return. I sent some one down to the Home Affairs Office, but the Chief Electoral Oflicer said he was not empowered to take the shilling, and that any one who wanted to see the Queensland return would have to go to Queensland, because it was kept there. This is the Federal Parliament, and the Central Electoral Office is in Melbourne, and, surely, at least copies of the returns for each of the States should be kept here, even if the originals have to be sent back to the States. . Mr FENTO N (Maribyrnong) [4.11]. - I asked the Honorary Minister a question this morning in reference to the Prahran Post-office, and it seemed to me that his reply might have been a little more courteous, seeing that a paragraph has appeared in one of the papers to the effect that an offer had been made to dispose of the Prahran Post-office to the Prahran City Council for £9,000. I wanted the correspondence between the Government and the Council to be laid on the table of the Library, and I understood the Honorary Minister to say that as certain negotiations were proceeding he did not think it wise to accede to my request. I should like to know if the Government have any intention of disposing of that very valuable property, situated in one of the finest business streets south of the line, for so low a sum as £9,000. It has been variously estimated that the property is worth from £15,000 to £20,000, and we still have 960 years of a lease to run. In the circumstances, it would be foolish to sell the property for so little, even for the benefit of the Prahran City Council or the Prahran ratepayers. Several hundred pounds was spent by the late Government on the building to bring it up to date for postal and banking purposes, and I understand that it now meets all requirements. I believe the Prahran Council wanted to get it for £5,000, and that a previous Minister said he would consider an offer of £10,000, but the Home Affairs Department stepped in, and placed the building in an up-to-date condition. I am not raising this question in a captious or critical spirit, but we should certainly know what is being done in this matter.",43

The matter was recently revived, but the Home Affairs Department has not made an offer to accept £9,000 for the building. I did write to the Postmaster General's Department informing them that other premises in not quite so central a position, but possibly better suited for postal business, could be found for about £9,000.

220,Mr MATHEWS,SELECT COMMITTEE ON,"Melbourne Ports) [4.19] - I was quite well aware that it is not the Auditor's report that is on the table of the Library, but the stock-sheets of the stock-taking which took place last December in connection with the Queen'sbridge Ordnance Stores. It seems most peculiar, however, as the Prime Minister must admit, that it is only at this stagetwelve months afterwards-that the Department are checking to see if the deficiency really does exist. During the whole of those twelve months they must have been receiving and sending out goods, and, therefore, before they can ascertain what the deficiency really was in December last, it will be necessary for them to go over the whole of the stock that they have received and issued since. They could not take stock without doing it. However, I am willing to let the matter rest until it has been investigated by those who supervise the Department. But some one has been very remiss in waiting twelve months before thinking of checking the stock-sheets.",44
