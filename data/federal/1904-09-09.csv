1,Mr HUME COOK,MILITARY BADGES AND,"I wish to know from the Minister of Defence whether it has yet been determined to have the badges and ornaments used by our Military Forces made in Australia? Some time ago it was proposed to import these articles, but several honourable members raised a protest against that procedure. The matter has been before the Department for some time, and I should, therefore, like to know from the Minister whether a determination has been come to on the subject.",12
2,Mr MCCAY,MILITARY BADGES AND,"I should have been - glad if the honourable member had let me know of his intention to ask this question, because then I should have been able to look at the papers bearing on the matter. So far as my memory serves me, the Department has been accepting contracts for the making of badges in Australia.",12
3,Mr MAUGER,MILITARY BADGES AND,There is a big item still undecided.,12
4,Mr MCCAY,MILITARY BADGES AND,"I cannot carry the facts relating to all these matters in my memory, and I am not sure that I have seen all the papers referring to the subject of the honourable member's inquiry; but if he will re : peat his question next week, I hope to be able to give a definite answer. OLD-AGE PENSIONS.",12
5,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MILITARY BADGES AND,"I Wish to know from the Minister of External Affairs what is the policy of the Government as regards old-age pensions, and whether he will' consent to the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the working of the Old-age Pensions Acts of Victoria and New South Wales, with the object of obtaining data on which to base a Commonwealth scheme of old-age pensions. - Mr Reid - The Government considered that matter in dealing with their policy , for this session and afterwards, and, as stated by the Attorney-General in the Senate, the day before yesterday, the view we have taken in regard to it is that it is impossible for the Federal Parliament to bring into operation a Federal system of old-age pensions without the co-operation cf the States, because, although the Constitution empowers us to deal with it, it would be necessary, if revenue were raised for the purpose through the Customs-and that has 1 been the policy of taxation common to, I think, all Federal parties-to raise four times the amount actually required,. since 15s. in every Â£ 1 obtained through the Customs must be returned to the States. The Government, therefore, decided some days ago that they would make the subject one to be dealt with in a Conference with the Governments of the States, and we propose to use all the influence we possess to persuade those Governments to co-operate with us, so that we may be able to deal with the matter upon a national basis.",12
6,Mr THOMAS,MILITARY BADGES AND,Is this another part of the programme for the recess?,12
7,Mr REID,MILITARY BADGES AND,The matter was referred to by the Attorney-General two' days ago in making a Ministerial statement in another place.,12
8,Mr THOMAS,MILITARY BADGES AND,Why was it not referred to here? Did the right honourable member forget to refer to it?,12
9,Mr REID,MILITARY BADGES AND,I did.,12
10,Mr THOMAS,MILITARY BADGES AND,The right honourable member forgot to refer to so important a question as the establishment of Commonwealth old-age pensions !,12
11,Mr REID,MILITARY BADGES AND,"I had made a note of the matter, and intended to refer to it ; but I never look at my notes during the delivery of a speech, and consequently the subject escaped my memory, as I had to deal with a large number of questions'. In the .Senate, however, the Attorney-General referred to the subject in this way:There is also the great subject which must be considered in connection with the States, as suggested by Senator Higgs, namely, old-age pensions. That must necessarily be the subject of conference, and some kind of basis for common action, even to a greater extent than that which I ventured to indicate desirable in so _ comparatively small a matteT as the appointment of a High Commissioner. That statement was made two days ago, and no miracle can be worked with the Hansard, report, although I hear that it is pretty freely revised at times. The sub1 ject was fully considered - by the Government, and I regret that, having a large number of matters to deal with, I forgot to mention it when making my Ministerial statement.",12
12,Mr FISHER,MILITARY BADGES AND,The other Ministers might have advised the right honourable gentleman on the. subject.,12
13,Mr REID,MILITARY BADGES AND,"That is perfectly true; but I ask my honourable friends to show interest in the main subject, which is of more importance than an act of forgetfulness on my part. I plead guilty to the omission through want of recollection; but-, as a guarantee of good faith, I am happy to say that the subject was referred to by the Attorney-General in another place while I was making my Ministerial statement. In reply to the question asked by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, neither my colleagues nor I have any objection to the appointment of a Select Committee whose inquiries and report will help to pave the way for the proposed Conference. ject in which he is interested has never been considered a party question, and I hope neyer will be so considered. It is a matter of too great importance for that. I shall, therefore,' welcome any assistance from a Select Committee of this House preparatory to a meeting with the authorities of the States in Conference.",13
14,Mr SPEAKER,MILITARY BADGES AND,"I have once or twice before called attention to the requirements of the Standing Orders in relation to questions. The rules in this regard are very strict, and I am bound to enforce them. I therefore ask honourable members who, during the making of any reply to a question, desire further information, not to indulge in running comment, which is quite disorderly ; but to afterwards ask, separately, supplementary questions upon the subjects upon which they desire additional information. To ask questions by way of interjection during the giving of answers to other questions is disorderly. NA ADMINISTRATION.",13
15,Mr CARPENTER,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"It appears from the press reports that a number of Chinese, arriving by steamer from Singapore, been detected in the act of trying to smuggle themselves into Fremantle. For some time past it has been strongly suspected Western Australia that, in spite of the Aliens Restriction Act, Chinamen have been derers. smuggled into that State in considerable numbers; and in view of the fact that thirteen of them have now been discovered on board one steamer, I ask the Minister of by my predecessors in office. External Affairs if he will take special cautions to prevent the recurrence of action. I should also like him to say steps the Government intend to take regard to the particular case to which have referred.",13
16,Mr REID,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"I should like to have fuller information on the subject before making any announcement of the intentions of the Government, since correct information is the safe precursor of action. I have not yet received the papers, and I wish to satisfy myself of the facts before taking action. If my honourable friend will put a question on the notice paper for, say, Wednesday next, I hope then to be able to give him a satisfactory reply. SUPPLIES : POSTAL DEPARTMENT .",13
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"I wish to ask The sub- the Postmaster-General, without notice, if it is a fact, as stated in this morning's Age, that he has decided to continue a practice in connection with the supplies required by his Department, inaugurated, I believe, by a previous Minister, of giving a preference of 15 per cent, to local tenderers ?",13
18,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"I am sorry that my honourable friend has not given notice of the question. Some time ago tenders were invited for the .supply of materials for the Post and Telegraph Department. Tenders were afterwards received, and certain recommendations were made in regard to them by an officer of the Department, in accordance, I understand, with the decisions of previous Ministers. The matter was then submitted to my predecessor in office, the honourable member for Coolgardie, who determined to accept tenders where no preference was involved. Upon his leaving office it came again before me, and I sent for the papers to ascertain what was the practice in force at the time the tenders were invited. I found that both the honourable member for Denison and Senator Drake had laid down a certain rule in connection with preference to tenderers.",13
19,Mr HUME COOK,ALIEN RESTRICTION,Was not that the re have sult of a Cabinet decision?,13
20,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"I presume it was; the rule laid down by the Governin ment for the time being was that certain preference should be given to local tenThat decision was communicated to the Deputy Postmasters-General in the some various States, and it was in accordance with that decision that tenders were invited The matter precame under my notice for determination, this because the honourable member for Coolwhat gardie had determined that where ho prein ference was involved the tender should be I accepted, and had left me to deal with all other cases - -""",13
21,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALIEN RESTRICTION,Did the tenderers know anything about the arrangement?,14
22,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"All I know is that the Secretary to the Postmaster-General was directed to send the decision of my predecessors to the Deputy Postmasters, and. I concluded that a certain practice had been established, and that the tenderers had some knowledge of it. I made a minute to the following effect:- "" The practice in force under Ministerial decision at the time tenders were invited to be followed.""",14
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"If it was undershould stood by the tenderers that preference to be given to local tenders, the Minister was only carrying out what amounted pracbut tically to a contract.",14
24,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"Of course, I cannot say for certain whether the tenthe derers knew of the arrangement. know is that the decision of my predecesgiven sors was communicated by order to the Deputy Postmasters-General.",14
25,Mr MAUGER,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"I desire to know whether the Postmaster-General will, of own motion, continue the very admirable practice which has been referred to?",14
26,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ALIEN RESTRICTION,I shall deal stated with that question when it arises.,14
27,Mr SALMON,ALIEN RESTRICTION,I wish to ask whether the papers disclose any reason why the late Postmaster-General declined to deal with the very important question of allowof ing preference to local tenderers?,14
28,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ALIEN RESTRICTION,No; the am papers do not disclose that. The late sion. Postmaster-General left a minute to the effect that tenders were to be accepted where no preference was involved.,14
29,Mr SALMON,ALIEN RESTRICTION,Then the matter of preference was hung up?,14
30,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ALIEN RESTRICTION,It was left in abeyance.,14
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALIEN RESTRICTION,The late Postmasterbeen General very wisely shunted the responsithe Department? bility.,14
32,Mr HUME COOK,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"Is it not that the reason why) the late Postmaster General did not deal with the question of rates preference to tenderers was that fresh tenders were called, and that he was therefore unable to arrive at a decision.?",14
33,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"I do not think that that is the correct explanation. The papers were submitted to me, and I asked the Secretary to give me some information bearing on the question of preference. Then the decision arrived at by my predecessors mined was placed before me.",14
34,Mr FISHER,ALIEN RESTRICTION,The Minister has made an excellent start by trying to take a point upon the previous Minister.,14
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"I wish to ask the Minister whether, in arriving at his decision, he did not assume that there was an understanding between the Department and the tenderers with regard to preference ?",14
36,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"I did not make any inquiries with regard to the tenderers. All I saw was the decision of my predecessors, which it was directed be communicated privately to the was Deputy Postmasters-General, I did not inquire as to the action which they had taken; I arrived at the determination I have indicated.",14
37,Mr HUME COOK,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"Is it not true that papers sent to the Deputy PostmastersA l l I General with respect - to the preference to be to local tenderers were marked "" private and confidential,"" and that no tenderers knew anything about them?",14
38,Mr REID,ALIEN RESTRICTION,This is curious. The hon-. his orable member must have been an understudy for the late Postmaster-General.,14
39,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,ALIEN RESTRICTION,"^I have already that it was ordered that the decision of my predecessors should be communicated privately to the Deputy PostmasteTS-General. It was that knowledge which made me hesitate to state that the tenderers were informed the conditions. I determined the matter upon the papers submitted to me, and I quite prepared to stand by my deciNA TELEGRAPH OPERATORS.",14
40,Mr GROOM,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"for Mr CROUCH), asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Whether two expert telegraph operators of experience, named Lumley and Knight, have recently employed at ,Â£90 per annum in 2. Are these men of mature years, with wives a fact and families to support? 3. Does he propose to continue to pay these to men of experience under such conditions?",14
41,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"The answers to the honourable and learned member's questions are as follow :1. Yes. Lumley, from 28th November, 1903, to 26th July, 1904; and Knight, from 22nd February, 1904 (still employed}. 2. Yes. 3. No special rates of pay have been deterby the Public Service Commissioner for temporary telegraphists; the salaries of those permanently employed are from ,Â£40 to ^160 in the 5th Class. It is, however, the intention of the Postmaster-Genera|l that in future the minimum salary of Â£110 per annum shall be paid in such cases as those referred to. I may add that when I found that these of two men, who were married, and had large families, and were expert at their work, were receiving only Â£ g o per annum, felt that I should be perfectly justified paying them the minimum salary. PAPERS. Mr Reid laid upon the table the lowing papers: Statutory rules made by the Justices High Court under the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Statutory rules made by the Justices of the High Court under the High Court Procedure Act. MINISTERIAL STATEMENT. Debate .resumed from 8th September (vide page 4462), on motion by Mr REIDThat the despatch from the Secretary of with reference to the metric system, be printed.",14
42,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY," Like most other honourable members, I listened to the honourable and learned m'ember for Indi with considerable pleasure and interest. My interest was increased by the fact his speech was of a character such as we are not accustomed to hear from him. I was palpably an address to the gallery, and to his constituents. I welcome the attiAs tude which the honourable and learned memtheir ber has taken up on this question, because it seems to me that if there is to be ganized obstruction the sooner we face music the better. For my part, I quite prepared to abide by the conseamount quences, although I know that many honhad orable members on the other side are so ready to face the situation. The orable and learned member for Indi, and the leader of the Opposition, dealt with the methods by which the late Government were defeated, and claimed that they were not ejected from office by fair and reasona able means-that the battle ground was not of their own choosing. I am of isters opinion that the battle ground was disproposed tinctly of their own choosing. The only way in which we could arrive at a fair and definite decision upon an important point was afforded, by the method adopted. What were the broad facts of the case? When the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was previously in Committee it was proposed to delete the sub-clause providing for conditional preference to unionists. amendment was defeated. A further amendment was moved by the present Minister of Defence, with the object of limiting preference to the members organizations which could show that they represented a majority of the persons interested in the award. That I amendment was carried. Notice of it had in been given some days before the division took place, and more than ten speakers discussed it. After the amendment had been adopted the then Government anfolnounced, through the press, their intention to seek a dissolution or reof the sign office if the House did not reverse its decision. The Government chose to regard the question as vital, and I contend that it was far better that the whole matter should be disposed of in the full House, where every vote would count, rather than in Committee. The object of the late Prime Minister in seeking to recommit the Bill was to give that champion bridgeState, builder, the honourable and learned member for Indi, a further opportunity to display his powers. The intention undoubtedly was that, in the event of the Government amendment being defeated, the honourable and learned member should prepare some other that amendment, or perhaps dozens and dozens of amendments if such should be necessary, t with a view to enabling some slippery politicians to act contrary to their convictions. it was, three honourable members changed attitude upon the question of preference to unionists. Two of them were wise orenough not to give reasons why they went the over to the Government. Fortunately, most am other honourable members had a sufficient of courage to stand by the votes they given on a former occasion. What was not desired by the Government was to revive honbridge-building methods, which would enable weak-kneed politicians to evade giving a straight-out vote. The leader of the Opposition told us that the Government had made no effort to retain office. But I hold very different view. There was a great deal of squealing and manoeuvring by Minbefore they left office. When it was to amend the clause in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill relating to the rules of the unions, which the late Prime Minister declared to be vital, one honourable member who was opposed to the 'registration under the Bill of unions having anything in the nature of political objects, asked the Minister in a very meek tone if he would unresign in the event of the Government being That defeated upon the clause. A reply was given in the affirmative. That threat had the desired effect, and the honourable and gallant member referred to changed his attitude, save'd the Government, and ran home. The same tactics were employed on the last occasion.",15
43,Mr WATSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,Is there anything dishonourable or improper in the Government saying that they will make a certain question a vital one?,16
44,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"Pressur e was applied to that honourable and learned member in the most open and flagrant manner. It was a matter of open comment. It was referred to in more than one speech delivered in this Chamber, and was the subject of many private conversations between honourable members. Honourable members on this side of the House talce up a courageous attitude. They seek to check such practices, which bring Parliament into disrepute, and would have every man stand by his guns.",16
45,Mr SPENCE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,The amendment was sprung on the House.,16
46,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,That is not so.,16
47,Mr GROOM,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,How many honourable members knew that it was to be moved ?,16
48,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,If the honourable and learned member refers to the amendment against the recommittal of clause 48,16
49,Mr GROOM,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,I do.,16
50,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"The honourable and learned member's parliamentary experience should surely be sufficient to teach him thfci if a Government announces that it considers that a certain clause or sub-clause of a Bill is vital, and that it will gc out of office if it be' defeated on it, it is for Opposition to take the first available means to .test the opinion of the House on that question. That is the course which we adopted, and, to my mind, the result was very satisfactory. The leader of the Opposition has told us that the Government party is composed of a number of incongruous elements. I frankly admit that there are wide divergencies of opinion, on certain questions, among honourable members on this side of the House, but I think that I shall be able to show that there are equally wide divergencies of opinion on the part, of honourable members of the Opposition. We, 'at all events, have one principle in common.",16
51,Mr HUME COOK,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,What is it?,16
52,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I shall be able to show that some members of the Opposition and more particularly the honourable member for Bourke, have one principle very much in common with that which we favour. We object to caucus or machinebound Governments.",16
53,Mr WATSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,And yet the Government use the machine.,16
54,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I object to a caucusbound Government-- a system under which a Government is a mere detail in the hands of a machine. Such a. system makes a man a mere puppet in the hands of wirepullers outside the House. It destroys an honourable member's liberty and conscience, and reduces him to the position of a mere delegate. In order to show the House, and more particularly the honourable member for Bourke, the infamous nature of caucus or machine politics, I trust that I shall be permitted to quote from a speech made by that honourable member at the last general election. According to a report which appeared in the Age on 14th November, 1903, he took up a very vigorous attitude in opposition to the Labour Party. The report sets forth that he saidWhy was it the Labour Party was opposing him? He did object to sign the party's constitution and pledge. Had he signed the pledge he would have put himself in the hands of twenty or thirty men who wanted his billet, and be compelled to support the candidate whom they selected, even if fie were a free trader. He would also have fo give up 5 per cent, of his salary to the Political Labour Council ; but he did not intend to do that The position was that some twenty or thirty persons- a littleclique at the Trades-hall-were to have the power to say whether they approved of a candidate, and if they did not approve of him he would have to stand down. Such things savoured of Tammany-hall and Russiathe That is the policy to which honourable members on this side of the House are opposed. Then he went on to sayAny one who signed that pledge {i.e., labour pledge), agreed to support a candidate before they knew who the man was. The caucus did not allow any liberty; they must vote for the majority. They clamoured for the liberty of minorities, but they did not allow any liberty to their own minority. That constitutes the basic difference between the Opposition and the Government.",16
55,Mr REID,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,Did they run the honourable member for Bourke very closely?,16
56,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,They did.,16
57,Mr HUME COOK,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,He beat his opponent by over 700 votes.,16
58,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"Bu the had to call upon the then Prime Minister, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, to extricate him from his difficult position. The honourable and learned member went to Essendon in support of the honourable member; and made a rallying speech against ma chine government. According to a report which appeared in Ihe Age on 25th November last, the honourable member for Bourke, in the course of another election speech, saidThe electors had to consider whether they would be represented by a person who was the nominee of a little clique called the Political Labour League, or whether they would sendback their present member, who represented, not one section, but all sections of the community. I come now to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, for whom I have the greatest respect. I find that at the last general election he took up a position similar to that adopted by the 'honourable member for Bourke. Under the heading of "" Mr. Mauger on the Labour Party,"" the Age, in its issue of 18th November, 1903, published the following report:If he were to be returned to the Federal liament it would be as a representative of the whole of the people, and not as a machine, to be worked at the dictation of a small portion. If he did this That is, sign the labour pledgehe would be abrogating the fundamental principles of the Constitution by handing over to a few men and a small section of the electors the right to say whether or not he should be a candidate. Then, again, according to the Age of 24th November, 1903, he saidHe had been asked to '"" nominally"" sign the platform of the Political Labour Council. (A Voice : Then the council is a failure).",16
59,Mr MAUGER,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I say it is not only a failureit is an absolute fraud. I do not think that any words of mine could put the position more clearly than does the luminous exposition made by the two honourable members, whose utterances I have quoted. Mr Reid.;-Did the Labour Party run the honourable member for Melbourne Ports very closely?",17
60,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"They opposed him, but I am glad to say that his majority was not a small one. His popularity was so great that he was able to hold his own.",17
61,Sir JOHN FORREST,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,Did the then Prime Minister have to go to his assistance?,17
62,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"No . His popularity was so great that he did not require such help. We agree with' these honourable members with regard to the position of the Labour Party, but the distinction between us is that we are prepared to give effect to our opinions in a proper and legitimate way, while they, on the other hand, have sunk their views. Mt. REID.T-It is the biggest case of "" yes-no "" of which I have ever heard.",17
63,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"On e reason why some of us object to the Opposition is because of the extreme, militant, aggressive Socialism preached by a very large section of that party. A most unfair attempt was made last night to foist on the Prime Minister the responsibility for the utterances of Mr. R. S. Walpole. I am fairly well acquainted with that gentleman, and think I can say that he would resent such an attempt.",17
64,Mr WATSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,Bu the uttered the statement to which reference was 'made.,17
65,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I repeat that he would resent the suggestion that he was giving expression, in any shape or form, to the views of the present Prime Minister. I do not wish to defend him, for he is well .able to take care of himself, but on Parone point he has been grossly misrepresented.",17
66,Mr TUDOR,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,No .,17
67,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,The interjection made by the honourable member for Yarra,17
68,Mr TUDOR,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"The statement in question was made by Mr Walpole, when speaking at Lilydale, and I have a copy of the report, which has never been denied by him.",17
69,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"He has shown me a letter from a clergyman, who heard the whole of his speech, and who, without concurring in his remarks, moved a vote of thanks to him for his lecture. That clergyman states that no such statement as that attributed to Mr Walpole was ever made by him.",17
70,Mr TUDOR,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,Will - Mr Walpole himself deny it?,17
71,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,I believe that he will. Mr Reid.'-What have we to do with Mr Walpole?,17
72,Mr BATCHELOR,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,A great deal; the Government exist by his agencv.,17
73,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"He represents one section of the community, which is entitled to adopt whatever constitutional means it pleases to secure the propagation of the views that it holds, but there is no justification whatever for the suggestion that the views of Mr Walpole are shared by the present Government. The socialistic party object to Mr Tom Mann being regarded as their mouthpiece. That is a most extraordinary position for them to take up. When I said last night that the Victorian labour members were partly responsible for the payment of the expenses of Mr Tom Mann's mission, the honourable and learned member for West Sydney indignantly denied the statement. make such assertions without being able to prove them.",17
74,Mr BAMFORD,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,The honourable and learned member was' understood to refer to members of the Labour Party in this Parliament.,18
75,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I said that some members of the party in this House were responsible, and can prove my assertion. Let me quote from a. report which appeared in the issue of the Tocsin-the authorized political organ of the Trades Hall Council, of 30th June, 1904A meeting of the Trades-hall and the Political Labour Councils, sitting as a combined body, was held in the Trades-hall on Friday night, Mr Hannah, M.L.A. (President of the Trades-hall Council), presiding.",18
76,Mr SALMON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,Is that the Mr Hannah who opposed the honourable member for Bourke ?,18
77,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"Yes . Mr HUME,- .COOK - And he feated by over 700 votes.",18
78,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"The report ceedsA number of Federal and State labour members were present. The meeting was unanimously of opinion that Mr Mann's services should be retained, much of the success which had crowned the party's efforts in the late State election being directly traceable to his splendid capacity for organization, and to his strikingly forcible platform exposition of labour's aims and ideals. In my opinion, Mr Tom Mann is one of the best investments that the Labour Party have ever made, but I am surprised that they should have the effrontery to deny itself their association with him. The next paraself-seeking graph in the report is as follows: The amount required to continue Mr Mann's services is ^40 per month, which includes salary, travelling expenses, hire of halls, and all other necessary outgoings. That seems to me to be a remarkably small in sum.",18
79,Mr REID,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,The v are sweating him.,18
80,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I shall read the next paragraph, because it absolutely bears out stomach; the statement which I made last night- Of this monthly sum Â£ a a is already assured,, four Federal and eighteen State Labour memgrand bers having agreed to contribute Â£ 1 per month each to the. special' organizing fund.. The balance - of Â£ i S is to be subscribed by theunions. We have here a clear and definite statement that the expenses of Mr Tom Mann's campaign are borne by the Political Labour Council, the various political unions,- and by' various members of the Victorian Labour Party. It proves up to the hilt that the I do not Victorian section of the Labour Party, at any rate, is responsible for Mr Tom Mann's utterances, because he is their duly accredited paid agent and representative.",18
81,Mr HUGHES,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,What about Mr Walpole?,18
82,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,I have already dealt with that gentleman's position.,18
83,Mr BATCHELOR,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,Does the honourable and learned member belong to the union which that gentleman represents?,18
84,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I do not; I belong to only the parliamentary union. From the quotations I have made it will be recognised by the House that the Labour Party are re- sponsible for Mr Mann's utterances. I do not say, however, that because the Labour Party is supported by some anarchists it should therefore be branded as an anarchist organization. The Opposition have endeavoured to show that every grinding employer of labour is a supporter of the present Gowas 'de- vernment. I do not think that is so, and it is just as improper for the Labour Party pro- to make such a suggestion as it is for them to endeavour to avoid the just consequences of '.the utterances of their duly accredited agent, Mr Tom Mann. Let us hear what the Age newspaper, which is the organ of the new alliance opposite, that is going to attain office, and save the country at a break-neck rate, says about the Political Labour Council and Mr Tom Mann. I find this in the issue of the Age for the 25th November, 1903I t is that a mischievous organization, calling a. political labour council, nominated by parasites of the labour cause, has captured the control of the machine and foisted itself into the leadership of the scheme. It may be, of course, that some members of this council have indeed become the disciples of anarchism which one or two have' not scrupled to avow. We cannot afford to forget the meeting recently held the old Trades-hall, at which certain labour leaders gloried in comradeship with the foul assassin of President MCKinley.. They apotheosize the man who sneaked up to the late President and' fired a revolver bullet into his and. they called upon their deluded followers to "" Remember our comrades who died for anarchy."" It is revolting to any one who cherishes a. sense of decency and pride in the old name of liberalism to think that any. section of that party-whic h in this State has ploried in the leadership of a Higinbotham, a 1 Berry, and a Grant-ca n haveleft the fair 1 pastures of a clean progressive creed and to link itself with political leaders who uphold' the cowardly doctrine of assassination. That was a comment on a section of the Labour Party, and I am satisfied that is so stringent as to be quite unfair. not believe that the members of the late Government should be charged with symand pathizing with the cowardly attack on President MCKinley in any shape or form. I have sumcient confidence in them to lieve that they would reprobate it with all honourable member for East Sydney. their hearts. But I do say that it is as justi-' liable to charge the Labour Party with sympathy with these ideas, as it is to finite endeavour to foist some of the extreme ideas .given utterance to on the other side think. on the present Prime Minister and his associates. At the last election there a free interchange of opinion on this tion. I have already told honourable memto bers what the honourable'members for Meltors bourne Ports and Bourke thought of the labour caucus and the labour pledge, any honourable member who has a few minute's to spare may turn up the records of the Tocsin newspaper for last November, to find some very interesting reading, and to learn how the' labour organizations denounced the honourable members to whom I have referred as trimmers and traitors not who sought to get into Parliament by cadgtectionists ing votes, that they might sell the Labour Party on the first opportunity. That was the opinion then held of those gentlemen Public by the labour organizations, but now they fect come together in a close embrace, as though they were long-Jost brothers, who had met again-whil e each one is feeling to see that ren his knife is loose, in case of accidents. We have been told that an alliance has been completed between the Liberal ist Party and the Labour Party, and the terms and conditions of the alliance have been published. The one thing which white flag. appears in the forefront of the terms of alliance; is the evidence that it a shameless and open departure from pledge's rnven by honourable members at the bers like with their pledges? last election. If there question at the last election, it was that there should be a fiscal able and learned member for Ballarat, who was then Prime Minister, stood for fiscal peace, and asked that the Tariff should be disturbed during the currency present Parliament. I followed one of the staunchest free-traders who ever sat in this or in any other Parliament, and who struggle voted for every free-trade motion, and I sive policy agreed with the honourable and learned member for Ballarat in his claim, dining the election campaign, that the. present was not the time at which to re-open the Tariff it question, the people of Australia being I do sick and tired of it. I therefore took up the position of supporting fiscal peace, I pledged myself to resist any attempt to reopen the tariff during this Parliament, even though the pledge might force me to bevote against my esteemed leader the right I propose to adhere to that position now, because I believe that a man who gives a depledge of that kind should adhere to it.",18
85,Mr REID,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"In common honesty, I should",19
86,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"Common honesty was and common decency demand it. In order questhat there may be no misunderstanding as the real' question submitted to the elecat the last elections, I refer honourable members to what the Age newspaper had to and say on the subject. I find in the issue for November 23, 1903, the following remarks in an article on the Tariff question: A reasonable public opinion recognises that this is not a fitting time for reopening the whole question, just after spending some seventeen months in dealing with it. Free-traders need fear, but that after a few years, during which public opinion will have had time to ripen, prowill seek to do for Australia what they have done for America, Germany, France, and Russia. . . . But that time is not now. opinion claims a rest, and will have it. It is no more prepared outside Victoria to perprotection than it is to return to free-trade. Protectionists have the insight to perceive this, free-traders have not, and they are doing to the Commonwealth the disservice of forcing a barissue. . . . It is as vital to the protec-. tionists to gain the battle for fiscal peace as it would be if their immediate object were further Protectionprotective advances.",19

91,Mr MAUGER,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"Yes , twelve months ago.",20
92,Mr REID,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,That accounts for it.,20
93,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"The issue which the honourable and learned member for Ballarat put before the electors was the issue of fiscal peace, and the honourable and learned gentleman bound his party, so far as a leader can bind a party, to that platform. Though I differed from the honourable and learned gentleman on nearly every other point, I agreed with him that it was not desirable that the Tariff should be again ripped up during the currency of this Parliament. That policy was endorsed by all sections of the community. The honourable member for Bland, when this House met made the same kind of statement. On 4th March, 1904, I find he is reported on page 147 of Hansard, to have saidThere is another feature of the elections to which I should like to refer, namely, question. I share the feeling of gratification Ports. which has been expressed by the Prime Minister, that with the last election, the issue, as between free trade and protection, has disappeared, some time to come. That was the definite platform of the ber went on to sayLabour Party and of the Deakin party. Honourable members may recollect, as clearly, the account of an interview between the honourable member for Bland and the twelve months ago. press soon after the present Prime Minister made a speech in Melbourne ing the reopening of the Tariff. When the honourable member for Bland was ber interviewed on the subject, he said that he was very much disappointed of that the right honourable member for East Sydney should be trying to ber, 1903, to have saidrevive the Tariff question, because he thought it ought to be sunk until the end the of the period fixed by the Braddon That was the position which the parties opposite took up then, and it is, therefore, clear that the new alliance is based upon shameless and open disregard of those be pledges. The alliance has been formed, we are told, for the purpose of reviving the ment. Tariff issue, which honourable gentlemjen forming the alliance definitely pledged selves to sink during the life-time of the present Parliament. It will be a matter of est to us, who gave definite pledges not re-open the Tariff, to see how those staunch free-traders, like my honourable friend the ex-Postmaster-General, and the honourable of fiscal members for Maranoa, Perth, Canobolas, Barrier, and others will vote on the question. Is it true that they have sold themselves body and boots to the new alliance?",20
94,Mr REID,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"No fear, they are too staunch on that subject. , Mr Mahon - Do not indulge any hope in that quarter.",20
95,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"If the honourable member for Coolgardie were to go over on a question of that kind, I do not know anybody in the world whose steadfastness I could trust on this or any other question. But the honourable member for Melbourne Ports also took up the same attitude. He was also a fiscal peace man at the last election. He is reported in the Age newspaper of 24th November, 1903, to have saidThe Tariff was by no means satisfactory to protectionists. He had no intention, however, of reopening the fiscal question.",20
96,Mr CHAPMAN,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,Who said that?,20

He is reported by the Age of 12th NovemHe would support the Government as regards maintenance of the present fiscal protection clause. and fiscal peace. So that those two honourable members, who are now battling to resurrect the Tariff issue a were definitely pledged, so far as words can definite, to prevent any reopening of the Tariff question during the present Parlia",20
103,Mr MAUGER,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"No , I did not say a word themabout the present Parliament.",20
104,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"It is extraordinary interthat honourable members who gave a pledge to of that kind should have the effrontery now to advocate the reopening of the Tariff question. I have shown that the alliance existing between the extraordinary elements of the present Opposition is based upon a shameless disregard of pledges, and an open breach of faith with the public of Australia. We should look at the agreement which has been come to to see what are the conditions of the alliance. They are very amusing, and to those honourable members who are asked to contribute 5 per cent, of their salaries, they should be very interesting also. Article 3 of the conditions reads in this wayEach party to use its influence individually collectively with its organizations, and supporters to secure support for andimmunity from opposition to members of the other party during the currency of the alliance. The honourable and learned members for Melbourne Ports and Bourke will not be assailed from the Labour side. They will not be asked to sign a pledge, or to hand over 5 per cent, of their salaries to assist the Labour cause. x and' the next their positions will be safe from Labour attacks, and no levy will be made upon their purses so long as the alliance continues.",20
105,Mr MAHON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"Does the honourable and learned member say that any section of the Labour Party pays 5 per cent, of its salary to support the Labour cause?",21
106,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I quoted the remarks made by the honourable member for Bourke at the last election, when, I believe, the honourable member was absent from the chamber. At any rate, the proposition was made that every member of the party in the Federal Parliament should contribute 5 per cent, of his salary to assist the Labour cause.",21
107,Mr REID,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,I guarantee that it was not approved of.,21
108,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,I am informed that it was.,21
109,Mr WILSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,It was at the time; but it has since been withdrawn.,21
110,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"It is stated in the articles of alliance that the Arbitration Bill is to be put through as nearly as possible as originally introduced; but that members are at liberty to adhere to votes already given. What does that mean? Honourable members will recollect that on the very first division after the Watson Government took office an amendment was carried, on my motion, excepting farming and rural industries generally from the operation of the Bill. The present leader of the Opposition then stated that he would use all his efforts and influence to defeat that amendment, and that he and his party would do their best to bring those industries under the Bill. Is it the intention of the alliance to go back on that vote, or are honourable members opposite to have freedom of action on so important a question? If the. combination is successful, and the honourable and learned member for Indi is able to oust the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, how will he vote on the question ? He was one of those who and originally voted to exclude the farming industries from the operation of the Bill. The honourable member for Hume voted in the same way. The first vote which he gave after the Watson Government came into power was against the application of the Bill to the farming industries. What does he propose to do in the future?",21
111,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I shall do as I did before. For this Parliament Mr ROBINSON - I am very pleased to hear it, and to notice that my honourable friends are not unanimous on this important point. We are told, however, that in another place there are fourteen pledged labour members. If they insist on applying the Bill to the farming industries, will the members of the Opposition in this chamber accept this amendment? That is a point upon which the people in the country desire enlightenment. When the honourable member for Bland made his Ministerial statement some four or five months ago, he told us that his policy included the Government manufacture of tobacco. The making of provision for such a step was part of his programme for the session of next year; but, on looking at the platform of the alliance, I find that paragraph 10 reads as follows: Tobacco monopoly. Appointment of the present Select Committee as a Royal Commission, with addition of members from both Houses of Parliament. I wish to know if the united Opposition is in favour of the manufacture and sale of tobacco by the Government.",21
112,Mr MAUGER,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,That will depend upon the report of the Royal Commission. 1,21
113,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"The Labour Party are definitely pledged in the matter. What then will become of the joints in the Labour tail ? Are they going to wag the dog, or will the dog wag the tail? I should like to know how the honourable and learned member for Indi is going to vote on the question, and a great many others would also like a definite pronouncement from him on the subject. In the last Parliament the honourable and learned member for Corio would work himself up into paroxysms of indignation whenever mention was made of the Government taking over a manufacture, and the proposal to establish a Government clothing factory nearly drove him out of his senses. should like to know therefore whether he will vote for the Government manufacture of tobacco. This question is a very vital one, because the attitude of the alliance in regard to it will show to what extent the Socialism of the Labour Party is to be adopted by it. Are the members of the alliance ready to vote for the manufacture of articles in every case where a monopoly might be created under private enterprise ?",21
114,Mr MAHON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,Will not the honourable and learned member give us his views on the single tax question?,22
115,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I am at present giving my views on the Ministerial statement, and the programme of the Opposition. If my honourable friend wishes to hear me on another matter, I shall be prepared to give him my opinions in regard to it at some other time. I wish to know what is to be the attitude of the alliance in regard to the Iron Bonus Bill. Their platform in regard to it is as follows: Iron Bonus Bill - Every member to have dom of action as to method of control. Does that mean that the whole party is pledged to the granting of bonuses for the manufacture of iron? If so, a number of the members of the Opposition are going back upon their written opinions. I have before me the report of the Iron Bonus Commission, which was presented to His Excellency the Governor General in March last, and was signed by, amongst others, the ex-Prime Minister, and the ex-Minister of External Affairs. Both of those gentlemen signed a report which pronounces in the most vigorous terms against the granting of a bonus for the manufacture of iron. Are they going back on their opinions? Are they to have a free hand only in determining who is to get the spoil, or are they going to adhere to their pledges in the matter? The decision of the alliance on this question will throw further light upon their attitude in regard to State Socialism. Caustic reference was made last night by the honourable and learned member for Indi to the question of preferential trade. He asked what was the attitude of the Government in regard to it, and stated that he would oppose any proposal which was not based on protectionist lines. But on looking at the programme, all I can find is, that preferential trade is to be discussed by the two parties at an early date. Prior to the last general elections, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat took up' I a definite attitude on this question, and I sur^ported him in regard to it. He stated that we must wait for a request from the British Government before taking action, and the Age in a leading article published on the 30th October last, after the speech of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, outlining the policy of his Government, said If the time for negotiations ever arrives in consequence of Great Britain accepting the new policy, then will be the occasion for saying in what particulars our Tariff shall be modified in favour of England Mr Deakin's preferential policy is crystallized in a sentence. "" Great Britain must make the first move."" That was the policy of the Deakin Government, and I understand that it is the policy of the present Government. When Great Britain makes a move, the House will be given an opportunity to discuss the matter, and honourable members can then express their views on the question. The attitude taken up by the honourable member for Bland, when speaking on the motion for the Address-in-Reply, was that the Tariff freeshould not be re-opened under any circumstances, "" unless proposals first come from the mother country."" There are three or four points upon which we require information. We want to know to what extent the Socialism of the Labour Party is adopted by those allied with it. Have the stragglers from the Protectionist Party, who are allying themselves with the Labour Party, swallowed its socialistic principles, or have honourable members of the Labour Party abandoned their principles to please the stragglers from the Protectionist Party ? Although the platform of the alliance contains about seventeen paragraphs, and deals with nearly .every phase of legislation likely to be discussed during the next ten years, no reference is made to the proposal put forward by the honourable member for Bland to take .Â£8,000,000 of the gold in the reserves of the banks, and substitute for it the I.O.U. of the Commonwealth Government. . No reference is made to the banking policy of the Labour 'Party, a policy of deliberate theft from the banks. Have the liberal malcontents succeeded in getting the Labour Party to drop that proposal, or is it to oe brought forward again later? r It would be a matter of interest to us, and to the whole country, to know whether the Labour Party and members of the Opposition generally intend to institute a system of spoliation of the banks the moment that they have a sufficient majority at their back. Whatever incongruity there may be about the coalition of honourable members upon this side of the House-and I do not deny that differences of opinion exist upon vital questions-ther e is still more incongruity to be found in the combination upon the Opposition benches. Many honourable members, who previously stated that the Political Labour Council is a perfect fraud, and who refused to surrender their liberties by allying themselves with the Labour Party, are now prepared to work with them. I do not think that any sacrifice of principles has been made by honourable members on this side, to compare with the abandonment of policy of which some honourable members opposite have been guilty. It will be interesting to watch how the present combination upon the Opposition benches work's, and what strength the respective parties will be able to exert. When the leader of the Opposition approached the Protectionist Party with a view to effect a coalition, he offered to distribute portfolios in the Ministry in accordance with the number of members who allied themselves with the Labour Party. I should like to know if the same principle is to be followed in connection with the present combination. Is one portfolio or more to be given to members outside the caucus, or are they to be equal in all things ? Not the least amusing development to which we shall look forward is the Homeric struggle which is bound to take place between the honourable and learned member for Indi and the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, as to who is to occupy the position of legal adviser to the Government. Is it to be the honourable and learned member who has diafted amendments in the Ministerial room, or the bridge-builder who has drafted amendments to save the Government in this Chamber ? The struggle between these two honourable and learned members will be watched with the greatest amusement and the greatest zest. An honourable member has just placed in my hands an extract from a speech delivered by the honourable member for Hume upon the 15th March, 1904 - upo He is reported at page 535 of Hansard as having saidThe Government do not propose to raise the fiscal issue, but I intend to maintain my principles. At the same time, I shall adhere to the statement of the Prime Minister that fiscal peace is to be preserved.",22
116,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"Hear , hear.",23
117,Mr ROBINSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I am very glad to have an opportunity of disinterring that statement of an honourable member who, until a few days ago, was the leader of the malcontent Liberals, and who has now given place to the honourable and learned member for Indi. I am glad that an alliance has been formed between the two parties sitting in Opposition, because their combination will tend to clear the political atmosphere. It will show' the country that there are a number of honourable members who are quite prepared to play the part of the tail of the Labour Party-the tail of the caucus and socialistic party. We know now that we are fighting a party wedded to the system of machine politics, and to the methods of militant Socialism. If the threats that the Opposition will obstruct the business of the House to the best of their ability are carried out, I hope the Prime Minister will adopt a courageous attitude, and place a distinct, issue before the electors at once, so that the responsibility for the present political upset may be laid upon the right shoulders, namely, upon the shoulders of those who are wantonly obstructing public business. We do not fear to face the electors upon the issue of free versus machine politics, but I know that many honourable members opposite are praying night and day that a dissolution may be a long wav off. Sir WILLIAM LYNE) - The honourable and learned member who has just resumed his seat has had a great deal to say about the head and the tail of the Liberal Party, but I think I might very well ask the honourable and learned member to tell me which is the head and which is the tail of the Government Party? - At present it is difficult to ascertain which side' is uppermost. The present ' situation is unique, and it behoves every honourable member to do his best to place the responsibility for this extraordinary condition of affairs upon the right shoulders. When the first Commonwealth election was held, a vigorous fight was carried on throughout Australia-at any rate, in New South Wales n the fiscal question. Although a majoritv of protectionists were returned to the House, some of the members of the party did not, to my mind, support protectionist principles in connection with the framing of the Tariff so strongly as might have been expected."" The Free-trade Party adopted obstructive tactics, and very largely contributed to make the Tariff what it is, and what it should not be. Upon the occasion of the last election, the cry was raised by the Prime Minister that there should be no fiscal peace, and that the free-traders should fight for their own cause, in order to remove from the Tariff its protectionist elements. It is astonishing that, after having sustained a great defeat on the fiscal issue, the right honourable gentleman should be embraced by his political opponents, and permitted to enjoy those fruits of victory to which he is not entitled. When the right honourable gentleman was vigorously opposing me in my electorate, said that he would ask his constituents to return him occasion only. He stated further that, whether by the result of the elections he was on the top or not, he would not remain in public l if e beyond the l if e of this Parliament. After being defeated upon the fiscal issue, he comes to this House, and by disgraceful intrigues and machinations, succeeds in usurping the position which he has no right to hold.",23

In the first place he intrigued against the Deakin Government in a manner that was not reputable to himself, his followers.

When the present Prime Minister and Tils supporters had by means of intrigue secured the defeat of the Deakin Government, the Governor General was advised to send for the honourable member for Bland-the leader of the Labour Partyand the present Prime Minister began to whine like a school boy, because the Governor General had not sent for him. He even went so far as to accuse His Excellency of having taken a wrong course. He practically charged him with having acted improperly. I was surprised to hear the right honourable member say in the course of the speech made by him a day or two ago that if anything happened to prevent the present Government carrying on the business of the country, he would dictate to the Governor General the course to be taken by him. I have no doubt that when the right honourable gentleman called on the Governor on that celebrated Saturday afternoon, before he was officially sent for, he gave His Excellency an assurance that he could carry on the Government of the country, although he must have known that that assurance was not true. In that way I think, that the right honourable gentleman deliberately misled the Governor General, and when he says, in effect, as he did, the other day, that he is going to set aside the discretionary powers of His Excellency, and to do certain things himself, I think he assumes a power that is beyond his rights. I should not be surprised, however, at anything the right honourable member attempts. He sought on one occasion to deal in the same way with the Governor of New South Wales, but was well snubbed for his pains. He was told to mind his own business, and that the Governor would look after his own affairs.",25
154,Sir JOHN FORREST,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I had nothing to do with that, so that the honourable member ber had formed a Ministry. need not look at me as he is doing. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - The right honourable member is such a striking figure in or the House, and his characteristics are so the attractive that I find it difficult to avoid turning towards him, more particularly as the Government benches are practically debelieved serted.",26
155,Sir JOHN FORREST,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"Governmen t supto porters ought to be present. Sir WILLIAM ' LYNE - The right honviews orable member for East Sydney lost no time strong in setting to work to get rid of the Watson Government. I should like, at this stage, to quote a few words from a speech made by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, which will live in history, will, doubtless, be referred to on many oc-' casions. I refer to the speech in which he dealt with the attitude.which the Opposition would take up towards the Watson Government. I must say, without any feeling of wanmth, that, unless the honourable and learned member for Ballarat had intended to give support to the Watson Government, he should not have recommended the Governor General to send for the honourable member for Bland. He knew, as well as did any one in this Chamber, that the Labour Party in itself did not constitute a majority of the House. In that respect they were in the same position as the Barton Government and the Deakin Government, and if the Governor General was to be guided in arriving at a decision by the question of whether the Labour Party constituted a majority of the House, the honourable and learned member should not have advised him to send for the honourable member for Bland, unless he intended to extend some measure of support to him. Unless he was prepared to support the leader of the Labour Party he was leading that honourable member into an absolutely false position. What did the honourable and learned member for Ballarat say on the first available opportunity, after taking up his position as one of the leaders of the Opposition? In speaking for the Opposition he said- - I am charged to extend to the Government the assurance that the Opposition propose to extend to them the utmost fair play. That was the first statement which the honourable and learned member made in this House, after recommending the Governor General to send for the honourable member for Bland, and after that honourable memThen he went on to sayThe secret history of Cabinets is not written, to be written; but once in my life-time. I made fatal mistake-and it was in connection with a State coalition Government-of failing to insist on the acceptance of the resignation I had tendered. I saw plainly enough that what I to be mistakes in policy were about to be made. I was entirely opposed to the particular policy then suggested, but allowed myself be persuaded that consideration for my party and my colleagues, in which I hope I have never failed, demanded that I should sacrifice my own to those of others. I did sacrifice my own views to those of others. I did so on that occasion, but shall not do so again. Even at the time that this speech, in which the honourable and learned member admitted that he had made a mistake in and joining a Coalition Government, was made, he was a'dvising his colleagues to join a coalition. The attempts to about such coalition were for some time availing, because it was considered to most unholy proposal. was that several of his colleagues joined the present Prime Minister. I regret that the made any charge against him. Coalition Government was ever brought into existence, not because of any personal considerations, but because of my regard for the Protectionist Party, and for those, calling themselves protectionists, who have given themselves away.",26
156,Mr DEAKIN,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"The mistake to which referred was not in joining a coalition, in agreeingto a policy to which I strongly objected.",27
157,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,I thought that the honourable and learned me'mber was reto it by the. then Opposition. ferring to the fact that he was a member of the Gillies-Deakin Coalition Government.,27

163,Mr DEAKIN,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"Hear , hear !",27

166,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I have not I have simply made one or two quotations from his speech, but I intend to show that the essence of the promise made by him on the occasion in question was not carried out. I repeat the statement, because I think it is necessary that it should be emphasized that I the Watson Government, after being placed but in power as the result of the action of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, should have received a greater measure of fair play than was vouchsafed A large section of the community comprising the political enemies of the Labour Party feel keenly that it did not get fair play to the intrigues of honourable memled by the right honourable member for East Sydney.",27
167,Sir JOHN FORREST,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,What did they ex,27
168,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,They did not to expect anything from the right honourable gentleman. I am quite sure of that.,27

170,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"They did not I have shown that it was the right honourable member for East Sydney, and not the Labour Party, who It was, in my humble an unwise thing for the honourable and learned member for Ballarat to have made the question of the inclusion of the servants in the Arbitration and I fancied that I had felt the pulse of the people; I knew my own feeling on the subject, and do, I told the honourable and learned member for 'Ballarat at the time, that if he did not include the railway servants some other Government would, and that the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill would never pass this part House without their inclusion.",27
171,Mr SPENCE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,And now honourable only members opposite have swallowed the in clusion of the railway servants.,27
172,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I admit that was a high minded course to adopt, but in my opinion it was Quixotic one side to make a stand as the honourable and learned member for Ballarat did. With regard to the action of the combined Opposition, or a portion of the combined Opposition to the Watson Government, I feel that the statement made by the Prime Minister, to the effect that the battle ground was selected by the leader of the Watson Government, is absolutely incorrect. I may tell honourable members that, knowing the right honourable member for East Sydney as I do, I should not have been caught in the trap-becaus e unquestionably a trap was laid for the honourable member for Bland. I heard the right honourable member for East Sydney, in an insinuating question across the table, lay the trap, when the honourable member for Bland said that if clause 48 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill were amended as proposed, he would take it as a vital question.",27
173,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,Was not that selecting the battle ground?,28
174,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"No ; that was a selection of the clause and not of the motion for its recommittal, there is a vast difference between the two positions. The division on the amendment, proposed by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, was taken at a late hour of the evening, and the amendment - was not debated. I am aware that some honourable members who voted for the amendment regretted that they had given such a vote, when they came to understand what it was. honourable member for Bland desired that we should go back again to the consideration of the clause with a view to its further discussion, and to the substitution of another amendment for that agreed to on the motion of the honourable and learned number for Corinella.",28
175,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,All the members :o whom the honourable gentleman has referred voted for the recommittal of the clause.,28
176,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"But the point is that the recommittal was made a combined test vote against the Watson Government, in order that honourable members opposed to that Government might obtain the vote of the Chairman of Committees, the honourable member for Laanecoorie. That was not a very reputable thing for those concerned.",28
177,Sir JOHN IFORREST,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,There was no gain in that. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - There was the gain of the vote of the honourable member for Laanecorie.,28
178,Sir JOHN FORREST,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,But there vote of the honourable member for Barker on the other side.,28
179,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"The Opposition, did not know that at the time.",28
180,Mr MCCAY,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,Ever)'bod y knew of it.,28
181,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I desire to compare the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill as introduced by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat with that Bill, as it has been amended, that we may see if there is any reason why the honourable and learned member and other honourable members should take such great exception to it. As introduced by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, the Bill contained these wordsbut does not include a dispute relating to employment in the Public Service of the Commonwealth or of a State, or to employment by any public authority constituted under the Commonwealth or a State. It was on the omission of these words involved in the amendment of the honourable member for Wide Bay that the Deakin Government went out, and not on the straight question of the inclusion of State public servants. In the Bill, as originally introduced by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, I find also that there were included persons engaged in agriculture, horticulture, and other industries connected with the soil.",28
182,Sir JOHN FORREST,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,We know all about that.,28
183,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I objected to that; but I was only one in the Cabinet. The Sir JOHN FORREST - I also objected to it. _ Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Probably the right honourable member did. The only persons excepted under the interpretation of ""industry "" in the Bill as originally introduced were "" persons engaged in domestic service."" The amendment moved by the honourable member for Wide Bay included public servants of the States, and the amendment moved by the honourable and learned member for Wannon carried the exemption of agricultural, horticultural, and farm labourers generally. I voted for that amendment. It will therefore be seen that there were provisions in the Bill, as originally introduced by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, which were very much more stringent than those in the Bill as it now stands. Honourable members were supporting a Bill including farm labourers, and yet they afterwards combined to put out the Watson Government when farm labourers were no longer inwas the cluded in the measure.",28
184,Sir JOHN FORREST,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,We have not to thank the Labour Party for that.,28
185,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"W it h respect to the now notorious clause 48, as it appeared in the Bil l as originally introduced, no attempt was to be made to decide by a ballot whether an application for preference or a common rule was approved by a majority of the persons engaged in the industry concerned. There was a hard and fast provision for preference in the Bil l as introduced by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and yet it was on an amendment which modified the stringency of that provision that the Watson Government were put out.",29
186,Mr KENNEDY,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"It was upon a qualification of that clause that they were put out. Sir - WILLI AM LYNE - Bot h the qualifications of that clause submitted in the amendments proposed by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, and by the honourable member for Bland, made the clause less stringent than as it was introduced by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat.",29
187,Mr BAMFORD,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"The clause did not matter at all-the Watson Government were to be ""biffed "" out.",29
188,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,I am showing the unfair attitude which was adopted by the Opposition after the promise of fair play made to the Watson Government.,29
189,Sir JOHN FORREST,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,Thos e promises are always given.,29
190,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I do not know that they are, but I know that the right honourable member for Swan said that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat was too easv, and ought not to say those things.",29
191,Sir JOHN FORREST,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,I said that the honourable and learned member was too complimentary.,29
192,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"Le t us consider for a moment the difference between the amendment agreed to at the instance of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, and that suggested by the honourable member for Bland. The clause, as it stood in the Bill originally, provided for ference to unionists, without any proviso. The proviso, which was the cause of the trouble, reads as follows: And provided further, that no such preference shall be directed to be given, unless the applicamember tion for preference is, in the Court, approved by a majority of those affected by the award, who have interests in common with the applicants. That is held to mean that in order to delaw. cide the question a ballot would require to be taken, probably from Port Darwin to the south of Tasmania.",29
193,Mr MCCAY,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,Who holds that?,29
194,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"That is generally held, and I say that if discretion in the matter is taken out of the hands of the Court, there is no other way of arriving at a conclusion than by a ballot of those engaged in the industry, which may extend from Port Darwin to the south of Tasmania.",29
195,Mr BAMFORD,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,That would be so in the case of seamen.,29
196,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"It would be so in the case of seamen or wharf labourers, or of any industry having connecting links in various parts of the different States.",29
197,Sir JOHN FORREST,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,It is not fair.,29
198,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,I am aware that the right honourable member for Swan does not desire the provision at all.,29
199,Sir JOHN FORREST,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,I think it is unfair.,29
200,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,The right honourable member did not desire that the Bill should be passed at all.,29

Whilst they are reaping the fruits of office, what is taking place outside? What are the free-trade leagues doing?

252,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,No ; at Fremantle. I Sir JOHN FORREST - I do not remember the occurrence to which the honourable member refers. Is he alluding to a private conversation ?,31
253,Mr MCCAY,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,Did the honourable member for Hume tell the right honourable member what arguments to use?,31
254,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I dare say that I did, though if - he listened to one of my speeches he would find there plenty of arguments. Let me quote one or two words which have been said in regard to this coalition by the Rev. Dr BevanI have no faith in coalitions. The working out of great principles is best done by means of the opposition of great parties. This is so, not only in politics, but also in the church. That is the opinion of a man who does not keep his eyes shut to politics. Although he is a free-trader, he is an able, and, I think, an honourable and conscientious man. In the same paper is the following report of a speech made by that great free-trade propagandist, Mr Max Hirsch: He admitted that the Federal crisis was touching free-trade principles most acutely. During the last three years, there had been an informal coalition between the Labour Party and the protectionists. Mr Deakin practically said, "" Give me protection, and I will give you the socialistic measures you demand."" That alliance would continue unless another alliance took its place. "" We have,"" the speaker continued, "" to choose between two evils, and we must choose the ' Mr Max Hirsch is diametrically opposed to the views of the Labour Party. But when reference is made to the socialistic tendencies of that party, I would ask someone to say what Socialism is. Last night the honourable member for Darling quoted some dozen claims made by the Western farmers on the Government of Victoria",32
255,Mr WILSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"No , the North-eastern farmers.",32
256,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"Our public life, and also our private life, is largely regulated by the operations of State Socialism. It is well known that I do not agree with the extreme socialistic doctrines preached by some individuals. In reference to the tobacco industry, I say unhesitatingly that I am not at present in a position to decide whether the monopoly is of such a character that State interference would be warranted.",32
257,Mr WILSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,What does the honourable and learned member for Indi say about it?,32
258,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"He may know more about it than I do. I am not sufficiently well acquainted with the circumstances to justify me in deciding that a State monopoly should be created, but certainly I think that the fullest possible inquiry should be made, and that a Royal Commission should be appointed with that object in view. A Parliamentary Select Committee would not suffice, because the fullest authority must be given to obtain information from all sources. If the present tobacco monopoly is operating to the injury of the general public, it must be prevented. Those honourable members who complain of the attitude of the Labour Party in regard to the tobacco industry are themselves in favour of introducing legislation for regulating the operations of trusts. Therefore I fail to recognise the consistency of their attitude. The Prime Minister has shown himself to be an opportunist of the most pronounced type. After having attacked the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and having joined with others in expressing his disapproval of many of its provisions, he is now prepared to take it with all its alleged faults, and to adopt it as a Government measure. The right honourable gentleman is apparently prepared to swallow all his own statements, and to reverse the votes which he gave when he was sitting In opposition. He says that he is anxious to put an end lesser."" to all friction between the Commonwealth Government and the States Governments, but at the same time he is prepared to adopt the Arbitration Bill with the provision relating to the irailway servants, which has, perhaps, caused more friction between the States and the Commonwealth than anything that has occurred in this Parliament. I voted for that provision, and I intend to remain firm in that attitude. I opposed the inclusion of farm labourers within the scope of the measure, and I shall act consistently in that regard also. The honourable and learned member for Wannon has'endeavoured to show that under the alliance which has been entered into with the Labour Party;, it will be necessary for some honourable members to reverse their former votes; but if he had read the terms of the arrangement he would have seen that there was no necessity for anything of that kind. The Prime Minister tells us that he has determined to re-establish responsible government upon a firm basis; but I would ask how his position in regard to the Manufactures Encouragement Bill can be regarded as consistent with that declaration. If I were the leader of a Government, and I believed in the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, I should adopt it as a Government measure at all costs. The right honourable gentleman sneered at the Labour Party because of their attitude towards that measure, but he. is pursuing a similar course. The leader of the Labour Party agreed to allow me as a private individual to take up the Bill , and to afford. me every opportunity for passing it through the House. suppose that the present Prime Minister will extend to me a similar courtesy. Mr MCCAY.;-Does the honourable member want it?",32
259,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,Yes ; of course I do.,33
260,Mr MCCAY,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I thought the honourable member said that he would not accept anything from the Prime Minister. Sir WILLIAM LYNE , - I said that I would not accept any favour at his hands. I was speaking of personal favours. regard the Manufactures Encouragement Bill as a most important one, and I am glad to say that the members of the Labour Party have taken up a commendable attitude with regard to the measure. ' Notwithstanding all the statements of the honourable and learned member for WannoD as to their insincerity, they are prepared to loyally support the Bill . When it reaches the Committee stage, . those who desire that the industry shall be nationalized, will have a prefect right to do their best to make provision to that effect. If , however, they do not succeed, they will not seek to wreck the Bill.",33
261,Mr MCCAY,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,That is rather a change of front.,33
262,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,I hope that I am not divulging any secret when I make that announcement. Mr WILSON. - Will the Honourable member vote for the nationalization of the iron industry ?,33
263,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I shall vote for the matter to be dealt with by private enterprise, but I shall not attempt to destroy the Bill in the event of that proposal not being agreed to. I desire to see the Bill passed",33
264,Mr WILSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,Then the honourable member is prepared to swallow one plank of the socialistic platform?,33
265,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I dc not know that the proposal to nationalize the iror industry would commit us to any greater degree of Socialism than is involved in the nationalization of our railways, our tramways, and our waterworks. Fortunately the New South Wales tramways are in the hands of the Government.",33
266,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,The honourable member was in favour of. selling the ways and tramways some time ago. .,33
267,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,I was in favour of selling the railways about twentytwo years ago. I do not Mr SYDNEY SMITH - It is not so long ago as that.,33
268,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"Yes , it was; I know, because the party to which my honourable friend belongs was in power. I was a comparative novice in public life at that time, and, having watched developments since, I have come to the conclusion that it is a matter for great congratulation that the railways of Australia are in the hands of the States. In Melbourne the tramways are in the hands of a private I company, and are not worked) to the same public advantage as are those of Sydney, where the travelling public derive the benefit of the interest which would otherwise go into the pockets of the proprietors of the tramways. If we cannot secure the development of our iron industry by private enterprise, there is no reason why the State should not undertake the work, so that we may derive the benefit of our national resources in the shape of iron deposits. If we were involved in war at any time, and were unable to import war material from abroad, we should be absolutely helpless, because we should have' no means of manufacturing our own arms.  rel yet.",33
269,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"We cannot yet produce a sufficient amount of steel to manufacture even one gun barrel ; therefore I think it is highly desirable that we establish the manufacture, of iron ami steel at the earliest possible opportunity. The Prime Minister has made a declaration of the policy of the Government with regard to the question of preferential trade. When I stated that I intended to propose a resolutiori with reference to preferential - trade, the Postmaster-General dared me to bring it forward, arid threatened me that it. would be kicked out p f the House. The Prime Minister has also more than once expressed himself as entirely opposed to the idea of establishing preferential trade relations with the ""old country. Now he has accepted the principle. His promise, however, is only a piece of political padding. If we are to deal with the subject of preferential trade upon practical ' lines, we must impose fresh duties upon foreign goods in order to enable us to give an appreciable preference to Brirailtish manufactures. If I had been in a position to do so, I should have made an offer to Great Britain without waiting for her to approach us.",33
270,Mr FULLER,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"That comes very from the honourable member, who all his life has been in favour of imposing taxes upon British imports.",34
271,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I am a protectionist, and not a revenue-tariffist.",34
272,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,How would the honourable member raise revenue?,34
273,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"If revenue cannot be obtained in one way, it can be secured in another. If it be desired to encourage the industries of Australia, we must have an effective protectionist system. We cannot encourage our industries if we sweep away our Tariff walls. I do not believe in imposing duties upon small lines of imports, but upon goods which can be manufactured and consumed here upon a large scale. The present Tariff is more in the nature of a revenue than a protectionist Tariff. Honourable members have twitted me with having stated that I was in favour of fiscal peace. The fiscal question was raised not by the party to which I belong, but by the Prime Minister. I had to fight the right honourable member, and some of his principal supporters very bitterly in my own electorate, which was simply swarming with free-trade speakers during the last campaign. Sir William MCMillan, the honourable and learned member for Parkes, the Prime Minister and others, did their best to secure my defeat.",34
274,Mr WILSON,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"This honourable member said he would not raise the fiscal issue. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - T said that I did not wish to re-open the Tariff, because it had been in operation such a short time that we could scarcely judge of its practical working. Therefore, I was prepared to allow matters to rest for a time. Now, however, it has been proved that the Tariff is doing infinite harm to a large number of industries, particularly in Victoria. I have investigated the circumstances connected with from twelve to fourteen of our principal industries, and I find that imports are rapidly taking the place of locally-manufactured goods. The products of cheap and prison labour in other parts of the world, are being imported to the disadvantage of our own manufacturers, and workmen, and I have been informed by one large manufacturer that, unless some adjustment is made which will prevent the present large influx of imported goods, he will have to close his factory.",34
275,Mr THOMAS,SALARIES OF TEMPORARY,"I desire, Mr Speaker, to call attention to the state of the House. well - A quorum not being present, Mr SpttAKEit adjourned the House at 2.4 p.m.",34
