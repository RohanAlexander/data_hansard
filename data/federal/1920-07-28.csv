2,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I ask you a question, Mr Deputy Speaker, concerning procedure. Y ou will remember that, during the discussion of a certain motion last week, there were some heated interchanges between the Minister for the Nav y (Sir Joseph Cook) and myself, and I , coming into conflict with the Chair, was named, and my suspension was moved by 'the Minister. I wish to know whether it is within your power, in such cases, if the Prime Minister is within the precincts, to call on him to take action ?",19

4,Mr BURCHELL,COMMONWEALTH TRADING,"for Mr GBEGOBT) asked the Prime Minister, upon noticeWill the Government instruct, BO that a fair comparison may he made between Federal and private business concerns, that in the preparation and production of the balance-sheets of all Commonwealth trading concerns such enterprises shall be separately debited with-(a ) State and Federal income taxes; (6) war-time profits tax; (c) rates; (d) insurance, depreciation, interest on capital and advances; (e) Jul] proportion of departmental costs reasonably chargeable to such enterprises 7 . Mr HUGHES - The answer to the honourable member's question is as fol lows :It is not considered that debits for (a) State and. Federal income taxos, arid (b) war-time profits tax, are legitimate charges against cost of production in a private trading concern, and it is'not proposed to inflate Government factory costs by the inclusion of any such charges. Under ordinary circumstances, charges ori account of rates would be incorporated in the factories' accounts, but, as the Commonwealth is exempt from such charges, no amount can be included under this heading in the accounts .of any factory. The amount, if included, would not materially affect the cost of production. Payment for water and sanitary services are, however, paid in Government factories. As a matter of policy, the Commonwealth carries its own risk of loss through contingencies which, in private enterprises, are ordinarily covered by insurance. Should anysuch loss occur in the case of factories, the amount of the loss is borne by the factory concerned. Aa regards depreciation, interest on capital, and advances, all charges on these accounts are duly brought into factories' accounts. All charges which arc definitely incurred on behalf of any factory, including cost of audit, are debited to the factory, but it is impracticable to assess, with any degree of accuracy, a charge on account of departmental costs. In any case, the amount would be so small that the effect on factories' costs would be negligible. It may be added that' the form of balance-sheet in use in the Defence Department was designed by the Advisory Accountant to the Royal Commission on Naval and Defence Administration in consultation with the Treasury, and is considered to fully reveal the actual position' of the respective factories.

The company is to be allowed freedom to increase freight.3 and fares subject to the Controller of Shipping being satisfied as to the reasonableness of any such increases, the present rates to be increased in the first instance by 20 per cent. The contract will provide for uniform rates of freights and fares to be charged in respect of each service, and provision will also be made with the view of preventing any discrimination or preference as to cargo space or otherwise. .RETURNED SAILORS A ND SOLDIERS IMPERI AL LEAGUE. NA SOLDIERS' TWEED.",21
14,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONTROL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF,"On Thursday, Sth July, a promise was given by the Assistant Minister for Defence to the honourable member for Hunter (' Mr. Charlton)' that inquiries would be made into certain allegations which had been made against the Returned Sailors and Soldiers I m perial League in New South Wales of discriminating against returned soldiers who are not members of the league in the distribution of civilian suiting made at the Government Woollen Mills, Geelong. I am now in a position to furnish the honourable member with the following information :The Inspector-General of Administration reports that an examination of the books and minutes of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League in New South Wales has besn made, with the result that there is no foundafor the allegations. The same prices for the tweed have been charged to members and An audit of the hooks of the tweed department shows that in no case has there been an overcharge. The league receives 6d. per yard on its contract-of this, Is. is retained by the head office to finance the tweed of department, and the balance by the sub-branch, matter comes less freight on the cloth. In connection with the remarks of the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) that besn "" the Sydney section of the league carried a resolution some six weeks ago that it would not supply tweed to non-members of the organiI might say that no foundation could be found to justify the statement.

DISSENT FROM Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER'S RULING .",22
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONTROL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF," The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) has given notice of his intention to move That Mr Deputy Speaker's ruling-that a motion ""That the question be now put,"" be received before the question itself has been proposed or stated to the House by Mr. puty Speaker-ib e disagreed to. But before the honourable member proI ceeds, I would like to make a few reto marks so that my attitude may not be Elliot misunderstood. I need not repeat ruling which I gave, and to which the that honourable member takes objection. It is still my opinion that the framers of the standing order providing for the closure motion contemplated that the motion should be submitted to the House for decision immediatelv on being moved. Otherwise, at least two hours and ten minutes might be occupied by the mover f and seconder of a motion before the closure motion could be submitted. Howrights ever, it is only right to say that I find from the past records that the preshould be preserved.. sent Speaker (Sir Elliot Johnson), f o whom I am acting in consequence of the very serious illness of his wife, has Tuled that a closure motion cannot be put until the matter. the original question has first been from the Chair. My ruling, therefore, is in conflict with that of Mr Speaker. The standing order reads as follows:After any question has been proposed, in the House or in any Committee of whole, a motion may be made by any member rising in his place, and without notice, and whether any other member is addressing the Chair or not, "" That the question be now put,"" and the motion shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate. I have no wish to differ from a ruling given by' Mr Speaker, but with all due I contend that the Chair never Tudor) makes a proposition. It is the honorablehonormember who makes the proposition. On the occasion on which the closure was moved, the honourable member for Dalley fac- (Mr Mahony) moved a motion, and then proceeded to speak to it . The usual statement from the Chair is, "" That the by the question""-whateve r it mey be-""be Those rewho are of opinion that it should be passed are asked to vote "" Yes , "" and those who are of the contrary opinion are asked to vote "" No . "" I regret that I cannot withdraw the interpretation which I have given. W it h great respect, I have to differ from Mr Speaker, and submit matter to the decision of the House.",22
17,Mr RYAN,CONTROL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF,"West Sydney) [3.15] I move That Mr Deputy Speaker's ruling-that a can motion ""That the question be now put"" can be received before the question itself has been Deproposed or stated to the House by Mr. Deputy Speaker-h e disagreed to. regret the circumstances which have led the absence of Mr Speaker (S ir Johnson) from his place this after the noon. It is somewhat of an anomaly if my motion is agreed to it will uphold the ruling of Mr Speaker, and if it is defeated, Mr Speaker's ruling will be overruled by the House, and that of Mr . Deputy Speaker (Hon . J . M . Chanter) upheld. I hope that honourable members will approach the matter entirely free r o m any preconceived ideas upon it , because it is of great importance that the of honourable members to discuss questions with in the Standing Orders The ruling given r by Mr Speaker is undoubtedly right, and I invite Mr Deputy Speaker to compare the various standing orders bearing on Before the discussion is stated ended-it need not be long- I hope that Mr Deputy Speaker will alter his opinion as to the time when a closure motion may be put. The standing order either under which the Prime Minister (Mr . the Hughes) moved "" That the question be now put,"" is on page 71 of the Standing Orders, and reads as follows:After any question has been proposed, either in the House or in any Committee of the whole, a motion may be made by any member rising in his place, and without notice, and whether any other member is addressing the Chair or not, "" That the question be now put,"" and the motion shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate. I invite attention to the first few words, "" A f t e r any question has been proposed."" Those words define the time when an honourable member may move "" That the question be now put "" ; that is to say, when any question has been proposed. Mr Deputy Speaker's ruling leads us to this peculiar position, that a motion, "" That the question be now put,"" may be taken when there is actually no question before the House to be put. The language of the standing order is quite clear. It says, "" A f t e r any question has been proposed."" The matter to be decided by us now is, ""When, is a question proposed?"" and ""Who proposes a question?"" The Chair is the only person who. can propose a question. honourable member can do I invite the attention of Mr Deputy Speaker to the difference between a ""motion "" and a "" question,"" and refer him to standing order 120, which providesWhen a motion has been made and seconded, a question thereupon shall be proposed to the House by Mr Speaker. The word ""proposed"" applies to the statement of the question to the House by the Chair, and not to the intention seconded, formed in the mind of an honourable memproposed ber to move a particular motion. Comby parison of the two standing that the question is proposed by the And Chair, and in that regard the word the "" stated"" is synonymous with "" proany posed."" But the actual proposal comes when the motion has been moved and seconded according to standing order No. 120. A glance at these two standing orders furnishes ample evidence and, am sure, also proof to any unbiased perif son that the ruling given on this obvious. May saysmatter on a former occasion Mr Speaker is right - I hope, therea fore, that honourable members hesitate, particularly in his .absence, to overrule a ruling which is obviously right. There are many ways of meeting question. the suggestion which you make that, the motion may not be moved "" That the question be now put,"" then there is no means-if the House be so minded-of preventing an honourable member from proceeding with his remarks. There is ample machinery provided in the Standing Orders. The Prime Minister may move, "" That the honourable member be no longer heard,"" and, if a majority is of opinion that it has listened sufficiently long to the honourable member who . is speaking it can vote him down. But your ruling leads to the extraordinary position that an honourable member speaking, and intimating that he intends to move something, may have that matter put to the House, although there is not another honourable member who is prepared to second it . A motion can not be put to the House unless some honourable member has seconded it . I hold that there is a difference between a proposed motion and a proposed question. You, sir, would elevate the position of a proposed motion to the same position as if it were a question to be decided by the House. If you confine yourself to the interpretation of No the Standing Orders to which I have reso. ferred-an' d they are as plain as the English language can be- I submit that you will come to the conclusion that you committed an error in your ruling. But I refer you also to May (10th edition, pp. 265, 266) in order to point out what is meant by the word "" proposed."" May lays down that questions are proposed by",22
18,Mr SPEAKER,CONTROL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF," In the Commons, when the motion has been it merges in the question, which is by the Speaker to the House, and read him; after which the House is in possesorders shows sion of the question. u n t i l the House is in possession of question it is absurd to suggest that honourable member may move "" That the question be now put."" Let me carry my argument a littl e further. May (page 276) also lays down when an amendment may be moved. This has a bearing and I throws light upon the question-that is, it is necessary to shed light upon the by The time for moving an amendment is after question has been proposed by the Speaker, will and before it has been put. So there is a difference between proposing a question and the putting of the But, before any honourable if member can invoke the closure, there must be the question proposed by the Chair; and the motion is then to bring it to a decision-whic h is the putting of the question. I would again refer you, sir, to May (page 213), where there is reference to the time of the closureA closure motion may therefore be sanctioned by .the Chair, either immediately upon, or within a few minutes after, the proposal to the House of the question to be closed. I ask honourable members to closely examine those woids. Of course, I know, and no doubt you, sir, also know, as do honourable members generally, that the closure is moved very often in the middle of an honourable member's speech, and, perhaps, after he has indicated that he intends to move something. The closure in such cases is moved in order to prevent that honourable member from developing his intention into a question by having it put through the Chair. Some honourable ber-generall y a Minister-rise s and moves "" That the question be now put."" Of. course, the honourable member who was originally speaking is then prevented from having his intended developed into a question. that procedure can be adopted there must be some question before the Chair.",23
19,Mr HUGHES,CONTROL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF,"There was a question before the Chair on this occasion, because the honourable member said "" I move.""",24
20,Mr RYAN,CONTROL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF,"The fact that an honwe orable member gets up in this House says "" I move,"" does not make it a tion, unless some other honourable ber also gets up and says "" I second it . "" A f t e r all, sir, your rulin g arises ""a confusion and from a misunderstandorable ing of the technical meaning of the word "" proposed,"" as used in the Standing Orders. If you will read them carefully you will find that the word "" proposed,"" used with regard to a question, is ployed with regard to the stating of the question by Mr Speaker. We all know the special circumstances which gave rise to the ruling in question. The honourable member for Dalley (M Mahony) was moving to postpone the Orders of the Day u n t i l after the sideration of notice of motion No. 1, not made. Government business.",24
21,Mr WATKINS,CONTROL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF,Did the member actually move it?,24
22,Mr RYAN,CONTROL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF,"No ; he indicated that was going to move it . But, whether he did actually move it or not does not affect my argument, because it only becomes a question when it has been seconded and is proposed from the Chair. The matter is one of great importance, and I hope honourable members will see the necessity for settling it irrespective of which side of the House they may be found, because we may sit on one side of this Chamber today and on the other side tomorrow. It is necessary that we should be able to uphold the rights of honourable members.. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), when he moved his motion, was out of order. Evidently he had become very anxious, for some reason or other, to prevent the honourable member for Dalley from proceeding with his very eloquent and forcef u l l y impressive speech with respect to the War Precautions Act and industrial unrest. The Prime Minister used the first instrument at his hand when he rose and mem- moved ""That the questiou be now put.""' I submit that the House should not hesitate to disagree with your r u l in g ; but I hope, rather, sir, that you will reconsider your decision and render one motion which will be in conformity with the But before decision of Mr Speaker (H o n . Sir Elliot Johnson) on this matter, which is obviously right.",24
23,Mr WEST,CONTROL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF,"East Sydney) [3.30] - In seconding the motion, I desire to draw the attention of honourable members to the seriousness of the matter with which are now dealing. The ruling given and by Mr Deputy Speaker restricts the quesrights of honourable members to address memthe House. The merits or demerits of the motion that was closured need not from concern us; but it is necessary that honmembers should support this dissent lest the ruling to which exception is taken be made the means of preventing honourable members from bringing business before the House. I hold strongly emthe opinion that no question can be before the House until it has been stated from the Chair. Often members have risen with the intention of making a motion, but, during the course of their r . preliminary remarks, ,some development takes place which obviates the need for conproceeding further, and the motion is It is only when a question has' been stated from the Chair, and has honourable thus become the property of the House, that it may be closured. Honourable he members who voted for the closure on Friday did so in ignorance of the motion that they were closuring. May makes it very clear that a question must be stated from the Chair before it is before the House; and if the House of Commons, or the House of Lords, insists upon that procedure, we cannot go far wrong in following their example. Mr Speaker is . not infallible; like all human beings he is liable to error. The Prime Minister is often in such a state of mind that he is not in a position to appreciate the seriousness of the things he does. That was the case on Friday, when he moved the closure, whilst Mr Deputy Speaker, no doubt elated because of the responsible position he was filling, lost for the time being his customary level-headedness. An y encroachment on the rights and privileges of honourable members should be resisted. I do not . say that some curtailment of debate is not wise, but when the closure is applied, its application should be in accordance with the Standing Orders. I hope honourable members will rise above party prejudices, and by their vote upon this interpretation of the Standing Orders preserve the rights and privileges of the House. Mr Deputy Speaker delivered a hasty judgment which was fraught with great danger to this House. Therefore I hope honourable members will endorse the views enunciated by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan).",24
24,Mr BRENNAN,CONTROL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF,"I rise to a point of order. I was under the impression that when Mr Speaker had definitely ruled upon any point, such as that now under consideration, his ruling became the settled procedure of the House until it was altered by a vote of the House, or until the Standing Orders had been amended. Do I gather that, although Mr Speaker has given a definite ruling, it remains for any Deputy-Speaker to give any fantastic ruling he may please in absolute contradiction of the procedure laid down by Mr Speaker? I am reminded by interjection that the late Sir Thomas Bent once gave a ruling to which he was careful to add, "" That is my ruling for to-night, anyhow."" thought, perhaps, you, sir, meant that those words should be added to your ruling on Friday.",25
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONTROL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF," The ruling of Mr Speaker Johnson was given on another question, and in accordance with his interpretation of the Standing Orders at that time. The House is now dealing with a motion to dissent from a ruling given by me, and I hold that it is. within the power of the House to review at any time any interpretation of its rules. That being the ease, this discussion is in order.",25
26,Mr HUGHES,CONTROL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF,"Bendigo-Prime M in ister and Attorney-General) [3.39] - The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr . Ryan) has based his argument on the first ^paragraph of the standing order dealing with the closure, and he has urged particularly that the word "" proposed "" in relation to any question means proposed from the Chair. He has quoted other Standing Orders in support of his contention, and has said very properly that we must discuss this question without reference to the side of the House upon which we sit. I agree with that entirely. I have sat on other sides of the House, and I am trying to deal with this question on its merits. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) has referred us to the Standing Orders themselves. I brush aside the question of whether Mr Speaker's ruling is in accordance with the ruling of yourself, s i r - I put that on one side, and for the very reason that the honourable member for West Sydney advanced, namely, that all men are liable to error. You, sir, on the face of things, are no more likely to be free from a liability to error than any other man; and, therefore, we come back to the question itself. We have to ask ourselves, as every Court does in construing an Act : What is the object of these Standing Orders-wha t did the Legislature intend in adopting them ? Clearly, the object of this and the following Standing Orders is to prevent honourable members speaking - at undue length, and to give the House control over its own business. It is provided that when any motion is moved any member may get up, although another honourable member is speaking, and move "" That the question be now put,"" "" That the honorI able member be no further heard,"" and so on. There are two possible meanings to the word "" proposed,"" and the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr . Ryan) has said that it means a proposal from the Chair only. Very well, let us see whether that meaning is compatible with the object of the Standing Orders, which, as I say, is to give the House control over individual members and prevent them arresting the progress of business. If the honourable member's contention were correct, it would follow that an honourable member might speak for an hour and five minutes, and not until he had finished, and his seconder, with a like right, had spoken for another hour and five minutes, and the motion had been put from the Chair, would it be possible for any honourable member to move ""That the question be now put."" Further, when the question was put from the Chair, any honourable member might immediately move an amendment, on which he might speak for a like time, and when that amendment had been defeated, another member might move a similar one; and so the proceedings might go on ad infinitum. It is quite clear that the whole object of these Standing Orders is to prevent waste of the time of the House. In the present case it is said that there was no motion before the Chair, but the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) it will be remembered, moved that the Orders of the Day should be postponed until after the consideration of notice of motion No. 1, in the name of Mr Groom. On this, the then Acting Treasurer (Sir Joseph' Cook) said that he understood that the business of the day had been called on, and, therefore, the honourable member's motion was too late. But you, Mr Deputy Speaker, then said that the particular Order of the Day appearing first on the paper had not been called on, and, therefore, the motion of the honourable member for Dalley was in order. Will the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Ryan), in the face of these clear facts, say there was no motion before the Chair ? It will be seen that the order that appeared first on the businessipaper had not - been called on, and that, therefore, the motion of the honourable member for Dalley was in order; and that honourable member proceeded to discuss it at length. It was not until it was very obvious that the intention of the honourable member was to waste time that I got up and moved "" That the question be now put.""",25
27,Mr MAHONY,CONTROL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF,"I object to the remark that my object was clearly to waste time. It was nothing of the sort, and I ask that the reflection on myself be withdrawn. Mr Hughes.",26
28,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONTROL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF, Will the right honourable the Minister withdraw the remark ?,26
29,Mr HUGHES,CONTROL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF,What have I said ?,26
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONTROL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF,"The honourable member for Dalley says that the Minister charges him with wasting time, and he objects. I ask the Minister to withdraw the remark.",26
31,Mr HUGHES,CONTROL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF,"Of courser if the honourable member says that his object was not to waste time, I withdraw the remark; but honourable members generally know perfectly well that that was the intention of the honourable member and of every honourable member on that side, and I do not see why any one should take umbrage at a plain statement of fact. Let me .remind honourable members what has been done in this House, not - once, but hundreds of times. I refer to the Hansard report of the 18th November, 1913, page 3265, when the Government Preference Prohibition Bill was before the House. 7",26
32,Mr TUDOR,CONTROL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF,You were on this side then.,26
33,Mr HUGHES,CONTROL OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF,"I know I was; and I only desire to show what has been done here many times. .There was a motion by Mr now Sir William Irvine, that the Bill be read' a third time. The question was not put from the Chair at all, but the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr. MCDonald) rose to speak. He had not got further than "" Mr Speaker "" when he was arrested by the then member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly), who proposed "" That the question be now put."" Here we have three things one after the other - a motion by Sir William Irvine for the third reading of the Bill, an attempt by the honourable member for Kennedy to say something to the Chair, and a motion by the then honourable member for Wentworth "" That the question be now put "" ; and the latter motion was forthwith put and carried. There were dozens and dozens of such cases at that time, as, apparently the usual way of carrying on the business. I take it as one of the most glowing tributes to my tolerance that I said very little at that particular time; indeed, I do not know what was the matter with me. I venture to say that there is nothing in the Standing Orders at all to Support the contention of the honourable member for West Sydney. There is, Mr . Deputy Speaker, in the very nature and object of the Standing Orders the support to which you must look for your ruling. The object of these Standing Orders is to prevent waste of time. If the r u l ing the honourable member for West Sydney would have you give is upheld, all I can say is that these Standing Orders are absolutely useless, for two hours and ten minutes could be taken up on any motion before it could be moved "" That the question be now put.""

34,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Maribyrnong) [4.6]. s is a Bill which is likelv to lead to considerable expenditure at a time when every Treasurer in Australia is crying out about the shortage of money necessary for carrying on the ordinary works of development; and if w© agree to this clause, which contains the various parts into which the measure is divided, we practically assent to the whole of the principles of the Bill. Under Part III., which sets out the powers and functions of the Director, quite a number of sub-Departments may be established which will naturally lead to increased expenditure from which, in my opinion, very little benefit will accrue to the people of Australia, and which will simply mean the duplication of expenditure already undertaken by the States. Nothing can be done by the Commonwealth that is not already being carried out by the various States. If it be necessary to engage the services of am eminent scientific expert to carry on research work on lines not at present attempted by the States, surely the States and the Commonwealth can combine to secure his services without the creation of a new and totally unnecessary Department for the purpose. It may be claimed that the will of the Minister will find expression in any action taken by the Director of the Institute. While there may be an odd Minister here and there who is prepared to withstand his officers, and determine how the Department of. which he is the nominal head shall be conducted, for the most part the heads of the Departments practically control their Ministers. In any case there are so many other tasks which the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) will have to undertake besides the administration of this measure that he will be able to pay very little attention to what the Director of the Institute will be doing, and, therefore, will simply initial the recommendations broughtto him by the Director. In this way expenditure will heap up. No doubt, at first, on the Director's appointment, the Minister will lay down very emphatically the necessity for having the Institute run on economical lines. He will say, ""We want efficiency and economy combined,"" and naturally' the Director will assent to that proposition, but there will be a very different tale when he commences his operations, and very soon he will be saying to the Minister, "" My recommendations must be carried into effect if I am to be held responsible for the proper administration of the Institute."" If honourable members peruse the powers and functions of the Director as set out in detail in Part III., they will readily come to the conclusion that this Mr Fenton. Institute will not only be a big Department in itself, but may comprise quite a number of sub-Departments which canonly be carried on by considerable expenditure. We are asked to incur this expenditure at a time when we have many heavy financial responsibilities facing us. Honourable members ought to hesitate before they give the Government the power to establish new Departments. There is a sort of an apology dn the Bill to the effect that in order to avoid overlapping with the States, everything to be done by this Institute must be carried out in co-operation with the State Institutes; but I have yet to learn of any man appointed to a new. position who has not immediately set out to magnify it, and make it more and more expensive. I shall not have it said of me that I sought to prevent any man- 'from coming to* the Commonwealth who might, through being possessed ""of ability not possessed by any person here, be able to enlighten us on various matters and carry out work that would eventually prove beneficial to the people of Australia; but I hold thati - the Commonwealth's part in bringing out such an expert ought to be confined to providing his salary. He could easily carry on his work in connection with universities, technical schools, and schools of mines in the various States. All the machinery and appliances necessary are available to enable him to commence his work. There is no need for the Commonwealth to establish a new Department for the purpose. I am not preaching economy for economy's sake. The cry of economy is a horse one can ride to death. To economv on some lines I am totally opposed. Here, however, we have the opportunity of preventing the establishment of an expensive - Department; but, unfortunately, a majority of honourable members seem prepared to endorse this expenditure without regard to the limit to which it may go. I am not opposing the Bill for opposition's sake. In various forms this measure has been before us on several occasions, and I have always opposed it on the ground that it would lead to the duplication, and even triplication, of expenditure already undertaken by the States. Can we justify establishing a seventh Department to supplement six State. Departments already doing the work it would undertake? To attempt to do so in the face of the liabilities fronting us is next door to criminal. It will be useless when the Estimates come down from year to year for any honourable member then to say, "" I did not think t h u Institute was going to cost this Bum of money,"" and move for the reduction of the item as a protest against such expenditure. At the initial stage we ought to be able to nip it in the bud. Those honourable members who vote for the Eill must accept the responsibility of setting up a new Department, which, according to Part III . , may possibly embrace at least seven sub-departments. I hope we shall be able to take a broad national view of the matter; and, in dealing with each clause, I trust honourable members will «ee just how far the States have gone in doing the work which the Commonwealth is now seeking to embark upon. We should allow the States to proceed on the lines they have already followed, while promising them every assistance; and, if that is done, I am sure it will lead to the gratification of the people as a whole.",27
35,Dr MALONEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Melbourne) [4.19] I regret the remarks of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), though of course, in the initiation of a large and important institution there may be many matters worthy of critiorganization cism. It is - true that the various States are conducting experiments on lines similar to those which will be undertaken by a Commonwealth Institute of Science not more than £1,000 per annum. and Industry,' but we ought to remember the many schools of surgery and medicine which are operating in England. It is the rival investigations of the universipaid ties of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales which serve to stimulate those bodies to higher and greater efforts. and Science must rule in this present day. The old time of bows, arrows, and stitute, spears has gone by the board, if utilizing I may use a war-time allusion. The machine gun would mow them down own in thousands. In the old days grappling irons were used in the course of naval encounters. Only in comparatively recent years have boarding pikes been abolished in the British Navy. To-day it is not much the rank and file of the men on our ships as the one controlling brain which counts. And so it is in the matter scientific application to agriculture. Only the other day the Minister for Trade Customs (Mr Greene) informed me that conhe would cable to England to ascertain particulars following on an intimation in the press that a new variety of wheat had been discovered which would give more than ninety bushels to the acre. We know how lucky a. farmer feels today if he can average twenty-five bushels for three years. Would we not be a wealthy community if our farmers could secure a return of ninety bushels to the acre ? The honourable member for New England (Mr . Hay), and the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) delivered speeches on this subject which are well worthy of perusal if honourable members failed to hear them. Those honourable members spoke of the benefits accruing from experiments in the growth of wheat. Scientists tp-day are hopeful of producing a ' variety which will contain elements such as to eliminate the need for eating meat. The time may come when we shall all be grain eaters, and will have forsaken the eating of flesh foods. How much would thickly populated Europe give today if it could only obtain additional territory equal to that in Australia which has been rendered useless by the prickly pear ? Do what we will, that pest is extending, and only science can arrest its progress. In inaugurating this important new we must closely watch expenditure. It is my intention to move, in respect of the salary to be paid the Director of the Institute, that it shall be I want to see established in Australia the principle that the salary paid to a member' of Parliament shall be the highest to any head of a Department. ' I intend to vote for this Bill . I hope expect great results from it . The central body should be the Commonwealth In linking up with State activities and them for particular experimental and investigation purposes within their States. A central body established in Melbourne cannot as satisfactorily carry out investigations, for example, in the north of Queensland as could a body established in that State. But the Comso monwealth Bureau should be the dominant authority, linking up each and all of the States. Moreover, the Government of should have the power to put before the central body specific questions of policy. and A sum of £5,000 has been spent upon rain stimulating experiments, which most people laugh at. Before such an outlay was agreed upon the actual question itself should have been placed before some such scientific and expert authority as the Institute will become. This should have been done before Mr Balsillie was permitted to fool away £5,000. Our manufacturers are suffering today from certain striking disabilities. They may not own the machines with which they are working, but are only permitted to rent them. The central authority should be asked some such questions as these:-""Are these patented machines necessary' to carry on Australian industrial life? If so, what do you suggest to protect the manufacturer and the public from these trusts and combines which hold the patentrights and are thus prolific of trouble and expense to Australian industry ?"" - Sir ROBERT BEST (Kooyong) [4.29] - If any honourable member my doubted which way he should vote and' upon this measure he should have I been persuaded to vote in its favour i as the outcome of the speech of value the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton). The honourable member furnished some of the most cogent reasons why the Bill , as introduced, should passed. His great point was that the measure would bning about still further overlapping; he enumerated several in stances where that occurs throughout States today. He pointed to the fact that experts in several of the States are engaged in branches of research and are actually performing a similar class work. That indicates a waste of energy and a serious amount of overlapping. The very object of the Bill is to prevent The Director is told by the Bill that must co-operate with existing organizaliament tions throughout Australia, with to preventing unnecessary overlapping. There must be complete control in . matter of co-operation and co-ordination.",29
36,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"The Commonwealth has complete control over quarantine, but after the States had agreed that the monwealth should be supreme they all ties broke away last year.",30
37,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"That may have been so, but the point is not really cogent to my argument. The very essence of this measure is co-operation with respect scientific research. The best results can achieved only by co-operation. The eral Institute, so far as possible, should undertake general supervision and be in a .position to direct and assist the several States along the lines in which their energies should be bent. If there is a supervising and co-ordinating authority, such as this measure proposes, there will be effective results. The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) referred to one point on which we disagree. It would be ringing the death knell of a scientific institution, such as is here proposed, if salaries were to be limited in the manner suggested by the honourable member. Such limitation would at once preclude all hope of our securing the best men.",30
38,Mr GABB,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,I call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.},30
39,Mr GABB,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Angas) [ 4 . 3 5 ] - I realise responsibility in regard to this Bill , I take this opportunity of saying that shall oppose this andevery other clause n it , not because I do not appreciate the of scientific research, or that I do not know that if we have not an Institute of this kind we shall be out of step with other countries, but for two definite be reasons. The first is that the House has been given mo estimate of the cost of the proposed Department. According to the - Age, the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) is the supposed to have promised an amount of £500,000 for the fitting out of the Institute. The Minister in charge of the measure (Mr Greene) stated last week that certain requests for money had been of made, but had been refused by the Government because the creation of the In stitute had not been sanctioned by Parlia that. ment. I am glad that the Minister took he that stand, but it is clear that once Parhas given its sanction to this a view scheme, many and large requests for money will be made. My second ground the for objection is the danger of overlapping. If any assurance had been given to us that there would be no overlapping, . the fears of many of us would he removed. But we find today that there is Comoverlapping of State and Federal activii n regard to the collection of taxation, and I am certain that if a Federal Institute of Science and Industry is established, wot one of the States will surrender its Scientific Departmentwillingly - and to with the consent of those who are embe ployed in it . The honourable member for FedKooyong (Sir Robert Best) said that the statement made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), that the different States were already doing this work, was a good argument for the establishment of a Federal Institute. would agree with the honourable member - for Kooyong if there were any guarantee that ths whole of the work would be concentrated in the Commonwealth establishment. But the very wording of clause 10, which provides that the Director shall co-Oiperate with the existing State organizations "" as f ar as possible,"" is an admission of doubt that co-ordination will take place. I am well aware that the Commonwealth cannot make a mandatory provision that the States shall co-operate, cut my littie experience of Federal Departments convinces me that the establishment of this Institute will lead to a tremendous increase in expenditure, and I desire to save myself from the risk of future reproach by opposing the measure on the grounds that we have no estimate of the cost and no assurance, other than a pious resolution, that there will be no overlapping.",30
40,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Y a r r a ) [ 4 . 4 2 ] on the motion for the second reading that the success of this Institute would depend largely, if nob entirely, upon the type of man appointed as Director-whethe r he was a practical or theoretical man-and I advocated the extension of the existing laboratory rather than the setting up of an entirely new Institute. In the Government Service are two sorts of Departments-the collecting Departments, such as taxation and Customs, which are always very careful as to how money is spent, and other Departments, like Defence, Home and Territories, and the Navy, wLich justify their existence by the amount of money they expend.' This Insti tute will come within the latter category. I quoted last week the letter of resignation of the chairman of the existing Bureau, Professor Orme Masson; I have not yet heard whether his resignation has been accepted or withdrawn. There is a very great obstacle to separating the Institute from .political control, as Professor Masson advocates. There must be parliamentary control of this or any other In stitute, so that there may be a check on its expenditure. Furthermore, there must be co-ordination with the activities of the States. It is within the recollection of honourable members that a conference of State Ministers of Health and their officers with the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) was held in Melbourne in order to evolve a definite plan I of action in connection with the in fluenza epidemic; but as soon as the State Ministers returned to their own States they repudiated the agreement with the Commonwealth. We may pass pious resolutions and express in the Bill fervent hopes for co-ordination, but we shall never achieve it unless we are in the controlling position. Even then there must be a doubt as to whether the States would hand over to the Commonwealth the work they are now doing. The honourable member for Darling (Mr . Blakeley), in the course of an excellent speech on the second reading, pointed out the desirability of the proposed Institute dealing with the problem of venereal disease.",31
41,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,I think that matter comes under the control of the Health Departments.,31
42,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Yes , and each State Health Department will say that it has - I stated complete authority to deal with the problem.",31
43,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,I think there is some coordination in regard to that matter.,31
44,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Yes . A Cabinet of which I was a member placed on the Estimates a sum of £15,000 or £20,000 to be allocated amongst the States for expenditure on the eradication or limitation of venereal disease. To what extent such activities would come under the control of the Institute I do not know. There is room for an establishment such as is proposed, but unless we place in control of it a practical man, not a theorist",31
45,Dr EARLE PAGE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,He should be both.,31
46,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,He must have the theoretical knowledge and the practical experience.,31
47,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,Is it not possible to get such a man without establishing an institute of this kind t,31
48,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) mentioned  who has done excellent work for the Commonwealth during the last ten or twelve years, and who, if given the opportunity, could make a success of the Institute. At . the hack of the Customs House in Melbourne the Commonwealth has the most up-to-date laboratory in Australia, and it is available at the present time for doing Commonwealth work. Honourable members who have not visited the establishment should do so. If any manufacturers' desire that technical work should be carried out for them at the laboratory, they should pay for it . If the technical knowledge of our skilled officers, trained in our own. Service, is placed at the disposal of manufacturers and others for their private profit, it should be paid f and the fact that such knowledge is available should be made known throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. When I was Minister for Trade and Customs, a gentleman came into my office one day with what appeared to be a 2-lb. jam t in , and asked that its contents might be analyzed. I pointed out to him that there were numbers of private analysts, but he said that there was only one man able to analyze this particular product, and that that man was in the service of the Commonwealth. formed me that the t in contained ambergris, which had been collected on one of the Tasmanian islands, and that if it were as valuable as he thought it to be, it was worth about £11,000. I push the claims of no one person, but I do desire the claims of all to be considered, particularly those of our own servants. There are Commonwealth laboratories in State, and these could be enlarged and their usefulness extended. I am very much afraid that if we create a completely new organization we shall have a Department that can only justify its existence by the amount of money it expends; and this would be a most undesirable result.",31
49,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"East Sydney) [ 4 . 5 2 ] - I offer no opposition to this measure; but, perhaps, I take a view of it different from that of the majority of honourable members. This Bill is introduced under peculiar circumstances, as an effort to honour a sort of promissory note which was given by the Prime Minister, amongst a lot of other similar documents, at the general election. I take it that the Bill will result in the establishment of a National In stitute of Science and Industry, which may lead to a co-operation of the States and the abolition of the State institutions as we know them at present. There is no doubt that a central laboratory is required to investigate and value our copper, iron, and other natural products with which Australia is bountifully supplied, but which are as yet littl e developed. I feel sure that the States, in view of their financial position, will have to curtail seme of their activities, thus making way for central Commonwealth action. I regard an Institute of this kind as a national affair, and the creation of it ought to have the support of every honourable member. , There have been objections raised on both sides on the score of the cost; but I subo r ; mit that money spent in this way is very wisely spent, whether in the interests of the man on the land, on the mine-field, or in the manufactory; anv efforts that result in ascertaining the true value of our natural wealth must prove of benefit to the country. The States hitherto have not assisted the Commonwealth in centralizing many activities; but the blame for ' this lies less with the State Governments than with the Commonwealth Government. For some years we have not had a Commonwealth Government with the' He in - courage to stand up against the States for the benefit of the people; indeed, the Commonwealth Governments have been like puppets in the hands of the States. From 1910 to 1913 the Labour Government of the Commonwealth had to face the opposition of the States to the ""founding of the Commonwealth Bank, the creation of the note issue, and other proposals. every There has been no Commonwealth Government for some years capable of bringing pressure to bear on the States so as to lead to the creation of a National Institute of Science and Industry, and it is very much to be regretted that we should have proved so weak in this connection. Dav after day we have Bills of a similar character to this, all showing the lack of co-ordination and co-operation as between the States and the Commonwealth, and that lack must continue u n t i l the Government asserts itself; when it does do this I feel sure the people will approve. I offer no opposition to this Bill , which, in my opinion, will render it impossible for the States to decline to part with any of their existing powers on the ground, that the Commonwealth has made .no provision for exercising them in a national way. I am not. troubling myself about the merits or demerits of this .particular measure, because I am only too pleased to see one of such a character before us, with an object so necessary and desirable.

50,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Grampians) [5.12] I move That after the word ""Director,"" in subclause (1 ) , the words ""and also of six local councils, each council to be representative of each State,"" be inserted. The object of the amendment is to insure that the Institute, when founded, shall obtain the hearty sympathy and cooperation of the best scientific minds and of the leaders of industry in its various . . 30 forms throughout Australia, and to in. . 13 sure also that the State Governments shall co-operate with the Commonwealth Government to insure its success. With17 out this co-operation and enchaining of sympathy, the Institute, if it does not hecome an absolute failure, will, 1 fear, f all very short of the desires of Parliament and of the requirements of the people. The issue raised by the amendment is fundamental. Should the clause be carried as it stands, and the amendment circulated by the Minister for the insertion of clause 4 A be inserted, the Director, subject, of course, to the Minister, would be the sole repository of power and authority, and he would be chosen, not by representatives of the best scientific and industrial minds of Australia, but by the Commonwealth Government. cast no reflection on the judgment of this Government or of the Minister, or on their capacity for choosing a Director, nor have I say in disparagement qualifications of any. gentleman who may be in the minds of Ministers or of honourable members as suitable for the position.",33
51,Dr EARLE PAGE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,Would the cillors be paid ?,34
52,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"That is a comparatively minor matter, which need not be discussed at the present moment.",34
53,Dr EARLE PAGE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,Would they be Government servants ?,34
54,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Not unless they happened to be Government officials when chosen to act as councillors. In many cases, no doubt, they would be State officials; but they would be persons chosen or nominated for the position, and would be thoroughly representative of the best scientific and industrial thought of the States.",34
55,Mr BOWDEN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Do you propose to make the councils part of the body corporate that it is proposed to establish ? Mr JOWETT.""-Yes ; they would be an essential part of the Institute.",34
56,Mr MARRS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"The honoiable member's proposal would really take the place of clause 4 B , which the Minister intends to move, but would be compulsory, while the Minister's is optional.",34
57,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Thes e local councils would be in addition to the Institute, and could not perform the work that it is desired to have done.",34
58,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"If the Minister will permit me to unfold my views on the subject, he will, I think, recognise that that is not so. I have used the words "" local councils"" instead of "" State councils"" bo indicate that the councils will not be representative merely of the State Governments. What the Committee has to consider is whether it will adopt a course which will enlist the sympathy and support of the best scientific and industrial minds of each State, and so of the whole of Australia, or one which will , to some extent, discourage that sympathy and support. If a dictator be appointed under the name of director, who at his own sweet will and caprice may make appointments to the Advisory Council, or r e f r a in from doing so, that is likely I to discourage sympathy and support. D u r i ng the war I had considerable experience of the workings of bodies constituted in various fashions, and I say anything to unhesitatingly that a government-apof the "" pointed dictator who could ignore or recognise the scientific opinion of Australia just as he thought f it would, to some extent, diminish the usefulness of the In stitute. My proposal is to establish local councils representative of the best sciencountific opinion. The election or nomination of the Director should be made by delegates from the six local councils.",34
59,Mr BOWDEN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,Would not the tendency of the councils be to oppose the work of the Institute?,34
60,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"No ; quite the opposite. My scheme makes full provision for the various State Departments to be represented on the local councils, and each local council will choose its best men to be its delegates to the Central Council. If the Minister wishes to obtain the warm-hearted and cordial support of the best minds in Australia from the very beginning, he w i j l not do it by depriving them of all sense of responsibility.",34

64,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"If the honourable member thinks it important, I shall answer his question. In all probability, the members of the local councils will be connected with some university, or a Government Department, or with some Chamber of Mines, Chamber of Pastoralists, or Chamber of Manufactures, and will probably be already in receipt of a considerable income. It will not be necessary, therefore, to pay them high salaries in connection with their duties on these local councils. Possibly they could be remunerated as the members of the Advisory Council have been, with a fee for each sitting, and something to recoup them for out-of-pocket expenses. However, if men of such distinguished ability are given some measure of power and responsibility, I am sure they will be quite agreeable to do the work without pay. In any case, they will be quite satisfied with a guinea or two guineas for each sitting.",34
65,Mr RYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,Does the honourable member suggest that the appointments shall be made by the States?,35
66,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"That is a matter to which I have given the fullest consideration, and which I shall deal with later on. My amendment to this clause' merely deals with the suggestion. I have other consequential amendments. have not to interest these gentlemen in science; they will do all they possibly can to increase the cause of science and industry in Australia, but if we are desirous of getting the best out of them, we must handle them diplomatically. A man will not get the best out of his agent or representative by ignoring him every day.",35
67,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,How many bers will comprise the-proposed Council?,35
68,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"There would be a local council for each State, that - is, six in all, and there may be any number on each local council.",35
69,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,The proposal utterly impracticable. The Institute is to be a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal.,35
70,Mr RYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"That is to say, mutandis.",35
71,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Give n ample notice, and my own time, I dare say I could carry on a conversation with the honourable member for West Sydney in the language he has used, but on the floor of this House, and within the limits of debate, it is impossible for me to do so.",35
72,Mr RYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,I was merely agreeing with the point raised by the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best).,35
73,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"If my amendment be inconsistent with the language of the Bill , the measure can be altered to make it consistent. The honourable member for Kooyong proclaims himself as the most impracticable man in the world if he makes the suggestion that there is any[124]- 2 thing impracticable in the proposition to have six local councils.",35
74,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,It is fair to say that previous Government Bills contained provision for the appointment of State A d visory Councils.,35
75,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Yes ; but they did not propose to make the State Advisory Councils part of the Institute. In that respect, the honourable member's proposal is entirely novel.",35
76,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"It may be novel. I am not prepared to follow slavishly word for word any proposal previously made: There are people in Australia who are quite as capable of constructing schemes that will work as there are in any other part of the world. I claim that my proposal is a better conception than that which was set for t h in previous Bill s ; at any rate, it would be more workable, We and more likely to achieve the result desired by the Minister and honourable members generally. The experience of the working of the Institute during the last few years has proved conclusively that the best scientific and industrial men of Australia have not been satisfied to remain mere dummies under a political Department. In fact, they have made their protests in the most effective mem- way, almost all of them, by resigning.",35
77,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,Not most of them.,35
78,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,A considerable number of them have resigned.,35
79,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Ou t of the lot, there were only three effective resignations. is Mr JOWETT - I know that some resignations were reconsidered.",35
80,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Les s than half of them resigned in the first place. mutatis Mr JOWETT - Perhaps not as a body, but from time to time a considerable number of very important members have resigned as a protest against being practically dummies under a political head.",35
81,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,The brains of the Council have thrown the scheme overboard.,35
82,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"I am not prepared to cast reflections on those who have not resigned, but very important and highly distinguished members of the Council did resign, because they were not prepared to be dummies under a political head. If this Committee decides to obliterate all representation of the best scientific thought on the Institute, it will be establishing a bureaucracy and a dictatorship which, by some happy chance, may prove M effective, but which, in all probability, is not so likely to be so.",35
83,Mr BOWDEN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,How can the Institute operate if there are to be six councils with all of their members scattered the length and breadth of Australia?,36
84,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"If there be one thing above all others required in connection with the Institute it is that it shall not be centralized either in Melbourne Canberra or anywhere else. Its bers should be drawn from all over tralia. Their field of operations, in fact, should cover the whole of the States.",36
85,Mr BOWDEN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"But what would happen when it became necessary to call members of the Institute together in order to sign a contract, for example? Would all these various people require to councils from each State. travel from all over Australia to the central office?",36
86,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Certainl y not. If the Director is to be given power to do and authorize certain things, as set forth twenty persons in each locality. in the Bill, may he not sign contracts? And if, under the Bill, he is to have power, then, with my amendment emis to form the Institute. bodied, he would still retain that power. If you desire that the Institute shall a success, there must be some form representation of the State Departments which today are carrying on somewhat similar investigations and experiments the Institute will undertake; and, as as possible, there should be on the tive work. Institute effective representation each State. There is no effective sentation proposed in the Bill. a Director is to be appointed without the which are at issue. Government asking the advice or counsel of any one else, either individually or as a body, then .po'wer will be given to Director to create his own advisory counof cil. The members of these various State councils, when appointed, will be asked ever they are to meet. to render enthusiastic service and assistthe ance; but they are to be given no share in the responsibility for the Institute, in the initial important task of appoint- £3 3s. a day. ing its Director. They will find themselves at the sweet will of a dictator aption. pointed by the Government. That is not the way to insure the interest co-operation of Australian scientists. ment means. Local councils should be appointed, and these should have some say in the selecan tion of. a Director, seeing that that person will be their guide and chief. There is in every State of Australia today a university, each, I understand, well equipped and possessing men of scientific over knowledge and attainments.",36

88,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Kooyong) or [5.43] - I interjected, when the honormemable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) Auswas speaking, that his amendment was utterly impracticable. I propose to indicate why it is so. The honourable member has stated that the intention be the hind his amendment !is that the Institute should consist, not only of a Director, but of certain local advisory The number of members :to be appointed to each of these councils was not mentioned. They are, apparently, to be an indefinite number totalling, perhaps, from five to The Director, together with this indefinite such number of members of State councils, This body, having been constituted, will find itself be in such a position that the simplest conof tract cannot be entered into, nor the smallest job undertaken, unless and until the whole of the members of the Institute as have been called together. It would far prove too unwieldy for proper execuThe fact is that the of Institute will be unable to act until repreits members have been called together If to consider the points, great or small, Let us suppose that there are ten members of each council. The'Institute, then, will comprise be that tween sixty and seventy persons. All these will have to be notified and their expenses paid to Melbourne, or to wherI n addition to item of travelling expenses, the members of the Institute, I presume, will be or entitled to fees amounting to £2 2s. or",36
89,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,That is not my inten,36

92,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"The honourable member, then, wants to substitute one individual for a selected body of men. The Bill does that more effectively than his amendment. I call his attention to the phrase in the Bill, "" which shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal, and capable of suing and being sued."" Mr JowETT.^That phrase could be left out.",37
93,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"It cannot, or certainly should not be left out. scheme propounded by the amendment will not only prove utterly impracticable, but, at the same time, most expensive. If - the duties and responsibilities of the In stitute are to be delegated to'the Director",37
94,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"No ; only in respect of such matters as the signing of contracts and o^ other small considerations, which would not necessitate the calling together of the full membership of the Institute.",37
95,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,It is not the signing of contracts that is so important as the matter of the Institute first deliberating on the question which involves the signing of a contract. I only mentioned contracts as a simple instance.,37
96,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"The honourable member's objections are frivolous and technical, and could be overcome in ' redrafting the Bill.",37
97,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"If the honourable member had any knowledge of kindred institutions he would not speak as he is doing. My objections are not frivolous, but arc of absolute substance, and particularly so from a legal standpoint. All that the honourable member seeks to obtain could be secured by the proposal of the Minister (Mr Greene). It is very desirable that there should be local councils, so that the Institute shall work in conjunction with them. original Bill contained a proposal for the establishment of councils to consist of three members each; but these members were not to form the membership of the Bureau or Institute. - Mr JOWETT - They had no power, and, therefore, they resigned.",37
98,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"I may be making a mistake, but"" I believe that suggestions of the kind now being propounded by the honourable member are identical with those which have been so favourably entertained by the professors themselves. These latter gentlemen are naturally exasperated because the Government are determined upon the appointment of practical industrial scientists to the various positions. I have the highest personal regard for our University professors, for whose studies in the realms of pure science we should all be prepared to extend our appreciation.",37
99,Mr RYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"What does the honourable member suggest that these professors want? The Sir ROBERT BEST - They want, of course, to dominate the Institute.",37
100,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,They want all their own way.,37
101,Mr RYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,Does the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) say that that is what is underlying the amendment ?,37
102,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,I do not know at whose instance the honourable member proposed the amendment.,37
103,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,At my own instance. I am not a tool to be .put forward by other people.,37
104,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,The honourable member's amendment is singularly in harmony with the aspirations of the University professors.,37
105,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"I have some respect for them, anyhow.",37
106,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"So have I , . in their own sphere. At the same time, if we are to get solid, practical work from the Institute, it must be constituted of practical industrial scientists, men with a knowledge of industry. The University professors have taken offence at the terms of this Bill, because it is not the class of measure that they contemplated. But I congratulate the Government on their determination that the Institute shall be constituted of practical men. The Mr Ryan - If there is any evidence that the professors wanted to get control of the Institute we should hear it .",37
107,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"The local councils proposed by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) would give control to the University professors. They dominate the existing Advisory Council, and the work performed by that body has not been completely satisfactory so far as practical results are concerned. No industries seem to have benefited largely by any advice offered by the council; work haa been of a theoretical rather than of a practical character. have not a word to say against the professors in their own line of .pure scientific research, but I say that their University qualifications do not necessarily make them capable of undertaking the work we hope to achieve under this Bill. Nothing I say must be regarded as any reflection upon them and their distinguished services at their several Universities. But an Institute such as is proposed must have help from every source, and its best energies must be applied in an industrial direction. Therefore amendment, which aims at making the Institute more representative, is not only impracticable, but would be very expensive. The same results can be more effectively achieved by the constitution of local councils of an advisory character as have been suggested by the Minister.",37
108,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [5.55] - I do not propose to touch upon the points so ably dealt with by the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) in regard to the impracticability of the scheme suggested by the honourable member '""or Grampians (Mr Jowett). The honourable member has not sufficiently appreciated what would be the effect of incorporating in the body corporate with perpetual succession various bodies scattered all over Australia and comprising an indefinite number of men.",38
109,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"""The Bill which the Government introduced into the Senate made that proposal.",38
110,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"That Bill proposed to constitute an Institute from three directions, and then there were to be certain Advisory Councils in addition, but they were not to be part of the body corporate, which constituted the legal entity of the Institute.",38
111,Mr RYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,That is what the honourable member for Grampians says was the defect of that Bill.,38
112,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,Exactly . honourable member for Grampians admitted that this proposal to include the six Advisory Councils in the body corporate of the Institnte itself was entirely novel.,38
113,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"I was told so, and lieved so until a few moments ago when I read the earlier Bill which the Governis ment introduced into the Senate. I Mr Considine - We might as well have a quorum. [Quorum formed.]",38
114,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"What I and the honourable member desire is to secure the cooperation! of scientific men, both theoretical and practical, in carrying out the work which the Institute will have to perform. The whole question is how best to secure that co-operation without overloading the Institute with expenditure, and how to direct its energies into the channels in which they are most required'. The experience of the Advisory Council to the date has been this: Perhaps an engineering question was before the Council; it was a small body, and there was no engineering scientist on it . Or, the question may have been one of agricultural science, and there wa3 no member of the Council particularly qualified to deal wibh it . The Council found that in dealing with specific 1 problems it was necessary to call in: those special scientists whose particular province it was to study that matter. The men who have been doing the real investigatory work of the Institute in many instances have not been the members of the Council. I do not care how representative the Council is made, - science is so highly specialized that it is impossible to place on the Council all the men who may be required to deal wi'h the scientific problems that will arise. I have given notice of an addition to clause 4 which will be moved as a new clause, and which will incorporate ini the measure what was the definite intention of the Government as to the way in which the In stitute should operate. The Institute will comprise a Bureau of Agriculture, a Bureau of Industry, and such other bureaux as the Governor General determines from time to time. One of those other bureaux might be one to deal with forestry. Of course, it will be necessary to appoint a definite head to the Bureau of Agriculture and, similarly, to the Bureau of Industry. Then we shall p r o vide that tha Governor General may apThe point Advisory Boards to advise the Director in regard to the general business of the Institute. That, I take it, will mean a gathering of scientists drawn, from many branches of science, and convened' from time to time to consult with be the Director as to the general scope of the work to be undertaken. Also, power to be taken for the appointment of a Council in) regard to any Bureau thereof. In connection with the Bureau of Agriculture, for instance, the Director carrying out the functions of the Institute, in cooperation with the States, would naturally call together om the Board, first and foremost, the scientists associated with the State Agricultural Departments. It does not necessarily mean that the Advisory Board will be confined to such heads of State Departments. There might be other eligible men occupying chairs ot agriculture at the universities, or experts in veterinary science, who might be called ini to form the nucleus of an Advisory Council. In that way we shall secure all the men required tute a scientific body of dealing with particular questions. What is the use of having an advisory council composed of engineers to deal with the question of agriculture? The scheme of the Government is to secure, by the appointment of advisory councils, the assistance and cooperation of the scientific men of Australia for dealing with the specific problems that the Institute will have to consider from time to time. I believe that that will not only secure the effective working of the Institute it self, but will prevent the tendency, which has been noticed up to the present, of distributing the energies of the Institute over a great number of subjects, some of which are, perhaps, more urgent than others.",38
115,Mr GABB,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,I again have to draw attention to the state of the [Quorum formed.'],39
116,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"What we are proposing will do exactly what the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) desires. It will be the means of securing the co-operation of our scientific men, and it will do so in a way which will enable them to concentrate on the particular scientific problems with which they are intimate. It will not call together a body of scientists who may not be conversant with the branches with which their fellow-members are familiar; but it will bring together, in co-operation with the Government on each specific problem as it arises, the best men it is possible to obtain. I bave discussed the Government's proposals with those interested, and I do not think we will have the slightest difficulty in securing, with the exception pcssibly of two or three men, the whole-hearted co-operation of the scientists of the Commonwealth. I hope the honourable member for Grampians will not press his amendment.",39
117,Mr BLUNDELL,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Adelaide) [6.10]. - I intend to support the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) in the amendment he has moved, because it is an effort to secure cooperation with the States. I admit that the amendment may be open to the charge that it gives the advisory councils a power which the Government may be justified in objecting to, on the ground that it might mean creating perpetual bodies. If that is. the objection, it is one that can easily be overcome to consti- Mr JOWETT - That is not the procapable posal.",39
118,Mr BLUNDELL,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,I agree with the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) that the amendment will be the means of creating in each State a body with administrative powers.,39
119,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"If the honourable member does not propose to make them a part of the corporate body, the amendment of which I have given notice will do all that is needed.",39
120,Mr BLUNDELL,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"I do not think so. The amendment is doing the very thing that I object to, as it provides that the Institute shall comprise, for instance, a Bureau of Agriculture. Where is that to' come from ? Is it to be in Victoria, where there is already a Bureau of A g r i culture? If we say we shall establish forthwith a Bureau of Agriculture, it House - means that we shall have in Victoria a second bureau, and that is a serious objection. We have to realise that, not only in this State, but in other States of the Commonwealth, bureaux of agriculture are already established, and are doing splend d work. Instead of having others we should use these institutions in conjunction with the activities of the Federal Government, which would be able to deal with more important questions that are not of State interest, but rather of Federal concern.",39
121,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,That is what is proposed.,39
122,Mr BLUNDELL,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"The Bill provides that bureaux of agriculture ""shall"" be established, but in another portion of the measure relating to co-operation, the word "" may "" is used where "" s h all "" should be employed. We should not agree to the establishment of new Departments when effective work is already being accomplished in every State, but should use those agencies which are available. - Mr MARRS - It reads "" s h a ll when necessary.""",39
123,Mr BLUNDELL,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,If the Bureau of Agriculture is to be successful it is necessary that it shall co-operate with the State bureaux already established. It is for us to find some means of co-operation to prevent additional and unnecessary expense. When I was a Minister in South Australia it was the practice to co-operate with the Commonwealth Government under an arrangement whereby the State bureau was utilized. A member of the advisory council visited Melbourne from time to time to consult with the representatives of the Commonwealth.,40
124,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,That was not statutory.,40

We all recognise the necessity for such an Institute: but we must also realise that it is undesirable,, in view of our financial obligations, to establish costly Departments that will be antagonistic to those already in existence. This Government may be quite prepared to co-operate with the States; but we have to remember that we are not legislating for this year or next year, and that it is quite possible that a few years hence a Government may be in power that will be in favour of establishing their own Departments in all the States. At the present time, I believe, there are some honourable members who think that the Commonwealth should ignore the States altogether, and in dealing with legislation of this character we have to remember that its administration may be in the hands of men whose opinions may be totally opposed to ours. - The new clause of which the Minister has given notice sets out the functions of the new Department, and the moment a Director realizes that he has the power to appoint he will do so.",40

I intend to support the amendment of the honourable member for Grampians, although I think it goes too far. I ask the Minister to postpone the consideration of this clause, as he will then have an opportunity of carefully considering the amendment. This is not a party question, but one on which every honourable member is anxious to do the right thing.",40
130,Mr BRUCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Flinders) [6.19] - The proposal before the Committea seems to be the antithesis of the proposal actually in the Bill . The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) suggests that it is not very difficult to amend the clause, and that possibly the Minister for Trade and Customs may be prepared to do so. To me it seems absolutely impossible when one considers the nature of the amendment and the principle underlying it. The Bill provides for the appointment of a central body, which happens to be one individual, to We should control, direct, and organize scientific effort. The proposal of the honourable member for Grampians is that we shall not have a central body, but that the members of the controlling body shall be scattered over the whole Commonwealth. That is absolutely out of the question",40

132,Mr BRUCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"I am sorry if I have done so. I have perused the amendment, and I have also listened to the honourable member's explanation, and I cannot see that it has any other meaning. I realise that the honourable member has been persistent throughout in suggesting that he is not creating an unwieldy body which would not easily be brought together and able to come to a dec'sion; but I suggest he is totally wrong When he makes that statement.",40

He has told us frankly that there are to be six State advisory bodies. not the Mr Ryan - Do I understand the honourable member to suggest that the position is not clear ?,40
135,Mr BRUCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"I think it is absolutely clear; but, apparentlv my reading of the position is not the reading of the proposer of the amendment. I understand there are to be six advisory committers or councils, which, together with Director, are to constitute a body corporate. These State3 are scattered far apart, and, no doubt, the individual members of the proposed body will live at long distances from one another. How such a body will be able to act with any celeritv, or any definite purpose, is quite beyond me to understand. It seems to me an entirely wrong principle that is embodied in the amendment; and for that reason I shall most certainly vote against it . I suggest that the matter cannot be dealt with in the manner suggested by the amendment, which involves a re-casting of the principle of the Bill .",40
136,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,If the amendment is carried it will mean that the whole Bill will have to be re-cast.,41
137,Mr BRUCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,Absolutely-a n entirely new principle is introduced.,41
138,Mr RYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"That would be in conformity with the suggestion of the honourable member for Calar© (Mr LaveHle), to withdraw and re-cast the Bill .",41
139,Mr BRUCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,That possibly is so; but I was not accusing the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) of such subtlety in: his tactics. against the Bill ; but up to the time he made his suggestion I was under the im>pression that his idea was to honestly try to improve it .,41
140,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,I wish to make f t a good Bill now.,41
141,Mr BRUCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"I think that out of his own mouth the honourable member has shown that his mind has not the subtle agility of the mind of another honourable member who has just interpccted. TVc points that have been raised in the discussion certainly require a great deal of consideration; but, personallv, I cannot see that we can possibly come into line under this amendment. It is essential and imperative, as pointed out, that we should have the co-operation of the best scientific minds in Australia, and also the co-operation of the States' various Departments. It is also a question for the consideration of the House whether one man should, form this body corporate, or whether there should be more. In the original Bill the number was three; and the number is a matter for direct amendment. It seems to me, however, that whatever is done, we must have a central body of a limited number, and provide that the man or men selected shall command the respect of the community, parthe ticularly of the scientific section and theleaders of industry. If this body acts with reasonable tact we shall get far better results from an advisory council than: we could get by creating a great unwieldy body which certainly, in my opinion, would not give that scientific in vestigation which is hoped for under this amendment.",41

In deference to my honourable friend, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Burchell), I shall withdraw the word ' ' misrepresentation "" and substitute the word "" m is understanding.""

149,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,But not to exactly the same terms.,42
150,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"That is so. But it must not be forgotten that when the measure was before the Senate it contained provision for the establishment of an advisory council in each State. Though the creation of the Institute of Science and In dustry has never heen definitely authorized, there has been established in each State at least one advisory council, and the honourable member for Grampians, I understand, wishes to restore that provision in this Bill .",42
151,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,To some extent.,42
152,Mr BOWDEN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"He desires to make the Considine, M. P. advisory councils a part of the Institute. Cunningham, L. L.",42
153,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"I cannot agree with Gabb, J. M. him. I should like to know why the GoMahony, W. G. vernment have discarded the State adMakin, N. J. O. visory councils for which the Bill contained provision when it was before us upon two or three previons occasions.",42
154,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"The position, roughly, is Bowden, E. K. that the work upon which these scientific Cameron, D. C. men will be required to co-operate, boils Cook, Sir Joseph down to specific subjects, and we believe Cook, that it is better to make provision in the Fowler, J. M. Bill which will enable us to call upon Francis, F. H. them to co-operate in respect of particular Gibson, W. G. problems than to establish a general counGreene, W. M. cil. But provision is made for the estabHiggs, W. G. lishment of a general council in regard to Hill, the central area.",42
155,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"I think that the view Jowett, E. taken by the Government is the correct one, because only specialists and highlytrained men will undertake independent investigations, .and these men may be hampered rather than helped by the creaentered tion of State advisorv councils. In judgment, the amendment of the honorber able member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) is not calculated to assist the Institute, and I regret, therefore, that I shall be not my obliged to vote aga'nst it .",42
156,Mr CONSIDINE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Barrier ) [8.10] That progress be reported. I do so as a protest against the high handed and arbitrary action of the Go- vernment in prohibiting the public from coming to this assembly this evening.

I think that the Committee is willin g to hear the honourable member, and I suggest that he be given permission to continue his remarks. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN "" (Mr .

191,Mr BRENNAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"I rise to a point of order. I wanted to raise a question of privilege a while ago- On the of privilege and order. I wish to direct attention to certain standing orders reAs lating to the matter. Standing 111 statesAn urgent motion, directly concerning the privileges of the House, shall take precedence of other motions, as well as of Orders of Day. Standing order 283 saysAny member may rise to speak "" to order,"" or upon a matter of privilege suddenly arisI ing. Standing order 284 providesAll questions of order and matters of lege at any time arising shall, until decided, House. suspend the consideration and decision of other question'. There is no reference to the powers duties of the Committee of the House, but I submit that the Committee is for the time' being the guardian of the priMatters vileges of the House, and that a matter of privilege suddenly arising, as it has chair. in this case, must be decided as the standing order provides in of every other matter. A little while ago I rose to put this point, but before I was able to ,put it the Treasurer (S ir Joseph Cook), with characteristic discourtesy, plunged in and interrupted me. I ask the Temporary Chairman (Mr . Watkins) to take counsel with those who AYES. may be presumed to know something about the matter, and without any disrespect I suggest that the point I raise is unanswerably in favour of my being able to bring forward any question of privilege, and submit it for the i m mediate decision of the Committee; because the matter to which I refer is very urgent, and because I think the Committee would be careful to be the guardian of its own rights-and privileges. W it h ithe military and the secret service of the police surrounding us, I should say that the matter is an urgent one, if NOES. ever there was such a thing, requiring immediate decision.",45

219,Dr MALONEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Melbourne) [9.41] I hope the Minister will reconsider his decision, because he knows that if the Director's salary is fixed it will be a difficult matter for Parliament to deal with it in the Estimates. I can call to mind one instance bearing upon' this particular matter. When the salary of the Governor General was under discussion in - an Enabling Bill in the Victorian Parliament, the provision that the salary "" shall not be less than £10,000 "" was altered by striking out the word ""less"" and inserting "" m o r e "" with the result that when'New South Wales endeavoured to increase the amount to £20,000, it was unable to do so because the Victorian Act limited the sum to £10,000. As Parliament will be blamed for anything that may be done in connection with this Bill, it would be wise to retain the right to determine the salary.",49
220,Mr RYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,As in the case of the Judges.,49
221,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Maribyrnong) [9.42] The Minister's contentionappears to me to be very weak, because I take it that the Director will be appointed at a fixed salary of, 6ay, £1,000, for a term of five years. If Parliament stepped in and re-duced the salary to £750 a year, the Director would have his remedy against the Government for breach of contract, be[Quorum cause if he were a sensible man he would have his contract in black and white bedo fore he accepted the appointment. I am against the Bill absolutely, but I shall vote for the amendment in order to secure parliamentary control.",49
222,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Minister for Trade and Customs-Richmond ) [9.43] - I hope the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Ryan) will not press his amendment, because if the Institute is to be a success it is very advisable that the Government of the day should have the fullest scope in the selection of the best-man obtainable, subject to that control which Parliament exercises over the Estimates ",49
223,Mr RYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,Do you propose to obtain a Director by inviting applications?',49
224,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Yes , in the usual way.",49
225,Mr RYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"But you will not ask applicants to "" state salary required,"" will you?",49
226,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"It will be largely a matter of negotiation in order to get the very best man available, and, therefore, the greatest latitude should be given to the Government. I ask that the amendment be not pressed.",49
227,Mr LAZZARINI,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Werriwa) [9A5]. - I hope that the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) will persist with his amendment, and that it will be supported by those who think that Parliament should have control of the public purse. It is a strange proposal that the Government should be given an absolutely free hand, for whilst the Government are the executive authority, this Parliament has to bear the responsibility, and every individual member will have to take some of the blame for any mistake that is made. The Minister (Mr Greene) said that the salary may be a matter of negotiation; be seems to contemplate a sort of Jewish bargaining. I am opposed to the Bill lock, stock, and barrel; but as an Institute is to be created I shall vote to provide that Parliament shall decide the salary of the Director. If we cannot get a qualified man for the amount fixed we can do without one.  first sight there is a good deal to commend the amendment; but when one considers the matter more closely he must conclude that the clause had better be agreed to as drafted. Australia is at a great disadvantage at the present time as a result of cheeseparing in regard to the services of its experts in all Departments. Other countries are prepared to pay the best for the best, and the sooner Australia adopts that policy the better.",49
228,Mr RYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"I am not suggesting any other policy.  a salary of, say, £1,000 per annum, we shall possibly get a man worth that amount; and if , on the other hand, we fix a salary of £5,000, the appointee might be worth* less. The question of salary had better be lef t open so that the Government may arrange to pay for the value they are to receive. If the Government arrange to pay £10,000 for the right type of expert he might be a very cheap man for a young country like Australia in its developmental stage.",50
229,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Capricornia) [9.50] The amendment might possibly hamper the Government in their choice of a man. They will have to negotiate for somebody, and we hope they will engage the best man available. They might be able by negotiation to get a good man for £4,000 or £5,000 per annum, but that man might not, accept the position if he knew that the arrangement made by the Government was only tentative, and must run the gauntlet of parliamentary approval. If such a man were in the employ of a big company he might prefer to keep his present position rather than run the risk of the contract with the Government being rejected by Parliament. The desire for control by Parliament will be met by the item being placed on the Estimates each year as is the salary of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. If Parl'ament so. desires the salary can be struck out or reduced.",50
230,Mr RYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"West Sydney) [9.52] Honourable members who have opposed the amendment have put forwnrd mutually destructive argument.?. - The Minister (Mr Greene) has explained that the amendment is unnecessary, because the salary must appear upon the Estimates, and be subject to parliamentary approval. On the other hand the  and the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) say that the amendment would hamper .the Government in their choice of a suitable man, because a likely appointee might fear that Parliament would refuse to endorse any contract the Government made with him. I fail to see why it should be impossible for Ministers to successfully negotiate with a competent man provided that Parliament allowed sufficient latitude in regard to salary, as I have no doubt Parliament would. The salaries of the High Court Judges are fixed by Act of Parliament; they are not left to the judgment of the Executive. Whilst in ordinary circumstances I would be prepared to yield to the request of the Minister that the amendment be not pressed, yet in the light of recent experience and my general knowledge of the manner in which the Executive have absolutely ignored Parliament in regard to the expenditure of public moneys, I am not prepared to do that. I am not unmindful of the. fact that as late as the 7th J u ly the Government, without reference to Parliament, issued, a regulation under the War Precautions Act enabling them to pay out of the consolidated revenue losses incurred in the running of ships along the coast under requisition, some of those losses being probably due to the ships having been held up while the seamen's strike was in progress. In view of the fact that the Government are prepared to legislate by Executive minute, and to directly charge upon the people the expenses attendant upon such legislation, while large profits are being made by the shipping companies trading along the coast, and in view of our general knowledge of the manner in which the Executive have abused their powers in connection with the expenditure of public funds, it is high time that we appl cd a: stricter rule and carried out the pledges we made to our constituents to restore to Parliament the control of the public expenditure. two Mr HIGGS (Capricornia) [9.56] The only effect of the amendment would be to disadvantage the Government in the selection of a suitable man. The honourable member for ""West Sydney (Mr. Eyan) does not think for a moment that the House would turn out of office a Government who made a bad appointment; the House never has done that. I favour the Government having latitude in this matter because it is necessary that they should get the very best man available. When the Commonwealth Bank Act was passed it was provided that the Governor General in Council should fix the salary to be paid to the Governor of the Bank.",50
231,Dr MALONEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"He is an absolute sweater, and the honourable member be knows it.",51
232,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"I do not agree honourable member. As soon as it became known that the Government wanted a manager for the Commonwealth Bank be so inserted-put . several of the banking companies called divided. upon their chief officers to say whether or not they intended to apply for the position.

234,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"The company realizes the value of his work, and is prepared to pay. If it was whispered abroad that the Government proposed to secure the services of the chief officer of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company his directors would probably ask him if he intended leaving the service of the company, and in the eivent of an affirmative reply he would probably be asked to terminate his engagement.

The head' of a Government Department should not receive a higher salary than a member of Parliament, as he has not to go before his constituents from time to time. If there is a genuine desire to benefit and protect the country, this or any other Government can bring in a special Bill to provide for the payment of any salary they please, just as they did in the case of the late Chief Justice of Australia, Sir Samuel Griffith, when the late Treasurer (Mr W at t ) submitted a measure for the payment of a pension of £5 a day to that In the same way the sum £4,500 was voted to Lady Bridges. Let us consider the salaries paid to some of the greatest persons mentioned in the world's - history. Pasteur was receiving £200 a year when he made his great discovery, and when he was offered £25,000 to go from Paris to Italy he refused because, he said, other men could do the work.

239,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Capricornia) [10.27] I hope honourable members willagree with me that the Governor General in Council, prowhich is really the Commonwealth Gobe revernment, should have power to suspend the Director for incompetence or misbehaviour. It will be noticed that the clause states that the "" Minister may at any time suspend the Director for incapacity, incompetence, or misbehaviour,"" and in this connection I draw attention to the Inter-State Commission Act, section 9, which is as follows:(1) The Governor General may suspend any Commissioner from office for misbehaviour or incapacity. The Minister shall, within seven days after the suspension, if the Parliament is then sitting, or if the Parliament is .not then sitting, within seven days after the next meeting of the Parliament, cause to he laid before both Houses of the Parliament a full statement of the grounds of suspension. (2) A Commissioner who has been suspended shall be restored to office unless each House of Parliament within forty days after the statement has been laid before it, and in the same session passes an address praying for his removal on the grounds of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. I may also point out that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank holds office during good behaviour for a period of seven years, and is eligible for re-appointment. I am very glad to know that the Minister (Mr Greene) is prepared to accept the amendment about to propose. The clause provides that the Director, if suspended, may be tried by a board of inquiry appointed by the Governor General; but I ask honourable members if any business firm or company with a board of directors would suspend its chief officer and allow him to be tried by a board, bef ore whom there might be laid a pile of evidence as high as the table in this chamber, as has happened in the case of public servants. maintain the prestige and power of the Commonwealth of Australia wherever possible; and I propose to strike out the word "" Minister "" with a view to inserting "" Governor General,"" which, of course, means the Governor General in Council, or, in other words, the Government, and to adopt the words of the Inter-State Commission. Act with regard to a Commissioner. Thus, if the Government wish to suspend the Director, - the Minister must report to the House, which must be satisfied to carry a resolution to the effect that the Director shall be removed from office. I therefore move That the word "" Minister,"" line 1, be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" Governor General,"" and that sub-clauses (2) to (6) be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following sub-clauses:(2) The Minister shall within seven days after the suspension, if the-Parliament is then sitting, or if the Parliament is not then sitting, within seven days after the next meeting of the Parliament, cause to be laid before both Houses of the Parliament a full statement of the grounds of suspension.

260,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Y a r r a ) [10.53] - The Prime Minister has proposed the postponement of the remaining Orders of the Day until after the consideration of notice of motion No. 2, for leave to introduce a Bill for an Act relating to industrial matters. I am most anxious to reach the consideration of that measure, but I direct attention to the fact that, according to the press, the Prime Minister on Saturday last threatened that he would pass the proposed amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Ac t in spite of the opposition of honourable members on this side. I have never known of any opposition to that Bill on the part of honourable members on this side. As a matter of fact, we have been asking for the introduction of the Bill . The adjournment of this House has been moved on more than one occasion to urge an amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act , to permit organizations to get to the Arbitration Court more speedily than they can do under the present law. They are prevented from getting to the Court at the present time. Now, in spite of what the Prime Minister said at Bendigo, he proposes to pass over the notice of motion for the introduction' of the Bill to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act . I understand that he proposes to take only the first reading of the Bill dealing with industrial matters, in order that it may be circulated, and we may consider it to. morrow. Every member of this House is aware that private business is taken first tomorrow, and, if the history of this Parliament repeats itself, we shall be occupied up to 6.30 p.m. with the consideration of that business. As the Bill proposes the adoption of a new principle, I presume that the Prime Minister will not desire that we should go straight on with its consideration, but that we should have an opportunity of considering its provisions. What this Parliament should be most anxious to do is to minimize, as far as possible, the industrial unrest existing at the present time. I agree that the disturbed feeling in the minds of the general community is not confined to Australia, but - is evident in every part of the world. It is nearly impossible to secure a measure that will secure complete in -' dustrial peace, but we should not shirk our duty to do what we can to prevent in dustrial unrest. I suggest that the Prime Minister should let us deal with notice of motion No. 1 to-night. - Question resolved in the affirmative. INDUSTRIAL PEACE BILL .

261,Mr EYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"West Sydney) [10.58] There is one word I wish to say on the motion for the adjournment of the House. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) this afternoon moved the closure at the end of a long controversial speech. I desire to enter m y ' protest against his action in moving the closure at the end of such a speech, because the adoption of that practice does not give other members of the House any opportunity to reply. Certainly, a veTy effective reply was given by the vote of the House. I should like to direct attention to the dictum of a Speaker of the House of Commons, on the 12th Mav, 1893, on a point raised by Lord George Hamilton. The matter is recorded as follows, at page 790, vol. 12, of the 4th series of Parliamentary Debates, 4th May, 1893, to 1st June, 1893: Lord G. HAMILTON - I wish, sir, to ask your opinion' as to the manner in which the closure can be moved, not only in Committee, but when the Speaker is in the chair, and I wish to ask whether it is in conformity with the spirit of the standing order for any Minister to preface his motion for the closure by a speech of a highly controversial character and stating, with all tie skill of an advocate, the reasons why the closure should be applied T",55
262,Mr SPEAKER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"I take it that the question of the noble lord is whether the closure can be moved after a speech has been made on a general subject or after reasons given for moving it. As far as I recollect, a similar question was raised in August, 1887, when a right honourable gentleman made a long and necessarily controversial speech, and at the end of it moved the closure. The honourable and learned member fot Louth raised the point, and I then told the honourable and learned member that the question had been settled by former precedents, and that it was competent for an honourable member at the close of a speech to move the closure. But after an experience of many years, I am bound to say that for an honourable member to make a controversial speech and then to move the closure is scarcely in conformity with the spirit of the rule, because such a course Bhuts out an answer to his speech being given. I wish to have that extract placed on record in order that the precedent get hy the Prima Minis"" er (Mr Hughes) this afternoon may not be followed on any other occasion; and I hope, if it be followed, that Parliament will give to it just as effective a reply as it gave today. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.1 p.m.",56
