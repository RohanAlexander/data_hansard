2,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"This morning I sent to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Hugh Mahon) a letter notifying him of my intention to move a motion for his expulsion. It was delivered to him by the Secretary to the Department, to whom the honourable gentleman said that he was unable to come into town today, because he had sprained his ankle. The Secretary, who noticed that he was fully dressed, and had his boots on, offered to bring him in in the car, but he declined to come. I wish now to notify the public, honourable members, and, incidentally, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie himself, to. whom personally I shall again communicate my intention, that tomorrow, on the meeting of the House, I shall move the motion to which I have referred.",19
3,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Why not give notice of the motion, instead of speaking in this offensive way?",19
4,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I trust that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie will be well enough to attend tomorrow. The other day he treated us to some observations about the courage of the late Lord Mayor of Cork, who had the courage to die. I hope that the honourable member will have courage enough to come here.",19
5,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I ask leave to make a statement in reference to the matter mentioned by the Prime Minister.,19
6,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,This is the last time that the Prime Minister will get leave from me to make a statement.,19
7,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"In that case, I do not know that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) will get leave from. me now. Leave granted.",19
8,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"A b o u t 2.15 this afternoon I heard that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie was telephoning to this building, and I had an opportunity of saying a few words to him . He # then informed me that he had h u r t his foot - I ask the Prime Minister whether ho is to be taken to have given notice of his proposed motion ?",20
9,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I give notice of it now. To-morrow I shall move That, in the opinion of this House, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, the Honourable Hugh Mahon, having, by seditious and disloyal utterances at a public meeting on Sunday last, been guilty of conduct unfitting him to remtin a member of this House and inconsistent with the oath of allegiance which he has taken as a member of this House, be expelled this House. BASIC WAGE.",20
10,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"A few weeks ago I asked the Prime Minister when the basic wage is likely to be brought into operation. He promised to 'inquire, and to make a statement on the subject as early as possible. Has he any informatio n to communicate to the House?",20
11,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"No . I saw the chairman of the Basic Wage Commission - I think on the day on which able member asked his question, or, at any rate, soon after--and he told me that lie hoped to present a report with in about three weeks. I should think that it is about two weeks since the honourable member asked his question, and I hope, therefore, that the report will be received without much longer delay. NA",20

Cameron), the honourable member for I l l a w a r ra (Mr Lamond), and the honorincluding able member for Adelaide (Mr Blundell) waited on me in connection w it tubercular cases, and made certain claims on their behalf. As the honourable memsioners ber informed me of his intention to ask children, this question, I have had prepared for me by the chairman of the Repatriation Commission the following statement:Repatriation benefits available for tubercular soldiers - 1. Medical treatment(a) Sanatoria for cases requiring active treatment. (0) ANZAC farms for arrested cases. This includes quarters for married soldiers with families, (s) Special departmental institutions for advanced cases. 2. Railway travellingFree to and from sanatoria, ANZAC farms, and institutions, and when on leave, from sanatoria and farms. 3. Pensions(a) Ordinary - Tubercula r soldiers have always had the ordinary pension benefits, and where it was inadvisable for them to work, they were granted the maximum pension and living allowance existingat the time. (I>) Special - Unde r the second schedule - of the Repatriation Act 1920, special pensions ranging between £2 2s. and i i per week are allowable under certain conditions set out in the schedule. The Commission proposes to adopt a grading as follows, that is - in addition to arrested tubercular cases capable of continuous work where the pension will by assessed by the Medical Referee Board as per the honor-' the ordinary scale:(a) Cases where the disease has been arrested and the patient is .capable, with care, of light to medium employment, particularly in the open air-Pensio n £2 2s - per week.

14,Mr TUDOR,DIVIDENDS FREE OF INCOME,"-In a paragraph which appeared in Monday's Age it is stated that the divisible profit of Dalgety and Company Limited for the twelve months ended on the 30.th June last was given, in cable advice, ,at £338,505, and .that the directors proposed a dividend which would make the dividend for the .year 10 per cent., with .a bonus of 5s. per share, both free of income tax. Does that statement refer to the Australian income tax? I wish to know from the Treasurer whether it is possible for any company to pay from its funds the income tax on its dividends. This company's income tax rate might be very much less than the rate charged"" on the incomes of some of its big shareholders.",21
15,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DIVIDENDS FREE OF INCOME,"I have not considered that aspect of the case. Obviously, the case to which the honourable gentleman refers is one in which the company is paying the income tax, whatever it may be. It is quite a customary thing for companies to make such an announcement. There is nothing new in that. Ma-. TUDOTI - Where the income tax would be Ss. 4d. for one individual and only 5d. for another on a lower grade, is it possible for a company such as I have referred to to pay at a fiat rate the income tax for all its shareholders? Sir JOSEPH 'COOK - I do not think so.",21
16,Mr TUDOR,DIVIDENDS FREE OF INCOME,Will the honourable gentleman look into that matter?,21
17,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DIVIDENDS FREE OF INCOME,I certainly shall. I do not think that any individual is relieved of his personal obligation under the law by any .announcement or action of the kind on the part of a company of which he is a shareholder.,21
18,Mr TUDOR,DIVIDENDS FREE OF INCOME,That is what I wanted to know. ADVANCES FOR WHEAT .,21
19,Mr CHANTER,DIVIDENDS FREE OF INCOME,"A week or so ago the Prime Minister made a statement in reference to payments for wheat, and I then asked him whether he would make arrangements for the printing of 5,000 or -6,000 copies of that statement in order that they might be distributed to honourable members and by them to various farmers' associations? 'Cam the right honTAX. orable gemtleman now say when copies 'of his .statement will be made available to honourable members? MT. HUGHES - I recollect the incident perfectly. I am 'under the impression that I mentioned the matter to the Chief of the Hansard staff, and told him that I desired 'to he supplied with 10,000 copies of the statement. I am not quite sure on that point, but I certainly did menition the matter, and copies of .the statement will be made available at the earliest possible moment. I shall attend to the matter directly I leave the chamber. NORTHERN TERRITORY. APPOINTMENT OF OFFICIALS.",21

21,Mr MCGRATH,DIVIDENDS FREE OF INCOME,"I find that when holidays are granted to permanent employees of the Public Service they receive full pay, but temporary employees, if they leave off work on those holidays, receive no pay. To-morrow will be Show Day at Ballarat. A number of returned soldiers are at work there on undergrounding cables for the Post and Telegraph Department, and whilsttwo or three permanent men will receive pay for the holiday, returned soldiers who are temporarily employed may work or leave off work as they please, but if they do not work on the holiday they will receive no pay. I should he glad if the Postmaster General will make inquiries to see whether these men cannot be given the holiday off with pay, as are the permanent employees.",21
22,Mr WISE,DIVIDENDS FREE OF INCOME,"The honourable member spoke to me of this matter yesterday, and I had inquiries made on the subject. I have been informed that permanent men are getting the holiday and also temporary men, and the latter are to be paid for the day with the exception of those who are casual navvies. Further inquiries made have confirmed that information. I got into touch with the Acting Public Service Commissioner, and he has informed me that the casual hands cannot be paid if they do not work. NA COUNTRIES.",21
23,Mr BLAKELEY,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"In view of the serious decline in prices of cross bred and inferior wool, will the Prime Minister sympathetically consider the re-opening of trade with late enemy countries for these products? "" Mr HUGHES - I have never, since Peace has been declared, expressed myself as opposed to the sale by Australia - Mr SPEAKER to other countries of Australian ducts. My opposition has been, and to the purchase by Australia of the products of enemy or late enemy countries. I think that some Australian wool which was purchased by the British Governlower ment was recently sold to Austria, but Navy."" whether directly by the British Government or not I do not know. many is prepared to buy our wool at a satisfactory price, I am bound to say that I see no reason why we should not sell it to her.

Sir JOSE PH COOK - I understand that the scheme referred to is quietly posing somewhere in the records of the House, and I advise the honourable memmembers ber to look it up if he wants to see it . SUPPLIES TO THE PUBLIC .",22
25,Mr FENTON,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"In view of the fact that a number of families in Victoria have been without sugar for several days, I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs what arrangements he has made to enable the people of Victoria and of other parts of the Commonwealth to be supplied with sugar; and, as the f r u it season is coming on, to enable housewives to secure a sufficient supply for the making of jam to assist them in meeting the high cost of living ",22
26,Mr MASSYGREENE,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"As I .explained to the House on several occasions recently, we are making available to the trade the whole of the output of refined sugar, and, in addition, we have purchased a large quantity that will be arriving very shortly. As soon as it arrives we shall be in a position to make available to the community as much as they require. - ADJOURNME NT (Formal). DISCONTENT or NAVALRATINGS . - I have received an prointimation from the honourable member is, for Dalley (Mr Mahony) that he desires to move the adjournment of the House .today to call attention to a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The discontent existing amongst the deck ratings of the Australian If Ger- Five honourable members having risen in their p'fcices, Question proposed.",22
27,Mr MAHONY,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"Dalley) [ 2 . 4 8 ] - I regret exceedingly the necessity for having to submit this motion this afternoon, but t is one which affects not only the welSCHEME. fare of the various ratings of the Australian Navy, but it may be the safety of the people of Australia. For this reason I have felt compelled to adopt this course to direct public attention to the very serious condition of discontent existing today amongst the lower deck ratings of the Australian Navy. We know T that as a result of the efforts of the B r i tish and Australian Navies during the late great war, the British people have been able to maintain their supremacy of the reseas. There were many complaints made prior to the war and since its close by of the British Naval Forces and also of the Australian Naval Forces. I find that in Great Britain the Admiralty SUGAR. took immediate steps to remedy the state of affairs existing amongst the lower deck ratings of the British Navy. They brought into being what was known as a Welfare Committee. It was composed of officers of the British Navy. In addition, there was appointed what was known as an Advisory Committee. This Committee is composed of men representing the lower deck ratings. The idea is that the Advisory Committee shall make any representations as to grievances to the Welfare Committee, and then the officers comprising the Welfare Committee either deal with the complaints themselves or pass them on to the Admiralty. In Australia the Government of the day adopted a similar system, and' created Welfare Committees and Advisory Committees. But the men complain that, owing to the fact that they have to submit the whole of their grievances to the Welfare Committee, which is composed of officers, they are deprived of the opportunity of getting them remedied, because, if it suits them to do so, the officers refuse to pass the complaints on to the Naval Board and the Minister. Consequently, they have decided-unanimously to ask the Naval Board and the Minister to receive them direct, without any intervention on the part of Welfare Committee; but it is surprising to learn that the Board and the Minister have refused to receive any one representing the lower deck ratings for the purpose of hearing their grievances. The men, on being informed, in reply to their request, that they could place their grievances before Welfare Committee, which would thereupon forward them to the Naval Board for consideration, said that they did not propose to do so, because they did not believe they could get a fair deal from the officers, and that they preferred to go straight to the Minister or the Naval Board. The Board then stated that they were prepared to receive one or two representatives of the Advisory Committee to show reasons why it . should receive them. I want honourable members to note the absurdity of the position. These men were to be allowed to meet the Board merely to advance reasons why they should be received by it, but they were not to be allowed to put their grievances before it. In this matter the Minister for the Navy (Mr Laird Smith) had an opportunity of making a name for himself by getting away from the old red-tape system, which has been in vogue in British naval affairs for centuries; but with a great deal of regret I have to say that he is merely allowing himself to be a creature in the hands of his officers and the members of the Naval Board, who have utterly failed to realise that as a result of the great world war new ideas prevail today. They do not see that they must get away from the old system, which prevented the man on the lower deck from - approaching any one except his immediate superior, and would only allow his representations to eventually reach the head of the Department after they had passed through all the various steps of the ladder from that immediate superior officer upwards. The old ideas have been exploded by the war, and it is surprising to me that an Australian Minister for the Navy should still be prepared to allow them to continue in force in Australia, especially when we know that the British Admiralty have broken away from them.",22
28,Mr LAIRD SMITH,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"In what way? Mr - MAHONY - They have decided to cut away all the old red-tape which bound down the Service hand and foot. I have with me a reprint from Ashore and Afloat, a journal dealing with nautical and naval matters in Great Britain, which has on it a photograph bearing the following inscription: Lower deck deputation arriving at Whitehall to see the Lords of the Admiralty. Such a deputation is unprecedented - in the history of the Navy. The letterpress contains the following:The Admiralty, for the first time in history, received a deputation representing all lower deck ratings. The deputation attended at Whitehall at the invitation of the Board, and consisted of twenty-one advisory members of the Lower Deck "" Inter-Port Welfare Committee.",23
29,Mr LAIRD SMITH,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,Who m did they see?,23
30,Mr MAHONY,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"Ear l Beatty, the First Sea Lord, received the deputation, and the interview, we are told, lasted two and three-quarter hours. The hero of Jutland, the idol of the British Navy, the .man who had done his part nobly and well, and but for whose efforts the German Navy might be riding triumphant in the North Sea today, received these men without any intermediary. The man who did the fighting raised no question of red-tape or dignity. With him it was simply a matter endeavouring to rectify grievances.",23
31,Mr LAIRD SMITH,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"What grievances were dealt with at the deputation? Mr MAHONY.:-It is quite immaterial what grievances were considered,, allihough, according to this journal, over one hundhred of the requests made were granted in whole or in pairt, and some were still under' consideration. But the main point is that the First Sea Lord received a deputation representative of the lower deck ratings without any intermediary. I have no desire to make a long speech, or to go into details of the matters, about which the men complain'. It is sufficient for me to say that there discontent among the lower deck ratings in the Australian Navy, and to point out thai! when similar discontent arose in the British Navy the British Admiralty took the sensible course of allowing the men to go immediately to the First Sea Lord and place their grievances before him. In Australia they are not permitted to take similar action. Surely what is good ' enough for the British Admiralty should be good enough for Australian Admiral's. If the practice is good enough for Admiral' Beatty,, surely it should be good enough for our Minister for the Navy (Mr Laird Smith). The men who did the fighting in the last great war realise how important it is that the grievances of the lower naval ratings should be redressed.",23
32,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"'In this case, the honourable member desires to follow precedent; but in other cases he wishes to make precedent.",24
33,Mr MAHONY,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"I am very cosmopolitan in my views. I do not believe in tying myself down to precedent. If there be any good precedent in Great Britain, I am prepared to follow it. But I am not so silly as to suggest that I am possessed of all the ability in the world, or of all the truth in the world. Whereever I see anything which is good I am prepared to accept it. It is all very well for the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) to laugh, but he would laugh upon the other side of his face should it be found in the not distant future that our Australian Navy is undermanned and understaffed! owing to discontent in the service. It is a fact that men will not join that service today, and' that those who have joined it are deserting it by dozens. One of the reasons why I have brought this matter forward is because of the enormous number of desertions that have taken place from the Australian Navy since the return of the Fleet to home waters. Mr E'ECEY - Hundred s of mem in the service wish to retire-.",24
34,Mr MAHONY,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"Precisely . They desire to get out of it because their grievances are not being remedied. Hereis an opportunity for the Minister for the Navy. tobreak away from the old red-tape system. Let him receive a depuis tation of these men, listen to their grievances, and see if he eannot remedy them. . - Sir JOSEPH COOK - What did Earl Beatty give the deputationists which1 waited upon him?",24
35,Mr MAHONY,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"He acceded to more than 100 of their requests. If the course which I have outlined was good enough for Earl Beatty to. follow, surely it is good enough for the Minister for the Navy and the Navasl Board of the Commonwealth. The future of Australia assuredly depends upon the strength of its defence upon the watery and! thenecessity for that defence, may arise maeL sooner than quite a number of us anticipate. At such a time, to whom shall we look?: Shall we not look to the men of the' Australian Navy ?' If that be so,, surely we are not asking toomuch in a democratic country like this when we ask that the Ministershall cut himself free from the old system of red-tape, and listen to the grievances of these men I We all know that the Australian temperament is vastly different from the temperaments of other nations. As a rule, the Australian is an individual whocannot be bullied; or bounced; but if he be handled with a little tact, a great deal may be accomplished. Knowing the Minister as I do, I feel sure that had he allowed himself to get aiway from theamtiquated system of red-tape by receiving thelower naval ratingsof whom I . am speaking, nothing but good would have resulted from his action. I would urge upon the honourable gentleman the need for making a final effort to burst these red-tape bonds, with a view to doing justice to the lower-deck ratings of the Australian Navy",24
36,Mr WEST,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"East Sydney) [3.6] - I am very pleased that my honourable friend has brought under the notice of the House file action of the Naval Board. I have received a great deal of correspondence on behalf of the lowerdeck ratings of the Australian Navy, and I believe that you, sir-lik e a good many other honourable members-at one time in your career, had a considerable experience of seafaring life. Those honourable members who are acquainted with that l if e realise the domineering and unChristianlike methods which are adopted in dealing with our seamen; and, as a result, desire, whenever the opportunity occurs, to do something for them. Like my honourable friend, I contend that the Naval defence of Australia must be our first line of defence. The action of the Naval Board is entirely out of sympathy with t i e aspirations of the Australian people. The members of no other service in Australia are subject to the disabilities to which our naval men are subjected. They are not allowed to approach members of Parliament with their grievances, or to express themselves in the same way as are ordinary citizens. If they have any complaints to make against the Board or their officers.",24
37,Mr LAXRD SMITH,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,Do their friends object?,25
38,Mr WEST,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"Fanc y a Democrat like the Minister for the Navy asking a questo be treated. tion of that sort. Can a sailor come into m y presence and lay his grievances fore me? Surely the Minister is unfit for his position if he holds such views as his interjection suggests. If the orable gentleman really entertains such opinions, he is unfit to be in charge of the Board. the fine men of whom the Australian Navy is composed. I hold that the Auslations tralian sailor should - possess equal privileges with every other citizen of community. Some time ago, the Naval Board issued regulations under which married men were not required to belong to the sailors' mess on the ship. They were'allowed Is. 8d. a day, because they could go home and have, their meals with their families; but that allowance has taken away, and they have now to take their meals in the-mess. This alteration did not include the officers. Week3 I wrote to the Naval Board in reference to the matter, but have received and that is not treatment to be meted out to any parliamentary representative. This you hold? autocratic crowd has not the courtesy to reply ifco letters, and, although I spoke to Ihe Minister about the mai/tar, I got no satisfaction. The members of the Naval Board seem to forget that they are nothing more than members of the Public Service, as is shown by the fact that when they are in harbour they are given a salute of fifteen guns, with a view, no doubt, to waking up the officers on the ship, and intimating to the men that they must keep their mouths shut when the members are on board. Day after day desertions are taking place, and, in view'of the conditions that prevail, men deserting will certainly have my assistance. I should not have the spirit of manhood if I did not assist men suffering under such cruel and unjust treatment. Why cannot the sailors be allowed to interview me in the same way as soldiers do? So far as I know, there is no regulation preventing soldiers from interviewing me; if there is the soldiers take no notice of it . The sailor, however, is an obedient, disciplined creature; but, obedient as he may be, he cannot be expected to follow tyrannical commands which seem to be actuated by stupidity. I suppose there can be no chance until there fe a change of Government. If I were on the Ministerial side of the House I should want to see the Minister for the Navy, whoever he might be, ready to treat sailors as men ought In my opinion, there ought to be no'Naval Board, but a strong beMinister, who would decline to be a mere ereature of the permanent service, content to "" polish up the handle of the big front door."" . U p to the present we have honnever had a Minister for the Navy who has had the courage to ' ' stand up "" to Even in G*eat Britain changes are being made in the Naval reguevery day, anrd the conditions are such as make it a pleasure to the men to the obey and salute their officers, whom they feel to be worthy of the respect shown them. I feel quite sure that the Minister for the Navy himself (Mr Laird Smith), if he were one of them, would refuse to salute an officer who, in his opinion, was not watching over the interests of the Serbeen vice. If the honourable gentleman were with the Labour party still, he would be one of the first to take the course that I ago am taking today. In this I am a follower of "" Admiral Mahony,"" 'the honorno reply, able member for Dalley.",25
39,Mr LAIRD SMITH,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"And what rank do Mr ""WEST - I do not know, but the Minister may address me as the "" Liberator of Oppressed Men."" Honourable members are laughing, but this is a matter too serious for ridicule. I quite admit that we cannot have a Navy without discipline; at the same time, we cannot expect men to be obedient unless their officers are worthy of their respect. The members of the Naval Board have an idea that they are the autocrats of the Navy, and that to their sole control the Navy should be left ; they, evidently think that, beyond paying the necessary taxation, the people should have'no voice in the management of naval matters. The Minister .ought to be strong enough to call the members of the Board together tomorrow, and say to them, "" Gentlemen, you have to carry out the will of the people of Australia, who find the money to pay your salaries; you are public servants just as are the employees in any other Department of the Commonwealth."" If that were done, I believe the members of the Board would give loyal obedience, just as they would to any regulation issued by the Government. Until we have on the Ministerial benches determined men, strong in the principles of Democracy we can never have a good Navy. A number of my friends are naval men, and, with my love for the Service, it pains me that the sailors are not allowed to see me when they wish. If one of the men wishes to See me he sends a boy to ring my bell, and I have to go down the street to talk to him. This is done in order that the man may not be accused of having been .seen with "" that fellow West,"" as an officer described me one day. boys of the training ship Tvngirait will be remembered, I that I took a deep interest in the flogging of these boys some time agoihave a recreation ground, often visited by an old naval friend of mine, who, in the kindness of his heart, takes f r u i other little luxuries to them at their play. One day, when he was at the fence speaking to some of the boys, an officer. came up and asked him-, "" Why are you talking to those boys? "" My friend replied, "" M in d your own business; I am on the King's highway. If the boys speak to me I 'shall reply to them."" that the officer walked away, saying, "" I suppose you are that fellow West."" That illustrates the view held by these petty officers,. because I have had the courage to stand up against Ministers and others in defence of proper treatment of the men, whether they are on ships or in anv other service of the State.",25
40,Mr SPEAKER,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,26
41,Mr WEST,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"I hope what I have said this afternoon will be the means of remedying evils that actually exist, and badly need remedying. I believe it is in the power of the Minister, if he has the courage, to remove these evils, and make the Navy of Australia one of which we can be proud.",26
42,Mr MARRS,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"Wentworth) [3.21] Personally, I should have liked longer notice that this motion was to be moved, so that I could make inquiries in order to find out exactly the case from the men's stand-point. I must admit that there is a slight discontent, so far as I know it , in the lower deck, but not the rampant discontent described by. the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony). The point seems to be that the men wish to get to the very head of the Department in order to place their grievances before him. In looking at a matter such as this, I always endeavour to place myself in the position of the head of the Department, the Minister. If one does that, it is brought home to him at once that it would be absolutely impossible for the Minister to administer his portfolio if he interviewed every man and officer of the Royal Australian Navy having a grievance. It could not be done; but I cannot see why representatives of the men could not, for instance, The interview the First Naval Member, A d miral Grant, a very fine officer, who, like think, Earl Beatty, fought in the Battle of Jutland. I should like to hear what the M i nister has to say to that suggestion. I do not say that they should be able to interview Admiral Grant every day in the t and week, but they should be able to see him at stated times if they came to him as representatives of the whole of the.lower deck. I know"" the Welfare Committee was not a success. Soon after they gave out their report, it was known throughout the Fleet, not as the "" welfare,"" but as the "" farewell "" report, and I endeavoured to find out why it had been given that name. With The first ground of complaint seemed to be that too many matters were being sent home to England for decision. That seemed to "" ril e "" the men a bit. They looked to the Naval Board to settle these difficulties. There has been a good deal of talk on this motion, hut no very concrete case has been made out. I join with honourable members on the other side of the House in asking the Minister to do everything possible to alleviate and wipe out any discontent that exists in the Fleet, by seeing whether some modus operandi cannot be found to enable the men to see the First Naval Member, Admiral Grant, or the Second Naval Member, Captain Hardy. I have great respect for those two gentlemen, because they know their jobs, and are out to make the Australian Fleet as successful a6 possible. If they could see the men, I think all our troubles would be ended; but something like that will have to be done, because I do not want to see even a simmer of discontent. I want to see the men happ)', because we all realise that we must keep up our Fleet, no matter how small it may be for the time being, and we want to see every officer and man on those ships happy. From the absolutely square deals which I have had from the Minister for the Navy in the many cases I have brought before him, I feel sure that he is out to make our Fleet a happy one, and that Admiral Grant and Captain Hardy are out to assist him. Surely the three of them can hit on some avenue through which this difficulty can be got over. Personally, I am dead against the Minister, the political head of the Naval Board, interviewing every man and every officer in the Fleet, because in ninety-nine cases out of 100 the Minister is not a practical seafaring man. The men might get at him and talk him round, but they cannot talk round the First Naval Member or the Second Naval Member. It may be said that the men would be got at by the First or Second Naval Member, but the M i nister is there, and he knows what is going ' on. I am not speaking personally about the present Minister (Mr Laird Smith) ; but if the Minister for the Navy does not know what is going on he has no right to hold the job. From what I know of the many cases I have brought before him, he does know what is going on. In one particular case, he reversed the decision of the Naval Board on a very important matter which I brought before him . It was the first matter I put before him, and my experience gave me. every confidence that he was watching affairs very closely. I know he has a long statement to make this afternoon, and in conjunction with the honourable members who have already spoken on the other side of the House, I urge him now to try to get over the present position, and settle it once and for all by giving an assurance that some means will be found by which the men's grievances, whatever they may be, will be immediately attended to.",26
43,Mr MCGRATH,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"Ballarat) [3.27] - If I have judged it rightly, the position is that the men on the lower deck have appointed an Advisory Committee to represent them and ventilate their grievances; that Committee has requested .an interview with .the members of the Naval Board, and the Naval Board have refused to be in terviewed, telling the men that their representations must be made through the officers, and that some officer must plead their case. We all know that no officer is competent to plead the .case for the lower deck. He does not understand their grievances, or the situation generally, and the men have not sufficient confidence in any officer's ability to plead their case for them. Admira l Grant, or other members of the Board, probably imported men, with old ideas of subserviency and so-called discipline, and a fixed belief instilled into their minds that the lower deck man is only there to fight, ancl is not supposed to have any grievances, have most likely considered it beneath their dignity that the men should he permitted to enter their presence. It is time we had a Minister who would say to the Naval Board, "" It is your business to meet and interview the Advisory Committee of the lower deck, and to see that there is no discontent among the men."" I am flooded with letters from lads who want to get out of the Navy.",27
44,Mr MAHONY,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"Hear , hear! They are deserting wholesale. "" Mr MCGRATH - Yes , they are all complaining about their treatment. It is absurd that in Australia, in the twentieth century, the men should be denied the opportunity of approaching either the Minister or the Naval Board.

47,Mr MCGRATH,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"I am simply asking the Minister to exercise common sense, and show a little consideration, for the men. I do not want him to sit in his chair and simply be governed by a few officials in the Navy. I have here a copy of. the minutes of the men's meeting, in which the following, appears-:The Advisory Committee consisted of twentytbree members, who were elected by the lowerdeck ratings to advise and? make suggestions for the welfare of the rank and file of the Australian Navy.

I have seen enough as a member of the Australian Imperial Force to satisfy me on that point. During the war the Australian Imperial Force was governed by the King's Regulations, which were obsolete,, having been framed' at least 100 years before. .There is a spirit of subserviency running right through the King's Regulations, and under fern the man in the ranks has no rights whatever. We desire that the Australian Navy shall be efficient, hut we shall never get efficiency unless we have contentment. It is impossible today to induceboys tojoin the Australian Navy. One of the causes, of this is that the Navy isseething: with discontent. These men, acting in; a. proper manner, appointeda committee from thelower deck,, and they asked, the Naval Board to receive them, and to listen to their grievances. No fairer request could have been made; and I hope that the Minister; whois new to his position, will be firm enough to insist that the Naval Board, shall meet the representatives of the men, listen to their grievances, and take every reasonable step to insure that we shall have' in the service a contented body of men. Mr JAMES"" PAGE (Maranoa) [3.32]. - It is, to say the least, most peculiar that the men on the lower deck of the Australian Navy are not permitted', to place their grievances directly before the Naval. Board - I have before me a, copy of Ashore and Afloat,, in which there appears a picture of a body of men of the lower deck ratings marching to Whitehall to place their views before the Admiralty. In theletterpress it is stated thatThe Admiralty, for the first time in history, received a deputation representing all. lower deck, ratings. The deputation, attended at Whitehall at the invitation of the Board, ancl consisted of twenty-one advisory members of the Lower Deck Inter-port Welfare Committee. Chief Writer C. S-.

If these men are labouring under grievances let the Minister set them rignt. Let him afford them an opportunity to go before the Naval Board, or some in authority, and ventilate them. Their complaints ought not to be pigeon-holed. I do not believe in political interferencepeople in these matters, but if the men of the this Parliament. lower - deck have grievance's there surely ought to be some one in authority to whom they can appeal. The road has been made easy for the Minister and the Australian Naval Board by Earl Beatty. If the Minister desires the Australian Navy to be successful he must make far more popular than it is today. young fellows, who recently interviewed me in Queensland, expressed a desire join the Navy. They were really anxious to join up, but after they had made quiries, they said to me, "" No Navy for usl""",29

61,Mr LAIRD SMITH,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"Denison-Minister for the Navy) [3.41] - There is one thing that I will not admit, and that is ' that there is any great discontent in the Australian Navy. They are as fine abody of men as it is possible to find in the it British Empire. The Navy is manned by Several men who, if there were the great discontent which is represented, would, to not carry on the excellent work they are doing : and I say it is an injusintice to them to allow the impression; to go forth to the world that they are discontented. Owing to the statements madfe this afternoon, it will be necessary for me to go very deeply into the constitution-of the Advisory Committee, to point out its duties, and so o n ; but before doing that, I should like to say that I am proud to be associated with A d m i r a l Sir Percy Grant., because ! know he has at heart the welfare of every man in the service. He is a big man in every sense of the word. He was present at the Battle of Jutland, fighting side by side with Lord Beatty. Let me tell honourable members what was put up to me, and what we had to do. This was the Naval Board's reply to the request by the men for an interviewThe Naval Board, after due consideration, decided that the Board could not meet the Advisory Committee, as a Board, but were prepared to agree that one or two members of the Naval Board should meet the representatives of the Advisory Committee. -""Who are the members of the Naval Board? Admira l Sir Percy Grant is one.",29
62,Mr MAHOHT,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"Rea d on, please. - Mr Laird SMITH - I have the whole of the letter here, and I shall give it to honourable members. A d m i Percy Grant, I Temind the House, occupies precisely the same' position as the First Sea Lord of the Admiralty. men of the British Navy, to whom the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr . Page) has referred, did not see the political heads of the Department at all. They made no attempt to do that. They saw the First Sea Lord . Grant, as one member of the Naval Board, is prepared to do that. For the information of honourable members. I shall read the whole of the letter to which I have already referredTheNaval Board, after due consideration, decided that the. Board could not meet the Advisory Committee, as a Board, but were prepared to agree that one or two members of the Naval Board should meet members of the Advisory Committee. It was intended, if this meeting took place, to reaBsure the Advisory Committee on the points they raised, and to inform them of the action the Board proposed to take to insure that all the papers, presented at this year's Welfare Committee, Bhould reach the Naval Board and be duly considered by that Board. Now what was the arrangement made? I went so far as to say that when the A d visory Committee and the Welfare Committee met we would provide the services' of a shorthand writer to take a record of the proceedings, transcribe it , and sub-, mit it to me as a member of the Naval Board, over which I preside. If the men interviewed the Board I would be obliged, if necessary, to see every officer and every man in the Australian Navy. Even now I am working day and night. Very few honourable members realise what it - means to supervise the expenditure of £3,250,000 provided on this year's Estimates for the Navy. ' The other day I bad submitted to me a statement from a company in which I have been interested for the last twenty-five years, intimating that they propose to increase their capital by £3,000,000. The affairs of the company are controlled by a Board of twelve, directors, whereas I have to administer the whole of the Department and supervise its expenditure.. In view of these facts I ask any reasonable person how could I possibly, in addition to my ordinary duties, interview ' all the officers and men of the Australian Navy. At times I have to turn away my personal friends, among them my constituents, because, owing to the pressure of iny official duties, I cannot r a l Sir possibly see them. Since I have been the administrative head of ' the Department I have not been one day absent The - from the Navy Office, except on one holiday, and even then I took matter to my private residence for perusal. Under these conditions I could not possibly give personal attention to the grievances of the lower ratings. Admiral What are the men asking for? Let us see what is behind this request. I was delighted to hear the honourable member  believe in political influence in Naval administration. Why should any men on the lower deck, because they happento know the Minister, or a member of Parliament, be able to see him, and perhaps go over the beads of superior officers who have not any political influence? While I am Minister, no man in the lower ratings, or officer either for that matter, is going to do that. I desire that every man shall get a fair. deal. Let me tell honourable members what was done by the Naval BoardThe Naval Board considered the situation, and decided that the Commodore Superintendent should interview the chairman of the Advisory Committee and ascertain and report personally to the Board the reasons for the attitude taken up by that Committee. This was done, and the Commodore reported the reasons put forward by - the Committee, which were as follows:(1) They were not satisfied that all the papers regarding the representation' made at last year's Conference were seen by the Naval Board or the Minister for the Navy. (2) They considered that it was dmpos- sible for a naval officer to clearly state the case for the lower deck, and they were of the opinion that their case would be more effective if dealt with direct with the Naval Board and the Minister than through an intermediary. (3) They desired to see the Minister for the Navy(a) to insure the Minister being (6) to insure that the full facts (e) in order that urgent atten(4) They considered that the press should be present at their interview with the Minister. I ask any honourable member who has had Ministerial experience how it would possible for me to consent to that?",30
63,Mr WEST,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,I say you could.,31
64,Mr LAIRD SMITH,SALE OF WOOL TO LATEENEMY,"If I did it would be impossible for me to carry out my duties. The statement continuesA Navy Order was published on 5th follow:August, directing that the election of representatives should take place forthwith, and outlining the manner in which representatives of the various branches were to be selected. In pursuance of this Navy Order, the men's representatives were assembled in August for preliminary discussion. They then returned to their respective ships and establishments,, in order to get in touch with the men they represented. After being given' sufficient for discussion to take place, they were called together again in October in order to prepare list of their requests in writing. Meanwhile Welfare Committee of five officers was selected, and the first sitting of the Committee, when welfare and Advisory Committee should was arranged to take place ori 14th October. Before this date arrived, however, the visory Committee informed the Commodore Superintendent that they did not propose meet the Welfare Committee, but requested permission to meet direct the Naval Board and the Minister for the Navy. They also asked that the press should be present at all the meetings, quoting the "" Jerram "" Committee. That was a Committee which dealt solely with finance. There was not a Minister present at its deliberations. The statement 'has been made in this House that, when the Board met last year, and the men's case came before it for consideration, that was the end of it . I hold in my hand a printed document which was circulated throughout the Navy. It sets for th particulars of how each case was dealt with by the placed in' possession of Board; it indicates the reception which first-hand knowledge of finanevery claim received, and how each cial questions raised; matter was finalized. No less than f if t y items were approved of, all of as stated in the papers are which were of great importance. In brought to the notice of the Minister and the Naval the time at m y disposal I have Board; been unable to secure information concerning the exact amount involved; but tion may he given to ques- the Third Naval Member, who is respontions of an urgent nature, sible for the matter of expenditure, has particularly the questions regarding pay. It was con- stated that I would be justified in saying sidered that much time that thousands of pounds have been would be wasted in putting spent, since the Welfare Committee first these questions through the met, in improving accommodation for the Welfare Committee. men, and in making their conditions generally better. Again, here are facts which speak for themselves; and I wish to say that in relation to the document which I shall now read the present Treasurer (Sir be Joseph Cook) must take a share of the credit for the increases granted during the period of his control of the Navy Department. The amounts involved per annum in general increases to ranks and ratings of the Royal Australian Navy from the dates shown are' as From 1st January, 1918, f105,000; from 1st April, 1919, £103,000 and £18,000 (additional), total, £121,000; grand total, £226,000. The above figures are based on numbers borne at the time the increase was granted. The increases include increases in pay to ranks and ratings generally, increase in various allowances for extra duty and qualifications, and intime crease in married allowance. a In following the present Treasurer in conthe trol of the Navy Department I have the worked at all times with the best interests meet, of the men 'at heart. I have always been a worker; I am still one, and I always Adhope to remain one. It is cruel, therefore, for any honourable member to make to statements such as have been made this afternoon; and it is unfair for any honourable member to suggest that I have been discourteous when I have been approached in relation to the well-being of the men of the Navy. I will proceed to give further official particulars of in creases, as follow: Able Seaman .. S 4 .. 10 1 .. 11 4 ILeading Seaman .. 8 10 .. 11 1 .. 12 6 Petty Officer . . 10 0 .. 12 4 .. 13 9 These are the minimum sums paid. a man qualifies in any particular tion to receive more, he is paid accordingly. There is a Committee now sitting for the purpose of considering the question of pay. All applications in this respect axe carefully examined, and if it is shown that any man is getting less than that to which he is entitled-less Committee considers fair and reasonable - his grievance will be remedied. Extension of time granted. The Advisory Committee is ""composed of twenty-four, and not of twenty-three, persons. There is also a committee of officers. This body first meets to consider a specific matter. Then the Advisory Committee sits and sets for th in writing its views on the matter under consideration. The two bodies subsequently sit j o in t l y ; and so the question at issue is discussed between the members of the Advisory Committee and of the Welfare Committee. The business is finally embodied in a report, and thus comes before the Naval Board. Owing to my various duties I am unable to preside at every meeting of the Board. I may mention that I did not attend one meeting at which the matter of the Amelia J . was under discussion. My reason for absenting myself was that that vessel was owned by a gentleman in my constituency. The Board had a free hand to act, and it did so. The Board very much regrets that it became necessary to dissolve the Advisory Committee. This necessity arose for the reason that the Committee was holding everything up. I quote the following circular: Tie Board, in dissolving the Advisory Committee, directed that the snips' companies of all ships and establishments should be informed that the work of the Welfare Committee this year would be seriously handicapped because Mr Laird Smith. of the attitude taken up by the men's accredited representatives in declining to meet the Welfare Committe and discuss the requests put forward.

I am pleased to see that evidence has been given, and it will be considered by the Board just the same as if it were submitted by the Advisory Committee.

It must be He remembered that there is a periodical in spection of the various ships, and when an inspection is being made, lower-deck ratings have the opportunity of making statements and forwarding grievances for consideration by the Board.

The statement in the letter sent by the Secretary of the Department to the men is a totally different one from that made by the M in ister this afternoon.

100,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Hindmarsh) [4.21] - I folwish to draw the attention of honourable members to a summary of the operations of the Australian banks for the year which ended with June last. The eighteen associated private hanks of Australia, namely, the Australian Bank of Commerce; the Bank of Adelaide; the Bank of Australasia;, the Bank of New South ""Wales;. the Bank of New Zealand; the Bank of Queensland; the Bank of Victoria; the Commercial Bank of Australia; the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney; the Commercial Bank of Tasmania; the English, Scottish, and Australian Bank; the London Bank of Australia; the National Bank of Australasia ; the National' Bank of New Zealand; the Queensland National Bank; the Royal Bank of. Australia; the Union Bank of Australia; and the Western Australian Bank, have a total paid-up capital of £25,442,390,. on which, in the last financial year, they paid dividends totalling £2,617,826, and earned also undivided, profits totalling £941,985, their aggregate profits for the year being £3,559,811, or 13.9 per cent. on. their paid-up capital. Had the shareholders in those banks received only the same interest on their capital as ordinary depositors receive, namely, 3-J per cent., the total profits of the banks would have been only £890,4S4. Therefore, had the Commonwealth Bank been in supreme control of our finances, and had it possessed a banking monopoly, the community would have made a saving of £2,669,327. That is what could have been saved if the financial magnates and banking institutions of this country had been given only the consideration of ordinary citizens; instead of being allowed the special privilege of operating in public finance, and making huge profits. Leaving that phase of the question, I come now to deal with loans. I find that a very considerable saving might also have been made if the Commonwealth Bank had bsen intrusted with the flotation of the whole of our loans. According to. the Budget, the total loans floated by the Commonwealth amount to £219,800,000. I asked the Treasurer recently for a statement of the average percentage of cost for the flotation of loans, and after making all calculations necessary, I find that by the flotation of loans through the medium of the Commonwealth Bank, average cost has been 5s. 9d. per cent, of the loans floated. In order that honourable members may have some idea of the way we are imposed upon Mr Makin. by Imperial financiers when floating loans on behalf of the Commonwealth, I refer, them, to the Commonwealth YeastBook for 1918. In trying to discover a basis for a calculation as to the charge made for the flotation of loans for Australia on the London money market, I found that I could only institutea comparison by a reference to the cost of floating two loans, amounting to £12,000,000, on behalf of certain States of the Commonwealth. The flotation expenses of these loans amounted altogether to £466,429,. which represents £3 16s. per cent., as against 5s. 9d.. per cent, in the case of loans floated by the Commonwealth Bank. It 23 clear from the figures that if the total loans floated for Australia,, amounting to £219,800,000,. had been floated by private institutions,, at the same cost for flotation, as that charged for the State loans to which I have just referred, the Commonwealth would have been involved in an extra expense of £7,720,475. Earlier in the debate, the Treasiirer (Sir Joseph Cook) appeared! to desire to know in what way the Commonwealth Bank had been, of special advantage to the people, and .1 direct his attention to this particular instance",35
101,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Not at. all. I know that it has been of inestimable advantage to the people. - Mr MAKIN - I am glad to learn that the right honourable gentleman's opinion of the Commonwealth Bank is decidedly different today from that which he held at the time it was established.,36
102,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Not at all.,36
103,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I remember that the Treasurer found it very difficult to say a good word for the Commonwealth Bank in 1912, when it was established.",36
104,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"May I tell the"" honourable member that if we were beginning; the matter again today, I should make the same criticism.",36
105,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,That is hardly consistent with the admission which the right honourable gentleman has just made.,36
106,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,I think that the the Commonwealth Bank has succeeded despite its faulty construction:.,36
107,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,In spite of the opinion of it which the right honourable gentleman previously held.,36
108,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"No , in spite of its fault y construction. It has had excellent management.",37
109,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,The Commonwealth Bank is not the complete banking institution that I should wish it to be.,37
110,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I tried to make it so at a Premiers' Conference, 'but the honourable member's party blocked me.",37
111,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"If that is so, the right honourable gentleman can realise his dethe sire by withdrawing the Bill , and drafting it in the manner suggested by claims of interest have no the amendment.",37
112,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"No , not that crazy stuff. It may be of interest to the orable member to know that I had Stourbridge, arranged with the whole of the States take over all their Savings Bank business, and their otherbusiness, and toconceninvested trate it all in this Bank, and the honoryears, able member's party blocked me.",37
113,Mr FEE,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,TON - Mr Holman?,37
114,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,No .,37
115,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,I do not think right honourable gentleman can hold the party on this side of the House responsible for that.,37
116,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Yes , 1 can.. I blame the public, of course, originally, for bum,ping me out of office and bumping in the honourable member's party, who did nothing bu t shelve that scheme.",37
117,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I think that this speech of the Treasurer's might be reserved u n t a little later, when he can give us the full advantage of his knowledge on these matters.",37
118,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,When the honourable member criticises me I want to show that there is something to be said on the other side.,37
119,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I am always prepared are best off. to admit that. I am not one of those who believe that they possess a monopoly all knowledge. I have no doubt that the Treasurer has his share, and I shall be very pleased to havehim demonstrate that a little later. SirJOSEPH COOK - I certainly w i l thank; the honourable memberf o r the hint. I shall look up the record. - Mr MAKIN - It may be well for people to understand theimpositions placed upon them, which are directly to payments necessary for accommodation, interest. In view of the burdens which and the interest that arises from that. find that for the accommodation of loan of £25,000,000 at 6 percent., the rateat which the last loan was floated, the people have to pay to the extent of £1,500,000 per annum in interest.. This means that the burden becomes each year more difficult to shoulder, and the circumstances of the people become more difficult because of the ever increasing burden of interest for which the community receives no return. I recall the remark that ' ' The interest financier takes in us is only equalled reby the interest he takes outof us."" The finality. I have noticed a table that was compiled by an estimable gentleman in Great honBritain , Mr Walter Jones, J.P., of in a recent address he gave to to a Birmingham business club.. In the course of the address he stated, thab £ 1 at 1 per cent., would, in 100 become £ 2 7s., whilst the same amount invested at 24 per cent, would become £2,198,720,200. That will give honourable members some idea of the way in which interest accumulates and addsthat the to the burden of debt.",37
120,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"The honourable member should rather say that the servicewhich that capital renders the community during that time enables that', and ten times, more, to be paid to the community.",37
121,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"The interest on that, capital returns nothing to the community. The people of this country are getting each year into a more difficult position i l as the public debt increases-. Instead of relieving the situation and assisting the creation of wealth to meet our indebtedness, the moneythat is expended in interest is assisting to overwhelm the people. Sir JOSEPH COOK. - It isstrange that the people whopay most interest in the world today should be the people who",37
122,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"a find' that in 1901 of every family in the Commonwealth had to pay, in interest, approximately 5s., whilst today the levy is about 13s. 6d. The Treasurer will scarcely contend that the investment of this capital' is assisting l . I the country to progress. As a matter of fact, becaiuaeof it we are* becoming more deeply involved, financially, and the the people, should thesystemi continue, will be overwhelmed with the difficulty i m due posed upon them by the payment of - I loans impose upon the people in the the way of interest, the Government should* recognise how essential it is to evolve some means whereby the country may be relieved of those burdens which give no direct return to the community.",37
123,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,I suppose that the honourable member has written all this to - Mr Theodore and to Mr John Storey.,38
124,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"The gentlemen referred to do not require information on this - subject. They are well informed as to the. necessity for the institution of a National Bank of exchange and reserve, so that we may have a complete monopoly of that which today is controlling the people.",38
125,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"They are doing nothing of the kind, and they are borrowing for their lives.",38
126,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I do not approve of the terms upon which some State loans have heen, and are being, floated. I think that there is a great wrong done to the people when there is any exemption from taxation in respect to the charge for the flotation of loans. In this regard I might point out that when people of financial resources had the opportunity of investing in a loan hearing 5 per cent, interest subject to taxation, or 4$ per cent, interest free of taxation, they rushed the 4£ per cent, stock, recognising that it would relieve them of snaring in the burden of taxation that must be imposed to meet the accruing interest on these loans, which is mounting higher from year to year. find that, in regard to our sixth war loan, subscribers to the 4^ per cent, bonds free of income tax applied for £36,325,130, while those who preferred 5 per cent, bonds subject to the payment of income tax applied for £6,526,830. I understand that the amount of taxation represented by the exemption of the 4 i per cent, interest payable on bonds is .75 per cent., and as the amount subscribed to our loan issues at 4-J per cent, is £143,269,337, the total loss of revenue tained by making this exemption is no less than £1,074,520 per annum. Thus it can clearly be seen that the notation of loans at a lower rate of interest free from taxation is not a, sound principle to adopt, irrespective of the party that may have instituted it .",38
127,Mr WIENHOLT,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,The last loan'floated in New South Wales was made free of taxation.,38
128,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"The fact that the State Government of New South Wales is pre-, pared to exempt the interest earned on its latest loan does not alter the merits of the principle, which, on the figures I have just given, must stand condemned. The large financial corporation and insurance societies who have invested in our 4£ per cent, loans are able to evade their obligation to subscribe to the revenue of this country by making use of this side door, which enables those who accept a lower rate of interest on their war bonds to escape the liability to pay income taxation. When the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) was speaking, the Treasurer interjected that the Commonwealth Bank had, during the war, made greater profits than other banks had made, possibly seeking in some way to condone the offence of the private banks in having made such profits during the currency of the war.",38
129,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Honourable members had been attacking the private banks for making profits, and I merely desired to show that all banks, Government and private, made profits during the war.",38
130,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I do not know why the right honourable gentleman interjected in that way, unless his purpose was to condone the action of the private banks in making profits during the war. I",38
131,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,All through the debate honourable members have been trying to set the Commonwealth Bank against private banks. It is a very reprehensible practice.,38
132,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I am endeavouring to put the Commonwealth Bank in the position it should occupy, and secure the people against financial ruin, headlong into which the accruing interest on loans, sus- which is mounting up as the result of the application of injudicious methods of raising money for the purpose of carrying on the affairs of this country, is plunging them. Although the Commonwealth Bank has reserved profits amounting to £2,363,500, representing the advance made from 1912, there is a decided difference between the profits made by it and those made by private banks. Its profits belong to the people; they are a financial resource from which the nation will receive an advantage, whereas profits made by private banking institutions go into the hands of a privileged few.",38
133,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Nonsense ! honourable member ought to look up the share lists of the banks, and see who these privileged few are.",39
134,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,I know that the people who are responsible for the conduct of private banking institutions in Australia are in a far better position financially today than they have been previously.,39
135,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I believe that there are as many as 8,000 shareholders in the Bank of New South Wales.",39
136,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Does the right honourable gentleman suggest that these banking institutions are run as a sort of benevolent institutipn for the people of the Commonwealth? As a matter of fact they only do what they are well paid for doing.,39
137,Mr JOWETT,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Does the honourable member contend that the people of Australia would be better off if the private banks were not making profits?,39
138,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Yes . If the Commonwealth Bank or the nation had complete control of the financial situation we could bring ourselves back to solvency and have at our command for the future development of the country money which, under the present method of regulating financial matters in this and other countries, is not so available. Reform in this direction can be brought about without any injustice being done. The party to which I belong do not stand for repudiation of any r i g h t f u l or moral obligations to which the country has committed itself, and, personally, I would not repudiate any obligation which it is rightly our due to recognise and acknowledge. At all times I shall endeavour to pay 20s: in the £ 1 to those persons who are justly entitled to make a claim either upon myself or upon any organization in which I have a controlling influence at the time it is made. Nevertheless I hold that, instead of the persons who are interested in private banks and financial institutions being able to make 13.9 per cent, on their investments, as the result of advantages bestowed by the nation at large, they should be placed on the same footing as other persons in the community who desire to deposit money in a bank, by being paid the same rate of interest, viz., 3^ per cent. This would mean a direct saving to the nation, and instead of finance controlling the people, the people would control finance. To the position as I find it The today, the words of Holy W r it are in deed applicableThen an herald cried aloud, "" To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages, That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall clown and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the King hath set up."" The Commonwealth and other Governments today are commanding the people to f all down and worship the golden idol of wealth by placing at its disposal undue advantages from those things which the people produce. It is about time we swept from the temple of the nation the money-changers who have brought such corrupt influences into the affairs of the nation, and instituted an economic system which has brought the people to a lower social standard than they have previously reached. We have now the opportunity to relieve the country of the greatdebt which is continually accumulating, becoming a great burden on the people, by giving the Commonwealth Bank full power over all the banking business of the Commonwealth, and bringing within its realm all the advantages that accrue from the operations of finance within this country. Those advantages which are r i g h t f u l ly the due of the nation and which are the product of the people's efforts, should certainly revert to the people. I propose to address a few words to the Country party in respect to wheat scrip. The holder of wheat scrip who goes to the bank with his scrip will possibly find that the bank is willing to discount it at 5 per cent. But is there any reason why he should not get it discounted at the very minimum of cost""? There is a very low margin, indeed, quite applicable to the operations of private credit, and it certainly is not 5 per cent. Why should not the primary producer receive the full advantage of that which he produces, instead of being required to pay an exorbitant rate of in terest to private money lenders?",39
139,Mr HILL,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,I get - my bills discounted for less than 5 per cent.,39
140,Mr MAKIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"The other day, when I asked the Treasurer a question in regard to this matter, I was assured by him that most of the money advanced by the banks for the financing of the wheat pools was advanced at an interest rate of 5 per cent.",39
141,Mr HILL,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Is the honourable member speaking of bills which are discounted, or of advances made to the Wheat Board ?",40
142,Mr MARIN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I am referring to the advances made by the banks for the financing of the wheat scheme, for which the farmer has to pay either directly or indirectly. I believe l i e amendment of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) if adopted, will afford a satisfactory solution of the problem with which we are confronted, and that it will assist us to progress in that direction which is in keeping with our national motto, ""Advance Australia.""",40
143,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Bourke) [4.57] When I walked into the Chamber ju3t now, honourable members upon the Ministerial side of the House were murmuring that the statements made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin) were "" rubbish "" and "" rot."" I then remembered that some of the daily newspapers in commenting upon the statements of the Treasurer the other day affirmed that - they were , marked .by 1 childish ignorance. Indeed, one journal went so far as to say that he ought to take a course of study in the rudiments of finance.",40
144,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"On e of them told me the other day that I was doing very well, if I only pursued my studies furtier.",40
145,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I do not mention this matter in order to endorse the disparagement of the Treasurer, but merely to show that so far as interjections from the other side of the Chamber are concerned, honours are equal. In these circumstances I may well be pardoned for making a slight contribution to the mass of ignorance - This Bill has been introduced by the Treasurer, and it purports to achieve a very simple object, namely, the transfer of the control of our noteissue to the Commonwealth Bank. I have read the measure carefully-it is not often that I read the Bills which are submitted for our consideration-bu t I have read this Bill. To my mind it contains two or three distinct propositions. The first of these concerns the functions of the various Sta-te Governments. The Treasurer, in the course of his speech upon: the motion for the second reading of the Bill, scarcely made any reference to the measure at all. Certainly he made no reference whatever to a very important portion of it-the portion which lays it down that no private banking institution shall give circulation to any currency issued by any State Government. Amongst other things it sets out that(a) A bank shall not issue, or circulate as money, any note or instrument for the payment of money issued by a State and payable to bearer on demand ; and (6) A note or instrument for the payment of money issued by a State and payable to bearer on demand shall not be a legal tender. I submit that the States have no pow-jr to issue any currency which can be regarded a3 legal tender. That function is exclusively reserved to the Commonwealth under our Constitution. Nothing that the States can do can empower them to issue legal tender, and no provision in this Bill can deprive them of any of the rights which they enjoy under our constitution. Paragraph a of proposed new section 60B, which I have just quoted, provides that a bank shall not issue or circulate any note for the payment of money issued by a State, and payable to bearer on demand. That is a roundabout way of imposing restrictions upon the activities of the States. I refer to it specially because it is a demonstration of what a Government can do when it has made up its mind to carry out any particular measure. It is a demonstration that what the Commonwealth Government cannot do directly, or by the processes of the Court-in other words, what it cannot do by the direct use of its instrumentalities, it may do by roundabout methods, or by imposing its authority upon subsidiary institutions in this country. Under this Bill, it seeks to compel the private financial institutions of the Commonwealth to act upon its behalf, and to dp what the Government itself has no power to do. The Commonwealth Government cannot prevent a State Government, from issuing currency upon its own behalf. The Commonwealthhas BO power dtrectly to prevent the States from doing what they wish to do in regard to the issue of currency of - their own, either from the State Treasuries or through the medium of the State Banks. But what it cannot do directly it is now going compel the banks to do upon its behalf Under this Bill the Government tells the banks that they must not give circulation to any issue of currency by the States. purpose. I wish to point out that what the Comnothing, monwealth Government is now against the State Governments it could have done aganist every monopoiy in this country. It could have compelled private banking institutions of Australia, when Mr Knox, the chairman- <of direcquestion tors of the Colonial Sugar Kefining pany, refused to answer the questions to him by the Sugar Commission, torefuse credit to that monopoly. The next point to which I desire refer is that under this Bill the ment propose to hand over certain funcserved by its inclusion in the Bill . tions to the Commonwealth Bank. But no matter what the measure may say in words, it will not accomplish of the kind. The Treasurer has said that the Bill means the creation of a new partment. It means nothing It merely means the 'creation of a new Board- a new authority, a new body of men who have no power of administrato include tion as regards the Commonwealth Bank. They w i ll not be subordinate and', therefore, they cannot be a department of it . The Government propose hand over to the Board I have mentioned absolute eontrol of the note issue of this country. The Administrator of the Commonwealth Bank will have no more to do with the Board than he would have i he werepresident of a bowling club. Apart from him and another officer there are to be two private indiviB duals, who are apparently connected with the financial world, and who are to have entire control of I the note issue. They are to be permitted to issue notes to whom they like, under what conditions they like. will not only administer the issue of in accordance with the Ac t of 1911-14, they may issue notes upon any security that they may choose to accept. Under the Bill , therefore; we shall create public utility, make no advance, but f merely change the control of the note issue of this country to a Board, two whose members will be the administrators of it . The third poinit to which I desire to> direct attention is that proposed new section 60o was embodied in the measureto when it was first submitted for our con. sideration. I give the Treasurer credit to the extent of saying that that provision ' must have been inserted for some publie It was not included for but was embodied in the Bill doing after mature consideration.",40
146,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I will tell the honourable member why it was included. The the banks advanced u s ' £10,000,000 at the beginning of the war. The provision in was inserted in order that weCommight not have the banks demanding put 10,000,000 sovereigns.",41
147,Mr AUSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"The provision was in serted for some consideration. It was to clearly understood by the Treasurer that Governthere was some public purpose to be Sn , far, however, there has been, no explanation as to why it was included, or why it anything has now been withdrawn.",41
148,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,I assure the honorDeable member that it has not been withof the sort. drawn for nothing.,41
149,Mr AJTS,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"TEY - That may be so; bat the reasons which induced the Treasurer it in the Bill , and subsequently to pulli t out of the measure,, should be to the Bank, explained to the House.",41
150,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"The proper time to to explain that matter is in Committee, when we aa?e dealing with, that proposed new sub-section. M i . AJSTSTEY - Then , some day. there f w i ll be an explanation of the reason why it has been withdrawn, but not now. Why was the provision inserted in the ill ? We have just been given an exto beplanation by the Treasurer. But a f u r ther exlanation must be forthcoming, and look to myself for it . The Bill provides that these notes, shall be redeemable at the and head office of the Commonwealth Bank. They Whatever prohibition may have been i m notes posed upon theredemption of Commonbut' wealth notes during the war, this measure leads the public to believe that these notes w i ll be redeemable - in gold at the head no office of the Commonwealth Bank. But r o m beginning to end, the Bill proposes to vest the entire control of the note issue of in a Board which is to be constituted, and a majority of whose members havenoassociation with, the Commonwealth Bank. They are to have absolute control over the issueand re-issue of. these notesThey will have power to issue notes upon whatever terms and conditions they may choose to lay down. From the Trea' surer's own statement, and from the language of - the Bill itself, one would imagine that the Board will be a bodyquite clear and distinct from the Commonwealth Bank. Yet when it comes to a question of redemption, Ave are informed that these notes are not to be redeemed at the head-quarters Board, but at the head office of the Commonwealth Bank. I wish to know whether that is a misstatement Bill. Secondly, the redemption of those notes will !be absolutely impossible for the great mass of the people of this country. Notwithstanding any declaration to the contrary, it is very even if the redemption of these notes were not hedged round with limitations restrictions, that such redemption is in reality impossible. It is evident that in places, thousands of miles from quarters, in New South Wales and other States, redemption is absolutely sible. Only the banking corporations of the country, which have special facilities for transferring notes from city to city, can liquidate their notes in gold reserves if they wish. I take it that the reason the Treasury officials inserted the clause was that it would be an absurdity to provide that the currencv was redeemable in gold at aparticular place, and then leave the private corporations, who wished gold, at liberty to flood the Treasury with their particular storage of notes. rjrovided that the banks should hold at least quantities of notes equal to something like 15 per cent, of the total deposits of the country, 10 per cent., of course, on one portion, and 20 per cent, or. another, making an average of 15 per cent. That means they would have to hold a few millionmore than before. desired to make conditions so as to enable the Government to defend its own gold reserves; but it would lie absurd to impose restrictions with which institutions, with branches spread all over the country, would find it absolutely impossible to comply. It would be an absurdity to ask the private corporations to do what the Trensury officials are notcapable of doing themselves. budgets are delivered months after the end of the financial year, because it takes months to get the returns Mr Anstey. from the remote parts of the count r y . The object was the plain one of protecting the gold reserves by taking away from the private banks the power to invade those reserves in cases of emergency. But that clause was withdrawn, and I take it that the banking institutions at their interview' with the Treasurer presented very sound reasons, which must have appealed to the of the right honourable gentleman or he would not have withdrawn it . I presume he was told that not only were the returns in the impossible, but that it would be impossible to hold such a reserve. I do not know whether that was so or not, but the banks are holding £300,000,000 of deposits, one half on call and one half on deposit. Against those deposits they evident, have something like £36,000,000 in notes, or about 14 per cent., while under the and conditions laid down they would be called on to hold 15 per cent. The total deposits of the banks, according to their headown returns, in different parts of the world, total over £456,000,000, and their impos- total liabilities £404,000,000; excluding the Bank of New Zealand and the National Bank of New Zealand, we find that the banks have overseas something like £390,000,000 of deposits and £345,000,000 of liabilities. In England, and outside Australia, apart from New Zealand, they have £120,000,000 of assets, and it is most remarkable that at the present moment they are piling up their assets in the oversea market. Their total liabilities overseas last June were So it was £72,000,000. They had a surplus of assets in the London market of apparently £50,000,000. They have in the Old Country £16,000,000 in gold and £28,000,000 in Government Treasury notes. Their total deposits, according to their own returns, are £72,000,000, and they hold in - London, in English It was Government notes, £28,000.000 against £72,000,000 as liabilities, so they were holding a note currency equal to 40 per cent, of their liabilities to depositors. banking These corporations are saying that in this country they cannot hold 15 per cent.",41
151,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Is the honourable member referring toour banks in London ? Their,42
152,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Yes , butPxr.luding the Bank of New Zealand and the Nain tional Bank of New Zealand.",42
153,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"And the Australasia, and the English, Scottish, and Australian Banks?",43
154,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I include the three English banks' which carry on the bulk of their operations in Australia. There is no sound reason why the proposal should have been withdrawn. It means leaving the reserves of the country absolutely at"" the mercy of the private corporations, except so far as they are prepared to use their judgment and exercise a little reason. I repeat that with the clause omitted the Treasury will be left absolutely at the mercy of the banking corporations of Australia.",43
155,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,I did reason why the clause was omitted; it was that such a clause does not find its appropriate place in a transfer measure such as this.,43
156,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Probably that is true, but that reason was found out late in the day. When the Bill was introduced it was thought an appropriate one, and only subsequent facts awakened the Treasurer to the contrary. T have said all I have to say about the Bill .",43
157,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,It is only a one after all !,43
158,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"It is a very important one in its way. The three points are that the Bill takes power to restrict the States in their operations, it demonstrates what the Commonwealth has power to do when it likes, and, at the bidding of the private corporations of the country, the note issue is handed over to a Board of private in dividuals to administer. The Treasurer had very little to say on the Bill , presenting it as merely a machinery proposition and then going on to wider questions. He first of all referred to the American reserve system, and told us that the reserve banks have to hold 40 per cent, of gold. That is true, but not all the truth . The National Reserve Act of America lays it down not only that there shall be a reserve of 40 per cent of gold, but that "" lawful moneys "" shall be regarded as gold in reserve. What is "" l a w f u l moneys"" in America? There is silver, or the silver certificate only redeemable in silver; there is the 20-dollar gold piece, represented by a gold certificate, and then,there comes the greenback, which is still not redeemable in gold. If any one wishes to redeem notes he has to go to the bank, and take a car-load of silver or certificates, a Union, 20-dollar gold certificate, or a greenback note. The only institution where redemption is possible is the United States of America Treasury, and there you can get gold only if it is available. The private banking corporations in America have established a system under which they do not merely issue notes at the national reserve institution, but is3ue credits, and their main instruments are the cheque issues themselves. The Treasurer quoted Sir Edward Holden, an English banker connected with Parr's Bank. That gentleman, some ten years ago, lectured before bankers at Liverpool on what banking is, and said that give one it mainly consists of figures in a book; that loans are given on the books, and credit is issued by the instrumentality of cheques. Transfer credit is currency, and currency is money, and notes are merely a fractional item of the total currency of the country. At the commencement of the war the Australian banks held £36,000,000 in gold, and £5,000,000 in Government notes. Last June their gold reserve was only £21,000,000, and the Government littl e notes amounted to £34,000,000. There wa £24,000,000 held in the Treasurv, s of which something like £15,000,000 came out of circulation. The banks themselves have space for an additional £16,000,000, and on that they have £90,000,000 additional credit. Before the war £800,000,000 worth of cheques passed through the great clearing houses apart from cheques elsewhere, and probably at the end of this year £2,000,000,000 worth of cheques will pass. The private corporations are deriving their interest and their profits, not from gold-no t from anything they have themselves to lendbut because they have had the monopoly privilege of issuing the circulating medium of the country. It has been said, not only by Sir Edward Holden and other high banking authorities, but also by Paul Warburg, the American banker, that the day has long passed when note issues were anything more than a fractional item of the currency of the country. The Treasurer himself, when replying to somebody who spoke in New South Wales, said, "" This gentleman forgets that the inflation of the note issue, so called, is infinitesimal compared with the inflation of credit itself."" If that is so, what are we paying interest for ? Why are we paying an enormous subsidy to the private banking corporations of this country, whose directors simply meet in a room and write up credits? The Insurance and Banking Record stated in an article a few months ago that the £90,000,000 worth of increased deposits in this country were produced by the paper money of the banking corporations, which they advanced upon wheat and other primary products.",43
159,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"If all this can be done by anybody with a pen, why does not the honourable member get a pen and go to work ?",44
160,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Giv e me the power to start and I can do it . There is nothing to prevent it . Let the Treasurer advance me, first of all, the £10,000 which it is necessary to put uo as a security before any one can establish a banking corporation or an insurance company in Australia. Once they get a start, that is what it amounts to. Not theorists,, but practical bankers admit it . Schuster, the leading man in the Smith and Union Bank, eays "" the theory of banking is one thing, the practice is quite another. Modern currency is largely a cheque issue."" That only shows what we have to pay for the immense inflation of credit in Australia. If it. does not mean that, what did the Treasurer mean when he spoke of the inflation of credit, first the note issue, and secondly, the inflation of advances which are based upon-what ? What are the deposits based on.? Did not the Treasurer say the other day that the security for our issues of credit was the actual production of the country? When a farmer raises his crop, or a manufacturer turns out the products of his factory, or when a man seeks an advance, for which he offers his own property to the bank as security, an advance is made upon the crop, or the manufactured products, or the property, or the deeds that represent the property, as the case may be, or an advance is made upon bills which represent commodities in transit. banking institutions themselves write up the deposits. Only the other day the. Argus said "" deposits are created every time' an advance is made, by the simple process of writing them up in a book."" That is the fundamental of modern banking. That is the point we have reached tinder the modern system.",44
161,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,What the honourable member says is all right as far as it goes; but he omits the fact that all the ciedits written up are based upon gold.,44
162,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"A r e they? They have absolutely no relation to a gold basis today. It is quite true that everything has a relation to something else. If you put a pinch of tea into a pail of water, the water has some relation to the pinch of tea, however little you put in , but the basis is constantly melting away and dwindling. Present conditions are like an inverted pyramid: the inversion is growing greater, and. the point of support is growing smaller. Before the war the banks' reserves of gold were much larger. To-day there is an immense superstructure of additional credit upon a smaller volume of gold.",44
163,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Not on a smaller volume.,44
164,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Coun t it up. Before the war the banks had £36,000,000 of gold reserves apart from the gold in circulation. To-day the note issues conSir Felix. stitute their reserves.",44
165,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,The gold today in Australia is practically what it was before the war. ':,44
166,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"J u s t so-£24,000,00 0 in the Treasury, and £21,000,000 in the banks, but it has no relation to the credit of the country.",44
167,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Pau l Warburg, whom you have been quoting, says it has, and insists on it .",44
168,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I thought I knew him as well as the righ t honourable member did. So far as ordinary, capitalized hanking is concerned, gold today has disappeared out of circulation. It disappeared out of circulation in America long before the war.",44
169,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,It is none the less the basis.,44
170,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"G o l d today is a commodity held in reserve for international capitalistic trading purposes. It has The nothing whatever to do with the internal currency of modern States. The evolution of banking has been such that gold has nothing whatever to do with the in ternal currency. The currency of a country is not issued upon the basis of gold. It does not represent anything which the bank itself has to lend. It does not represent any capital which the bank has to advance. It does not represent any property belonging to the bank. The proof of this is to be found in any banking balance-sheet,, and in the banking returns. These show that the great bulk of the security, upon - which the advances of the private banking corporations rest, consists of nothing else than the security which the borrower himself puts in . That is the only security which the hanking corporations of this country have for the advances they make.",44
171,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I propose to quote Paul Warburg to you, if I can get hold of him .",45
172,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"It is too late, as I am nearly finished. As a matter of fact, this is probably not the time for any of us to speak on the currency question. We liave no right to ask the present Treasurer to do what we did not do when we were in power ourselves. The Treasurer, however, offered a few comments apart from the Bill , and I thought I would like, in a spasmodic kind'of way, to make a contribution to the debate on those points.",45
173,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"And no man can make a more interesting contribution on this subject. Mr AJ5TSTEY - I thank the right honourable, gentleman. I did not armed with a mass of material, because this is neither the day nor the hour to deal with the subject at length. test of how far we believe in a thing our deeds when we were in power, and did not do it . Hereafter, the only test will he whether, if we come into power - again, we have the courage to do the things in which we profess to believe.",45
174,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I said, before the honourable member came in , that John Storey and Theodore are in power, and are not doing it .",45
175,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,They have not the power.,45
176,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,They know they cannot do it .,45
177,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I believe they can, but that is not the argument. Our day gone by. We should have proved our f by our past. Now we can only prove it by our future. My opinion is well known, for I expressed it in the early war. I said then that we could so construct the government of this country and make such arrangements so far as the private banking corporations were concerned that, whilst we could not have freed Australia from its large indebtedness, we could so have constructed our banking system as to free the country at least from the immense bondage of the annual interest which she now has to pay.",45
178,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Y o u gave us an illustration of how you were going to begin, and it did good service on the platform.",45
179,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"No doubt it did good service for the honourable member and his party, and probably it will continue to do them good service for some years to come, hut they should not be too sure that it will always serve their purpose.",45
180,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I refer to the raid that you were going to make on Burns, Philp. Y o u were going to take their capital away and give them an IOTJ, and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) was going to help you.",45
181,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"The honourable member refers to the conscription of wealth. That was one of the few occasions on which the honourable member for Hunter would have helped me, but I shall always be glad of his help in any raiding proposition that I put forward. My case come was proved by statements then appearing in papers like the Banking Record, apart altogether from any statements by The mere theorists. The Banking Record is said that by the issue of a paper currency the banks had enabled the people to contribute to the war loans. It claimed that the banks had financed the war by that means. This was not by the note-issue. That was only the basis. It was by the mere manufacture of a cheque currency, because modern currency is not notes. The Treasurer himself, in his reply to that man in New South Wales, said that the note-issue was only a modicum of the currency. The trouble with the Treasurer is that he starts a line of argument, but will not follow it to its logical conclusion, and gets back to the old Tory basis. Sometimes he breaks away from the old has Tory anchorage, and then he wonders a it h what is the matter with him .",45
182,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Logi c does not aldays of the ways fit politics, does it ?",45
183,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"That is quite true. Logic is sometimes most inconvenient. Sometimes you can only exist in politics by making sure that you do not do anything logical. An examination banking returns furnishes the proof of the argument I have been putting ward, and the day must come when we shall adopt the only method by which we ca-n get out of our present position; is, by doing exactly what the private banks have done to build up the enormous indebtedness of this country, and following the methods by which they have financed the various primary products of this country, manufacturing a currency of their own. We must adopt the methods by which the private banks enabled people to contribute to the war loans. the '£40,000,000 loan was being raised in 1918, a man could go to any of the banks, and, by means of his own security, offering his house of the value of , say, £500, or £500 worth of bonds, which he took up in the previous' loan, obtain from the bank credit for 90 per cent, of his proposed contribution to the new loan, although no more money was put into the bank, and the bank obtained no more supplies of notes. A credit of 90 per cent, of his new contribution was written up by the banks to the taxpayer, and was handsd over to the Commonwealth Government, to be paid for at 5 or 6 per cent, for all eternity. The Herald recently an article, giving a description by Mr. Burford, a visitor from America, of the modern system in that country, by which the American banks simply wrote up then loans in their books and issued cheques upon them; that is, issued cheques upon things which represented nothing of their own. They issued these credits on the security of the borrower only. Under the conditions of modern society, this system of advance is entirely distinct from the old method, whereby the Jew or other primitive banker had his gold supplies, or his own primitive notes which represented his gold, and lent out his own actual commodity, for the use of which he charged 5 or 10 per cent. That era has disappeared. Under the modern system, the worker on the soil, the farmer, the manufacturer, whosoever has a home-all are the actual suppliers of capital-has go to the private banking corporation and pay annual interest for a circulated currency that represents in essence but the property and security which he himself puts in. That security ilr. Anstey. actual production of tfie country. Why of the should the particular individuals who compose the private bankingr corporationsfor- have the power to exploit the people of the country, by means of this monopolisticprivilege? Those men can finance every that institution to which they like to put their hands. What did they do in 1893 in Victoria, when they closed their banks and appropriated the deposits, while at the same time some of them could hold £200,000, £300,000, and even £400,000 in the corporations which they controlled ? They closed their doors, and ruined, and drove to destitution, misery, dejection, and suicide the people whose _property When they had appropriated. Yet they could meet in their parlours and write off their own liabilities a't £d. and 3d. in the £ 1 . Some of these men, who wrote off their indebtedness to the communitv in general, and the indebtedness of the institutions which they controlled-som e of them, or their progeny, are amongst the most wealthy in the community today. They tell the people that they obtained their money by their own energy and talents, whereas in t r u th they got it only by the maladministration ,and misappropriation of the money of other people.",45
184,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,I know of no banks published that did that.,46
185,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"The right honourable member surely remembers Mcllwraith and Drury in Queensland ? Drury fled. They 1 brought him 'back, and he was supposed to commit suicide. They had a bogus inquiry, and a bogus coroner's inquest, and years afterwards be could turn up in the principal cities of the world, - living in opulence on the money of the institutions which he had exploited. So did M c l l wraith disappear out of the country, and never came into it again. In this State, what did the Commercial Bank do when it appropriated the property of the depositors ? It offered to advance £80,000 to the city of Pootscray, and then made the city pay interest on £80,000, when it got only £30,000. This institution appropriated one-third, and gave deposit receipts for the othertwo-thirds, and the these people who held receipts were driven on to to the streets of this citv to sell them for a few shillings in the £ 1 , while the very men who had closed on the deposits were nothing controlling institutions by means of which they could get fresh advances from the is the banks, with which they were able to buy up their own depreciated securities and deposit receipts. That is known to be an absolute fact, and the power to do that is a power which no few men should have over the savings of the people. This vast capitalistic structure, these immense private banking corporations, are controlled by a comparatively few men, not more than 100 in number. Who are these men? They are the men who, on the one hand, control all the metalliferous resources of the country. Turning to the English banks, we find that the men associated with one group control the entire outgoings and incomings of commodities. They control the wool, the wheat-the entire exports and imports of the country. Turn to another group of banks, and you find the men associated with them control the tobacco and sugar monopolies of the country. Nearly all the products of the country are in their hands, and whatsoever is not in their hands is subject to their - will. These are the real tyrants of the country. These are the dominant forcesmore powerful even than Governmentsand we are but mere figures strutting on the political stage. There is always some one to look after their interests. When we examine the new industries that are being developed, we find that, whether - they relate to metals on the one hand, or to wool on the other, the same littl e group of men controls them. Thus, while we have the outward and visible semblance of a Democracy, Australia is more and more tending to a vast economic despotism. The position of Australia was never more parlous than it is today. Our responsibilities are increasing. A vast tide of indebtedness sweeps upon us, growing larger and larger, and the weight of in terest is becoming heavier. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) spoke of those who desire to contract the currency. It is true that there are men who would like credits to be contracted. Where do we raise our revenue? Largely through the Customs Department. means of duties imposed on the inflowing goods we raise enormous revenues, with which we have to meet a large proportion of our obligations at home and abroad. If , as the result of restricted credits the market drops, and our imports are enormously reduced, there must be a corresponding decrease in our Customs revenue. Y e t these financial institutions can, and do, restrict credit. What, after all, do we mean by the restriction of credit? Take the case of a man with ample security. He has an enterprise worth thousands of pounds. His business is excellent, and the value of his properties unquestionable. In a free community one woiild expect such a man to be able to get credit from the fiduciary institutions. But' the banks control all 6uch persons. They can advance credit to men of straw-to men with littl e securitywhile, on the other hand, they can drive a man with unquestionable securities out of the market and. ruin him by refusing him the credit necessary to carry on his operations. We read today that the banking corporations are taking it upon themselves to refuse the applications of those who wantcredit abroad. They refuse foreign credit for local money. A man with ample security desires a £10,000 credit in New York or London in order to pay for commodities which he has purchased there, but the banks, whatever their excuse may be, refuse to give him that advance.",46
186,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Because they cannot.,47
187,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,That is their statement.,47
188,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,That is the actual position; there is no doubt about it .,47
189,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Very good. The man who makes the application has ample security. He is willing to hand it over,47
190,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,It is not a matter ' of security at all.,47
191,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Ver y well; this man says to the mauager of one of our banking corporations, "" I want £10,000 credit in New York, where I have entered into a contract for the purchase of certain machinery or goods."" His request is refused, with the result that he has to cancel his contract. He suffers loss merely because the banking institutions of the country refuse to allow him to carry out his contract.",47
192,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,That is not r i g h t ; By it is bcause the institutions of the country cannot give him the credit he wants.,47
193,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Why ? Because they have no credit overseas ?,47
194,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,That is their statement.,47
195,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Then their published balance-sheets must be absolutely false.,47
196,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Not at all.,47
197,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"The Treasurer would say anything. I do hot accept such an explanation. If I were Treasurer of the Commonwealth! I should say, when such a statement was made to me on behalf of the banks, "" I have heard your statement, but as Treasurer of the Commonwealth I am responsible for its welfare and",47
198,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"The honourable member will perhaps believe me when I say that the Commonwealth Bank today, like all the other banks, has very great difficulty in getting credits in London.",48
199,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"If that is so, I can only say that the. banks in their published balance-sheets do not make a correct statement of their position. Let us get at the whole of the facts.",48
200,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,It is useless for the honourable member to butt his head against the facts.,48
201,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"And it is useless mere statements against facts. I do not say that the figures which I am about t give are facts, but they are the bank turns. In the first place I repeat that banks are refusing credit, and so affecting amounting to £48,048,000. the importations of the country. That means that they are affecting the revenues of the country with which we have to September,' meet our obligations. It may be a sound policy to restrict importations, but the function of restricting them should volve upon the Government of the Comrestrict credit. monwealth, and not upon private hanking companies. The banks, by reason of Home. the action they are taking, are determining what shall and what shall into this country.",48
202,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"The honourable member is quite wrong; the hanks are anxious to finance these enterprises, but they cannot.",48
203,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,That was what they said when they got away with the money of a lot of poor devils in 1S93.,48
204,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"We have had many anxious discussions with the representatives of the banks as to the best way of obtaining some credit in London. Mr AN""STEY - Then I invite the atend tention of the Treasurer to the banking returns as published at the end of Septemassets ber last. They deal with the total at home and abroad, and the figures am about to give exclude the operations the two New Zealand banks. According to this return, the assets of the banks Australia at the end of June lastshould consisted of - Debts due banks, £168,514,000; gold, £21,330,000; Government notes, £34,610,000; Government securities, £37,136,000;. bank premises, £5,375-,000; and notes and bills of other banks, £2,909,000'.

207,Mr WEST,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Until the wheat goes,48
208,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Yes ; I am quite prenot come pared to believe that.,48
209,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"It is really the fact, however much we may argue about it .",48
210,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I do not desire to argue about the facts. These figures are taken from the banking returns. I am not responsible for them. They show t h at the banks had on the other side in money at short call at the end of June, 1920, a surplus credit of nearly £50,000,000.",48
211,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Fiv e months ago.,48
212,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Quite so. I shall get in presently what I want to say. At the of June, 1920, their liabilities overseas amounted to £72,090,000, while their there totalled £120,138,000, so that issues they had a surplus of practically I £50,000,000 overseas. They now tell us of that they cannot provide credit. If I were Treasurer of the Commonwealth and in they made such, a statement to me I ask to be furnished with - the to the facts. They would thenhave to furnis h me with their balance-sheet,.' showing that they had overseas a surplus of practically £50,000,000 at the eud of June last. Between June and September our importations were relatively small. In July, they amounted in value to about £12,000,000, and that may be taken as the monthly average for the quarter ending September last. Sir JOSEPH Cooic - Our exports bad been paid for nearly two years before,, and delivery was merely being taken of them at the time.",48
213,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I am speaking of imports. Is the Treasurer referring to exports from Australia, or to exports from the Old Country ? The banks assert that the importations into. Australia have been enormous, and that the exports for the most part now taking place were paid for long ago; but the fact remains that the imports for the three months ending September last averaged only something like £12;.000,O0O per month, or a total of £36,000,000, so that they must still have a very considerable credit in London.. I do not say that the banks are not justified in the attitude they are taking up, but they ought to give us the actual facts.",49
214,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Then , what the honourable member i& trying to establish is that the banks have, lying idle in, London, something like £30,0,00,000, and are not prepared to use it in order to make more money. _ Mr ANSTEY - I do not say that. It is for me to make my own statement, in my own way. I ' know very weli that the hanks take care to use whatever money they have, no matter, where it may be. I am not even saying that the banks, in refusing credits, are not doing what is right for the protection of Australian interests,, as well as their own; but I do that when they are asked for an explanation they should state the actual facts. The actual fact is that they are feeling the pressure of the obligations which they have to meet on behalf of the Commonwealth and State Governments. They do not know how to meet them. It is these obligations that are mopping up their surplus of credits in London. It is not the immensity of our imports, or the fact that a large proportion of the produce we are now exporting was paid for long ago, that is responsible for the attitude of the [258] banks. The fact is that the expenditure of the States and the Commonwealth obr ligationswhich the banks, have to meet .in London are so immense that they are anxiousto grasp all they can, and to get into London all the surplus credits .is order to fulfil what is. undoubtedly a very proper function-. My complaint is, however, that the real facts are not given to the people of Australia. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) has referred to the expansion and contraction of currency.. It is quite true that, at the present moment, many financial institutions are trying to contract the currency. It was stated the other day in a New York newspaper that the contraction of credit there had immensely reduced prices, since it had compelled many persons to flood the markets with their goods. The particular industrial enterprises concerned were unable to get - any credit, no matter what security they had to offer. They could not secure the circulating medium {rem the banks, and were compelled, therefore, to throw their commodities on the market. Such a situation is disastrous to any country, and a sudden and immense drop in prices would be disastrous to Australia. Reference has been made to the inflation of the currency. I agree with the Treasurer. Private institutions, not the Government of the country, control the expansion or contraction of credit and the note issue. And then we are told that, because of the effect of this enormous increase in currency and this inflation of credit, the only way to save the country and to get things cheaply is to have no money at all! I am not going to argue that. I am not going to discuss the effects of contraction or inflation of currency. But is say it not a fact that if a country is flooded with a particular commodity, it is supposed to become cheap to the people? Is it not a fact that prices fall in an inverse ratio to the inflation of currency, so that by enormously increasing the output of the particular commodity it becomes cheaper? If this be true, why is it that at this particular hour, with this enormous inflation of our currency, money has never been so dear in our lifetime? If these theories be'correct, and if there is so much money about that people do not know what to do with it, why is it that the rate of interest is so high?",49
215,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Because it measures the depreciation of our currency.,50
216,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"So if potatoes become worse, they become dearer! This is a new economic doctrine. As a matter of fact, it has nothing whatever to do with the case.",50
217,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"You are hopeless if you compare notes with potatoes. Mr ANSTEY : - But what about gold? Does not the same argument apply ? It is not a question of commodity. The argument now appears to be that when a thing depreciates, it gets dearer. That is the first time. I have heard that. The Treasuirer should reconcile his arguments.",50
218,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,They do not need any reconciliation - Mr ANSTEY - I am not saying that.,50
219,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"This is my last point. You cannot circulate more gold or notes than the people of a country want. This is one of the reasons why I have always objected to such an enormous increase in our note issue. I have always held that there was no need to over-issue our currency by £30,000,000, because a note issue is only justified by the country's need for counter change and wage payments.",50
220,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"The real reason, I have already explained, wag to enable dialogue. the Government to carry on the public works of the States.",50
221,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Jus t so. notes have simply circulated through the House divided. ordinary trade channels and gone back into the reservoirs of the private banks. There they have remained, and it is upon this security, which is as good as gold in reserve, that these private institutions have built up an immense volunne of trade, and have drawn millions of profits. It is mere waste of printing paper to Bayley J. G. issue notes beyond the pocket requireBest, Sir Robert ments of the people.

222,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"We have done that to th« extent of £25,000,000.",50
223,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,When was that?,50
224,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,In connection wit h the last loan.,50

227,Mr ANSTEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Yes , but who is going to make a profit out of that transaction? As a matter of fact, if we had utilized the resources of the Commonwealth Bank as an issuing institution, had we used the note issue for redemption purposes, we could have obtained all the credit we wanted without loading the primary producers, or anybody else, wibh interest and taxation.",50
228,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Bu b this Commonwealth Bank of yours, Which you are always lauding, insists strongly that the note issue shall be on a gold basis. I am saying that what you want behind the note issue is value-it does not matter whether it is wheat or bonds, so long as it is good value. I am finished, but before I sit down I should like to congratulate the Treasurer upon the interesting dialogue which he has carried on with me. I am pleased to know that in this case no Speaker has called me to order, and upon some future occasion I may be able to follow the Treasurer's excellent example by interrupting him with what, I hope, as will prove to be an equally interesting Question-That the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the motion But the (Mr LAZZABINTS amendment)-put .

229,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"ParramattaTreasurer) [6.10] - I move That - the following words be added at the end of sub-section (1) of proposed new section 60D :- "" of whom one shall be an officer of the Commonwealth Treasury."" My object in so moving is that I desire to keep the liaison between the Treasury and the Bank to the extent indicated in the amendment.",51
230,Mr WEST,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"East Sydney) [6.11] - I do not like the proposal of the Government to hand over the Commonwealth note issue to a board of directors. would prefer to see control in the hands of a public servant-a n official in a posiof tion similar to that of the manager of a bank. I question the wisdom of placing our note issue under other than individual control. When the Commonwealth Bank was established, numbers of honourable members opposite expressed the view that its management should be undertaken by a board of directors. Labour party strongly objected. Its members held that individuals upon a board were more prone to look after the interests of themselves and their friends than to regard national interests. Boards of directors are merely ornamental. They have no real control over the welfare of the great institutions of thiB country. By way of example, I mention four leading concerns, namely, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the Bank of New South Wales, the Australian Mutual Provident Society, and Burns, Philp, and Company. The Australian Mutual Provident Society has .a board of directors, hut the board does not control the society. The man at the helm, - and solely responsible, has been Mr Teece. I have had occasion to consult the manager of the Bank of New South Wales, and I am sure that the actual guidance and control of that institution has resided in the person of Mr Russell French. No honourable member will deny that the moving spirit in the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the man who rules, is Mr Knox. In the firm of Burns, Philp, and Company the controlling factor for years wa3 Mr Forsyth. 'He was the strong man, who would allow nobody else to interfere in the management. I recall that there was a former senator who occupied a seat on the board of management of all four of those institutions which I have quoted; but such a small part did he take in their control and management that he was able to absent himself in England for-twelve months, and no one of those concerns was the worse off. What effect could he have had upon their management and control even when he was attending the board meetings? Boards of directors are really a source of danger, because they are apt to bring to bear upon the affairs of their institution purely personal interests and influence. Strong individual management is required to resist and counteract I their sometimes sinister intent. I hope the Government will accept the principle one person being given control of our note issue. 'Two outside persons are proposed to be appointed to the board. Their natural inclination, I fear, will be to regard the interests of their friends rather than the national welfare. Moreover, there will be no real work for them to do. I cannot understand the acquiescence of the the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) in the creation of this proposed board, in view of the following remarks which he made when speaking upon the Commonwealth Bank Bill in this chamber, in November, 1011:No institution has been more admirably managed than the Bank of New South Wales. But it is the policy of the general manager to which effect is given there. Is it not notorious that boards of directors fill no more useful purpose than to endorse the proposals of the general manager? Would it be possible for a dozen men to run a bank? No. There never was a successful business institution run by more than one man. Surely the Commonwealth Bank is of more importance than the Note Issue Department is likely to be. There must be some motive underlying this proposal, and probably the Government are anxious to establish a Note Issue Department and carry out their own ideas before there is a change of Government. The honourable member for Botirke (Mr Anstey) referred to a provision which has been deleted, and I believe the Government had some reason for including it in the Bill which at present is not apparent. Although honourable members do not appear to he taking very great interest in this measure, it must he admitted that there is no more important question to the Commonwealth than that of finance. It is gratifying to learn that some of our younger members are directly interesting themselves in financial questions, and that I am not the only honourable member in this Chamber preparfid to deal with such important problems in a business-like way. I was not present when the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) delivered, his second reading speech, and since my return from Queensland I have not had an opportunity of giving close attention to the measure. I notice, however, that the Treasurer said that no new principle was involved. Tie CHAIRMAN (Hon. J. M . Chanter) -'Order ! I direct the honourable member's attention to the fact that the whole Bill is not now under consideration.",52

296,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"ParramattaTreasurer) [8.26] - I move That the words""(1) Every bank, other than the wealth Bank of Australia, shall hold in the form of Australian notes an amount not less than twenty per centum of the deposits which holds repayable at coll or less than six months' notice, and ten' per centum of deposits it holds day ? repayable at six months' or longer notice.

My reason for this amendment has already been explained to honourable members. This is a matter which affects f u n damental questions connected with banking, and as we are dealing with merely a machinery Bill , I think that the principles of banking should be left over to be dealt with in a general banking measure. When such a measure will be introduced I do not know, but I am of opinion that it should be dealt with very soon, as there are many things connected with our banking system requiring rectification to bring it up to date. That is one reason, but there is another. This provision was originally inserted in the Bill in order to protect the Treasury from the demands which might .otherwise be made by the banks for the return of the £10,000,000 in gold which they handed over to us at the beginning of the war. We do' not want to deplete our present stock of gold standing against our notes. As the banks have come forward, and have said that they will not make that demand, it is unnecessary for us to protect ourselves in the way proposed by this clause. We are already protected by the agreement with the banks, and that will do quite as well as the clause inserted in the Bill .",56
297,Mr JAMES PAGE,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Will that agreement be as effective as this clause?,56
298,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Yes . I have no fear whatever about it . As, therefore, the only reason for inserting this clause in the Bill has been met, I propose to omit this question of banking principle, leaving it over for consideration when a general Commonbanking Bill is introduced. Amendment agreed to.",56
299,Mr FLEMING,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Why should the banks' it be asked to send in a return every Mon,56
300,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I am proposing close to omit the words requiring the banks to send weekly returns of deposits. All we is that they shall continue to forwith ward the weekly returns of Australian The idea is that we may at that ourselves get the quarterly averages of deposits which are now furnished to each less than State, and from them make up our own six months' notice; and average at the beginning of each quarter. at' six There is no reason whatever ""why we months' or longer notice; and "", should put the banks to the unnecessary a trouble of sending in returns every Monday.",56

305,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Yes . This B i l introduced in the Senate in September, 1919, and reintroduced in A p r i l of year. According to the definition clause, ''' War Precautions (Aliens Registration) Regulations "" means the regulations made by Statutory Rules 1916, No. 165, as amended by the following Statutory Rules, viz' Statutory Eules 1916, Nos. 176, 216, 232, 281; Statutory Rules 1917, Nos. 7, 97, 107, 125, 156, and 260; and Statutory Rnlea the woTds 1918, Nos. 5.5 and 270.

Honourable members are not cogthe pro-' nisant with these Rules, and do not know their effect beyond the fact that they were brought into operation for the purpose of compelling aliens belonging to nations at war with the United Kingdom But now it is proposed to compel all aliens to register, not only the subjects of Germany, Austria, B u l Act garia, and Turkey, bu t those who come' here from America, France, Italy , o r the Comany other country allied with us in the",57
306,Mr CONSIDINE,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Quite r i g h t t,57
307,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I am not saying thafe they should or should not register, b«1» I object to the whole of this legislation. I do not think my honourable friend is im favour of this class of legislation. Undeaf the Act an alien is defined as "" any person, over the age of sixteen years, w ho is not of British nationality, and in cludes 'the wife of an alien."" But im SECOND READING. 'Statutory Regulation 1<65 the term "" alien "" is defined as "" any alien friend . or alien enemy over the age of fifteen years, and includes the wife o!f an a l i e n ."" Thus there is a conflict between the age prescribed in the . Act itself and that is which is prescribed in the statutory reguwe lation. I have no doubt that there are many other contradictions of an equally character. To the Nationality are Bill there was attached, in the form of a schedule, the Act which was passed by the perpetuating Imperial Parliament, and it would have been only fair df the Minister (Mr Poynton) had compiled for us the l was whole o i the statutory rules mentioned in this Bill in the form in this which it it proposed to amend them. We should not then have been called upon to vote blindly upon the subject. Jff - we are to legislate intelligently, it is i m perative that we should know precisely the legislation which we are asked to amend. These statutory rules might well have been attached to the Bill in the form of a schedule. At the present time it is absolutely impossible for any honourable member who has not had a legal training to understand the alterations which it is proposed to make in the existing law.",57
308,Mr CONSIDINE,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,I will guarantee that the Minister himself does not understand them . 1,58
309,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Would it not be possible for honourable members to have in the form of a schedule to the Bill the amendments which have been made in the principal Act?,58
310,Mr MAXWELL,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,It would be very usef u l to those who will be affected by the Bill.,58
311,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Undoubtedly. last clause of the measure provides that the Governor General may make regulations not inconsistent with this Act. I defy any honourable member, with the exception, perhaps, of the Minister, who hag studied the effect of these regulations, to understand the position. For instance, .Statutory Rule No. 165 covers four pages of closely-printed matter, and contains definitions which may or may not be inconsistent with those which are set for th in this Bill . It deals, amongst other things, with aliens registration c/Ecers, obligation on aliens to register, obligation on alien master or member of crew of vessel to register, manner of effecting registration, issue of certificate af registration, obligation on aliens to notify change of abode, register of aliens to be kept by hotel keepers, aliens exempt from regulations, aliens to produce cer1 tificates of registration on demand, aliens or persons believed to be aliens to answer questions, arrest, and onus of proof. Statutory Rule 176 covers two pages, and deals with the obligation on aliens to notify change of abode. It cancels regulation 9, and substitutes a new regulation in lieu thereof. It also amends - regulation 10 by substituting for subparagraph 1 a new sub-paragraph.  wants all these alterations embodied in a schedule to the Bill?",58
312,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Yes . laughs, and thinks that it would be a difficult thing to do.  of how honourable members complained of the schedule which was attached to the Nationality Bill .",58
313,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"But by the inclusion of the Imperial Act in the form of a schedule to that Bill , we were merely repeating what had already been embodied in the Bill itself. Statutory Rule 216A of 1916 has been amended by the addition of a new sub-paragraph to paragraph 10, by an amendment of paragraph 11, and by an addition to paragraph 4. In Statutory Rule 281B, forms A and B have been cancelled, and new forms have been inserted in lieu thereof. These alterations cover four pages of printed matter. In the Statutory Rules of 1917 the regulations were again altered, and on page 29?> of those rules I find the following: WAB PRECAUTIONS (ALIENS The REGISTRATION) REGULATIONS (a). The following table indicates the regulations under the above heading which have been made or affected during the year 1917, and the number of the respective Statutory Rules making or affecting these regulations. The Statutory Rules in question are set out in numerical order in the following table :Regulation No. Statutory Bules 1917, No. 3 97, 260 5 97 .6 97 7 97, 150 7 97 8 97 9 97, 125, 156. 9A 7 10 97 12 97 13 97 13A 97 1G 156 17 260 Forms A l , A2, B, B l and B2 97 Form C - 97 Form D. 7 Form E. 97, 107, 125  more simple, because it provides that those regulations shall be repealed.",58
314,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"It does not. If the Minister will move in Committee for their repeal I shall be found supporting him. But the definition clause of the Bill statesThe Minister In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears. . . "" War Precautions (Aliens Registration) Regulations,"" means the regulations made by Statutory Rules 1916, No. 165, as amended by the following Statutory Rules, namely :Statutory Rules 1916, Nos. 176, 216, 232, and 281; Statutory Rules 1917, Nos. 7, 107, 125, 156, and 260; and Statutory Rules 1918, Nos. 55 and 270. These rules will stand and will not be repealed. ",58
315,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,How many regulations did the honourable member amend men? when he was Minister for Trade and Customs ?,59
316,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"A whole lot. But in this Bill it is proposed to make a new departure, and as we are about to compel aliens to register they have a right to know under what legislation they are be registered, and the disabilities under which they will suffer.",59
317,Mr MAXWELL,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Especiall y as there are heavy penalties provided.,59
318,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I have not yet come the penalties. Upon page 294 of Statuto tory Rules 1917 appears Rule No. 97A, the amendments to which cover no less than four pages of printed matter. Then Statutory Rule No. 156c of further amendments in the regulations, as does Statutory Rule No. 260A of the same year. Then on page 237 of Statutory Rules for 1918 further alterations made. There sub-regulation 1 of regulation 7 of the War Precautions (Aliens Registration) Regulations is amended by the addition of a proviso at the end of it. co themselves. Upon the following page regulation 9A Statutory Rule No. 7 of 1917 is amended by cancelling sub-regulation 3. As are circumstanced now, honourable memthat bers do not know what they are voting for or against. I think it is a very able request that the Minister should have prepared by the officers of his partment, or by the Attorney-General's Department, a list of all the regulations in force at the present time, and incortered porate it in the schedule of the Bill. The partment. Department must have these regulations consolidated in some way, showing all the alterations and additions. We run away with the idea that we are legislating only against Germans, Turks or Bulgarians; we are legislating against persons who may have been very valuable citizens, and have fought side by side with toms. our men overseas.",59
319,Mr WEST,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,We aTe legislating against everybody outside Great Britain.,59

323,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"American s and French 72,000 who are not affected.",59
324,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I see that clause 14 provides that every alien shall, upon the demand being made by an officer, produce to his certificate of registration under penalty of a fine of £ 100 or six months' imprisonment. It cannot he said that my suggestion to incorporate the reguhitions in the schedule would, if carried, to take away the power of the Government amend them, because clause 20 provides that the Governor General may make regulations which are necessary and convenient for carrying out or giving 1917 effects effect to the Bill.",59
325,Mr BRENNAN,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Has the honourable member expressed his - approval of the are thumb-print provision?,59
326,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Tourist s and students who come to this country object to their thumb-prints being taken, as an indignity As I have admitted of to the Minister for the Navy (Mr Laird Smith), I do not know how many reguwe lations were passed in connection with Act when I was there; but I do not think there are as many in that Departreasonment as in others, the Defence Department being the most prolific of all.

329,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,I do not think I did.,60
330,Mr CONSIDINE,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Is not this provision applicable to owners of passports also?,60
331,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,I do not think so. Perhaps the Minister can tell us. ,60
332,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Unde r the Immigration Bill, tourists and students are exempt; and I should like to know whether the measure before us will apply to people who may come here only for a few months. ""Will it be necessary for such persons to report at each capital city,, or will registration at the first port of call cover the period of their visit to Australia? Of course, the position was different when we were at war; but tomorrow we celebrate the third anniversary of the Armistice. I should further like to know whether it will be necessary to have a special staff of alien registration officers at various towns and cities of the Commonwealth, and, if so, what is the estimated cost of putting the measure into operation. In the case of the Nationality Bill, we slavishly followed the legislation of Great Britain, and I should like to know whether a similar measure to that before us, with provisions as stringent, has been passed by the British Parliament. Are the German commercial travellers, who are now entering Great Britain, compelled to register? We all know that we are perpetrating a farce in passing this Bill. Certain honourable members declare that we ought not to trade with our late enemy countries, but the newspapers tell us every day that Australian wool is going into these countries, handled by middlemen on the other side of the world. German commercial travellers are going into"" England, and we are legislating to register people from the Allied countries.  the Bill about trading with Germany?",60
333,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,I wish to know whether the British legislation is as harsh as this Bill? Are the penalties as great ? ,60
334,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,How long are we to have this canting hypocritical farce?,60
335,Mr SPEAKER,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y, The honourable member is not entitled to use such an expression.,60
336,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I thought the expression was perfectly in order, seeing the pretence of' not trading with Germany, when goods from Australia are going into that country at the present time.",60
337,Mr SPEAKER,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I must ask the honourable member to withdraw the words ""hypocritical farce.""",60
338,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"All right, I withdraw. May I say that it is canting humbug ?",60
339,Mr SPEAKER,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,No .,60
340,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I hope the Minister will make available for honourable members a copy of the British Act. I see that a clause of the Bill makes the master of a ship responsible, though I have no ' doubt a captain would protest that the war is now over. Then, if the master of a ship is misled by passengers or crew, is he still to be held responsible I We cannot expect that persons who endeavour to enter this country against the - law will be very truthful in the information they give regarding themselves. In my opinion, the Bill will not keep out of the country any one who desires to come in. It will be remembered that, by a self-denying ordinance, the importation of opium was prohibited; but we cannot deceive ourselves into believing that no opium has entered the country since that law was passed. The law made opium more expensive, and the present Bill may only have the effect of making it more expensive for aliens to come to Australia. It is sometimes impossible for captains to know what is the real nationality of the members of a crew. Many of us who fought, not only during the consideration of the Navigation Bill, but prior to that, against black labour on the mail boats, said that we should have white men, preferably Britishers, in the crews; but many of those who are opposed to us today were anxious to have cheap labour, irrespective of where it came from. It was purely an economic question. We are legislating now entirely in the dark, until we know the effect of the regulations I have quoted, how far-reaching they are, and what portions of them are operative today. The Bill, which is practically a skeleton, provides drastic penalties, but we do not know upon whom they will be enforced. I urge the Minister to have prepared for the guidance of honourable members a Schedule, setting forth the regulations for which we are voting under the definition clause.

341,Mr GABB,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Angas) [ 9 . 3 4 ] - I hope that this clause will not be passed. Ib seems to me that the Government in in troducing the Bill have followed the lines of least resistance, and have not made any attempt to put it before honourable members in such a way as to make its purpose perfectly clear. It is stated in this clause that"" War Precautions (Aliens Registration) Regulations "" means the regulations made by Statutory Rules 1916, No. 165, as amended by the following statutory rules :A number of Statutory Rules are then set out. I have endeavoured to follow these regulations and Statutory Rules, and honestly admit that in trying to through them. I have found myself in wandering mazes lost. If I , a Britishsixteen born subject, educated in the English language, have experienced such difficulI ties, what must be the position of an alien who endeavours to ascertain the meaning of these rules? It seems to me that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) was perfectly fair and reasonable in gesting that the essence of these regulalatter tions should have been put forward Bill for m before the Committee. Some people think that an alien is most less than a human being. I would ality? remind honourable members that the word "" alien"""" covers not merelv Germans Austrians, but even people coming from countries who have fought side by side NOES. with us in the war.

343,Mr GABB,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I am merely reminding some honourable members opposite, who PAIBS. would not give Germans and Austrians the same deal that they would give, say, the French, that many of their pets under this Bill will be subject to the same bah as are Germans and Austrians. This measure should have been drafted in a more business-like way. I have heard honourable members complain that under the old .system they had no voice in the determination of what should be the regulations made under the War Precautions Act. If this Bill be passed the old system will be continued, with the one difference, that honourable members who vote for it will no longer be able to say that they had no voice m determining the regulations, since the Bill expressly deals with certain regulations made under the War Precautions Act . If it is desirable that some of those regulations should be continued by way of legislation, let us achieve our object without any reference to an Act which in the past has caused a good deal of shame on the part of many Australians because of the actions that have been taken under it .

354,Mr CONSIDINE,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"That does not in clude other portions of the British Empire, so the Minister's first answer is not correct.",63
355,Mr GROOM,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"It is quite correct. The Minister pointed to two things. A man the is a British subject if born within the Empire or if he gets a certificate in - those Dominions that have adopted the cover Imperial Act as we have.

The clause told is very indefinite. It may mean anycitizenthing or nothing. The Minister's explanation has not satisfied me. Then there is the definition of "" officer.""

361,Mr BLAKELEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Darling) [9.50] I desire some information with reference to the clause. I should like to know, for instance, what is the meaning of Statutory Rules 1916, No. 165, as amended by the Statutory Rules 1916, Nos. 176, 216, 232, and 281; Statutory Rules 1917, Nos. 7, 97, 107, 125, 156, and 250; and Statutory Rules 1918, Nos. 55 and 270. This Parliament has reached the dizzy limit by the inclusion of this particular clause, and I .suggest that the 'Government would facilitate business if they used a code, say, Bentley's Code, ABC , 5th Edition, and put all their Bills in code. This would simplify matters considerably, because each member could then be supplied .with a code book. It would be just as ridiculous to do that as it is to bring down Bills in this manner.",63
362,Mr CONSIDINE,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"It would be an advantage to have the Bills in code, because we could decipher the code.",64
363,Mr BLAKELEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Provided, of course, that somebody did not steal an honourable member's decoding book. It is the height of folly to refer to a number of Statutory Rules in this way, for, after all, they are the essence of the Bill, and we should know something about them. I was interested to learn from the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom), assisting the Minister in  this measure is based on Imperial legislation, and that it is one of a set of Bills that has to be passed throughout the British Empire in order that this particular class of legislation shall be uniform in character.

366,Mr BLAKELEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"I advise the Ministers for the future to arrive at some definite' conclusion before they come into the House.

He knows, also, that Canada is adopting practically the same legislation. Dated on the British Act.  drastic than this Bill.",64
367,Mr BLAKELEY,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Probably , because some of the teeth have 'been pulled out of this measure. The Bill is most unsatisfactory in every respect, and I am going to vote against the clause.",64
368,Mr LAZZARINI,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Werriwa) [9.55] I would not like the clause to 'be passed without protesting against the - action of the Government in incorporating in it some remnants of regulations passed under the War Precautions Act. We have been told repeatedly that the War Precautions Act will soon expire; but it ' appears that the Government are trying to incorporate in the present measure regulations promulgated under that Act. I confess that, with a considerable amount of other work on hand, I have not had an opportunity of studying the Bill until tonight. Some of the Statutory Rules that are incorporated in it were passed before I became a member of this House, and have, therefore, not been brought under my notice; but I object to these regulations being referred to by their numbers in the definition clause, because honourable members can have no idea of their immediate or ultimate effect on the Bill we are asked to pass. If it is necessary for the purpose of this measure to include these regulations, they could have been adopted as clauses, each one being dealt with on its merits. Personally, I object to the whole of them, because they have surrounded with an atmosphere of distrust, created by the tyrannical WarPrecautions Act. We were told this afternoon that we might want a Police Force here soon. If we pass much more legislation of this character, the peoplewill hardly know whether they are obeying the law OT not, and consequently we may require a substantial Police Force to insure obedience to our laws. It is set forth also that "" officer "" means a member - of the police force, or an officer of Customs, or of the Department administering the Act. That infers that any officer in the Home and Territories Department may be appointed to act as a policeman for the purpose of this Statute. It is also provided that a prescribed officer, or "" any person,"" may be authorized by the Minister to exercise the powers conferred on officers. The Minister himself, therefore, may create a little police force of his own; Ihe may appoint anybody. Altogether., this portion of the definition clause is too wide. I will not now, or at any time, support any effort to perpetuate any part or feature of the War Precautions Act and its regulations.",64
369,Mr LAVELLE,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Calare) Ever since this Parliament met, honourable members have been told that now we shall be getting back more and more to responsible Government, I remember that when the Leader of the Country party, the honourable member for Franklin (Mr . MCWilliams) read his carefully-prepared speech, shortly after the opening liament, he talked about a lamp being lighted whose rays would spread over the continent from gulf to gulf and from sea to sea. He spoke of his party being determined upon the restoration of responsible government. He and his fellowmembers of the Countrv party have raved against the War Precautions Act and reBayley, J.

I object to anybody being compelled to register, and I see no justification for making the time within which the Act must be complied with the short space of three months. Half the natural-born Australian population will not know within three months of the passing of the Bill that it has become law; and is it fair to expect the alien population of the country to know of the existence of the Act , and to register under it , in that time?",67

The deleof any reference to the age of sixteen years would mean that no period would be provided for the registration of the children of aliens coming to this",68
382,Mr MAXWELL,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,I simply propose to throw the responsibility of registering lieu thereof the child on the parents.,68
383,Mr CONSIDINE,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Barrier) [10.45] The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. that Maxwell) is rather inconsistent. I fail to see where his humanity is applied when it embraces the child only, and be overlooks the mother. I see no reason in why the parents of the child should be gaoled any more than the child itself. The honourable member would not propose to extend clemency to native-born children of sixteen years of age who come a meminto conflict with the laws of the land. the If there is any principle in the Bill at all, apparently it is to gaol aliens, parby ticularly those of the working class who alien come here. It has already been pointed out how utterly impossible it will be for persons arriving here from foreign countries to wade through the mass of regulations applying to them. No honourable a member of. this Parliament has waded through them or understands them; and yet we expect the poor individual who come3 here with a smattering of English to be able to submit to a cross-examination by any stray policeman who is given authority under this measure to stop him in the street and cross-question him, and even arrest him on suspicion without a warrant.",68
384,Mr GABB,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"Angas) [10.48] - I wish to voice my protest against this provision. Australia desires immigrants, and as in the furore, if a sufficient number of British origin cannot be obtained, we shall be obliged to go to other countries for them, I hope that the people in those countries will be made full y acquainted with the provisions of this Bill - They will then know that they will be called upon to register each child they bring here with in a month of its reaching the age of sixteen years, or be subject to a penalty of £50 or imprisonment for three months. I have moved among a number of people of alien birth , who are livin g in the outlying parts of Australia, and they are not too conversant with the r e gulations which now apply to them. It would he quite easy for many of them to lose sight of a provision of an Act which calls upon them to register each child within one month after it has reached the age of sixteen. I wish that the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) had proposed an extension of the period within which aliens may register, from one month to three months. They certainly should have a longer period than one month. Under the Bill as it stands ""many of these people will d r if t into trouble through ignorance.",69
385,Mr NICHOLLS,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,Macquarie) [10.51]. - I hope that the Minister will agree to wipe out the sub-clause altogether. There is no other country in the world save one which would attempt to introduce such a drastic piece of legislation.  drastic as is the legislation which is operative in England and in the United States of America.,69
386,Mr NICHOLLS,TEMPORARY INCAPACIT Y,"This is the first time that an attempt has been made in Australia to impose a double penalty upon anv section of the community. before have the parents of a child who has committed an offence, been called upon to suffer punishment and vice versa.

Motion (by Sir JOSEPH COOK) proposed - That the House do now adjourn. Mr J. H. CATTS (Cook) [10.58] Although the hour is late, I feel it my duty to raise a matter of urgent public importance in regard to the basic wage payable to the public servants of the Commonwealth. In October, 1919, the New South Wales Government adopted a basic wage of £ 3 17s. per week. Government, at the time of the then new basic wage in New South Wales, was called on by Labour members particularly, and by a deputation introduced to the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) by - the Leader of the Labour party (Mr. Tudor), to at least adopt that basic wage as the minimum adult rate for the Commonwealth. The reply of the Prime Minister was that he would appoint a Royal Commission, and that the matter would be dealt with in the policy speech - The scandalously low wages of £3 On the 31st October last year we had that policy speech at Bendigo, in which Mr Hughes saidThe Government is appointing a Royal Commission to inquire into the cost of living in relation to the minimum or basic wage. The Commission will be full y clothed with . power to ascertain what is a fair basic wage, and how much the purchasing power of the sovereign has depreciated during the war, and the best moans, when once so adjusted, of automatically adjusting itself to the rise and f all of the sovereign. The Government will , at the earliest date possible, create effective machinery to give effect to these principles, and the recommendations of the Commission. A. few days afterwards, when the Prime Minister was approached further in the matter, the following statement by him was reported in the press:Mr Hughes said he had announced in this policy speech that he intended to appoint a Commission to inquire into the minimum basic wage. On Monday last he received names from the labour industrial unions, and as soon as employers appointed representatives this Commission would commence its inquiries. The wage fixed would apply to public servants as well as to other persons. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Adjournment. Mr Lazarus asked if it would be possible to give a measure of relief immediately, and Mr Hughes replied that he was afraid it would not. He did not think the Commission would take long. The Government would have power to enforce the decision as far as its own servants were concerned. "" My answer is,"" concluded Mr Hughes, "" I am offering you, in common with every other worker in Australia, a promise of speedy and effective relief."" There has since then been a doubt created by the Prime Minister himself as to the value and effectiveness of that Commission, and this brought a reply from Mr. Piddington, the chairman of the Commission, in which he sought to re-estabThe lish some kind of public confidence in that body. Twelve months have elapsed, and now the basic wage in New South Wales, laid down by the Board of Trade, is £4 5s. per week; yet the Commonwealth is not even paying the previous basic wage of £3 17s. In every Department there are sweated employees; in the Defence Department, in the Postal Department in its various branches, and wherever the Commonwealth employ men, there is a hue and cry that sweating is rampant. 7s. 6d. and £3 10s. are being paid to married men of competence, and with long years of service. One case known to me is typical of a large number. It is that of a Mr R. A. Hunter, who resides in Newtown. He is a competent man, whom I have known for many years, and he has had ten years' service. He has a family of seven children, and were it not that he happened to have a house of his own before he entered the Commonwealth employ, it would be absolutely impossible for him to maintain his family in the most frugal manner on what he has been receiving, namely, £3 10s. per week.",69
393,Mr BAYLEY,BASIC WAGE TO COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,What is his position?,70
394,Mr JH CATTS,BASIC WAGE TO COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"I forget his exaet position; but he is in one of the Postal branches. He has qualified himself by examination for positions in the Customs Service, and has diplomas as meat inspector and veterinary inspector. Although I have done my level best to help him. my efforts have not been attended with success, and I understand that this week, after his long service, he has abandoned his position to make an effort outside to maintain his f a m i l y. That is a ease typical of many. The Government also promised to deal with profiteering, which is another branch of the subject, and the Prime Minister went so far as to say that he would shoot profiteers. Yet profiteering is increasingi and the latest effort of the Commonwealth is to raise the price of wheat for home consumption to 9s., which is double the price at which we were supplying foreigners during the war; and it must increase the price of bread throughout the Commonwealth.",70
395,Sir JOSEPH COOK,BASIC WAGE TO COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"We must be followshould ing the example of John Storey, who put ample increase. up the price of gas!",71
396,Mr JH CATTS,BASIC WAGE TO COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"He has not done so. I hope that John Storey is not going to agree to put up the price of gas, but will "" boot o u t "" the recommendation Mr Justice Wade as absolutely r i d culous. The gas companies have doubled their nominal capital, and are paying camouflaged 6 per cent, instead of the than ever before. usual 12 per cent, they paid before the New South Wales Gas Act became law. They are paying as maintenance Christmas. for the upkeep of the mains in an date condition, yet they are putting aside £S0,000 for depreciation. There depreciation in the gas services. Every foot of pipe is replaced, and the service"" is kept up ; yet they go before Mr Justice Wade, and get from him a recommendaenable tion that the price be increased by 8d. 1,000. I sincerely hope the Labour Gotwelve vernment will not be misled by the recommiserably short allowances. mendation like that. If Mr . Wade can be humbugged by the gas panies, 1 hope that the Labour GovernLabour ment, which particularly represents the members, that there is only o n Labour consumer, will not swallow the same of specially concocted legal fiction. The neglect of the Commonwealth Government to honour their pledges to people is causing great distress, particuplaced larly throughout the Federal Service, which is a seething mass of discontent, and properly so. The basic wage should not only cover present requirements, but should anticithe pate a further increase, because it is always below the amount necessary to heartily maintain a family. I have today received a large number of telegrams, representing hundreds of my constituents and members of the Federal Service known to me throughout New South Wales, and I wish to take this early opportunity to put on record my greatest sympathy and anxiety to help them. When we are dealing with public servants particularly, we should include the old-age and invalid pensioners, who are. themselves Federal dependants, and ought to appeal to our sympathies. How is it possible for old-age pensioners and indigent invalids to maintain any kind of an existence on a maximum allowance of ' 15s. per week? An increase be granted, and a speedy and It will be said that money is scarce; but I regard that as absolute nonsense. There is ample wealth in the country to do justice to the people of Australia; and if the by Government say there is no money, they i - simply exhibit their incompetence. There is greater prosperity in the commercial a and money-making circles of Australia The new basic wage and the pension allowance should be raised and paid before As the public servants up-toand others to whom I have referred have been held up for over twelve months, is no m consequence of the Government not redeeming its pledge, there is the amplest claim that this new basic wage should date from the 1st January last in order to the public servants to meet the per debts they have incurred during the last months, in particular with their The pubJustice lic servants of Australia should undercomstand that there are only twenty-six men in this House of seventy-five e kind man out of thirty-six members in the Senate, and that no matter how much we may desire to help them, however great the our anxiety to do so, the public have us in a position of impotence to do anything effective to help them in this matter - The numbers are against us, but we can say that if there should be found sufficient numbers on the other side of House, then the Labour members will join with them most enthusiastically and in seeing that justice is done to the employees of our Public Service. We invited the oublic servants, as well as the workers of all industries at the last election, to return a Labour Government, but mum'beEs of them were heedless of that appeal. There were two reasons which operated .against this much-desired resuiit-(Ij ) a new manipulated electoral system, and manipulated regulations; -(2.) a public misled with (a) war hysteria and misrepresentation; (-&) lavish promises to all sections, especially to returned soldiers - Already these various sections have lived to see that those promises were made merely for the purpose of getting their votes, with apparently no real intention of givin g effect to them.
