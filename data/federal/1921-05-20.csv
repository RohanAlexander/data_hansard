34,Mr CHARLTON,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Of course they should. As we cannot produce tea, there is no reason why we should impose a duty, and the Committee would be acting wisely if tJiey removed the duty altogether.

41,Mr WATKINS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Newcastle) [11.32]. - The Oommittee has agreed to an increase in the duty on candles, and the duty proposed on stearine is quite inconsistent with that decision. If it remains as proposed the stearine will be imported, and for the manufacture of candles will he required only to be moulded here, which is the simplest part of the manufacture, and thus candles made here from imported stearine will come into competition with the candle industry. Stearine is the most important element of these manufactures, and from it by-products, are used in connection with the manufacture of woollens and also of explosives. The manufacture of stearine, therefore is, in a sense, part of our defence system. The most important consideration is the manufacture of stearine in Australia from our own tallow. While we have increased the duty on candles, we have left what is. really the main industry still at the mercy of outside competition as before. I am given to understand that wax can be landed here, paying the present duty, at a less'rate than it costs to manufacture stearine in Australia. If that is so, it proves the necessity for protecting the manufacture of stearine, in order that we may utilize our own tallow. I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs to look into this matter with a view to putting the duty on this article on a proper basis. The paraffine wax imported into Australia is produced by black labour, and that is an additional reason why we shouldput our own industry for the manufacture of stearine by white labour on a proper footing. The industry has been established in every State, and for many years has been employing a considerable number of hands, whilst the production of the article here is of benefit indirectly to numbers of people employed in other industries. The cost of production here has been checked, and the statement that it costs more to pre 1 duce it'than the price at which .wax ean be imported from other countries can be vouched for. I have no objection to people using wax candles where, in this country, they can be used, but so far as. their use in the warmer parts of Australia is concerned there would be ne wax, harm done if their local production was wiped out altogether. By protecting the manufacture of stearine we give facilities for the production of oline, which is used in the manufacture of woollen goods and glycerine, which is used in the manufacture of cordite. Before I submit an amendment; I should' like to know from the Minister whether he will agree to aa increase in the duty on this article on the same basis as the increase agreed to on candles?",24
42,Mr GREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"I am looking into the matter at the moment. "" Perhaps some other honourable members desire to address themselves to the question.'",24
43,Mr FRANCIS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,Henty) [11.38] - I hope the Minister will agree to the. request of the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins).,24
44,Mr MATHEWS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,Anothe r convert.,24
45,Mr FRANCIS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"There.is no necessity to convert me to belief in protection for the industries of the Commonwealth, I may be a little inclined tp go to extremes in the matter of Protection. In the production of stearine we have an essential industry closely connected with, the candle industry. The Minister has very wisely consented to give some further protection to the candle industry, and that is appreciated by the manufacturers. The protection of the stearine industry does not mean the protection merely of .the production of paraffine wax and stearine, but of other products manufactured from tallow which are of very great importance.. If we allow paraffine wax to come in under the-present rate of duty, we shall practically wipe out of existence the use of stearine for candle-making purposes. It has already been pointed out that paraffine wax, under the present Tariff, can be brought in .at a price below that at which stearine can be manufactured here. We are Out, therefore, to protect the Australian stearine. industry. A ll the money used in the purchase of the material from which stearine' is made, and all the wages earned in connection with the industry,, are spent in Australia; whereas the money paid for the purchase of paraffine wax is : sent outside Australia; and in the preparation of the wax, black labour 'is employedAs a White Australia community,, we have no desire to encourage black labour. The stearine industry benefits the Australian farmer, the grazier,' and the worker. In connection with the manufacture of stearine candles in Australia, we produce annually 1,000 tons of glycerine, which is largely used in the manufacture of cordite, and for many other purposes; and if we do not protect the stearine industry, we shall have to bring in' from overseas laTge quantities of that by-product. Knowing that - thousands' of tons of fallow are used annually in . the manufacture. of stearine candles here, the Minister will, I am sure, agree to. increase the duty. Wheu we increased the duty on candles That, in the circumstances, is just. two days ago, it was said that the result therefore movewould, be an increase in prices-that the people outback have practically no other means of lighting, .and would have to more for their caudles. I have it on the best ""authority; however, that since we have seen fit to grant the industry a very necessary increased protection, the manufacturers have decided not only not to increase, but from - tomorrow to decrease, by i d . per packet, the price of candles to the . people outback.",24
46,Mr GABB,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,They ought to decrease price. A reduction is long overdue.,25
47,Mr FRANCIS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"I have it , at all events, on the best authority, that the reduction I have named' is to be made. There are some very interesting figures which might, if necessary, be quoted; I - think I need say no more to convince the Minister of the wisdom of protectingan the stearine industry by increasing duty on paraffine wax to the extent of an stearine candle. additional l d . per lb.",25
48,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.45] - Thi matter was brought under my recently, and I have been looking into it. The object sought to be achieved in arranging the duties on candles and wax has been, as far as possible, to protect the manufacturers of stearine candles as against the wax candle. If honourable members will compare the item relatingto candles with that now under discussion, they will see that the arrangement hitherto has been such that the duty on wax has' been slightly below the duty oncandles.' There has been a difference of i d . per lb. We have now raised the duty on candles to 2id. per lb. I appreciate the arguments which have been put forward as to the necessity for a slightly higher dujy on paraffine wax, inasmuch as it can be brought here and moulded directly into candles without any further process of manufacturing. In that way, it must become a serious competitor with candles manufactured from the Australian raw material, unless we give an additional protection to the local stearine industry by imposing an additional duty. It seems to me, however, that the same balance as between the paraffine wax and the paraffine candlos-that is a difference of idper lb - shoul d be maintained.

Mr GKEGOEY:-We are starting on a new division. 'MT. CHABLTON - But the honourable member is dealing with the heading to the division, and not the particular item before the Committee.",28
63,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PROPERTY OP GERMAN, I must uphold the point of order raised by the honourable memher for Hunter. The honourable member for Dampier muBt confine himself to the item.,28
64,Mr GEEGOKY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Very well, Mr. Chairman, I shall endeavour to do so. I direct attention to the fact that there is a general increase of 10 per cent, on piece goods imported from outside the Empire.",28
65,Mr GEBENB,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,We have given increased preference to the British Empire of 10 per cent.,28
66,Mr GKEGOEY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"There is an increase from 5 per cent, to 15 per cent, on piece, goods imported from outside the Empire. Honourable members should consider the probable effect of this upon the people of Australia. In a matter of this sort three parties are deeply interested, the protected employing capitalist, the employees in the protected trades, and the general public Friends of the protected employing capitalist have been conspicuous during the debate on the Tariff.",28
67,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"-I am afraid the honourable member is again getting away from the item. Mr GEEGOEY^- A great deal of latitude is usually allowed during the discussion of the items in a Tariff. No honourable member can have, very much respect for the manner in which the Tariff has been debated up to the present, as item after item has gone through""without even the slightest debate. Upon, further consideration, I think that probably it would be better if I deferred my remarks until we ere considering woollens, as I want to be able to speak generally on'the high.cOst of' living, aud to quote from reports submitted by the Inter-State Commission. I want to show how the woollen .manufacturers of this country - have unduly exploited the people. However, I shall take a better opportunity of doing so.",28
68,Mr FLEMING,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Eobertson) [12.10] I have always been strongly of the opinion that we cannot do too much in the direction of encouraging trade between the variouB portions of the Empire,, and particularly with Great Britain. The Minister proposes to admit cotton, linen, and other piece goods, n.e.i., free from Great Britain,^ as'against 5 per cent, under the intermediate Tariff, and 15 per cent, under the general Tariff, but I would like to have Free Trade within the Empire. Great Britain depends very largely upon the manufacture of cotton' goodsj and we ought to do .all we can to give it every possible advantage in that respect, particularly in view of the fact that since the war the United States of America, have been making a powerful attempt to wrest from the Old Country its supremacy in the cotton trade. It is our duty to support the Motherland, not only in times of war, but also in times of peace. Because I feel that - this is our duty, and also because I am absolutely convinced that the establishment of Free Trade within the British Empire would advance, not only the interests of the Empire as a whole, but also those of Australia, I want to see the adoption of this principle as far as possible. Of course, we should not gb to extremes in anything in politics. One begins to get into trouble at once by adopting absolute Free ,Trade or absolute prohibition. I advocate neither course, but simply claim that we should give the Old Land, and the various Dominions, the greatest form of preference, approaching as close as possible to Free Trade, with safeguards which could easily be adjusted to prevent the products of coloured labour from overwhelming those of white workers. Anything we can do to help Great Britain, in the cotton trade, will assist it to maintain its supremacy in that trade, and also its command of the mercantile marine. I hope' the Minister, right through. these textile items, will give as far as possible a free list to Great Britain. Mr GREENE ' (Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [12115J - In these items I have done a great deal in the direction suggested by the honourable member. I have raised the British preference from 5 per cent, to 15 per cent. Cotton, linen, and other piece goods are free, 5 per cent., and 15 per cent, in their respective columns, as against free and 5 per cent, in the previous Tariff. I have increased the duty on cotton and linen piece goods defined for cutting up from free, and 5 per cent, to 5 per cent., 1.0 per cent., and 20 per cent.",28
69,Mr FLEMING,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"But why is it necessary to impose a duty of 5 per cent, against Great Britain on cotton and piece goods defined for cutting up?",29
70,Mr GREENIS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"There is a little difference between that class of goods and cotten, linen, and other piece goods, n.e.i., and I thought that when they came in fined for cutting up it would be an vantage to get a little revenue out of them. However, there is in that item a preferat the head of the textile division. ence of 15 per cent, to Great Britain. the sub-items <the same preference will found. I propose to make an alteration to sub-item D, covering silk, which will go back to some extent on the general in-, .would be practically valueless. tention to give a preference of 15 per cent, to Great Britain, the reason being that the exportation of silk from that country is practically negligible, and giving of a substantial preference to British goods would not be effective. Where there is no doubt as to Great Britain's ability to manufacture and ply our needs in regard to textiles, felts, and furs, I have throughout increased the preferential Tariff in their favour from 5 per cent, to 15 per cent. I have given her carte blanche to do what I remanipulated. cognise she can do-giv e us all we and if she cannot do it on a 15 per preference she ought to be able to do There is a departure from that principle in regard to calico for bag-making, cause Great Britain does not manufacofficer ture that particular class of goods, to give her a preference in that respect would simply mean putting an unnecessumption sary tax on our own people. For that reason I have taken off the whole of the dnty on calico for bag-making.",29
71,Mr FLEMING,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,It is highly necessary to do so in the interests of eux export trade.,29
72,Mr GREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"That is so. The flour we export goes away very largely in calico bags. That is why I have removed - the duty. The effect of an amendment that I am going to move will be to leave tubular cotton piece goods exactly where they are in the Tariff, in so far as they are not used for the manufacture of articles of clothing. At the present time there is a certain class of tubular cotton piece goods coming into the country which are simply chopped up, and which can thus be very easily converted into articles of clothing - These goods are coming into competition with an established industry, and therefore it seems desirable that we should make the alteration to which I linen invito the Committee to agree.",29
73,Mr JAMES PAGE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Maranoa) [12.21]. - I ask the Minister why yarns, sewing cottons, and silks have been omitted from dethis division of the Tariff? The item of adyarns is a key item for textile manufactures, and therefore should have appeared It In should be dealt with before we determine, be the duty upon cloths and attire. A similar remark is applicable to sewing cottons, without which the whole of the textiles Why these articles have been placed in items 392 and 393 of the schedule is beyond my comprehension. There is one matter the connected with this particular item which requires some explanation at the hands of the Minister. The ways of the Customs Department are peculiar at the very best supof times. How the omcers of that Department arrive at their decisions I have been endeavouring, without success, to understand for the past twenty years. It is no wonder that our importers become confused by the way in which duties are As a matter of fact, cerwant; tain goods which are imported may be cent, placed under different headings of the so. Tariff, and the authorities are thus able to twist them to suit their own convenibeence. I know of instances in which an has decided that t i e duty payable and upon a particular article was so and so, and after the goods have gone into conthe authorities have come along and determined upon the payment of a higher duty. It is for this reason that I desire something definite. In this schedtile it is proposed that leather cloth shall be dutiable, under sub-item H (3) of the item which we are now discussing, at 5 per oent. British preferential Tariff, 10 per cent, intermediate Tariff, and 15 per cent, general Tariff. Then, under item 130A, it is proposed that duck waterproofed bytreatment with any substance shall be dutiable at 15 per cent., 20 per cent., and 25 per cent, respectively. As oil baize, leather cloth, and upholstery ducks are practically identical, there will thus be three rates of duty upon similar articles. If they were placed under the one heading all difficulties of classification would appear. I am not complaining of the duties which it is proposed to levy upon these goods. But every importer should know exactly what he has to pay upon them. It would simplify matters, both for the Customs authorities and the importers, if all these goods were subject to one duty. Mr JowEtT - What are the items to which the honourable member refers 1",29
74,Mr JAMES PAGE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,Item s 130 and 105A. Mr JOWETT. - Is leather material the same thing as upholstery duck ?,30
75,Mr JAMES PAGE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Yes . Here are samples which prove that they are the same thing, the only difference being that one article is superior to the other",30
76,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,It is the use to which these various articles are put that largely determines the duty which is charged upon them.,30
77,Mr JAMES PAGE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Suppos e that I imported a suit of clothes, would ister charge the same duty upon it as he would charge, upon the tweed of which the suit was made ?",30
78,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"No , no.",30
79,Mr JAMES PAGE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,Why cannot all these articles be subject to the one rate duty ? That is all for which the importers ask.,30
80,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,Oi l baize is to be mitted free.,30
81,Mr JAMES PAGE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Yes , but that is different from the other two articles which not made here. I have mentioned. Moreover, none of these goods are made in Australia..",30
82,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Dampier) [12.29] - I should like to amend the item so as to make it read "" Cotton, linen, flaxen and other piece goods, n.e.i.; oil baize holstery duck"", &c. I am advised that all these articles are used for the one pose, and consequently they should all be leathers. included in the same category. I think that the' three items which have been enumerated by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page) should be subject to the one duty. Now there are three heads of classification-certai n articles, such as oil baize, areadmitted free; others are classified as leather cloth; and others again as upholstered duck. This diversity of classification creates an enormous amount of trouble for impordis- ters as well as for the Customs officials, and must also increase the cost of administration. I do not ask for an abolition of duty, but I think that an arrangement might be made which would lessen the difficulties that are complained of. Week after week decisions in fegard to classification are made and published, so that they fill whole books. According to an article published in a Tasmanian newspaper in 1911, there were then 14,000 fluctuating decisions. The simpler the Tariff schedule, the better for the community.",30
83,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [12.33] - There is great difficulty in classifying some of these articles, but were I to agree to what - has been suggested by the honourable member, I should please the importer, and act contrary to the wish of the Committee in regard to the protection of Australian industry.",30
84,Mr JAMES PAGE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,What Australian the Minindustry could be affected?,30
85,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Leathe r cloth-no t the light material that is stamped "" leather cloth,"" but an article well-known in the trade-is dutiable because it comof petes seriously with our own leathers. The acceptance of the honourable member's suggestion would tend to prejudice the waterproofing industry here. Canvas adand duck imported from the United Kingdom are admitted free, and used locally for waterproofing material. Oil baize is",30
86,Mr JAMES PAGE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,Canno t it be used in the same way as leather cloth?,30
87,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"No . It is much lighter than leather cloth; the latter being and upused for upholstering furniture, and vehicles, and in other ways which bring purit into direct competition with our own",30
88,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,Thes e articles are manufactured in Australia.,31
89,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"The proposed wide definition includes articles that are made here. Great care has to be exercised in the framing of definitions, and in the Department we thresh out every matter carefully so that no loop-hole may be left for importation prejudicial to local industries. The task is an extremely difficult one, but we have done our best, and have succeeded fairly well. Any change in the items takes a considerable time to work out in all its details, but definite decisions are published from time to time which make lines of demarcation that, after a little while, the trade gets to know and to act on. What the honourable member proposes is too faT-reaching.",31
90,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"If I do not press my proposal, will the Minister have the matter reconsidered if necessary?",31
91,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"The Customs Department desires, in its own interests, to simplify definitions as much as possible. We do not wish for friction between our oflicials and the public; what we desire is satisfactory and smooth working. But all proposals of the kind I am discussing must be carefully considered before action can be taken.",31
92,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,I shall not press my proposal; but I should like to know why yarns occupy the place in the Tariff in which they stand.,31
93,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"When we were going through the Tariff, my officers stressed the importance of not disturbing its general arrangement more than was absolutely necessary; aud, therefore, yarns were left where they have always been, although the duties were altered.",31

This is a revenue duty; but we thought that silk was more or less a luxury, or, at any rate, .an article on which we might fairly impose taxation. The preference to Great Britain is not effective to any extent, because silk is not manufactured there. So what I am proposing is, in effect, to revert to the old duties in respect of silk piece goods. These latter are the raw material for some of our own industries-ties , parasols, and the like. We found that the duty under the general Tariff was so close to the duty upon apparel that there was not sufficient margin. I think, however, that the proposal to restore the former impost on silk goods will prove satisfactory to local manufacturers who work on the imported raw material.",31
96,Mr CHARLTON,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Hunter) [12.46] I am pleased that the Minister has proposed his amendment, although, in the interests of those who manufacture from the raw material-that is, imported silk piece goods- I do not think the suggestion goes far enough.",31
97,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,It will give our manufacturers ample protection.,31
98,Mr CHARLTON,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"The amendment, if agreed to, will certainly improve matters. I do not intend to move a further amendment, but I wish the Minister would consent to 'the imposition of a duty of 10 per cent, only upon silk imported for the manufacture of ties, parasols, sunshades, and umbrellas. I understand that there are fifteen tie-making establishments in Australia, and these employ a large number of hands. I ask the Minister to give my proposition serious consideration.",31
99,Mr FRANCIS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Henty) [12.50] --The Minister for Customs has proposed a substantial reduction which should have considerable effect upon the tie and umbrella manufacturing industry. In my view, however, the duty upon the raw material could have been still further reduced. Industries which are prosperous today may not be in such good circumstances twelve months hence; and this Tariff, of course, is to stand for a long time. England imports her silk free from Italy and France, aud has a great advantage in competing here with Australian makers of silk ties and umbrellas. I do not object to fair competition; but we need to see that it is fair, and that we are noi injuring a promising Australian enterprise for lack of reasonable encouragement. While the Minister has been generous I would like to see a slight reduction even upon the rates under the old Tariff. I have been informed that, unless Australian silk tie-makers-wh o deal in a raw material which Australia cannot produce-ca n secure increased production, or be given greater protection against overseas competition, they will be unable to satisfactorily establish themselves. I ask the Minister to postpone consideration of this item in order that he may go more deeply into the matter of local manufacture from English silk piece goods, and, perhaps, agree to an additional 5 per cent, reduction.",31

But since that, from information I have received, I believe the Minister would be acting wisely if he inserted a sub-item to deal with ties, parasols, sunshades, and umbrellas under departmental by-laws. It haa been pointed out to me that some such amendment as this is necessary if our dustries are to exist, which they cannot do if the Minister's amendment is adopted.",32
103,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,They all that.,32
104,Mr CHARLTON,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"I know that, and I intend giving some of the reasons which have been submitted to me. It is only right that we should look into these matters to see if the case submitted by interested parties is worthy of consideration or not.",32
105,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,We should not take their word.,32
106,Mr CHARLTON,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Exactly . I think in this respect it will be admitted that I nave been endeavouring to fall in with the Minister's views, because he has adopted a very fair attitude, and has treated suggestions with consideration. The Minister proposes to increase the British preferential Tariff on silk introduced into Australia for general purposes, which, of course, can be considered a luxury, from 15 to 20 per cent. The proposed rate is evidently for the purpose of obtaining revenue. I do not take any exception to the present rate, and I do not think I would have objected if it were 30 per cent. The position taken up by manufacturing industries in Australia is that silk is used for articles of utility that must be obtained by all sections of the community, and when we consider that phase of the question we have to endeavour, as far as possible, to protect our own industries.",32
107,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,What does the honourable member suggest?,32
108,Mr CHARLTON,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"That the Minister should agree to an addition to sub-item DD, covering silk for manufacturing ties, parasols, sunshades, and umbrellas under departmental by-laws, making the rate of duty less than on other articles. .That is all I require, because our own industries are not in a position to compete with imported articles.",32
109,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,I think they are.,32
110,Mr CHARLTON,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"I can contradict that statement, because I have been informed that the pre-war Tariff on raw material was, under the British preferential Tariff, 10 per cent., and 15 pei cent, 1 on foreign silks. I understood from the Minister that he was amending the rates so that they would be equivalent to prein- war rates,' but that cannot be' so, as he proposes increasing the British preferential Tariff to 20 per cent. I am informed say that the great bulk of the trade done by Australian manufacturers was in lines at two prices, namely, 12s. per dozen and 20s. per dozen. Buying with the greatest care, and being extremely keen over each item required i u the manufacture, they were, in the case of the 12s. per dozen lines, just able to beat the imported ties by 6d. per dozen; but, in the case of their 20s. line, more often than otherwise they were imported at 18s. 6d: per dozen, which was Is. 6d. per dozen less than the Australian tie. Their only Teason for getting trade at this price was because smaller quantities could be bought, and they were on the spot to deliver at once. Several of the manufacturers at this time imported ties, and were able to sell them profitably in competition with goods of their own manufacture. As this happened with a Tariff of 15 per cent, on foreign raw material, it requires no great foresight to understand what will happen if we are asked to pay 30 per cent, on our foreign silks, which form 80 per cent, of the trade. I ask the Minister to consider this matter, with a view to charging a lower duty on the silk we use in manufacture in Australia, and which thus affords employment to our own people.",32
111,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Eichmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.20] - This matter has been before me on many occasions, and the amendment I have moved is the result of the consideration that has been given to the whole question. If 'honourable members will turn to the Tariff, and compare the pre-war rates with those I am now proposing as between the rate on silk-piece goods and that rate ©n apparel, they will find that there is a difference between the apparel rate and the piece-good rate of 25 per cent, which has been retained. The 25 per cent, in my opinion gives an ample protection for the manufacturer of ties.",33
112,Mr MATHEWS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,But they deny that.,33
113,Mr GREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Honourable members must remember that the high apparel rate is on the finished article. There is not a further 25 per cent, difference, but there is 25 per cent, greater protection on the finished article than on the raw material. I do not know, but I think it would be fair to assume that the finished article, generally speaking, would be worth double the price of piece goods, which means that there is an actual protection of 50 per cent.",33
114,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"The Minister must not forget that he is going to ask the Committee to impose a duty of 60 per cent, ou the parasols when we are dealing with that item.",33
115,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"I do not propose to do that. The rates which I have provided in the Tariff have been carefully considered, and are in my opinion ample to give the necessary protection to manufacturers. Personally, I am not prepared to give any further concessions in this particular direction as it seems that it is ample protection as to British goods, and the rate is still greater on goods coming, from Erance and Italy.",33
116,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,What does the Minister propose?,33
117,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"That the rates shall be 15 per cent, and 20 per cent. Having looked into the matter very carefully, 1 believe that what we are doing is a fair thing in the circumstances.",33
118,Mr FRANCIS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Henty) [2.84] - The 25 per cent, margin mentioned by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) is in reference to ties imported from foreign countries.",33

120,Mr FRANCIS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"I am referring to the difference between the apparel rate and the silk piece rate. tinder the amendment the British preferential rate is to be 25 per cent., and the foreign rate 35 per cent. It must be remembered that SO per cent, of the imported ties are made by .British manufacturers from foreign, silk, and they enter the Commonwealth with preference over foreign made goods, so that the manufacturers consider that there is a margin of only 10 per cent. (",33
121,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,That is not so.,33
122,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,It is rubbish.,33
123,Mr FRANCIS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"If honourable members know as. much about the tie industry as they think they do they will vote for the duties being restored to the pre-war rates. I was under the impression when the Minister very generously (amended the rates to 15 and ,20 per cent, that we were going back to the pre-war rates, but I find that the position is as stated by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton), the duties, in those days, being 10 per cent, and 15 per cent.",33
124,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,If the honourable member will compare the apparel rates with the piece-goods rates he will find the balance is the .same under the proposal I am submitting.,33
125,Mr JAMES PAGE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,But it is an increase.,33
126,Mr FRANCIS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"'Exactly . Even if we were paying 15 per cent, in those days it has been altered to 20 per cent. Surely with the protection that this industry is asking for-particularl y when the material cannot be manufactured in this country-ther e is no one who would' support actual prohibition by refusing . the concession that the people in .the tie and .umbrella industry are asking for. There are certain subsidiary items, such as silver tops, which are used in the manufacture of umbrellas and parasols, and if they come in as manufactured articles they are cheaper than they would be if introduced in bulk for manufacture here. I do not say that the tie or umbrella industry is of great importance at this juncture, but if the Government will give the industry sufficient encouragement the manufacturers are prepared to invest more capital in it.",33

130,Mr FRANCIS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"I may be prepared to concede more than the honourable member, and I will show him the force of my argument before I have finished. * Mr RICHABD FOSTER - The honourable member is doing the industry a lot of harm.",34
131,Mr FRANCIS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) may have been a member of this Chamber for a very long time, but I intend to exercise my rights, and place the position before the Committee as I see it . I represent as many people, and perhaps more, than the honourable member does. We want articles that cannot be manufactured in this country to come here, but. we must give our industries an opportunity to compete, not only with Great Britain, but with foreign countries.",34
132,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"On the other hand, the honourable member must not lose sight of the revenue point of view. He must remember that silk ties are a luxury after all.",34
133,Mr FRANCIS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Umbrella s are not a luxury, but a real necessity. I do not know why poor people should not be able to wear a silk tie as others do. If these articles are regarded as luxuries then I see no reason why we should not protect the manufacturer of luxuries in this country as against their manufacture elsewhere.  orable member desire to wipe out the duty altogether?",34
134,Mr FRANCIS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Yes , I go as far as that in the case of articles that cannot be .manufactured in Australia. I am as good a Protectionist as any member of the Committee, and I again ask the Minister to put the duties on the raw material used in the tie industry and the umbrella industry back to the pre-war rates. If he does so he will be doing something to assist Australian industries.",34
135,Mr LAZZARINI,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Werriwa) [2.32] I support the proposed reduction of the duty on piece silk imported for the manufacture of these articles. Piece silk is not 'manufactured in Australia at all. The idea that silk ties are a luxury is fallacious. A silk tie from the economical point of view is the cheapest tie that any man can wear. I have on a silk tie which I have been wearing for two years. If I w»re cotton ties I should have had to purchase twenty in the same time. Silk piece goods made here into ladies' blouses represent the most economical apparel that ladies can wear. To argue that a duty on the raw material of these industries is justifiable because silk ties are a luxury is merely to cloud the issue by suggesting that the Government desire to tax the rich and leave the poor untaxed. Silk piece goods are manufactured here into articles of utility and the most economical apparel that can be worn. There is no factory in Australia making silk piece goods that are made up into ties, and if the tie industry is to be developed the duty must be removed from the silk piece goods used in the industry. The Minister (Mr. Greene) argued some time ago that 'bulk tea should be admitted free to Australia because it was put into packages in this country, and the thing to do was to make the packages dutiable. In the same way I say that silk piece goods, used in the manufacture of ties, should be admitted free, or at as low a duty as possible, because, no doubt, the Treasurer must consider the revenue aspect of the Tariff. If that is the intention in this case, why does not the Minister for Trade and Customs say definitely that he is introducing a revenue Tariff, and cut out all the nonsense he has talked about building up Australian industries?",34
136,Mr GREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,I have said so in distinct terms,35
137,Mr LAZZARINI,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"No ; the contention has been that in this case the Governtured ment are taxing a luxury, and I say that it is not a luxury.",35
138,Mr GREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"There is a protection of 40 per cent, on the finished article over and above this duty.",35
139,Mr LAZZARINI,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"That does not matter. My argument is that the Government - are making the people who buy the Australian article, made out of silk piece goods, pay 15 per cent, more than they should be asked to pay for those goods, by imposing a duty of 15 per cent, on the raw material of the articles which they purchase.",35
140,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"We are getting a little revenue, and are protecting dustry as well.",35
141,Mr LAZZARINI,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"It cannot be said that we are protecting the industry by making it pay 15 per cent, duty on the raw material it uses.",35
142,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.37] - I wish that honourable members would consent to go to a division on this item. We have been talking about it for a long time. I have explained the item to the Committee, not once, but half-a-dozen times, and now we have an honourable member, who was not present during the previous - discussion, standing up and again repeating that the proposed arrangement of the duties does not protect the local industry. It does. It gives the local industry a protection of 40 per cent. It give3 it exactly the same amount of protection that it has 'had all along.",35
143,Mr MATHEWS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,How does the Minister make out that the protection is 40 per cent. ?,35
144,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"If the honourable member will look at the Tariff h will e find that undeT the proposal I am now making the United Kingdom rate is 15 per cent., the intermediate rate 15 per cent., and the general Tariff rate 20 per cent. If he will look at item 110 he will find that the United Kingdom rate on apparel is 40 per cent., the intermediate rate 50 per cent., and the general Tariff rate 55 per cent. Our manufacturers buy foreign silk piece-goods and their competition is with manufactured articles from Great Britain, which are dutiable at 40 per cent. This represents a difference of 20 per cent. Then members must bear in mind that the value of the manufacarticle is practically double the value of the raw material.",35
145,Mr LAZZAETNI,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,Not in ties.,35
146,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Yes , it is; I can prove that from the statistics of the Trade and Customs Department. Therefore the protection which the industry is given on the manufactured article is 40 per cent. I say that that is ample. The proof of that statement is that that is the protection which the industry has had all along, and under which it has been built up and has grown to considerable proportions. I am retaining that protection in the case of imports from Great Britain, and have increased it in the case of imports of these the in- goods from foreign countries.",35
147,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"That is of no value at all, because all the imports are from Great Britain.",35
148,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"I have said that, in regard to ties imported from Great Britain, we are giving an effective protection of 40 per cent.",35
149,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"No , it is only 20 per cent.",35
150,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,Does not the honourable member realise that the value of the manufactured article is greater than the value of the raw material?,35
151,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,That has always been so.,35
152,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Jus t so; and, as I say, we are giving the industry exactly the same amount of protection that it had before. The position, as I see it, is that, inasmuch as the manufactured ties from silk piece-goods are worth double the value of the silk with which they are manufactured, if a protection of 20 per cent, in excess is given on the manufactured article the effective protection must be doubled, and, therefore, it is an effective protection of 40 per cent, that is proposed for this industry. I am not disposed to make any alteration in the item.",35
153,Mr FRANCIS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Henty) [2.43] - I move That the amendment be amended by leaving out the rates of duty proposed, and substituting- "" British, 10 per cent.; intermediate, 10 per cent.; general, 15 per cent."" I am proposing the rates of the pre-war Tariff on the raw material. I want honourable members to recognise that the silks made into ties come from France and Italy. They are manufactured in the Old Country and when sent out here compete in a disastrous way with the local industry. I hope that the amendment will be agreed to.",35
154,Sir EOBERT BEST,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Kooyong) [2.44] - I am prepared to take the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) at his word, and I ask him to revert to the same protection as this industry was given before. A difference has been brought about by increasing the duty on the raw material. The Minister is under the impression that by doing so he will increase the revenue, but I do not think he will do anything of the kind.",36
155,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,He will not decrease it.,36
156,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"I think that, if anything, he will decrease it . If the Minister is anxious that the people engaged in this industry should have exactly the same protection as they were given before I ask him to put the duty back to the old figure.",36
157,Mr GREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,Then I must reduce the apparel rate as well.,36
158,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"I am talking now about ties only. The tie industry is a big one here, but the general Tariff duty of 55 per cent, is of value to the local manufacturers, since are not imported from foreign countries. Our only competition comes from the Mother Country itself. As we have no silk industry the question is whether we should encourage the development of our tie industry by giving the manufacturers the raw material at a reasonable price. I suggest to the Minister that the original duties of 10 per cent, and 15 per cent, on the raw material would produce quite as much revenue as he is likely to get from the increased duties, and that a reversion to the original duties would also have the effect of substantially increasing the tie industry here. It would enable manufacturers to absorb a large proportion of the trade that is at present catered for by imports. It is true that there is a duty of 40 per cent, on made-up ties from the Mother Country, and that the honourable gentleman has added 20 per cent, to that duty. Nominally, there is a protection of 20 per cent., but practically there is a little more by reason of the greater value of the made-up article. The tie manufacturers, however, had the benefit of that difference before.",36
159,Mr CHARLTON,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"As an alternative, would it not be sufficient to increase the duty on the made-up ties ?",36
160,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"I do not think it is necessary to increase the duty on ready-made ties, provided the Minister will agree to allow the raw material to come in at a reasonable rate, and, provided also, that we can arrive at some reasonable compromise with a view to further stimulating the tie-making industry, aud enabling our manufacturers to absorb the present trade in imported ties. Amendment of the amendment negatived. Amendment agreed to.",36
161,Mr JAMES PAGE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Maranoa) [2.50]. - I move That after the word ""linens,"" sub-item (K), the words "" tinsel cloths"" be inserted. This alteration is partly an elimination of certain materials which are used only as trimmings, and naturally should fall under item 106B at the same rates of duty. Tinsel cloth is at present included in item 106A, but there is no valid reason, Protectionist or otherwise, for its insertion there .at lower duties. No Protecno tionist principles are involved. The duties ties on both items are of a purely revenue character, there being no manufacture of. any of these lines in Australia. In addition, the respective duties on this item and on item 106B should be identical, so that there should be no confusion between the items when entering goods for duty. One covers ' ' pieoe goods ' ' only, while the other includes "" articles "" for similar use, namely, trimmings.",36
162,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.52] - For the moment, I find it difficult to understand what purpose the honourable member (Mr. James Page) is trying to serve. Tinsel cloth and tinsel belting are included in item 106, and are admitted free under the British preferential Tariff, whereas if they were included in item 105E, as proposed by the honourable member, they would be dutiable at 15 per cent. I do not know why he wishes to make them dutiable.",36
163,Mr JAMES PAGE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,I am willing to take the risk if the honourable gentleman will agree to the amendment.,37
164,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"I cannot see any object to* be attained by the amendment. Tinsel has been included in item 106, together with similar goods which are used by dressmakers and others, and I would prefer to leave it as it stands. I do not think there is anything to be gained by the proposed change.",37
165,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,It would cure an anomaly.,37
166,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,The trade will know perfectly well after a little while under which heading the different items f all.,37
167,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,But the item as stands causes difficulty to the trade.,37
168,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"This matter has never been brought before the Department. Had there been any real need for such a change, we should have heard of it long ago. It seems to me that people very often put up these proposals, without first consulting the Department, in the hope that they will carry them, and that they have some object to serve, of which we know nothing at the time. If we accepted such proposals off-hand, we might suddenly discover that we had done something that we dfti not wish to do. Unless we have a fair opportunity to look into these technical alterations-and they are very technical in their detail-w e should not be asked to make them. We should nob be asked off-hand to take a line out of ome item and to put it in another when there have been no representations to us in regard to the matter. If there was any grave reason for this change, we should iiave heard of it long ago. I ask that tinsel cloth and tinsel belting remain in the item in which they now stand.",37
169,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Dampier) [2.55] We find that there are two items dealing practically with the same article. cording to the departmental classification, tinsel, which is a metallic artificial silk, comes in under item 105E, while what is exactly the same kind of thing is classified differently, and comes in under 106A. join with the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page) in asking that ' both be dealt with in the one item. The amendment means that both will be dutiable, so that no loss of duty is involved in its acceptance. My sole desire is that we shall simplify, as far as possible, the bringing in of goods through the Customs Department, since any expense incurred in that way must necessarily involve further cost to the people. Without desiring in any way to reflect upon the Department, I must say that it is absolutely autocratic in its methods. The classification in operation this week may be altered next week. One has only to look at the extraordinary classification book issued by the Department to realise the detail in volved. I presume a great deal of it is necessary.",37
170,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,Muc h of it is unavoidable.,37
171,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"No doubt; but my object is', as far as possible, to simplify it the Customs procedure, so that every importer may know exactly what duty he has to pay. I am afraid that much of the agitation against the removal of the Seat of Government from Melbourne to Canberra is due to the fact that local merchants and others realise that, while they are able, as at present, to get readily into touch with the Department-and I am not for one moment suggesting anything improper-the y have a better chance of having their cases looked into than has a business man in another State who has to interview the Deputy Controller of Customs, who, in turn, is bound by the instructions issued to him under the classification. When several classes of goods are brought out in the one package, the whole parcel has to be opened in order that the goods may be examined and classified. I am not arguing as to whether these goods should be dutiable or not-that is a matter wholly for the Parliament to decide; I simply suggest that the amendment would simp l if y the Customs procedure in regard to at least one line.",37
172,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.59] - I sympaAc- thize with the view which the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) has put. I have not had an opportunity to thoroughly inquire into this proposal, but what i think is at the bottom of it may I be briefly stated. There is a provision # in the Customs Act that a substitute for any particular article shall come undeT that article for which it is substituted ",37
173,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,That is so now.,37
174,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,Quite so.,37
175,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,It is not a very good provision.,37
176,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"It is a provision which cannot he avoided. I admit that these two articles do look something alike, though one is an artificial silk, with an artificial metallic basis, and the other is a true tinsel, having a small proportion of silk finish with a true metallic base. This artificial silk is probably a copy of the tinsel; and the reason it is put under a different item from tinsel is that it is .a substitute for silk, and must, therefore, be rated as silk. These difficulties crop up in administration in a hundred and one different ways. Even if we did what is requested, and changed this from one item to the other, it would only'give rise to another set of difficulties of exactly the same kind in the matter of interpretation --difficultie s inseparable from the administration' of the Customs law. We do our best to meet the requirements of the trade, and, though there have been no representations made up to the present, I shall do whatever lies in' my power in that direction.",38
177,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Before the Tariff leaves the Senate, will the Minister meet the representatives of the importers? I am not speaking of Customs agents, who like this sort of thing, because it adds to work.",38
178,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"If the importers through their association make definite representations, we shall know exactly what they mean, and where their proposals may lead; then, if as a result, we find any alteration is desirable for the simplification of the law, I .shall be delighted to make it, for it will save work to everybody.",38
179,Mr JAMES PAGE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,Maranoa) [3.4] I am quite satisfied with the explanation of the Minister. I do not wish the honourable gentleman to think that I desire to defraud the revenue.,38
180,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,I do not think that for one moment.,38
181,Mr JAMES PAGE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"No r should I like the Minister to think I am guilty of sharp practices. My object was simplification. I looked on this as an anomaly, and as such I brought it before the Commit'tee. However, the Minister has now assured us that if the importers can show that an alteration is desirablein their interests, and in the interests of the Department, he will make one. I desire to withdraw my amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Mr MASSYGREENE) proposed - That sub-item (E) be amended by adding the following words:-""And on and after 21st May, 1921, ad val., British, 15 per cent.; intermediate, 15 per cent.; general, 20 per cent.",38
182,Mr GEEGOEY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Dampier) [3.7] - I should like to see greater preference than is now proposed given to the Old Country, ,and I hope the general duty will not be less than 25 per cent.",38
183,Mr RTXEY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"A preference of 5 per cent, is fairly good.",38
184,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"I do not agree with the honourable member. I hope that the promises we have been making "" all through the piece"" to give special consideration to goods from the Old Country will not be departed from.",38
185,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.9] - I am prepared to accept the suggestion made by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory), and make the general Tariff 25 per cent. Looking at the figures of importations, I see that the bulk of these goods now come from Great Britain. It their is true that from elsewhere we get considerable quantities of certain classes or grades which cannot be obtained from Great Britain. I ask leave to amend my amendment by substituting 25 per cent, for 20 per cent, as the general duty. Amendment amended accordingly, and agreed to.",38
186,Mr GEEGOEY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Dampier) [3.10] Does sub-item, F mean woollen piecegoods ?",38
187,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,Yes .,38
188,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"-Thes e duties are an increase on the duties imposed by the Tariffs of 1908 and 1914, and I'should like to take this opportunity to deal with the position of the woollen industry in Australia. I endeavoured to address myself to this question some time ago, but was ruled out of order; and I take the present opportunity to raise a protest. I feel that, while the war was on, the woollen manufacturers of Australia did not "" play the game"" so far as this country is concerned, and that remark applies also to the woollenmanufacturers of Canada. I address my remarks particularly to honourable members opposite, who have been very persistent in their arguments in favour of high protective duty. I think they will find it difficult to show that the worker engaged in the industry has had anything like",38
189,Mr CHARLTON,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Would it not be well to address your remarks to the whole Committee, and not to a particular section?",39
190,Mr GEEGOEY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,I refer particularly bo the Deputy Leader of the Labour party (Mr Charlton).,39
191,Mr CHARLTON,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"If the Deputy Leader of the Labour party follows your example, and refers to your party and its attitude on many questions, you will be in an awkward position.",39
192,Mr GEEGOEY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"The honourable member has not been at all particular in referring to myself, and has made statements that are quite incorrect. I am prepared - to support a Protective policy.",39
193,Mr JAMES PAGE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Why not have a "" cut ""- at the high priest of Protection, ""Bobby Best""?",39
194,Mr GEEGOEY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"I propose to do so; but the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has very pointedly remarked that I am here as a Eree Trader, and, of course, against Protection. This is unjust and unfair. Where it is shown .by statistics that an industry is languishing, and there is a desire for higher duties, I am prepared to grant them. But has it been shown in this instance that the industry needs more protection? The Victorian State Government appointed a Fair Profits Commission to inquire as to the profits of manufacturers in this State, and that Commission, in its Eeport No. 13, issued last year, saysThere is one other mill, and perhaps two, in whioh the profits have been increased by too high a rate of gross profit on turnover. The other mills, forming a majority, have heen making no more than fair profits. Of the two mills just named as making undue profits, one is a "" private"" business, i.e., not a public company, but its figures for the past three years are as notable as those of the second mill, which is a public company, and so can be freely named, as the Ballarat Woollen and Worsted Company Limited. Some further reference to this company,must be made. It has had many vicissitudes in past years, but of recent years has been very prosperous. After making all allowances for writing off capital in former years, it cannot be said-and the Commission adopts the company's own figures - that shareholders have put more than £60,000 original capital into the business. In addition, within the last few years £30,00.0 of reserves have been capitalized and issued in shares to the shareholders. According to published statements, at an interim meeting of the company, held a few weeks ago, the following distribution of profits for the half-year was made, partly out of accumulated but preas viously undistributed profits, namely:Dividend distributed (half-year), £27,000. Issue of shares as a result of writing-up, plant, &c - fac e value, £30,000; market value, about £90,000. Apart from the shares, the dividend is at the rate of45 per cent, per annum on the total nominal capital of £120,000; . 90 per cent, per annum on capital subscribed by shareholders; About 90 per cent, per annum on the capi-' tal used in the business as shown by the last annual balance-sheet.",39
195,Mr JACKSON,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,What year is referred to in that report?,39
196,Mr GEEGOEY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,The report was issued last year.,39
197,Mr EILEY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,The manufacturers bled the .public during the war.,39
198,Mr GEEGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"There was no justification whatever for these manufacturers putting up prices as they did. During the general debate on the Tariff. I read a letter sent from the Chamber of Manufactures in Sydney in regard to blankets, pointing out that the Australian manufacturers could not supply all the blankets required for the people. Letters have also been appearing in the press recently on this subject. One was published in the Argus only a few days ago, from a draper, who stated that he could not get supplies of the cheaper flannels required for the poorer sections of the community.",39
199,Sir GBANVILLE RYBIE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"That , I think, was largely owing to the strike.",39
200,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"It must not be forgotten that during the war our woollen manufacturers got all their wool at the appraised prices. They were not called upon to pay the high rates demanded of the English manufacturers for the same types of wool, but, nevertheless, they raised the prices of their goods enormously, especially for the articles manufactured from the poorer types of wool. The Minister has given us an undertaking that when the Tariff Bill comes down he will make an effort to insert some provision for the protection of the people in regard to items in respect of which high duties have been imposed under this Tariff.",39
201,Mr GABB,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,Will you help to do that?,40
202,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"I am going to make a suggestion. I understand that the Denton Hat Mills and most manufacturers at present will only supply wholesale houses; and I suggest that if we impose duties, with the idea of making this country self-supporting, we should see to it that the people are able to get their requirements at fair and reasonable prices. I believe the Minister intends to include provision in the Tariff Bill to the effect that where protection is afforded an industry, those who control it shall be compelled to supply goods, say, for cash, to retail houses - this",40
203,Mr MATHEWS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"He sliould do so, at any rate.",40
204,Mr HILL,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,Will you support us?,40
205,Mr MATHEWS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Yes . We will also allow you the honour of bringing in the provision, if you like.",40
206,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PROPERTY OP GERMAN," I think the honourable member for Dampier will realise that he is discussing another Bill, not the item before the Committee.",40
207,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"I am referring to certain remarks made by the. Minister upon this particular matter. I think I would be justified in moving to insert some such provision here. Mr GREENE;-Not in the item. honourable member tried to do that, he would defeat the end he has in view, because, as he knows, any such amendment would be unconstitutional ",40
208,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"The Minister knows why I want to bring this matter forward. I have some remarkable information concerning the position of the woollen industry ' in Canada, showing how the manufacturers there fleeced the people during the war. They paid poor rates of wages to the workers, and made enormous profits. We know, also, that during the war there was, in this country, one section of the people always ready to give everything. They were to be seen on the wharfs and in the hospitals, men and women, devoting their daily lives to the task of helping the Empire in the struggle. And there was another crowd, generally to be seen chasing around in .motor cars, waving flags, and always talking about the Empire, but who, at the same time, were robbing the people for all they were worth.",40
209,Mr LAZZARINI,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"And when we tried to stop them, you gave us no support.",40
210,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"I think we all endorse the remark of President Harding, that special legislation should be brought into provide that, during war time, every person should have his allotted duty, and that no one should be allowed to make undue profits. I have no time for the man who wants high protective duties, but is not prepared to do a fair thing by the community. And yet we have evidence of on every hand. There is the statement, in the Industrial Australian, to the effect that, although the capital invested in the woollen industry in Australia was only about £1,100,000, in three years the manufacturers made profits amounting to more than the whole of the amount invested.",40
211,Mr CHARLTON,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,More than that. And yet the honourable member did not - say anything about-it at the time.,40
212,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) is not fair to me, because I would have been only too - pleased if legislation had been brought into deal with these people who, during war time, were out to make excessive profits. If the Sir' ROBERT BEST - But what about . the war-time profits tax?",40
213,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,That did not prove very effective.,40
214,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,I think it did.,40
215,Mr GABB,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,The honourable membeT for Dampier was called the bridge-builder for the Government during the war.,40
216,Mr LAZZARINI,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,Yes . He did not hear the division bells.,40
217,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"I think if the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) looks up the Treasurer's statement, he will see how much was received under the war-time profits tax. I thought we would have got £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 at least. I object to these high duties unless we get some definite promise from the Minister that, at an early date, we shall have legislation to compel those who enjoy high Protection to supply their goods at a fair rate to the people.",40
218,Mr CHARLTON,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Hunter) [3.24] - It is quite refreshing today to hear the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) talk about the advisableness of dealing with the people who make excessive profits. His remarks are in marked contrast to what we have been accustomed to in this House during the past few years. I agree with him. So far as woollen goods are concerned, I admit freely that during the war, and at the present time, too, the prices charged to the general public are altogether too high. I.also remind the honourable member that the people who support him-the importers of goods manufactured in other countries-as o charged excessive prices during the war period.",41
219,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,That does not alter the position.,41
220,Mr CHARLTON,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Apparently, nothing alters the position in the opinion of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster). He knows that during the war the wool produced in Australia was exported overseas, manufactured there, and when returned to Australia was sold at prices far in excess of its true valueI am not justifying high prices at all. I merely want to remind the honourable member for Dampier of the true position; and I ask him if lie has forgotten the very many occasions when this matter was brought up by honourable members on this side of the House during the war, and if he did anything to help us? The Government then had ful l power, under the War Precautions Aet regulations, to do whatever they liked to stop profiteering. When we impaled the Government on this issue, what did the honourable member do? Why, he supported those who were plundering the people. Let him not forget that. has little cause to talk at us, and to tion my consistency in regard to this matter. My conduct in regard to this matter during the war was quite consistent right through. I always, complained that the Government were permitting the manufacturers in this country to rob the people. The honourable member uow expresses surprise that more revenue was not received through the medium of the war-time profits tax. But, after all, that was only another device to permit those who were inclined to increase their prices to extract from the people more than they were entitled to get. They felt secure so long as the Government were able to collect something in the form of excess profits tax. That was the kind of legislation which the honourable member supported, notwithstanding that honourable members on this side of the House frequently pointed to the serious position into which the country was drifting.",41
221,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,What did you propose to do ?,41
222,Mr CHARLTON,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"We proposed that the Government should take action, under the War Precautions Act Regulations, to prevent profiteering; but the honourable gentleman, on every occasion when there was any possibility of the Government being defeated, was either not in the division, or else some reason was given why he could not support us. It is, as I say. refreshing now to hear the honourable member for Dampier talk in this way.",41
223,Mr CORSER,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,What item are we on ?,41
224,Mr CHARLTON,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"We are on wooller; goods, and I am replying to some statements made by the honourable member for Dampier. However, if the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) wants to bring me back to the point, I may state that last year we imported woollen goods to the value of £3,500,000, as compared with £2,000,000 worth made up in Australia. It appears, therefore, that there is room for improvement, so far as our own manufacturing industry is concerned. It is essential that we should be a self-contained nation. Honourable members opposite are in agreement on this question.",41
225,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"It is fair that the consumer should be considered, also. He Mr Charlton - Exactly . That quesis what I have been endeavouring to emphasize all the time. I said last evening and I repeat, that the Minister has promised to appoint a Board to see that justice is done to the consumer as well as the manufacturer and the employee. This policy is on the lines of our party platform. This New Protection is what we have been advocating for years. And this is what we asked of the Government during the war. It is pleasing, even at this late hour, to know that at last something is about to be done. I give the Minister full credit. But we.would not be justified in increasing duties solely the benefit of manufacturers. We must see to it that while they get a fair return on their capital, the workers engaged in the industry and the consumers are treated fairly. We want to be a self-contained nation. The war has taught us this lesson. I object to the honourable member for Dampier charging me ""with inconsistency, because if any party haa been consistent in regard to profiteering it is the party to which I belong. Had we the power when we were in office we would Save made an alteration. power was available during the war to the Government of which the honourable member for Dampier is a supporter; and, had the honourable member and his party been consistent, action would have been taken against those who were then robbing the people.",41
226,Mr GEEENE,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Eichmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.30] - It is only fair to the Government that I should point out to the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), from whom we have just heard a very interesting speech, that he was in this House for a considerable time supporting a Government which passed the War Precautions Act and enjoyed all the powers bestowed by that measure. But what action did he and his party take under that Act along the lines that he is now telling us this Government ought to have followed? We have only to turn up the public records to ascertain that the only party which exercised the powers to which the honourable member has referred was the party now in office. But, after all is said and done, this has nothing whatever to do with the case. The woollen mills of Australia before the war were not able to eam more than a reasonable return on their capital.",42
227,Mr JACKSON,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"They did not average 5 per cent. - Mr GREENE - The average return on capital invested in those mills prior to the war was never high, and in some cases was very low. Undoubtedly we have the raw material in our own country, and the manufacture of it into woollen goods should be one of our great native industries. I think it will be. I know of nothing more hopeful than the development I have seen in the woollen industry for during the last few years;, and, if the duties set out in the schedule are agreed to, I have information which leads me to believe that one ortwo of the great firms which have used our wool at the other end of the world are coming here to commence operations on a big scale. In fact, I believe w.e are on the threshold of one of the greatest industrial developments we have seen in this country in regard to this particular form of manufacture, in which I believe we ought to be able to hold our own with the The world. I am hopeful that the duties provided will be sumcient to encourage - these people to come here, and to give those who are already here that protection which is necessary to put the industry on a thoroughly firm and established basis. If honourable members agree to the item, they will have no cause for regret.  manufacture of wool is undoubtedly a natural secondary industry of Australia, and ought to be most successful, seeing that we grow 62 per cent, of the world's merino wool; but I think the Minister (Mr Greene), in view of his experience under the operations of the War Precautions Act, must realise that he is overdoing things when he seeks to impose a protective duty of 30 to 45 per cent. It is likely to bring great profits to those who actually manufacture the wool, and those who invest their money in woollen mills. The extra impost will be absorbed by higher profits and the payment of higher wages for shorter hours of labour. In view of the experience gained by the Government during the war, they must know what pro-fit it is possible to make in this industry. They took over twenty-two mills with a capital value of £1,144,000, and in two years and four months made a profit of £1,177,000 on the output of those establishments. That is to say, they could have paid off the whole of the capital cost of the mills and still made a substantial profit. I do not think that the making of inordinate profits is calculated to develop the woollen industry. When such' profits are made, the people of Australia cannot be getting the advantage they should derive. I am not opposed to giving reasonable protection to any industry where it can be shown that it is necessary, but in the face of figures I have quoted the protection asked for on this item is totally unnecessary. In any case, the - Australian woollen manufacturer has ample natural protection. He has at his command the raw material, and it is the best in the world; he has every facility for turning it into cloth-the coal, an ample water supply, and an excellent climate-and he has also the protection of freightage. With all these advantages, the Australian manufacturers ought to be in a position to manufacture every bale of wool that Australia produces, and spurn all opposition. No claim can be advanced upon this item for the imposition of high duties On the ground that it is necessary to fence off the competition of black labour, yet we are asked to impose a 30 per cent, duty against the white labour of Great Britain, where wages have risen, and where the cost of coal and other materials has mounted to a high figure. It seems to me quite unnecessary to have this increased protection for the local manufacturer. I would not mind if the duty were made 100 per cent, against outside nations, but as a matter of principle I am not anxious to see unnecessarily high duties imposed, which have a tendency to make Australians inefficient and lazy in the building up of their industries.",42
228,Mr MATHEWS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Melbourne Ports) [3.39] - I am no friend of, nor do I hold a brief for, the "" boss"" manufacturer. He is usually a nasty man, who does not pay decent wages unless he is compelled to do so. Workers in woollen mills aTe among the worse paid in our community. It is true that great profits were made during the war, but we wotild have been compelled to pay double the prices we did pay for our goods if it had not been for the existence of our own woollen f2ills. The trouble in regard to the prices we paid during the war arose from the fact that our warehouses in Flinders-lane were not only sellers of goods manufactured locally, but also sellers of. imported goods. The great mistake made by the local manufacturers was in allowing a yard of their output to be sold in Flinders-lane. During the war. a tailor who bought so many pounds worth of goods per month from a certain the warehouse was not permitted to take more than a small percentage of Australian made goods. The serge of the suit I am wearing was obtained by the warehouse from the woollen mills at l is . 6d. per yard, but when it came to be sold to the tailor the firm demanded 27s. 6d. per yard. Flinders-lane also endeavoured to pass off locally-manufactured goods for imported goods, and at high prices. Though I hold no brief for the manufacturer, I am greatly concerned as to the interests of the workers. For that reason 1 I would like to see higher duties imposed. Once the importer realizes that he is about to be beaten for the local market, he will lower his prices and take less profits in order to overcome the competition of the local manufacturer. We must be prepared for that emergency. During the present year, thirty companies have been formed for the purpose of undertaking the manufacture of woollen goods, and I understand that a dozen more are in course of formation. This is no proof that the duty is sufficient. The companies are hopeful of getting further help from this Parliament. If the wool-growers had gone in for the manufacture of their own wool, there would not have been the great drop they have recently experienced in the price of their cross bred wools. Those wools could easily have been made up into goods and exported. But the pastoralists have never recognised the side on which their bread is buttered. Honourable members ask what steps can be taken to prevent the manufacturers from raising their prices. I hope that the promise of the Minister (MT . Greene) to introduce legislation to prevent these men from robbing the consumers will be carried into effect; in any case, if the local manufacturers do attempt to rob us by putting up their prices, the importing friends of some honourable members will be more likely to rob us in the same way.",43
229,Mr FLEMING,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Does the honourable member think that the Australian manufacturers are turning out as good a cloth as they should, considering the quality of the wool they are getting?",43
230,Mr MATHEWS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,No place in the world can turn out woollen goods equal to those produced in the west of England.,43
231,Mr JOWETT,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,We produce very good cloth in Australia.,44
232,Mr MATHEWS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Yes ; since the duties were increased in 1908, the quality of the woollen goods produced in Australia has improved enormously, and there is no valid reason why it approximate that of the west of England cloth, which, I repeat, is the best turned out in any part of the world. If I had the power, I would make everybody wear Australian-manufactured goods. With this end in view, I would absolutely prohibit the importation of tweeds from the west of England.",44
233,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,If we destroy competition we shall increase the cost of commodities.,44
234,Mr MATHEWS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,We can be assured of internal competition if we enact laws to prevent the establishment of combines and the making of extraordinary profits.,44
235,Mr FLEMING,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,How long would the quality of goods be maintained under such conditions?,44
236,Mr MATHEWS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"If there were no combines in Australia the different woollen mills would certainly maintain the quality of their goods. Take a list of the manufacturers in the Commonwealth today. They are all deeply concerned in each other's welfare, but legislation could prevent them from arriving at any so-called "" honourable understanding."" That would be the common-sense way of checking this evil. What is the position in which we find ourselves? Australia is the greatest wool producer in the world, and yet there is wool selling here today at 2d. per lb. Why should we not encourage the conversion of that wool into the cheaper forms of cloth?' During the war the duty imposed upon woollen goods was utterly useless, because we could not have obtained those goods from overseas at any price.",44
237,Mr JOWETT,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,The honourable member means that the duty was inoperative?,44
238,Mr MATHEWS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Yes ; tailors were buying goods from the warehouses in Melbourne from 42s. to 25s. per yard, whilst others were indenting woollen goods at those prices. Yet in the years gone by I have made up thousands of yards of the same material at 8s. and 9s. per yard. To-day, however, everybody is endeavouring to restore the pre-war conditions. We all recognise that wages must come down in England aud America, because manufacturers there desire to produce cheaper commodities for the purpose of supplying the oversea markets. We must take steps to prevent should not this dumping in Australia.",44
239,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,Has the honourable member any idea of how the wages in the Old Country compare with the wages paid in Australia?,44
240,Mr MATHEWS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"I cannot say. The woollen manufacturers are no friends of mine, because they do not pay adequate wages to their workmen.",44
241,Mr JOWETT,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,At the present time the wages paid in the Old Country are higher than those which are being paid here.,44
242,Mr MATHEWS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"There is only one way in which we can get better wages and better industrial conditions for the employees of our woollen manufacturers, namely, by Protection through the Customs House. We all know that at the end of the season countries which produce certain commodities export their surplus to foreign markets. A case of the kind was quoted in this chamber today. At the present time the users of fat in Australia are paying £8 per ton more for that article than is being paid for it in England. We now have an opportunity to set our house in order. The Tariff is before us, and until that great bone of contention, William Morris Hughes, returns to upset us again, we have time to consider it from a scientific stand-point. It is up to us to see that this great wool-producing country shall also become a manufacturer of woollen-piece goods. I appeal to the Minister, in spite of the uproar that has been caused by this item, to increase the duty which has been proposed upon it.",44
243,Mr RILEY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Put more than 45 per cent, upon it?",44
244,Mr MATHEWS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Yes . f f I could compel our manufacturers to keep their prices down to a reasonable level I would impose a duty of 100 per cent, upon it. There is no reason why we should not compel our manufacturers to sell their products at a fair price. Could we not create a Department which would take into consideration the cost of labour and the cost of manufacturing operations; and which would assess the profits that ought to be made upon the capital invested ?",44
245,Mr GREGORY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,If we only allowed a certain interest we should destroy the desire of the people to undertake the work.,45
246,Mr MATHEWS,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"That is a conservative view which ought long since to have been forgotten. Some years ago the manufacturers of Melbourne Ports held a conference which I attended, at which they considered the freight which the coastal shipping companies should charge them, and also the price which should be paid for coal used in their industrial establishments. I wa3 told that these prices were too high. My reply was, "" Very well. We want to stop that. The Labour party desires that the Commonwealth shall have power to compel the companies to charge only a fair price for their coal. Will you vote for us ?"" Their answer was, "" Oh no, Mathews. The worse of your crowd is that they go too far."" These people feared that if we regulated the prices charged by the shipping companies we should also regulate the prices which they themselves charged. In spite of the capitalistic talk to the effect that labour is ruining Australia, quite a number of persons are anxious to embark upon this particular industry. I have no use for our present economic system, but I recognise that the people who sent me here have to live whilst we are effecting a change in it. I wish to give them an opportunity to live during the transition period, and the only way in which I can do that is by granting Protection to our manufacturers. I ask the Minister if he cannot see his way clear to increase the duty upon this item? Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. LIEUT - COLONEL WALKER'S SWORN STATEMENT Motion (by Mr MASSYGREENE) proposed - That the House do now adjourn. . Dr MALONEY (Melbourne) [3.55] I regret having to bring under the notice of honourable members a letter which I have received from my solicitor, in reply to a communication from Messrs. Ellison and Hewison, another firm of solicitors, which was read in this Chamber by the honourable member for Herbert (Mr. Bamford). During the interval which has"" passed I asked my solicitor to give me his opinion upon that letter. I have no animus against the author of it, but, as he has taken up quite an unwarranted attitude upon behalf of his client, I propose to read the reply to it, which I have received from my solicitor, Mr Joseph Woolf. It is as follows:Melbourne, 13th May, 1921. DEAR DB . MALOXEY, Your letter of the 6th of May duly to hand. It is curious that Messrs. Ellison and Hewison persistently ignore the real facts of your speech as set out in Hansard. They could not fail to see that the real and essential fact you set out is actually true, namely, that Colonel Walker, as may be seen at page 311 of the evidence following his previous statement on oath, then formally recanted and withdrew his sworn statement on oath. This statement was he deliberately swore that he had seen Mr Caldwell in the presence of himself and others sign the document produced. He said he was aware of his responsibility and the nature of an oath when he made this statement. He had previously challenged the Committee to call a - writing expert who wonld verify the signature as Caldwell's signature. - Your inference, therefore, is irresistible, namely, that he produced a forged document. You, however, omitted the word "" therefore.""' If yon had said, "" Since Colonel Walker relied for his perjured statement on the document he produced, it must have been such a perfectsignature of Caldwell's as to deceive a writingexpert."" You would have stated a conclusion had you used the word "" therefore."" Colonel Walker evidently believed that he could commit perjury without being found out, as he impudently challenged the Committee to produce a writing expert, because lie believed the signature was such a good imitation of Caldwell's that lie would be borne out. If a signature will deceive a writing expert it must be a remarkably good forgery of the original signature. Of course, you could not prove that it was forged by Walker or anybody else, but Walker gambled on the perfection of the forgery. You obviously knownothing about it . Most men would agree with you had you stated this as a conclusion, but you stated it as a fact, and did not preface it with the word ""therefore."" You would not be able to prove as a fact in a Court of law that this si<mature of Caldwell's was in fact a forsrerv. and, therefore, that it would be a foreed document. This, however, does not dispose with the real question. Colonel Walker has the unparalleled audacity to try and make you responsible on a completely false issue. He is like a cuttlefish which flings out inky fluid to prevent being followed. These cuttlefish tactics of Walker are obviously designed to save him from further prosecution for perjury. Now he turns round and says, ""Although I committed perjury deliberately and in order to prove I was telling the truth, demanded a writing expert to prove it was a real signature, I now turn round, and say since I committed perjury when I said it was written by Caldwell it is no longer a forged ture, and I no longer want a writing expert, and, therefore, Mr Maloney would have independently to prove that it was a forged signature, but he cannot do this, as he is unaware of any of the circumstances. Here, an impudent offender against the criminal law instead of being repentant and humble, actually dares to threaten a member of Parliament, who honourably does his duty, which this unrepentant sinner by threatening hopes to deter him from doing. The crime is denned in the Act of Parliament which constitutes the Joint Accounts Committee, and the punishment for this crime of perjury is five years' imprisonment. Their duty was clearly to uphold the law of the Commonwealth. Of course, it is ridiculous toassume that a man who deliberately sets out to commit perjury does not commit it, because he is found out and forced to recant. You cannot be deterred from doing your duty by any threat or impudent challenge to surrender your parliamentary privilege. The parliamentary privilege is the highest privilege a memher of Parliament has, and that is a very good illustration of its value to the community. Here the facts are absolutely true as a whole, and you have acted as an honourable man in making your statement for the benefit of Parliament and for the protection of public morality, which ought to include that no man who commits perjury, no matter how highly placed, should escape justice. The question is, what does the honour of Parliament demand if the Joint Accounts Committee have failed to observe those principles of honour which should actuate all members of Parliament for the enforcement of the law. Sir Frank Madden, when challenged on oue occasion to repeat outside that he had made in Parliament, to do so, and I shall follow his example in this case, but if a statement is wanted as to perjury, I am ready to make it. I do not know Mr Hewison, but Mr Ellison I have found a decent fellow. that in this case he speaks as a lawyer representing a client, and wishes to make a point, because I did not use the "" therefore."" I am fighting, for Australian native who has been deeply wronged. Had not Colonel statement, made in the course on oath, been challenged by the cross examination of Senator J. D. Millen, so that Colonel Walker was forced to own Dr Maloney. that what he had sworn to was not true, much in j u r y would have been done to this man. Thirty years ago, in this chamber, I tried to secure the punishment of a millionaire who had committed perjury, as later I tried to secure redress for the Reverend J . B . Ronald, who was injure d by nine witnesses who gave perjured evidence against him. Apparently, however, signa- under our laws, if a man has money enough, he may 'escape punishment for an offence for which, if poor, he would be put into gaol.",45
247,Mr BAMFORD,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"Herbert) [ 4 . 2 ] - I could not clearly follow the letter which the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) has just read; but it seemed to be a climb down on the part of Mr . Woolf. If it is contended that Colonel Walker has committed perjury, why has not an information been sworn against him in the Courts?",46
248,Dr MALONEY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,That will come.,46
249,Mr BAMFORD,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"The honourable member has taken advantage of the privilege of free speech which Parliament confers on a member, but I say, advisedly, that no man under cover of that privilege should stab another in the back, giving him no opportunity to reply. All that is asked is that the statements made in Mr Woolf's letter, which have been voiced by the honourable member, shall be repeated outside.",46
250,Dr MALONEY,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,They are in the office of the Attorney-General.,46
251,Mr BAMFORD,PROPERTY OP GERMAN,"This is a fair challenge, and we have made it before. Let these statements be uttered outside, so thai/ Colonel Walker may take action in respect to them, and clear his character statements definitely, or, if 'he cannot do so, accept refused the consequences. This is not an. unreasonable thing to ask. No man should make statements in this House which may damage a citizen for the rest of his l if e , and not give that citizen an opportunity I take it to make an adequate reply.",46
