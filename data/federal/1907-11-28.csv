1,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"I beg to present a petition from 2,648 professors and teachers of music in the State of Victoria, who pray the House not. to. ' consent to the increased duty on pianos. I invite honourable members to examine the ' petition, which is unique in form, while every signature that of a registered music teacher. Petition received and read.",14
2,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, in view of the unique character of the petition, and the trouble and care which have been taken in connection with its compilation,- I should like to move that.its text be printed for - circulation.",14

5,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I beg to ask the Prime Minister if he will lay upon the table of the House any communication which he has received in regard to the natives of Papua, and also if he will obtain from the Director of Agriculture a report . on the condition of the natives working in Papua, especially on the mines.",14
6,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"L as t night the honourable member was good enough to mention this matter to me, and this morning I asked for a report, though in recent reports Mr. Staniforth. Smith has referred to the condition of the natives in employment in general terms of approval. He had called attention to the fact that there had been an undue amount of sickness among carriers, but, on inquirv. it had been discovered that the condition of the rest houses had been allowed to become insanitary, with the result, that dysentery had become prevalent. The insanitary condition has been removed. That appears to have been the only sickness to which he hns recently called attention. TELEPHONE ADMINISTRATION.

7,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General a question in regard to the statement in the press that, in anticipation of the electrification of the railways and tramways in Melbourne, is steps are being taken to have a complete metallic circuit and underground tunnel in connection with the telephone service. I desire to know what action is being taken in Sydney for completing the metallic circuit and underground tunnel, because for years the telephone service has been, affected seriously by the induction from the electric tramway service. The suffering has lasted for a long time, and I want to know what steps have been, or are going to be taken to complete the metallic circuit a.'.ii.' thereon in underground tunnel?",14
8,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I am fully seized of the importance of the matter mentioned by the honourable member. In Sydney .works to the end mentioned are in progress, and will be continued. A further vote will be asked for in order to carry them to a successful conclusion.",15
9,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I desire to know if the Postmaster-General has yet taken any step to do away with those anomalies iri regard to telephone charges which have been a source of so niuch comment in the House-the differential treatment of subscribers to private telephones ?,15
10,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Ves . I have voured to meet what I regard as the well-rounded complaints of honourable members by extending the distance for the minimum charge' from one mile to two miles, and also by making an additional charge of ios. for every quarter of a mile or fraction thereof, and 20s. for every ditional half-mile. That will, I think, meet the majority of the cases.. If , ever, I find that it does not, we will a further extension in order to make the charges equitable.",15

Mr WATKINS - Since it is stated that an order for a new switchboard must placed in America two years before it required, I wish to ask the Postmasterliament General whether he'does not think that better business arrangement should be adopted by the Department, so that telephonic' service in any town or city not in. the meantime be held up and organized ?",15
13,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"- I think that the Dethe partment needs to have at its disposal considerably larger amount of money than if has, so that it could take steps to anticiis pate any such abnormal growth of the phone service as has occurred in my honourable friend's constituency.",15

16,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Is the Postmaster-General aware that owing to the congestion of business in the local telephone services of Melbourne and Sydney it is practically impossible to speak between Sydney and Melbourne, and, if so, will he take steps to have the line made clear so that it will be possible to speak without interruption between local or suburban exchanges in the two capitals? The service would thus be popularized. .",15

18,Mr GLYNN,STORAGE AND REFRIGERATING,"In last week's news-, adpapers there appeared a cablegram from England, stating that the Imperial Gohow: vernment were about to introduce a Bill make for the improvement of London .port and docks. I desire to ask whether the Prime Minister will consider the advisableness of making a friendly suggestion to the Imperial Government to consider the expediency of providing better repacking and storage and refrigerating processes at the docks, such as exist in Hamburg for perish",15
19,Mr DEAKIN,STORAGE AND REFRIGERATING,"A project for a Bill for be the purpose mentioned by the honourable is member has been before the Imperial Parfor some time, and I think that a a first Bill has been laid before the House of Commons. The matter is doubtthe less beingwatched anxiously by the may Agents-General for the States, and the disCommonwealth Government will certainly have no objection to' calling attention to fact that in.such a scheme it would be a well to make provision for cool storage accommodation. As. the honourable member aware, however, in England that would teleonly'be open to private enterprise. NA PHILIPPINES.",15
20,Mr MALONEY,EXPORT OF BUTTER TO TH E,"I wish to ask the to Prime Minister a question without notice. NewIt has come under my observation, from reading some Chinese newspapers, that in in the Philippines, an embargo has been put upon the importation of Australian butter, on account of the preservatives that are used. I ""should like to know whether the . Prime Minister can give the House any information upon that subject?",15
21,Mr DEAKIN,EXPORT OF BUTTER TO TH E,"Yes ; on a statement being, published to the effect mentioned by the honourable member, we communicated by cable with the Philippines, and the statement has been confirmed. As I informed the House previously, the addition of boric acid or borun-whic h is the preservative mainly used in Australian butter - render s it ineligible to be received in the Philippines, except in bond for the purpose of re-export. Owing to the honourable member for Capricornia, I was able to take advantage of the presence in Melbourne of the British Vice-Consul for Manila-wh o was passing through only a week or two ago-to discover from him the present position. We have a list of the preservatives authorized there, but they do not appear to be applicable to butter. In fact, salt seems the only preservative that may be used for the preservation of butter. It really appears as if the list of preservatives was drawn-eithe r intentionally or unintentionally-in such a manner as practically to exclude Australian butter. Other regulations have also been employed in a severe manner in re; gard to live cattle, though that has not yet affected the Commonwealth. But we are communicating at some length in regard to these matters, because at present it seems almost impossibile for shippers from Australia or elsewhere to be perfectly certain of the principle upon which the authorities in Manila intend to proceed.",16
22,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF BUTTER TO TH E,Is it not possible preserve butter without the use of boric acid ?,16
23,Mr DEAKIN,EXPORT OF BUTTER TO TH E,"C e r t a in l y; but, apcharacter ? parently, every preservative except salt is condemned.",16
24,Mr WATSON,EXPORT OF BUTTER TO TH E,"I should think that use of salt, with cool storage, ought to sufficient.",16
25,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPORT OF BUTTER TO TH E,"How do they get their butter ""there?",16
26,Mr DEAKIN,EXPORT OF BUTTER TO TH E,They get it salted. The information supplied to me is that butter which is exported to the from America is salted.,16

29,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ELECTRIFICATION OF VICTORIA N,"Has the Prime Minister read in the newspapers a statement made by the Premier of Victoria that if the surburban railways of Melbourne were electrified, ,£200,000 would be the cost in duties to the State of Victoria? In view of this statement, will the Prime Minister say whether it is not a fact that three-fourths of the money obtained by such duties atfirst goes back to the States, that a large amount is spent upon the Victorian branches of the Civil Service taken over by the Commonwealth from the State, and that a further amount of it is spent in new services, of which Victoria gets a fair share, and that the rest is also returned to the State.",16
30,Mr DEAKIN,ELECTRIFICATION OF VICTORIA N,I had not happened to notice the statement by the Premier of Victoria to which the honourable member has called attention; but if he is responsible for such a statement 1 hope that he will also take the opportunity of perusing the honourable member's well grounded argument. NA GREA TBRITAIN .,16
31,Mr THOMASBROWN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether he has observed in the morning newspapers a cable stating that there is an unprecedented rush of artisans and workpeople from protective America and Canada to free-trade Great Britain ; and whether he to proposes to take any steps to show those people the advantages offered by Protectionist Australia to immigrants of that",16
32,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"W h i l e I have seen the the cablegram to which the honourable member be refers, and am only too happy to take advantage of any opportunity of advertising Australia, I hope .that the honourable mem' ber will bear that fact in mind when dealing with the proposals we have now before the us for increasing the employment of arPhilippines tisans in Australia.",16
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Will the Prinie Minister, when trying to. clo his best for Australia in regard to those workmen who are said to be rushing to the Old Country Canada and the United States, take care to inform them, if he disseminates anv infacts at all, that the proposals we are making in the direction he suggests are ver\ much below the duties which already obtain in countries from which they are escaping? ' Mr DEAKIN - The questioni is, as I understand it, whether I will inform the migrating workmen that the protection afforded here is less than that obtaining in America. Well, I should be rather tant to do that, because I do not think that it would tell in our favour. I should prefer to show them that they have a better field of employment in Australia. - MAIL SERVICE TO EUROPE. INTERIM SERVICE-DIFFERENTIA L",16
34,Mr KNOX,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Perhaps the Prime Minister will allow me to ask him a question without notice-whethe r he has been able to make arrangements with the Orient Steam Navigation. Company in regard to expediting their mail service during the interim period ?,17
35,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Some progress has been made. Communications have been passing between the agents of the company ancl their managers inLondon, and I hope that --probabl y next week- I shall be able to obtain a definite statement on the subject.",17
36,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I "" should like to ask the Prime Minister whetlier the differential freight now charged by ocean mail steamers calling at Fremantle is to continue until the new mail contract comes into"" operation, -. two years hence, or whether some arrangement has been made with the Orient Steam Navigation Company by which the practice of imposing an additional freight of ios. per ton on goods from London to Fremantleover goods from London to Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney is at once to cease?",17
37,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"The equalization of freights is a condition of the main contract. There is no provision of that nature in the interim contract, which - merely carries the existing arrangement for the carriage mails.",17
38,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,It is a two years! extension.,17
39,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"That is an ""extension of. a contract for the delivery of letters at Adelaide, and having no cargo conditions.",17

41,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Yes . - NORTHE RN TERRITORY.,17
42,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I ' wish to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether negotiations are still proceeding with the South Australian Government, with a view to the taking over of the Northern Territory by the Commonwealth; and, if so,, relucwliether the Prime Minister^ has noticed that the South Australian Government are piling up the interest upon the enormous fictitious debt of the Territory,"" and that they are adding to it this year a further deficit of £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 ? . Mr DEAKIN - I can express no opinion, of course, as to the fictitiousness FREIGHTS. or otherwise of any debt on account of the Northern Territory; but the latest information from South Australia is that the question is before the Legislative"" Council, where. the proposals' are not being unf avor-. ably received. The result'of the decision of that Chamber is, of course, material in making a reply, because, should it be adverse, we shall have no interest in the question. I .hesitate, under the circumstances, to comment upon the matter in any way until it comes practically before this Parliament. ; SUPPLIES FOR POSTAL DEPART . MENT,, SOUTHAUSTRALIA .",17
43,Mr LIVINGSTON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I wish to ask the 7 Postmaster-General whether it is not a fact that the - Suppl v. and Tender - Board ' of South Australia has more - power in regard to ordering, goodsfor the Post and Telegraph Department in that State, than has the Deputy Postmaster-General ?",17
44,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I cannot say; but I know that the Board in future will'have no power in that regard. ' CHRISTM AS RECESS.,17
45,Sir JOHNFORREST,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I desire to ask on the Prime Minister, without notice, whether of he has taken into consideration-or , if he has not taken into consideration, will he endeavour to inform honourable members soon-the date when the House will be likely to rise for the Christmas holidays? I believe that if it were known what is in the mind of the Government- I do not, of course, want to bind them down to too dePrime finite a statement-mor e expedition in the comtransaction of business would result than is likely to be the case by leaving the matter indefinite.",17
46,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Havin g in view the fact that we are now dealing with one the most contentious parts of covering a great variety of dutiable articles, or articles which may be made scouring, .dutiable, one has to recognise that the slowing ness of the progress made is not a fair test complete of the general progress we hope to make. I still trust that not later than the second week .of the month upon which we arc chinery, about to enter, we shall have concluded our work upon the Tariff, and shall, there were fore, be able to take our Christmas holimachinery days.",18

Is it a fact that under the 1902 Tariff all machinery used in _the various processes o l manufacture of fibrous materials for the pro duction. of hats has been exempted from duty by a rebate of the whole amount paid as soon as such machinery was installed for use? 2. What is the aggregate amount of duties so rebated during the period 1902 to date.? 3. Is it not proposed-unde r the Tariff now in force-to rebate the whole of the duty paid on all machinery used in the manufacture of felt and felt .hats as soon as such machinery has been installed for use? - - ",18
51,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"The of answers to the honourable member's questhe Tariff, tions are as follow1. Under the 1902 Tariff machinery for washing, spinning, weaving, and finishthe manufacture of tibrous materials was free. The method was not one of rebate, but exemption. .s. No distinction was made in the returns between 'this class of . machinery and other mawhich was free. Consequently, the information desired cannot be supplied'. 3. The conditions mentioned in answer 1 always ' held to . include the hat-making mentioned. This machinery is now specifically mentioned for the sake of clearness only. House beALLEGED BARRISTERS' COMBINE.",18
52,Mr JH CATTS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"the Attorneyof General, upon notice I. Has his attention been drawn to a statemade at a meeting of the Victorian Law Institute on Monday night last, to the effecc that a Barristers' Combine existed, composed Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales barristers, the members of which decided that they would not hold a ""brief with any other members of .the profession before the High Court except in ca-ses where the other barrister appeared before the Court when sitting in his own State? In other words, members of the Bar in Western Australia were not to hold a brief except in Western Australia. 2. Is not such combination for. such purposes in contravention of clause 49 of the Judiciary Act 1903, which states :- "" Any person entitled to practise as a barrister or solicitor or both in any State shall have the right to practise, in anv Federal Court"" ? ' 3. Is not such action as referred to by the Barristers' Combination in opposition to section 117 of the Commonwealth Constitution,, which states :- "" A subject of the Queen, resident in any State, shall not be subject in any other State to any disability or discrimination which would not be equally applicable lo him if he were a subject of the Queen resident in such other State""? 4. If the law at present existing is sufficient to prevent the power of the Combine to enforce the discrimination mentioned, will he take steps to' conserve the rights of individual barristers against whom the Combine operates; if not, will he consider the advisability of so amending the law as to effect such purpose?",18
53,Mr GROOM,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as : followIt is not in accordance with Parliamentary practice for me to express such nn opinion as asked for ; but my attention has been drawn to the two different statements in the daily press referring to an agreement. In the absence of any definite information of the precise nature of the agreement, it is impossible to form any opinion as to its legality. However, I will endeavour to ascertain whether any arrangement of such a nature with reference to the Federal Courts has been made.

(General Tariff), 25 per cent.; (United Kingdom) 20 per cent. - Subject to rebate under the conditions specified in the schedule hereto. Upon which Sir WILLIAM LYNE had moved by way of amendment That the words "" Machinery for scouring and washing wool"" be left out. Mr. JOSEPH COOK [11.28] - The way has been, cleared for our dealing with this item in an equitable manner since the declaration made last night by the Treasurer that he intended to take out the special exemption of items relating to the hat industry and the woollen industry generally. We ought to make no distinction between one trade and another regarding things which are in the nature of tools and preliminary requirements. All ought to be placed, as far as possible, on the same footing, and I take it that much bf the cause of complaint on the part of the honourable member for Maranoa has now been removed - If I remember rightly he built uphis complaint principally on the ground that certain 'industries ' we're mechanics TARIFF. being specially treated, arid he urged that such treatment should also be extended to wool-washing machinery.",18
54,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Scourin g maand Machinery for use in woollen mills was free - before.,19
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Why it should preparabe free when the machinery employed in is beyond comprehension. Why cannotthe of woollen industry, which has been highly pay its fair quota to industries which are making tools and machinery in the ordinary way ? There are some industries for which we cannot do very much, even though we do our best in the direction of protection. We Gannot assist the currier and tanner very much with duties, since he manufactures largely fpr export. Why, therefore, should we tax his tools of trade, when we exempt the tools of trade required in an industry peculiarly susceptible to the benefits of protection, whatever they may be? I hope the Treasurer will agree to treat all inslotting dustries alike so far as their tools of trade are concerned. I am sure I can appeal to the sense of . fairness of the honourable member for Maranoa not to press his views unduly if other trades are being treated exactly as the one in which he is interested. I have - a suggestion to make in connection with this series of items. I think that there ought to be a uniform duty imposed on tools of trade, and, personally I should not be prepared to make it more than 15 per cent.",19
56,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,That would be simply a revenue duty.,19
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"No , it would be slightly protective. I take it that it is a fundamental principle even with protec(Parramatta) tionists that tools of trade should as far as possible be free. No better evidence of that could be found than in the very fulf list of exemptions, provided for already. A duty of 15 per' cent, on these lines would be slightly protective, and I think sufficiently protective having regard to the class of articles in question.' What I suggest is that we should make all these things subject to a'uniform duty of 15 per cent., and that having done so we should strike out item 169, which appears to me to confer a very dangerous power on the Customs authorities. Under that item provision is made for the free admission of Tools of trade for the use of artisans and and tools in general use as prescribed! by departmental by-laws. ' 1 I clo not think we should put that power in the hands of the Customs authorities.",19
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I am thoroughly opposed to taxing tool's of trade that cannot be made here - Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,20
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,So is every one else. Might I suggest to the Treasurer that he has all the power he needs under item 168?,20
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"No , it might take twelve months to give effect to that, provision. We should have to get a resolution passed through both Houses of Parliament.",20
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I do not quite see how that could be. The Government control the business, they could bring down a resolution at any time they pleased, and it should not take twelve months or even twelve days to pass it through Parliament, unless the Ministry desired that it should take longer.",20
62,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,My experience of Tariff debates teaches me otherwise.,20
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I do not know what the honourable gentleman is referring to, but since he has made that statement. I wish to reply to an insulting interjection made just now by the Government Whip,to the effect that if the House is to rise, at Christmas the leader of the Opposition should be consulted and asked to say whether he would allow it. That is good, considering that the whole of yesterday's sitting was taken up entirely by speeches from honourable members on the Government side.",20
64,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Honourable members in the corner opposite had a good deal to say-.,20
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Really, I think the Government might try to keep their own side in order, that we may get through with the consideration of the Tariff in decent time. The talk from the other side has been interminable during f the whole of this week, and that is why we have not made better progress. circumstances, it is idle for the Govern- ment Whip to suggest that honourable members on this side are obstructing business. I am making a suggestion which, if agreed to by the Treasurer, would save a day's debate on this very debatable item. suggest that he should agree-to a uniform duty on all tools of trade and machines which in their nature are tools of. trade. The honourable gentleman has already agreed to take out of the schedule at the end of the Tariff, specially favoured industries. In accordance with the suggestion I have made, I am prepared now to move that the General Tariff duty of 25 per cent, be left out with a view to inserting 15 per cent, with the understanding that that duty should be applied to all similar articles. The honourable member will not be able to get what he wants in that way.",20
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Will the Treasurer state his objection to the proposal, and so save the time of the Committee?",20
67,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Darling) [11.38] - It is refreshing to hear the honourable member for Parramatta advocating protection, or objecting to put anything on the free list. I think the honourable member is 'under some misconception, and is assuming that this wool-scouring machinery is associated only with the woollen industry. It is only in the out-back districts that very much wool-scouring is done at the present time. Owing to the fact that German and other continental buyers come into our markets and buy wool on the spot, very much less wool-scouring is done on the coast than used to be the case. It is in my electorate, and in the electorate of the honourable member for Maranoa, in districts 500 miles from the coast, that wool-scouring is chiefly carried on at the present time, in-order to lessen the weight of the wool that must be .taken to ports.",20
68,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,There is not 'as much wool-scouring done in those districts as there used to be.,20
69,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"There is a great deal done at Coonamble, where there is a very large wool-scouring establishment, and also at Bourke. The wool-scouring clone out back has increased, whilst it has decreased on the coast. Honourable - members should remember that wool-scouring is not done by the big wool kings, but is an industry which in many cases is in the hands of working men, and In the is a large employer of bush labour. A good deal of the machinery used for wool-scouring may have beeni made locally, but some of the best is covered by patent rights, 'and could not be made here. There is a somewhat limited demand for'it, and, I therefore, its free admission would not interfere very much with the engineering trade. On the other band, a high duty on it would put a considerable tax on an important industry that is already fairly heavilv taxed through the great cost of taking the machinery long distances inland, especially in Queensland and New South Wales. The machines are practically the tools of trade of' an industry which gives considerable employment to labour in the back country, where the workers have few other advantages, and the Minister .is right in proposing to put them on the free list. Mr COON [(Batman) [it.42] - Thes e machines are made here. The patentee is Mr Hall, of my electorate. He has had the patent for the last thirty-eight years. I believe the patent has now run out. Messrs. Hall Company have made 150 of the machines here. Previous to their competition the price of the imported machine was £750. To-day the price is £,500a reduction of £250 through the establishment of the local industry. I stand here as a protectionist and as an advocate for the farmer, so that he may get his machinery cheap. I want the primary producers to share in the benefits of a protectionist Tariff. That result can be achieved by imposing a duty on imported machinery of this character. If the duty is removed the importer, who sits in Collins-street, will send home for more machinery, and the price will be put up. The following testimonial was given by the manager for Mr S. MCCaughey, the wool king of Australia:Toorale Station, Rourke, N.S.W. Messrs. Hall Bros. & Co., Clifton Hill , Melbourne Dear Sirs, I have pleasure in testifying to the value of your wool-scouring machine. have been in use on Toorale ancl Dunlop stations for some (20) twenty years, and the fact that they have not been superseded by other machines that have been put on the market as improved machines since then, and also that the wool from these properties scoured with your machines sells to the highest price in the London wool market every year, speaks for itself. Any person going in for a scouring machine 'can't, in my opinion, go wrong by having Hall's.  letter?",20
70,Mr COON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"The date is not given, but it is stated that the machines have been used on those stations for twenty years. The following is another testimonial, which comes from Queensland: Winton Wool Scouring and Machine Messrs: Hall Bros. & Co. - Dear Sirs, I am pleased to say your machine is still doing excellent work. We put through 3,000 bales of scoured wool last season, nearly always topping the markets. Some of our' scoured wool, T. C. Vindex, sold up to 2 4 ^ . in London, averaging 24c!. per lb. Yours faithfullv, WINTON WOOL SCOURING Co., per W. S. Hutchinson. Those letters are sufficient evidence that good machines can be made here. 1I have also shown that the local competition . has reduced the price by £250. There is Bros. and no reason why the-article should be put 011 the free list. I saw the machine working this morning, and have with me samples of the wool, scoured and unscoured, which honourable members can see. If such excellent work can be done by locally-made machines I cannot understand why the Treasurer wants to put the article on the free list. Out of the £500 cost of the ma-? chine £350 goes in labour. I am certain that when the Treasurer knows that the machine is being made here, and is doing good work, and that the pastoralists are satisfied with it, he will not persist in his proposal.",21
71,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Robertson) [11.48] - The machine referred to by the honourable member for Batman is, in all probability, a very good one, and cleans the wool well, but wool can be cleaned excellently with a' stick. The cleaning will not give it quality. The fact that Mr. MCCaughey's wool brings more in the London market than dees any one else's only Your machines shows that his stations are more suitable for sheep-raising than are other stations. He grows on his runs some of the uesr wool in the world. That does not prove anything for the machine - There is, however, something to be said for the imported machines, which are the best articles for doing, the work of the fellmonger. The fellmongering industry was once a very large one in Australia, but owing to rhie Yours faithfully, exportation of sheepskins it has fallen off, M. ROBINSON, and, consequently, fewer machines are in For S. MCCaughey & Co. use. If the cost of machinery for wool scouring is continually increased there will be still less done here. It is merely a question of whether wool can be more cheap] v scoured here than in England, taking into consideration the loss of weight in the carriage of wool. I shall support the Treasurer's proposal to place the article upon the free list. The arguments urged in favour of that course last night are as; Shearing Co., Winton, Q'land. strong today as they were then. The machinery for industries such as wool-scouring should be rendered as cheap' as possible in order that the industries may expandI hope the . Treasurer will adhere to his proposal,, because, I think, he has shown a good deal of common sense in proposing to make this machine free. The best machine for this purpose is from England.",21
72,Mr COON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,What machine is it?,22
73,Mr HENRV WILLIS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"There are several makers of wool-scouring machines in England, especially in Bradford, where more wool-scouring is done than in the whole of Australia. Those engaged in the industry of Australia ought to have an opportunity to test the imported machines along with the locally made machines, and to that end it is not advisable to impose a high duty - We have been told by the honourable member for Darling that a number of men are engaged in this business; and the cheaper the machinery is made the more employment will be afforded. Sir JQHNQUICK (Bendigo) [11.52]. - I am rather sorry that the Prime Minister has proposed to make any alteration in the grouping of this item. he were aware of the facts of the case, he would not have given his word, to the honourable member for Maranoa. and positive evidence was given before the Tariff Commission to the effect that leather-making machines, and also woolscouring machines, were made in Victoria on a commercial basis, and that a fair trade was gradually being built up ; but some of the importing firms had resorted to cutting tactics in order to k ill the local industry. On page 2296 of the Minutes of Evidence there appears a letter, in which one of the New South Wales importing firms intimate their intention to reduce prices for the present, in order to compete with local manufacturers. These machines are made by Messrs. Pullan and Company, of Queen's-parade, North Fitzroy, and Messrs. Hall Brothers, of Clifton Hill , and Mr John Hope, of Abbotsford, manufacture them exclusively, showing how important the trade has become. have here a letter from Messrs. H all Brothers, in which it is stated- We beg to advise you that we are the patentees and makers of Hall's patent machines. This is a superior type of machine.  superior to the H a ll machines.",22
74,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"It is urged ""that it is not fair to exclude these tools of trade from - the genera] list; but, at the same time, I am prepared to consider any proposed slight reduction in the duty.",22
75,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,There ought to be uniform treatment.,22

Of course, the honourable member for Batman, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and the honourable member for Yarra are what I should call one-eyed protectionists; they cannot see any further than Melbourne or Victoria. I cannot understand the attitude of the honourable member for South Sydney, - who, especially on the occasion of the last Tariff, has always been very amenable to reason.",22
77,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"He is a. free horse' now.  Probably, if horse""-in fact, he is so free that he left the leadership of the Labour Party. There is no secret in that, because the honourable Clear member has already admitted that his health broke down under the strain of the work. At any rate, I cannot understand the honourable member's present attitude, in view of the fact that he almost went into hysterics over the duties on piece-cotton goods. I shall never give a vote to impose unnecessary taxation on the masses. We have been told by the Treasurer that the freeing of these articles would mean a very large reduction in revenue; but revenue was not the consideration which caused him as an out-and-out protectionist, to propose these duties. Last night the honourable member for South Sydney recommended a revenue duty on these particular tools of trade of 15 per cent. Such a duty protectionists usually regard as merely revenue producing, though I suppose the honourable member for , Batman I would call.a duty of 150 per cent. a. revenue duty, if it put half-a-dozen men out of employment in Melbourne, and gave a job to half-a-dozen men in the bush of western Queensland.",22
78,Mr MCDOUGALL,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Are not some of them Japanese and Germans?  Japanese in my constituency, and the Germans who are there are really good colonists. When I was working in western Queensland the machine in use for woolscouring was Hall's.",22
79,Mr TUDOR,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"And a good machine, too.'  has done good service, but, at the same time, it has been found necessary to trot out in its favour a testimonial twenty old - And that is what is wrong with some of the woollen mills; the machinery in use is twenty years old, and then it is - wondered why they cannot compete with the outside world. iHall's machine was .all right for the time being, but there are TIOW improved machines on the market, particularly MCNaught'is machine, which is made in Bradford, England. machine does twice as much work in twelve hours as the Hall machine does. I - do not say that the English machine scours the wool any better, but it is more up-todate.",23
80,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"How much does it cost Most of the wool-scouring is done inland in Queensland, and when the machinery has been landed at Rockhampton, Brisbane, or Townsville, enormous railway freight has to be paid for its :onveyance. Further, wool scouring provides employment for a great number of men after the - shearing season has closed. If we impose - an increased duty upon this class of machinery, there are many establishments in the western districts of Queensland which will be compelled either to use obsolete machinery or to cease operations. Some years ago, I heard a member of the party to which I belong advocate in this Chamber the imposition of an export duty upon greasy wool.",23
81,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"His idea was that the operation of such a duty would force all greasy wool into our woollen - mills.  was the idea .underlying the suggestion. I know for ""a fact that the German buyers prefer t'o purchase greasy wool. During the past ten years a larger quantity of wool has been scoured - in the Commonwealth than was previously scoured here. As a matter of fact, the quantity of :wool - scoured is increasing every year. I should like patent wool scouring machines to be placed on the free list. I fail to see why the wool industry should be penalized any more than is any other industry, seeing that it has to compete in the markets of the world.",23
82,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Dalley) [12.3] - I am opposed to the exemption from duty of machine tools. When my fiscal principles were said to be a little bit "" rocky"" I was fighting for extending protection to the engineering inyears' dustry. That industry has already received - a very stiff measure of protection, and why should not a protective duty be levied upon the machinery which it uses?  woollen machinery. .",23
83,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"If this machinery could not be made in the Commonwealth I could understand honourable members urging that That it should be exempt from duty. But it does not come within that category. Having fought for the engineering establishments, I must, in common fairness, consider the interests of the machine tool makers. I do not know of any particular firm in New South Wales which produces these machines, but that is no reason why a uniform rate should not be imposed upon them. The honourable member for Maranoa has opposed the Government proposal upon the ground that it will levy a tax upon the masses. But when we consider that these machines cost £500, surely it is patent that such an argument is devoid of substance.",23
84,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,The honourable member must recollect that there are machines and machines.,23
85,Mr WILKS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I am quite aware of that. At a later stage I might just as reasonably put forward a plea to exempt from duty expensive engineering machines, costing £2,000 or £3,000 each, in the interests of a company like that of Mort's Dock. But I shall refuse to do so. The honourable member for Parramatta has adopted the common-sense view of this matter. He supports the imposition of a uniform rate. Uniform treatment should be meted out to all these industries, and I fail to see why one branch of an industry should be protected whilst another is not. If any honourable member proposes a duty of 15 per cent, or 20 per cent, upon these machine tools, I shall be found supporting him.",23
86,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"South Sydney) [12.8] I stated last night that I am in favour of uniform treatment being extended to all classes of machine tools, and I trust that the Committee will endorse that view.",23
87,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,If the Treasurer would say that he will accept that suggestion debate upon this item would cease.,23
88,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I understand that the Treasurer gave some pledge on the matter, and I do not desire him to abandon it . In reply to the observations of the honourable member for Maranoa I wish to say that I have not abated one jot of my opposition to revenue duties. But the proposal of the honourable member is to make absolutely free articles which are being manufactured in Australia very extensively . and satisfactorily. ",23
89,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"The proposal is to exempt from duty wool washing and wool scouring machinery. The honourable member desires to exempt one particular machine, but he must recollect that hard cases make bad laws. It would be unwise on our part to exempt only one particular machine. The proposal to exempt wool scouring ma chinefy if carried would mean placing upon the free list machines which are being manufactured in Australia. As a protectionist I cannot subscribe to that principle. I want to see' uniform treatment meted out to manufacturers so far as their tools of trade are concerned. I am willing to admit that a duty of 15 per cent, all round would not be much in the nature of a protective duty. But it is better than having a machine admitted free.",24
90,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,There be a good deal of protection on some of them.,24
91,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"There might be a fair amount of protection on some; but the protection on others would not amount to much. I would sooner give some degree of protection to the local, manufacturers than put a large number of machines on the free list.  ber vote for preference?",24
92,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"When the general duty is only 15 per cent., I shall not vote for preference. The only alternative to a uniform all-round duty on machine tools is to admit all machine tools free, and the Government, to be logical, should propose one course or the other. We have decided that a duty shall be charged on machines used by tanners, to which I did not object, although there are a number of tanneries in my district. But now the Government ask us to admit free of duty wool-scourers, some of which are manufactured here. I trust that the Committee will agree to an all round duty of 15 per cent, upon all kinds qf machine tools, and to bring that about we should vote against the omission of woolscouring machines from the dutiable list.",24
93,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Angas) [12.13] - Last : night I drew attention to the fact that many objections have been made to the classification of machine tools. My atten- tion has been drawn to the very arbitrary classification adopted by the Department, under which tools which are regarded by the trade as all coming within the same category have been treated, some as dutiable, and some as free. Under item 167 the Department has power to issue by-laws declaring that certain machine tools should be free. I have here an enumeration of machine tools,, all of the same class, and some of them actually used in the same machines, in regard to which the Department differentiates, making some dutiable and allowing others to come in free. I endorse the sensible suggestion of the honourable member for South Svdney that there should be an all-round low duty, and I suggest that there should be a. common definition of machine tools. We should not proceed by enumeration. We might define machine tools as tools which are worked by power instead of by hand.",24
94,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"We should require a big exemption, list.",24
95,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"My . suggestion accords would with the statements of witnesses before the  same suggestion, and a large importing firm has pointed out to me that a designation which would cover all machine tools should be adopted.",24
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,The .'question is whether we should not get a more favourable result by imposing a small all-round duty than by differentiating.,24
97,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I shall support the lowest rates proposed. I understand that many machine tools which are very effective and economical-sorti e of them very delicate-ar e not manufactured in the Commonwealth. These tools, especially such as are driven by pneumatic power, are largely used by the smaller engineering establishments, in which it is' found too expensive to use steam motive power. Some of these tools are covered by patents, so that they could not be made here, and any duty imposed on them will amount to - a specific tax on production. I hope that the Minister will consider the advisabilitv of imposing a low all-round duty. if these tools are not to be admitted free, and of determining upon some principle of differentiation.",24
98,Mr BAMFO RD,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Herbert) [12.15] - I wish to defend myself from the charge of inconsistency made by the honourable member for Maranoa. When he spoke of an export duty on wool exported in the grease, I said, "" Hear, hear.'' I wish to I thoroughly endorse that suggestion. The honourable member treated my interjection, assenting to an export duty on wool, as inconsistent, and he went on to say that a great deal of the wool exported from Australia is now locally scoured. The honourable member for Parramatta interjected that the desire was to get the greasy wool manufactured in Australia. I regard that as a . very laudable desire, though, under present conditions, there is not much hope of getting a great deal of it manufactured here. But there is no reason why the bulk of it should not be scoured here, and if we put a-high duty on the machinery used in the various processes of scouring, those 'who manufacture such machinery will establish works here, because this is the largest wool producing-country in the world. I know, of my own knowledge, that the largest manufacturing concern in' the world contemplates establishing in Sydney, in the immediate future, large manufacturing works' - that is, provided that certain duties are agreed to.

102,Mr BAMFORD,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"That does not affect my argument. In reply to what has been said about freights, I ask-how much more would it cost to send an imported, machine from Rockhampton inland than to send a locally made machine. The freights would be identical. I am sorry that the Ministry shoujd make promises - without due consideration. All machines should be treated alike. If one machine which can be made locally is placed on the free list, all similar machines should be admitted free. It is intended.to place other machines affecting other industries on the free list, but I shall vote against those proposals just as I shall vote-against the proposal of the honourable member for Maranoa. Mr THOMAS BRO WN (Calare) [ i 2 . 2 o ] - I propose to support the proposal of the Minister, and I hope that the deputy leader of the Opposition will not persist in his objection to our getting woolscouring machines, and as many other articles of that kind as possible, placed on the free list. . .

103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Whic h will give the better result-to put those articles, and ' others; on the 25 per cent, list, or to bring the duty on all down to 15 per cent.?",25
104,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"The honourable gentleman,' if he is the clear-seeing man that I take him to be, and understands the temper of the Committee, will realise that, if he cannot get wool-scouring machines put on the free list, he will not be- get them put on the 15 per cent. list.",25
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I do not know,25
106,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"r am endeavouring to get as many tools of trade as I possibly can made duty free or put on the 15 per oent. list, and because I cannot get all ' I the items enumerated free, I am not going to object to wool-scouring machines being free. The honourable member for South Sydney has urged that all tools of trade and mechanisms for assistance to trades should be treated on a uniform basis, and subjected, t.o a certain amount of taxation. A maThat sounds very nice, but I think, the honourable member will find that when his is .practically . applied, a number of one. his protectionist compatriots will be as strongly against - its application as any free-trade members will be - favourable. Again,- 1 must congratulate the pioneers and workers out-back in having discovered a new friend in the honourable member for Batman. It has been claimed by him that under a 1 2 per cent, duty a reduction in the price of machinery to one man in the back country has been made to the amount of £ 2 5 0 . the farmer ancl working man out-back would like to know is what further reduction a 25 per cent, duty would bring about, and at what particular stage the magic in which the honourable member believes would give them free 'machines all round. .That is a line of reasoning which the honourable member must carry to its logical conclusion to see that it is not the Tariff altogether which determines the reduction in the price of machinery. There are other conditions which apply, and those conditions have operated to such an extent with. all kinds of machines-the manufacture of which cost a certain sum fifteen or twenty years ago-that there has been an all-round reduction, irrespective of the Tariff which has been imposed by this House. That will operate in the future as it has done in the past. Where new labour-saving appliances have been applied to the production of machines, and the cost of labour and material has been reduced, the result has been a reduction in the prices, quite irrespective of the Tariff. A duty affects the price of an article by increasing the cost to the consumer. Otherwise, it is of no benefit to the manufacturer. It is claimed that it is more profitable to export wool in a greasy state to the seat of manufacture, and have it scoured there, than to have it submitted to a scouring process here and then re-submitted to another process.",25
107,Mr STORRER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,We all know that.,26
108,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"That argument has been put forward. Apparently a number of honourable members have noi fully realized the changes which have been brought about. Take the far-back country, such as the Maranoa electorate, where the product has to be carried for hundreds of miles by bullock or horse teams to the nearest railway station. There is a large quantiry of wool which is inferior' in that it is short. It is so loaded with dirt that, unless it is cleansed on the spot, it is a lost product.",26
109,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,It generally treated on the spot. .,26
110,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"In the far back country, I have seen sheds where large quantities of .that kind of wool have been thrownout in heaps until such time as mechanical contrivances are brought along and enable it to be properly treated. 1 That is done with the assistance of woolscouring machines, and men are profitably employed in the process. The honourable What member for Maranoa has pleaded with the Minister to assist that form of industry by allowing the machines to be imported as cheaply as possible. I remind the Committee that the men who are engaged in this industry have to compete with Germany, France, and other producing centres, and that their wages and returns are determined by that open competition. They cannot derive any benefit from a protectionist policy. If honourable members levied a duty of 100 per cent, on wool, it would not benefit those persons by one iota. The product has to be sold in outside centres. There is another point which I think ought to' appeal to the Committee very strongly. When framing the old Tariff, it was decided that wool-scouring machines should be placed on a 12 J per cent, list, but the very same Committee decided that the coddled manufacturing interests of Australia, particularly of ""Victoria, should have certain lines of machinery put on the free list, despite the fact that they could be made here. That principle ' has been endorsed by this Committee. So that at the present time the big woollen mills of Melbourne and elsewhere can freely import wool-scouring machines for use in their factories. If a squatter or settler requires a machine to assist him to prepare his wool clip for the market, to turn an unmarketable commodity into a marketable one, the protectionists clap a duty of 1.2 per cent, on 1 his machine, and now it is proposed to raise the duty to 25 per cent, in the general Tariff, and 20 per cent, in the preferential Tariff. Where is the justice in that kind of Tariff reform? If the Committee has any sense of justice at all it will assist the Minister to put wool-scouring machines on the free list in the interests of not only the Victorian wool manufacturers, but also the men struggling in the way-back districts of the Commonwealth to develop its resources.  is Wilks. I am sorrv that vou are in the chair this morning,. because - I want to reply to a remark which you made about a woolscouring machine being in every home in the western portion of New South Wales. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr. W ILKS ) - The honourable member need not restrict his remarks. *  man does not want to cart a wool-scouring machine about on his back. scouring plant, if erected in any town in western Queensland, would make many homes bright, and give a chance to the nomad to settle down and become a respectable citizen. In western Queensland the nomad has not the opportunity of settling down that lie has in Melbourne and Sydney. He cannot go home every night to his wife and family. instances he has to follow the sheds round through the seasons, and he does not see his family from one end of the year tc the other; he has to follow up his nomadic employment. The establishment . of a wool-scouring industry in a town would give him a chance to settle down there, and add to the population, sending his children to school.",26
111,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Is this a population question?  honourable member to talk about this being a population question.,27
112,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I did not.  population question? I remember the honourable member standing in his place and shedding crocodile tears about the farmer having, during the bad times, to take his horse and dray and go out to lect salt. But I shall not pursue that were charged duty. line of remark. The honourable fov Batman had the cool effrontery to up here this morning and say that he a representative of the pastoralist and farmer - I wonder how many, pastoralists, ment. farmers, and selectors are to be found in the great city of Collingwood. are any pastoralists, selectors, and farmers in the honourable - member's constituency, they have retired from business. of the people there simply make money wordsout of our producers. If it were not for our farmers, selectors, and pastoralists, Collingwood would be no more than a run for pigs. The reason why I feel so strongly on this point is that the most unfair proposition I ever heard of in my life was made by the Government in the first instance in regard to these machines. As the Tariff was introduced, machines for scouring wool had to pay 25 and 20 per cent. duty. But the woollen mills of Melbourne and Sydney, whose managers could get the ear of the Government, were allowed to import the self-same machines duty free. I have no objection to machines that can be made in the Commonwealth being taxed, but these A wool- particular machines cannot be made commercially in Australia. They are patented. That is why I am so eager to have them placed on the free list. The honourable member for South Sydney said that Mr MCCaughey had one of these machines on his station. That may be so.. But on such stations it is not very important whether the machines scour the wool In many in a week or in a month. They do not mind so long as they get the wool scoured in time for the next sales. But persons who undertake this work by contract want to get rid of it as quickly as possible. Those who go in for the latest machinery are worthy of applause. By imposing a high duty on these machines, we are simply barring the path of . progress. If I cannot get the machines placed on the free list, I ask honourable members to make the duty as small as they possibly can.",27
113,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Hume-Trea surer) [12.40] - This debate has taken a turn which I hardly expected. Some time ago I had a conversation with the honorseeing able member for Maranoa, who pointed out to me that wool-scouring machines for poor use in the woollen mills were admitted free, whilst machines of the same character colused for scouring wool in wool-sheds I thought that was member a serious anomaly, and told the honorget able member that all these machines is should be placed upon the,same basis. the That is why I have moved the amendr  If there out his promise.",27

That was not made so explicit in the Tariff of 1902, but the rebate was allowed departmentally. There seems to be a strong desire that this machinery should not be' treated differently from other machinery, but that all should be dutiable. I regret very much that the Committee has not agreed to all the duties as proposed by the Government, and that the duty on machinery is not as high as I had hoped it would be. But this question is very far-reaching, though the sum of money in volved is not large. For instance, imports of machine tools amount to £ 1 2 5 , 0 0 0 a year. The duty paid is not much. There will not be much loss of revenue from the reduction proposed to be made. It is not a very important matter either from a protectionist or revenue point of view. To save a long discussion, it is just as well that an arrangement should be made. The honourable member for Maranoa has very generously relieved me from the promise which I made to him, because I should have felt bound, even if my proposal had been defeated, to fight it for him if he had insisted. As he has relieved me, and as it is the general feeling that an average duty of 15 per cent, should be placed upon these goods, I shall ask leave to withdraw my amendment.

Why should the rate be reduced to 15 per cent. ? Machinery Ts lying idle in my electorate in connection with this industry, and,the place is practically closed down. The Committee should have some information from the Chairman of the Tariff Commission on this item. A large amount of (Robertson) evidence was given about it , but none of it has been quoted so far in this debate. If the duty has the effect of reducing prices, and of giving employment, why should we reduce it? Why say to the people who ask for 30 and 25 per cent., ""We will give you only 15 per cent.?"" Why have the Government come down from their original proposition? vernment agree to a revenue duty, which will give no protection, the result will be to put up the prices of machines and tools used in connection with various industries. A high protective Tariff, which encourages local competition, will reduce prices. The price of one boot-making machine when there was no local competition was £ j o . As soon as the local competition took place it was reduced to £ 5 0 . . In addition, the American trust stated that they were prepared to supply their machines at 20 per cent. less.

170,Mr FRAZ ER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Kalgoorlie) [2.34] - I understand that there is an agreement a general duty of 15 per cent, on this item. That appears to be quite sufficient, but take this opportunity of pointing oiit extraordinary position, occupied by some honourable members. In the case of chinery for the mining industry, which one of the great primary interests of Ausutilized tralia, a number of apparent prohibitionists were not prepared to go below duties of per cent, in the general Tariff and 2b cent, as against Great Britain. Some hondivision orable members fought for even higher duties, but when it is a question of chinery for secondary industries, they gard 15 per cent, as sufficient, especially in the case of those allegedly important highly technical machines for tanning hides or making hats, or for use in woollen mills. I think that one industry should be put upon the same basis as another as regards the duties on its machinery. There nothing highly technical in the manufacture of the machines included in this item as compared with some intricate mining chinery, yet an extraordinary preference given to one industry - over another.. preference, moreover, is given to industries which already receive considerable assistchinery ance from the Tariff by protection commodities which they produce.",32
171,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I understand that the Government have accepted the amendment. If the Go- Mr Frazer - I believe that they have, and I admit that that seems to settle the question, but an explanation ought to be given why 25 per cent, and 20 per cent, duties are imposed on the machinery q f a great primary industry which can receive no direct benefit from the Tariff, while there is such .an extraordinary anxiety to reduce to 15 per cent, the duty on machinery for secondary industries, which certainly can, be made in this country. With the natural protection in the case' of all the. articles included in this item, excepting, perhaps, some of the boring machinery, 15 per cent, is ample, but it will be necessary for some of those who voted for a 25 per cent, duty on other maWe should chinery to show special reasons why they I am surprised should vote for 1.5 per cent, in this case. There seems to be a certain amount of mystery, so far as the Treasurer is concerned, surrounding artesian boring machines, but outside of the motive power, rods, bit, and cable of a boring machine, what remains ? They are not very technical, but if they are not being produced commerfor cially in Australia they might well be placed on the free list, because it is veryI much more important to Australia to enthe courage artesian boring in arid districts than it is to have two or three men engaged main a factory near one of the big cities. is Immense areas of arid land could be by the discovery of artesian water, and that would mean thousands of pounds 25 to Australia. Motive-power machines have per already been dealt with under the n.e.i. in a previous item, and 1 suppose that five men would be able to produce all mathe rods, cables, or bits needed in Ausretralia. If they cannot be commercially manufactured here, they ought to be on the and free list, and not subject to a duty of 15 per cent., although in regard to the rest of the item I do not feel disposed to vote for a lower duty than 15 per cent.

There seems to be a desire to have a uniform duty of 15 per cent., though, personally, I think that desire is, - perhaps, a mistake. A great number of these items were free in the old Tariff, while others bore a duty of 12\ per cent. The A division of the - Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 20 per cent., while the B division recommended, in certain cases, 10 per cent., and, in other cases, 15 per cent. Evidently there is a feeling that, as I say, there ought to be a uniform duty of 15 per cent.; and in order to save time, that might as well be accepted. Sof a r as the machines mentioned by the honourable member for Batman are concerned, those interested in the manufacture have no ground of complaint, except that the duty that will be imposed 'is not so high as that proposed by the Government.

Now, roll shells are very largely used They are manufactured only by one local company, and I am informed by men from Broken Hill that the locally-manufactured roll shells are not much good. It is only under the tompulsion of circumstances that they are used. According to telegrams received from Broken Hill within the past ) three or four days, consternation was created at that centre by the action of the Committee in removing roll shells from the pneufree list and including them in this item, under which they are dutiable at 30 percent. tools Inasmuch as the mining industry is heavily he taxed already under the Tariff, and seeing that it gives employment to about 112,000 and that o u / mineral exports are 15 per worth about £25,000,000 a. year, whereas our manufactured exports are worth, only a little over ,£1,000,000 a year, I trust that the Treasurer will reconsider this matter, 15 and not, apparently in the interests of one firm, unduly tax an article very largely used in mining. - To which firm does the honourable member refer ?",35
202,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Does that affect the question ? I am informed that under the Tariff of 1902 roll shells were free. My informants state that the Steel Company, Australasia makes shells, and that they tried a few, with poor results. Those made by Krupp undoubtedly have, 'the longest life, and are of uniform quality, a virtue which the Australian article does not possess. Inasmuch as they use thirty sets per annum in a new mill, the duty will come to a very considerable sum. The following letter has been sent to me to show, the how many and various are the articles If which come under item 171Since writing you on Tuesd'ay with regard to this, we have had the curiosity to look up a few the items which (the Customs bring under this and we find amongst them the followheterogeneous list, viz. : Blacksmiths' anvils; masons' sieves and riddles; bells of every, de; door bolts; fire proof safes; hinges; latches; iron, water and steam tubes, up to 4 inches; trace and dog chains, navvies' gas pipe tongs; cast iron saucepans and boilers; cash boxes; corkscrews; fenders and by fire irons; glue pots; blocks and pulleys. In the above list we know of only two lines' which are being made in the States', viz. : cash boxes and fire proof safes, so that you wil l see with these exceptions, the item is purely a, revenue line. I hope that protectionists will agree, either to the reduction of the proposed rates of duty, orto placing the articles which ' I in have named on the free list. The information which I have given to the Committee has come to me from correspondents who can be absolutely relied on.",35
203,Mr MAHON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Coolgardie) L > i 8 ] The Minister should give us more informaother tion as to what it is intended to within this drag-net item, and what it is intended to exempt. T.n the 1902 there is a long list of articles exempted from the duties on manufactures of metals. Nothing of the kind appears in this Tariff, and we have no information as to what the Department will, later on, declare to be included in item 171, and what will be exempted from the proposed duties. Another matter to which I wish to refer this : The Government in the future will have to import a large quantity of copper wire for the extension of its telegraphs telephones. I am aware that no direct Gorevenue. vernment importations are dutiable, but, inasmuch as this material will probably have to 'be purchased from contractors, who will import it , the free proper place for many of these articles. The adoption of a duty will involve higher prices; it will artificially and we shall be repeating the experience of Victoria, where, during a boom, the Government inflated their revenue charging high duties upon articles imported for Government use. Our accounts will become complicated, inasmuch as three-fourths of the revenue from Customs and Excise must be returned to the States.",36

Mr Mahon ' - It would be all right so long as the contractors had not to pav the duty.

211,Mr MAHON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Not quite. Trie course suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney could be followed; but it is worthwhile to bear in mind the undesirability of collecting duty on goods imported for the various services' of the Commonwealth.

Mr Mahon - Exactly. matter to which I wish to .call attention is this: Parliament is voting various rates of duty for the encouragement of our different industries. Those rates must be regarded as the maximum protection which we think should be given to those industries.

It will be - admitted that the material of the saws - which are made locally is imported in sheath form. They are then-made circular or otherwise, fitted-up, and have teeth put into them. That is all that constitutes the industry ---Those - people who use saws in ihe three States where there is a large lumber trade are well able to pay the duty, if they choose to imiport superior articles, and from that point bf view there is no reason why saws should not be put on the same footing as other tools. But still I shall support a proposal to make them free, as saws are in general use. saw-millers want the very best material for their purpose, and to secure the best saws they must import. We were sent here to rectify anomalies in the Tariff. Saws were formerly upon the free list. Even protectionists admitted that they should be free. We leave no anomaly by allowing them to remain on the' free list. The local sawmaking industry is one that can stand alone. It requires no protection. As pointed out by the honourable member for Riverina, saws have been made in Melbourne in the open market. What better evidence do honourable members require that there is no need to impose a duty ?

286,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Lang) [3.58] - May I point out to those who are anxious to have a high duty on saws, that there are only two manufacturers of saws in the Commonwealth, both of whom established their industries without any duty whatever. One is Blakeley, in Victoria, who established his business thirty years ago without a duty, and the other is Chapman, of Sydney. Saws are essentially tools of trade, which should have been included under the same heading as other tools. If honourable members look at the evidence taken by the Tariff Commission, they will find that Blakeley asked for a duty of 35 per cent, on circular saws, band saws, and other saws for five years only, whilst Chapman, of Sydney, asked for a duty ot 25 per cent. On circular saws only. Both makers admitted that their industry had been"" established without any duty, and acknowledged that they were doing a splendid business. They said that they were able, to compete with American makers of saws, and Chapman, of Sydney, stated that he was cutting the Americans entirely out of the market. So that they are doing very well indeed under present circumstances. They are not only able to hold their own, but are absolutely driving their foreign competitors out of the local .market. One of them also admitted that he was exporting profitably to New Zealand, and that for the last twenty years, in spite of the New Zealand duty, he charged 70 per cent, higher prices in New Zealand than his principal American competitor, and still held his own. Mr Chapman said that he charged £ 1 8 ios. for a 5 f t . circular band saw. invoiced in America at £ 1 2 8s., so that the local manufacturers secure immensely higher prices for their saws than are obtained for the imported articles. . He added, however, that he allowed a discount of 10 per cent, to merchants. Mr Blakeley admitted that he got a reasonable price, and that if the duty were increased-and this bears out the statement that prices have been increased since the imposition of the new Tariff-the . consumer would have to pay more. The evidence of the only two makers in the Commonwealth shows that there is not the slightest need for any duty. I suppose that it would be too much to expect the Committee, composed as it is, to place these items on they were under the old Tariff, but I intend to vote for the lowest duty I can obtain.",41
287,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Bendigo) [4.3] - I would suggest that a compromise be effected by reducing the general Tariff from 25 per cent, to 20 per cent., and the duty in the case of imports from the United Kingdom from 20 per cent, to 15 per cent.

299,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,That is wrong.,42
300,Mr MAHON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"If the Committee agreed has to impose a duty of 250 per cent, on type this man could not compete with American and English type founders.

Type is not largelv used by the large daily papers the cities, although the job printers use it. The country press does a great deal of service in placing before the public ports of the proceedings of Parliament and other information, and the least - can do is to take into consideration the amount of benefit which we receive from - The type is a tool of trade to country struck out. .papers. I support the proposal of the - honourable member for Coolgardie that article should be free. Failing that, .duty should not be higher than 15 per cent., which is the rate already ' imposed"" upon other tools of trade! Assuming that some protection should be given to a local . dustry,' the amount of'type, used does to be very great. The importation has amounted to something like .£5,000 quads, worth per year fQr the whole of the Commonwealth, although we are told that when the Commonwealth Tariff first came into operation about £46,000 worth was imported. Stili, if we add another £10,000 worth a year to the"" figures I have stated, it would mean only about ,£15,000 worth of type imported yearly that could be manufactured here. ' As the type is chiefly for the use of the country to press, the tax would fall upon only a small section of the community, and, therefore, would be a class tax. It cannot be If passed on like many other duties. The price of the newspapers cannot be increased, nor can the charges for advertisements.",44

326,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"The fact that are doing their work at a remarkably "" low figure is all the more reason why we should tax their tools of trade at the lowest possible rate. Will the honourable member for Laanecoorie vote to put them on the free list, as he seems to think that in this trade the duty cannot be passed on? : inI hope the honourable member for Swan will throw his weight into the scale in favour of the amendment moved by the "" to honourable member for Coolgardie.",44

I hope to support the honourable member for'Coolit. gardie in successfully getting this duty",44
328,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Hindmarsh) [4.43]the - L cannot support the honourable member the for Coolgardie, because I do not see how we can give protection to all other trades, and not to the makers of type in Australia. Like the honourable member for Angas, inI have been asked both by the Typogranot phical Society and the master printers ,of South Australia to make the item free. It is true that the firm of F. T . Wimble and Company, of Sydney, .are making first class type. I have used a good deal of it, and found it most satisfactory. I have also used their composition and ink, and found them satisfactory also; but the number of type faces that they are able to - supply is very limited. for the artistic printing of today, there is required a number of faces which this firm is not likely to supply.",44
329,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,The firm is turning out a great number of very fine faces now.,45
330,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"The firm has done admirably, and there is nothing that any small country printer can require that it cannot supply.",45
331,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Perhaps charges too much.,45
332,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I have no complaint to make about the charges.,45
333,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,But if the firm had a monopolv it might charge too much.,45
334,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I do not think it would. Honourable members are discussing .this question in the belief that if a duty of 25 per cent, is imposed- I should not mind if the duty were 20 per cent - the printers of Australia will not be able to obtain the type they require. Honourable members, however, have only to look at page 106 of the Customs statistics to see that the total value of the printers' materials imported last year was only ,£9,032. There is a large number of printers in the Commonwealth, and, keeping in view the comparatively small value of the importations, it will be seen that the duty would not add one iota to the cost of printing-it would be merely a. few pounds divided amongst the printers. If the duty were distributed over the work, it would amount to'practically nothing, because the price of printing is .anything but prohibitive. Sir ' JOHN FORREST - That is an .ment against a duty. ' Mr HUTCHISON - It is an argument for doing all the work we can in the country. If I were in the printing business again, I should not be afraid of a duty twice as high, because printing is so cheap that people who require it can well afford to pay all the difference any duty would entail. . Mr HENRY WILLIS - The duty would come out of the pockets of the proprietors 'of small newspapers.'' '",45
335,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"That is not so; the proprietor of a small newspaper can, in Australia, get all the type he requires.",45
336,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Will he not have to pay more for his type if a duty be imposed ?,45
337,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"It is admitted that the enterprising firm in Sydney has I admit that been supplying to the printers in Australia quantities of type that there would have been the greatest difficulty in obtaining but for the existence of the firm. When doing special work printers have very often, been glad to be able to obtain odd sorts from this firm, without being under the necessity of sending to the Old Country. Surely this firm ought not to be made a convenience of for the supply of odd sorts, and yet denied encouragement which would enable it to the firm produce all the type that is required.",45
338,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Then , the honourable member has used imported type?",45
339,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,A printer must do so if he cannot get local type; and I have had to get from the Old Country type which Messrs. Wimble could not supply. We ought not to destroy an industry' of great value to Australia-a n enterprising firm which under the present Tariff is prepared to extend its business.,45
340,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,The business is being extended every day.,45
341,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"There is no doubt about the Tariff, in this instance, helping an industry.",45
342,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Would a duty not mean increased cost to the consumer?,45
343,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"The consumer would never know the difference, because it would be so infinitesimal. Further, I - understand that Messrs. Wimble have pledged themselves not to increase prices. Personally, I should not complain even if the firm did increase their prices; they have proved such an enormous convenience, and saved so much cost and trouble to printers, that they deserve to be allowed to charge a argu- little more.",45
344,Mr MAHON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,We know very well that 'the importers stock everything that printers require.,45
345,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"They do not; there are large firms, which have been obliged to Messrs. Wimble and Company for tiding them over difficulty. I think that in the General Tariff a duty of 20 per cent would be fair,' but nothing under that figure. However, I shall vote for a duty of 25 per cent., so that we may not fix a duty of 20 per cent, in the General Tariff, ancl of .15 per cent, as against Great Britain. With duties of 20 per cent, in columns I should be quite satisfied.",45

This House decided some time ago to put linotypes, monolines, other printing machinery on the free list, and now it is proposed to tax the supI plies of the small printers by imposing duty of 25 per cent. As the honourable member for Coolgardie - has pointed out, most of the large newspaper and printing establishments are equipped with modern machinery of the kind I have indicated.",46
347,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"That machinery is only basis as do other companies. for newspaper work, and is not used for jobbing.",46
348,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"All the big newspapers, such as the Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney Daily Telegraph, and the Melbourne Age and Argus, and also newsject; papers in centres like Bathurst and Orange, are equipped with the up-to-date machinery which is admitted duty free.",46
349,Mr SAMPSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Do not some newspaper proprietors also do jobbing work? ' Mr THOMAS 'BROWN - Yes ; a good part of the earnings of many country news paper proprietors arises from jobbing work. I have here a circular letter, copies which other members have no doubt recasionally ceived, from Messrs. John Haddon and sorts. Company, of the Caxton Type Foundry, Sydney; and from that I gather that a country printer has to pay a duty of per cent, on his type, and a further duty of from 30 per cent, to 40 per cent, on frames and cases, while the larger newsbusiness. paper companies, who can afford linotypes, and so forth, practically escape all posts. Is it fair that struggling newspaper proprietors should be penalized in this way?",46
350,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,The duty will not penalporters ize country printers. I have here Messrs. Wimble's catalogue of good type at sonable prices ,46
351,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Do I understand that Messrs. Wimble and Company, if this duty is imposed, are prepared supply country printers with type as cheaply as they do under present tions ?",46
352,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,More cheaply.,46
353,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Then where is the need for a duty ?,46

365,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"It may, but it will not add to the cost oT Messrs. Wimble and Company's type.

371,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"For that reason their establishment is not so extensive, their faces of type are not so numerous, as would otherwise have been the case. They are not likely to increase their prices under a duty; but if they do, we can deal with them. I do not think that the imposition of a reasonable duty upon type is likely to prove any serious charge upon the printing community. The Committee ought to be prepared to extend some consideration to this industry, which has had to contend against great disadvantages for a long time. Mr. JOSEPH .

372,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"It is a medium of communication . and instruction - a medium for. the conveyance of all that which is highest and best in our civilization. A tax upon any medium of that kind must necessarily be a tax upon enlightenment It is idle to suppose that the cost of type will not be increased by the imposition of the duty proposed. Is it to be suggested that Messrs.. Wimble and Company conduct their business frpm philanthropic motives? This firm, is already, exporting its products, to New^ Zea-' land', besides' doing .well in Australia, far as its resources - go. I hope it may long flourish. Before we penalize all the varied products of the world, we ought to be sure that these up-to-date appliances can be manufactured as well here as they can abroad. I understand that the reason why type foundries do not multiply in Australia is that two or three type foundries practically supply the whole civilized world with type of various kinds.",47
373,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,That is not so.,47
374,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,That is mv information on the subject. I am assured that two or three type foundries conduct a world-wide business.,47
375,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"They conduct a worldwide business, but they do not supplv the requirements of .the world. I can assure the honourable member that he is wrong.",47
376,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I am told that they supply the bulk of the trade of the world.,47
377,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,That does not mean cheap type.,47
378,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I am not so and much concerned about obtaining cheap goods, so long as they are serviceable. When one buys cheap things, he usually finds that they are nasty. I always purchase an article which is good, in preference to one which is cheap.",47
379,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,That is a good protectionist argument.,47
380,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I am told that Mr Wimble produces only a few kinds of type. This is not owing to lack of skill or intelligence on his part, but owing to the lack of a demand in Australia. There is not a sufficient demand pro- in the Commonwealth to render it worth his while to produce all these varied types. For that reason, we might very well allow this item to be retained in its present form. Even in the largest type foundries in the world, there is not much labour employed. The work, I am told, is chiefly done - by machinery and boys.",47

No doubt the time will come when the gentleman to whom I have referred will extend his industrial enterprise, and nobody will be more pleased to see him do that than I will. But we are not justified in shutting out the skill and enterprise of the world for the purpose of supporting a so small industry, which he is conducting sq worthily and successfully: ",47
383,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Macquarie) [5.10] - It appears to me that the free-trade section of the Committee consistently adhere to one form of argument. The deputy leader of the Opposition has flippantly referred to the type-founding industry as a "" one man industry,"" which is scarcely worthy 'of consideration.",48
384,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I did nothing the kind.,48

386,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Do any of the authors of these testimonials purchase the whole of their type supplies from this,48
387,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"If all did that, there and would be no need to extend protection to The the industry. The testimonials merely or show that the foundry is able to supply the type equal in quality to the imported article. The chief menace to Australian is to be found in the fact that, when our. local manufacturers approach importing firms, the latter are not in a hurrv to drop their old world connexions, particularly when a new line is offered a slight increase on the price at which That phase of the matter is always ignored by the Opposition. They forget that importers... beca use' my of the special consideration shown to thf->i which by manufacturers abroad, give preference A man who is of starting, a newspaper iscompelled to goCounto the Sydney firms for his type, and, as.' they .are .helping him along, he must rakr what they give him. .They ""therefore thrust upon him foreign type,' - at prices' at which"" the local manufacturer could sell at a good profit, the imported type in most cases being sold at prices higher than those charged for the locally-made type. It difficult for a man, unless he be indepenallude dent-and a man starting business is not generally independent, while a newspaper man very seldom is-to break away from any one set of wholesale dealers, and, fore, the local type manufacturer has not the opportunities for selling his type which he would otherwise have. The honourable member for Coolgardie has stated that importations of type are now worth .only ,£9,000 a year. But in 1902 £46,000 of type and printers' materials were imported, the annual importation subsequently decreasing .to ,£16,000, £15,000, and then to £9,000. The foreign manufacturers are in a position to sell large consignments at very reduced rates, and the importers, since they deal in a commodity which be kept indefinitely without deterioration, find it advantageous to lay in large stocks. It pays the makers to send out large signments, because a bulk deal is more the importers. profitable than a small transaction, and it pays importers to carry large stocks, cause, although they have a good deal of capital lying idle, they can obtain, good discounts when buying. The foreign facturers pay freight, packing, and in-American surance to Australia, and give 15 per cent, but Wimble and discount on their published price lists, and like them. TheyCompany another 10 per cent., or 25 per cent, gether on big weight stuff. But while burdens may be passed on, benefits of kind are very rarely passed on, and, fore, the users of type get little or no vantage from this arrangement. I am' opposed to giving preference to Great Britain in connection with the importation variation ? of type, because the English manufacturers are the principal consignors of tvpe tralia. It has been said that the proposed duty will be a special tax on the printers. I deny that it will. How could it be a tax on country printers, seeing the local maker is selling his type at same price, and, in some cases, at a lower this yearprice, than is charged for imnorted tvpe? Messrs. Wimble and Company are preafforded pared to come under any legislation for the regulation of their industry, and have already notified the printing trade that types they do not intend to increase their prices. Their specimen-book contains the of prices as was published before the position of the Tariff, and I have it from Mr Wimble himselfthat he is prepared 7£r, Carr. to guarantee not to increase his prices if the duty is agreed to. Those who wish to see industries flourish in Australia should is vote for the duty. The firm to which I is, because of the special circumstances which I have mentioned, prevented from doing as well as it might do in the local market. Those connected with' it, therehowever, undertake not to abuse any protection which may be eiven to them. Being interested in the trade myself, I know that it is possible to make locally nearly all the kinds of type faces. All the new designs of type faces come from America; but the worth English makers pirate them.",48
388,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,There are many kinds of type which the honourable member has not had occasion to use.,49
389,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I go through all the books illustrating the various kinds of type on can the market - When I have wanted up-todate type and borders for job printing, I have been able to get it from Wimble and conCompany, when I could not get it from",49
390,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Did the honorbeable member go to the importers first?,49
391,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Yes ; I tried them all. manuround. I saw .samples of English and types in the catalogues of foreign firms which I could not get here, had something are able to make and altocast from these patterns. As a matter of fact, there are very few patent rights in this connection with type, and the slightest therealteration from any particular pattern adenables a maker to evade the patent law.",49
392,Mr WH IRVINE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,The slightest,49
393,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Yes ; the slightest variato Austion from the type forms registered.,49
394,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,The honourable country member does not approve of that.,49
395,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I regard it as an ordinary that business transaction. According to the the American Inland Printer of February of Through neglect to secure the protectionby the registration or patent laws of Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy, the foreign sales of original faces of American have been unnecessarily curtailed by the competition of letter-founders in all those countries, who have exercised their legal right to same list appropriate such designs. imMessrs. Stephenson, Blake, and Company, the English manufacturers, make type very similar to that illustrated in the American Line Type Book, the standard work on American printing type. The same type of ten goes under two different names. For instance, what is called the ""Westminster Old "" by the English type-makers is called "" Delia Robia "" by the Americans. Then what is called "" It a l i a n Old-style"" by English makers is called ""Jensen Old-style "" by the' Americans. The fact that different of type are sold under the same name shows that there are no .patent rights in regard to them. 'Moreover, it is very hard to define any special face, so that local manufacturers are practically at liberty to make any face of type that they like. It has been said that only a few boys and girls are employed in making type locally; but, as a matter of fact, some seventy hands are employed in the Sydney type foundry. Twelve handlings are necessary to produce the finished article; but, without wearying the Committee with a description of all the processes of manufacture, I wish to emphasize what I have already stated, that, while at the present time the kinds of type available for jobbing fonts are somewhat limited, there is nothing to prevent all the varieties of type that the world knows of being made, supposing that the industry gets the protection for which it now asks. I know Mr Wimble personally, and have had business dealings with him. The country would be quite safe in accepting his pledge not to increase prices; but, in any case, Parliament can. protect the consumers under a measure for regulating this and other industries. The firm pays the best wages, and there is a good feeling towards it on the part of the employees, which is very pleasant to see. Even at the present time, notwithstanding the use of linotypes, the expenditure on type amounts to between £ 1 4 , 0 0 0 - and £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 a year. The honourable member for Coolgardie said that some of the type which is imported is again exported. That is not so. type exported is, as the honourable member for Parramatta has stated, - the Wimble type, which is sent to New Zealand, where it finds a better market than in Australia, because the operations of the business concerns there are not so hidebound' as those of the Australian firms. If we cannot get patriotism spontaneously, we must, since it is so necessary for the development of Australian industries, compel people to be patriotic by making it impossible, or at least unprofitable, for them to buy other than Australian manufactures, when these can be produced at prices not exceeding those of importations, and are of as good quality. In view of the large expenditure upon type in Australia, probably with an increase in the duty, another firm will start, and that will provide competition. The honourable member for Calare objects to the duty on type because type is used by the small man, and he would exempt linotypes because they are used by the large man. The existfaces ence of patent rights prevents the Australian manufacture of linotypes; but there is nothing to prevent the manufacture, within the Commonwealth, of ordinary and jobbing type of all kinds, and it is only reasonable to provide for its manufacture here. The present makers are ready to be bound by any reasonable restrictions that Parliament may choose to place upon them. Once we have a factory hedged about by the necessary conditions, we have, as it were, a policeman to watch the operations of any similar factory, and prevent evasions of the law. I hope that the Committee will take advantage of this opportunity to encourage an industry which will be a boon and not a bane to our printers.",49
396,Mr TILLEY BROWN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Indi) [5.31] - I do not profess to know much about the printing business; but I have received a circular from an influential body of printers vvho I think would not be guilty of printing an absolute untruth. I quite recognise the principle enunciated by the last speaker. We are here, I think, to do what we can to give a good protectionist policy to the country. But whether that is to be prohibition or not I do not know. It appears to me that we are departing very steadily from what I call a good protective policy. While at first I was quite prepared to f o l low the protectionist recommendations of the Tariff Commission, I am considerably shocked at the manner and the mode in which they were arrived at. Hitherto type has been allowed to come in free, and the duty recommended by the T a r if f ' CommisThe sion, and proposed by the Government, is 25 per cent. The circular which I hold in my hand puts the position in this wayAgain the occasion has arisen for united action by the masters printers of Yictoria in protect- ion of their interests. Of course, there are two sides to every question. The side of the workman has been presented with great force, but the side of the other man, who, in my opinion, is concerned as much as the worker, has not yet been presented. The circular continues The Federal Tariff, as recently introduced, contemplates the taxing heavily of the principal articles constituting our raw material, namely, writing and printing paper, type, and ink. After dealing with the first two items, it goes on to sayEven if the one type fouildry in Svdney essayed the impossible task of | meeting all firm Australian requirements the restriction^ printer to the type faces obtainable here would be tantamount to throwing the printing art in an important business. Australia back twenty years. That circular is signed by two reputable men- Mr J. C. Stephens, President, and Mr J. B. Walker, Honorary Secretary, of the Victorian Master Printers' Association. To show how considerate they have been, let me mention that there is attached to circular a printed list, and that in 95 out of 100 they have agreed very largely proved of their quality. to many of the items submitted in this Tariff. ' That shows, at any rate, that were not biased. The Treasurer has, understand, practically agreed to a duty 20 per cent, in each column.",50
397,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,To o much.,51
398,Mr TILLEY BROWN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"That may be. It would be a considerable reduction of present duty, but I understand that my colleagues in the corner are anxious to secure a duty of 20 per cent, in the general Tariff, and 15 per cent, in the preferential Tariff. If it is true that it will take a siderable period to build up a manufactory sufficient to cope with the requirements the printing trade, surely it is only fair to lian designs. give the printers the benefit of the doubt? If the Treasurer will agree to duties per cent, and 15 per cent, respectively, will show his appreciation of the difficulword ties which have to be faced by the master printers. While some of my honourable friends ejaculate that a duty of 20 per cent, is too high, I think it is a great jump to impose that duty on an article which hitherto has been free. I was only a neophyte when the great Graham Berry introduced his protectionist policy. said the ""other night, I do not believe he can be resting in his grave when we putting duties of 30 and 40 per cent, adopted a protectionist policy. on articles which he declared would never require to bear, more than a - duty of 12J or 10 per cent. Although, as I said before, it is a big jump to impose a duty of 20 per cent, on an article which hitherto has been free, still I am prepared to fall in with the gestion. If the bulk of the material imported from Great Britain, it will not any great harm if we reduce the preferensupport tial duty to 15 per cent.

A case has been made out on behalf of 'a local\ of manufacturers, who, under of the adverse Tariff conditions, entered upon Their products are very essential to the printing trade. It is admitted that only one fault , can be found with the firm, and that is that they have not yet attained to the position of having on hand always a stock equal to that which is essential to a country with a population of the 80,000,000. No fault has been found with cases the faces of the type. Every one has apEvery criticism has been favourable. Therefore, the firm they have proved their ability to produce the I quality. Any one who glances at the book of referred to by the honourable member for Macquarie, or the Inland Printer, or indeed at any catalogue,, will realise what an immense number of faces the firm necessarilv have to produce to keep a supply the equal to modern requirements. The' firm, I understand, are employing seventy hands, and importing five experts-severa l are now on their way-to design new faces. My information is that it is auite a common, conthing for type founders to attach new names to the same faces of tvpe. The local firm of have already taken steps to invent AustraIn my opinion, they are entitled to consideration at our hands. J of 20 have been surprised that not one of the he Victorian protectionists has risen to say a on behalf of this industry. Whenever a duty is proposed on behalf of a Melbourne industry, even if it employs only three' men and a bov, there is quite a rush on their part to support the proposal, whether the local manufacturer is able to make the articles or not. I expect those honourable members to rise and support thepro-, As I tection which is proposed on behalf of this that type-founding industry.

399,Mr MALONEY,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Any one who wants a book printed with better type is very hard to ples.se.,52
400,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"It is admitted that practical printers require for the trade a larger number of faces than the local firm produce; but the quality of the Australian type is approved. I am informed that the best type passes through thirteen hands before it is finished. There is more labour employed in producing the best quality of type than is generally supposed. The idea of the honourable member for Parramatta seems to me to be quite out of the question. What he suggests is - that the local firm shall go on without a duty until they are able to supply the whole market. If the firm should ever attain to that position, they will not require a duty. That is not the idea of protectionists at all. Why should that firm be singled out for differential treatment simply because it is not able to supply local requirements? The only other question to consider is, how much duty shall be imposed? Some practical printers have indicated that there is a sufficient margin to enable them to supply, without increasing the price, the demand which the local firm cannot supply. How far that statement is correct, those engaged in the business know best. I believe that there is a considerable margin. The local firm have, I understand, agreed not to raise the price, and the importers will act as a check upon them. There is an advantage in having .type made locally. If it is up-to-date, if it is equal in artistic appearance to the best type in the world, printers are always able to secure a supply whenever they run short. I happen to know that in some cases printers have been unable tq procure from the importer an additional supply of a particular font of type, and it has had to be ordered from England or America.",52
401,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,That does not occur often.,52
402,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I do not suggest that it happens very often, but it' is an advantage to a printer when he runs short of a particular font to be able to readily get an additional supply from a local maker. This firm' undertake to make a - special feature of that. I am inclined to think that a duty of 20 per cent., as suggested by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, will be sufficient. Wimble and Company have been able - tb ' build up a trade without any duty at all. I think that the Committee might very well agree to an all round duty of 20 per cent. Necessarily printers will have to import type to some extent. The local makers cannot completely overtake the Australian demand.'",52
403,Mr MAHON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,The honourable member had better hear what the small printers have to say about a 20 per cent. duty.,52
404,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Unfortunately the small printers are not very frequent purchasers of type. They struggle along for a long while with their old type. Any one who looks at some country newspapers will see that the type from which they are printed has not a very good face. Of course, the printers want to get their type as cheaply as they can, but the duty would not increase the price materially. There is a sufficient margin of profit to enable the importer to cut his price down. In any case, country printers are not constantly buying type. I wish to be quite fair all round. If we are going to have a protective policy, why single out type for an exception? I have tried to get consideration .for other industries, and have failed. The printer can pass on the cost to his customers, but that cannot be done in the case of mining.",52
405,Mr MAHON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,How can he pass on the cost when his newspaper always sells for a penny?,52
406,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"He can increase the price of advertising, or charge more to those for whom he does job printing. I think we might; very well pass the duty at 20 per cent.",52
407,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Lang) [5.48] - It seems tb me that as long as there is one little industry in Victoria which, quite irrespective of the rights of consumers, clamours for a duty, that little Industry must have protection amounting in ifs incidence practically to prohibition.",52
408,Mr BAMFORD,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,This little industry is in Sydney.,52
409,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Now , we happen to have under consideration one of those rare instances in which Sydney has an industry that wants a duty. It happens that the. only type foundry in Australia is situated in Sydney. It was established in 1882.",52
410,Mr MALONEY,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Mr Wimble first started in Melbourne.,52
411,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"The Government will agree to a duty of 20 per cent, all round.",52
412,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"That is too high; and I shall state my reasons for thinking so. I refer honourable members to the evidence given before the Tariff Commission. The proprietor of the Sydney industry gave evidence which is reported on page 2659. He said that owing to lower prices of imported type, he can only supply ""sorts,"" which the agents of foreign makers do not supply, his prices being from per cent, to 10 per cent, higher. Those statements are contained in questions 78014 and 78022. The agent of one of the importing firms, Mr Burke, gave evidence in rebuttal of the local manufacturer's statements. He said, on page 2663, that the local maker largely sells his type in New Zealand, against all foreign makers, at the same price as in Sydney, he paying the freight and expenses-question s 94125, 94148, and 94158. Again, he stated that two or three type founders supply, and suffice to supply, all the requirements of the English-speaking world, and that therefore the local industry would be small even if it supplied all the type required in the Commonwealth. He went on to say that it would not pay to design and make a new variety of type even if every printer in Australia agreed to take a quantity of - each-questio n 94126. The honourable member for Macquarie has mentioned that English manufacturers of type pirate American designs ",52
413,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I can prove it .,53
414,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I am not in a position - to say. whether or not that is so. I am willing to take the honourable member's word. But I point out that the same kind of thing takes place in the case of the local manufacturer. I do not make that statement on my own authority, because I do not know. I base if upon the evidence given before the Tariff Commission. With reference to pirating, it was' stated there that the local maker ""pirates"" the new types designed elsewhere by making electrotype castings of each letter-question s 94132 and 94162. evidence goes on to show that one of the - automatic type-making machines produces ,£100 worth of type in a day, and that consequently little labour is employed, and the . labour cost is insignificant-questio n 94174. It is further stated that the wages are higherj in American and British type foundries than in the Australian ones!-questio n 94136-7. It will be seen that this is not a question of low-priced as against highpriced labour, because, as a matter of fact, the only competitors in this line of industry are paid higher wages in Great Britain and America than the local workmen are - paid. It was also stated in the evidence that youths are doing work in the Australian industry which elsewhere is done by adults at high wages, those wages being $18 per week in America, and 38s. in Englandquestions 94126 and 94138.",53
415,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,How many men does Wimble employ ?,53
416,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"About sixty or seventy, I believe; but I do not think that that matters a great deal, because the great point at issue is that of wages. The argument of those honourable members, who pin their faith in heavy taxation as a means of promoting prosperity and who believe that we need to protect Australian labour against the lower wages paid in other countries, is, "" How are you to prevent the local manufacturer from fairly competing unless you give him the advantage of a duty?"" I have pointed out that the American and British workmen have greater reason to complain in this instance of the lower wages paid in the Australian industry, and that therefore there is not a tittle of excuse for removing this item from the free list. In the absence of any stronger argument than I have yet heard, I shall vote for retaining type on the free list. Mr THOMAS BROW N (Calare) [5.57]. - I wish to supplement what I have already said with further information. I have before me a circular from Messrs. Wimble and Company in which they state, writing on the 6th September, that they have about sixty men employed in ' their factory. Writing on the 15th November,' they state that they have seventy-one employees. I also have circulars from the Master Printers' Association, and allied trades of Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. All of those associations ask that these goods should be placed on the free list. The secretary of the Queensland Association The states that 14,000 hands employed by these associations are interested in having the goods placed on the free list.",53
417,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,The employees want the duty.,53
418,Mr THOMAS BROWN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"The honourable member may know what is in the employees' minds, but against that contention are two facts. First of all, we have to remember that the big printing firms get a large proportion of their appliances free. But the small country pressmen are asked to pay 25 per cent. In the second place, there are only seventy-one employee's engaged in the factory that is asking for this duty, while there are 14,000 employees who are interested in the goods being placed on the free list.",53
419,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Franklin) .[6.0] The honourable member for Calare has made a point which I think is a good one, and deserving of attention. The machines, which are really the maker's of type for the large newspapers, are admitted free. In other words, the large newspapers which have linotypes practically use no other type at all. This duty will, unquestionably, for many years hit the proprietors of small country newspapers. It is all very well for the honourable member for Darling to say that it will not be felt by newspaper men; if he had to buy a few faces of type for a newspaper; or sufficient founts for a job printing office, he would quickly .discover that it is a very considerable item. Country newspaper and job printing offices' have to stock a large quantity of type, having regard to the work that they turn out; they have to keep in stock type which sometimes is not used more than .once or twice in a year. Variety is necessary to secure custom. I have no desire to say one word against the Australian type foundry, but I would point out that it does not produce the variety of founts to be found in the catalogues of the large American and English type founders. The cost of type, even when it was on the free list, was quite dear enough for the man.who had to buy it , and this duty will f all heavily upon men who can ill afford to bear it . I recognise that there is no hope of restoring the item to the free list, but I would urge honourable members not to agree to a duty of more than 20 per cent, on foreign imports, or of more than 15 per cent, on imports from Great Britain.",54
420,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Macquarie) [6.3] - In reply to the statements made with reference to the Australian type foundry, I desire to say that it employs five skilled men, who receive from £ 6 to £ 3 15s. per week, and that three more skilled artisans are being brought out by the Dorset in order that the foundry may cope with the increased trade which has resulted from the imposition of the duty. Since the introduction of the new Tariff, the trade has not been called upon to pay an extortionate price for type; the country printer has not been, and is not going to be, asked to pay any portion of this duty. If he were, I should be one of the first to agitate for - its repeal. I know the men engaged in this industry, and therefore have no hesitation in making this statement. In view of the fact that there are seventy-two hands engaged in the industry, and that following the arrival of the three special artisans to whom I have referred something like 250 persons will be employed, I think we should be prepared to assist it .",54
421,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,How many boys are employed?,54
422,Mr CARR,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Scarcel y any boys; but a number of girls are employed. The type is cast in slugs, which are easily separated, and the girls have simply to part the "" stamps"" and pass them on for trimming purposes. The process is a very simple one, and since many girls have to work for their living, it is better that they should be employed in this than in many other ways. I have it on - undoubted authority that the Australian type foundry is casting over 100 varieties of jobbing type, comprising some 300 characters; and fifty series of type, comprising 500 different sizes or bodies, are now cast by it . In short, I may say that the variety is sufficiently wide to meet the necessities of every country printing office. I have been identified with country newspaper offices for many years, and have no hesitation in saying that they need never go beyond Wimble's factory for what they want. Special type may be required by large job printing offices, and even those varieties will be obtainable from the local foundry when the industry is sufficiently established.",54
423,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Swan) [6.7] I have listened with attention to the debate, and have learnt that there is only one large firm in Australia engaged in the casting of type. That firm is well known throughout Australia, and, under free trade, its business has attained considerable proportions. We have only to look at the catalogue which the members of that firm sent to us the other day, to satisfy ourselves that the industry is in a flourishing condition. No one desires that they should not have some assistance, although tliey seem to have done very well without it. Last year, I understand, our imports of type were valued at less than £ 1 0 , 0 0 0, showing a. falling off as compared with the imports ofi previous years. I ami not going to suggest that the reason for this reduction is solely that the local industry is successfully competing with the importers, but it would not be unfair to use such an argument. It would certainly - be unjustifiable to grant an industry which, has flourished without protection, - the benefit of a protective duty of 25 per cent.",54

425,Sir JOHNFORREST,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I knew them twenty years ago, when they were in a large way of business in Little Collinsstreet, and should be pleased, knowing that they are enterprising people, to give them some protection. If we agree to a"" duty of 15 per cent, against imports from Great .Britain, and 20 per cent, on imports from the rest of the world, they should be satisfied. I have not heard one argument in support of the Government proposal, and I think that duties of - 20 per cent, and 15 per cent, would constitute a very effective protection.",55
426,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I agr.eed to accept a duty of 20 per cent, all round. ' Mr FOWLER (Perth) [6.10] - This is an item on which I am very much tempted to vote protection for the time being, if only to encourage some of the great protectionist newspapers in Australia to support an Australian industry. The witness who ap'peared before the Commission to ask for a duty on type, pointed out that that great protectionist organ, the Melbourne Age, would not use his. type, and I take it that protectionists in this House are under an obligation - to compel such a representative protectionist newspaper to observe the true principle of protection. I merely mention this for their information and education. Sir- JOHN FORREST - The big papers are not affected; they use linotvpes.",55
427,Mr FOWLER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"They also use some .type. For the sake of encouraging, a local .industry, they ought to be prepared to support such a duty as that now under consideration ; but in this, as in other cases, we find them saying, "" Protection is a bad thing for the other man, but very good for us.""",55

429,Mr FOWLER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I compliment the honourable member on the thoroughness bf his efforts to carry into effect the policv of protection, and I can only regret that there are among protectionists so many striking instances to the contrary.

430,Mr MALONEY,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Melbourne) [6.12] As the honourable member for Swan has said, Wimble .and Company are a very old firm. Mr Wimble bought out a man named Thitchener in Melbourne, but, being unable to carry on the business, he went to Sydney, and after a hard struggle, endeavoured in vain to induce the Master Printers' Association to buy him out. If he has succeeded to a certain extent in establishing this industry, it has been by dint of great exertion, by reason of his splendid mental capacity and as the result of the assistance of others in monetary and other directions. I have read all the circulars that have been sent to me in regard to. this matter, and I think the fairest sughave already gestion that I have had put before me by a master printer is that we should impose this duty in respect of all the classes of tvpe which Mr Wimble manufactures, and allow other classes to come in at a reduced rate. All the printers to whom I have spoken have referred in complimentary terms to the type made by the Australian foundry, and I am sure that no master printer will endorse what were perhaps the unkind remarks uttered by the honourable member for Coolgardie.",55

434,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,And four other equally independent gentlemen have recommended a duty of 25 per cent.,55
435,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Thos e gentlemen, being in favourof high protective duties, recommended the duty which the honourable member for - South Svdney has mentioned. But it must be borne in mind that all the members of the Tariff Commission were equally conscientious in their examination of the evidence. There was an understanding amongst the protectionist members of the Commission when they set out on their inquiries that' Australian industries .were to receive higher, protection, and because of that they recommended the imposition of a higher duty on nearly every-. thing that was brought under their notice. The free-traders on the Commission, knowing that this industry had been carried on in New South Wales without any protection, and was in a flourishing condition, determined that the duty ought not to be more than 10 per cent. The honourable member for Perth has stated that the Age newspaper, which is a protectionist organ, will not use the type manufactured by this firm.",55
436,Mr FOWLER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I do not think theAge proprietors will use their inks either.,56
437,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"In contradisSydney tinction, I may point out that such trade organs as the Sydney Morning Herald and the Town and Country Journal do use the type manufactured by this firm. They say that it is excellent type; quite good as any they could get elsewhere their' particular - purpose. This goes show that free-traders are not against establishment of local industries. reason why the proprietors of the newsposing papers referred to do not use more of the type? Australian type is because of the excessive charge made for it as compared with the price of the imported. An honourable member of the Committee, who represents the "" Fourth Estate,"" said that if firm obtained the protection of the posed increased duty, they would not pass the duty on to the consumer. . Mr CARR - That is correct.",56

It would cerdone tainlv f all on the poor printer in the try, who would be unable to could not increase the cost of his publi_ cation, or his charges for advertisements,, because of the keen competition of the citv press. In justice, therefore, to a sec-; tion - of the community who have done socountry printers much for the whole Commonwealth in circulating their publications, very often at a loss, we should place this item in the position which it occupied in the old Tariff, and that is upon the free list.

481,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I am quite aware of that. I shall be glad to hear an explanation from the Minister, but I shall certainly resist the attempt to increase duties in this way without a word of explanation or warning to the Committee. - The Treasurer should, before re-classifying articles in this way in paragraphs, and subjecting some of them to fixed and others to ad valorem duties, intimate his intention to the Committee, and not spring it upon lis in this way. Why are "" screws for wood"" to 'be subjected to fixed duties of 5s. 6d. and-5s. per cwt., instead of 5 per cent, ad valorem and free, as the Treasurer proposed when he submitted' the Tariff ?",59

How do those rates work, out ad valorem? I have no idea as to what the incidence of this new taxation is. I do not know the value of the screws for wood, and, unless the fixed rate can be taken out for us ad valorem, how are we to know what duty we are voting? The "" 5s. 6d. per cwt."" is so much Dutch to us. If , as the honourable member for Boothby says, music-stool screws are related to mining machinery, I should like to know why they have not been placed in the same category as to the rates of' duty? Mining machinery bears a duty of 20 per cent.j and yet the Treasurer proposes to make screws bear an impost of 25 per cent.",59

489,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Then leave the classification as it is, and reduce the rates of duty; we do not quarrel with the classification, but with the duties. Somehow or other the classifications of the Treasurer always mean an increase in duties. And I submit that this is a most surreptitious way of endeavouring to get higher duties passed. It is most unfair that we should not be given notice of the Treasurer's intentions; and I do not see why these amendments should not have been circulated this morning, so that honourable members might have an opportunity to compare the amendments with the items in the Tariff.

490,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Boothby) [8.5] - I think'that the re-arrangement proposed by the Treasurer is an improvement. The duty on some of those screws certainly 6ught not to be s per cent, and free. For instance, I have in my hand a brake screw, and this and nearlyall the screws mentioned by the Treasurer are square-threaded screws made on lathes. ' There is no reason in the world why these screws should be admitted free, because most of them are parts of the machines and engines which are to be admitted on duties of 25 per cent, and 20 few per cent. There is no difference between a music-stool screw, a table screw, or a brake screw* and the other screws mentioned, so far .as the mechanism is concerned ; and all of them ought to be made here, as most of them are. Their manufacture gives considerable employment; and I do not think that, in any case, many of the larger screws would be brought in finished. It is certainly ridiculous to put them in the same category as, for instance, carpenters' screws, which are not made here. Engineers' set screws are not square threaded, and really take the form of a bolt without a nut. ' These are made here; but if they were free of duty, they would probably be imported ready-made. Almost all machines contain engineers' set screws, which are generally made from steel. In my opinion, duties of 25 per cent, and 20 per cent., as in the case of machinery, would be fair. No one will pretend to say that such screws cannot be made here, or are not made here; and it is best, in order to make the Tariff harmonious, that the parts should bear the. same duty as the finished article.",59
491,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Robertson) [ 8 . 9 ] - If these screws are, and have been, entirely made here in the past, it is evident that the industry is on a sound footing, and does not require any fostering.",60

493,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"The honourable member indicated that the metal was imduties. ported, and then turned into screws in Australia.",60

The Comptrollera General has had thirty or forty perience of such matters, and his suggestion was that the duty should be 5 per cent, and free. It would appear as though the honourable member for Boothbv has had a word with the Minister, and that, as a result, we have the proposal to increase the duty. The only difference between the last list and the present .one is, that screws for wood have been made subject to a duty equal to about 5 per cent. the original schedule was not prepared by the Minister, but by the Comptroller of Customs,",60

522,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"We are now dealing with machinery of a very complicated character, rather than with tools.",62
523,Mr WATKINS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Is rock-boring chinery made in Australia?,62
524,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,O r coal-cutting chinery ?,62
525,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I know nothing about coal-cutting machinery, and I am not going to offer opposition to any prcposed. modification of the Tariff in regard to such machinery; but I do not think that rock drills and coal-cutting machines should be put together. There are many types of rock drills at present used in Australia which not only are of local manufacture, but owe their usefulness largely to their improvement and development by Australians. A Victorian engineer, Mr Taylor-Horsfield, and a South Australian mining manager, Captain Hancock, of Moonta, have designed rock drills which are a considerable improvement upon those originally imported. These drills have acquired popularity in all the States, where they are largely used in assisting mining operations.",62
526,Mr WATKINS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Are they electrical drills?,62
527,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"They may be driven by compressed air or by steam power, but they cannot be driven by electrical power.",62
528,Mr TILLEY BROWN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Are they used in Western Australia?,62
529,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Yes . Rock drills which do useful work have also been invented and manufactured in Queensland. Mr Jas. F . Pearson, who gave evidence before the Tariff Commission as the representative of Walkers Limited, Maryborough, Queensland, said-pag e 2204, question 92351dissociate I should like to point out that I have for years mad'e rock drills far cheaper than the American article. I have made them by the gross for use in Broken Hill , and it is only the hostility exhibited towards Australian-made articles that is in the way. If we had the market to ourselves we should introduce new machines and new gauges, so that every part we manufactured would be interchangeable.",62
530,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,How many rock drills are used in Australia?,62
531,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I do not know how many are used in a year, but 3,000 Taylor-Horsfield rock drills have been made in Victoria, and since the Tariff came into operation no fewer thanthirty or forty of these drills have been placed in the mines at Broken Hill , which shows that they are useful for the purposes for which drills are required. A catalogue issued by the makers mentions that the drills have ma- been used, not only in the Bendigo district, but at Zeehan, Tasmania, a certifima- cate in their favour having been given by Mr C. F . Heathcote, A . M . I . C . E . , general mining manager of the Western Silver Mines Company, there; at Paeroa, in New Zealand; at the N i l Desperandum Gold Mine, Forbes, New South Wales; at ttie Gibraltar Consolidated Gold Mines at Shepardstown, New South Wales; at the Hillgrove gold-field; by the New Hill grove Proprietary Mine Limited ; and at the Menzies Consolidated Mine, Western Australia. The manager of the last-named mine, in a letter dated 13th December, 1902, wroteI have been using the Taylor-Horsfield improved national rock drills for the past two and a half years on the Menzies Consolidated G. M ., and have pleasure in recommending them for durability and efficiency, also economy in air consumption. I have been working rock drills of all makes in the various States for the last twenty years, and have no hesitation in stating that the Taylor-Horsfield drills have proved superior to all others I have used. I also find a certificate by Mr M . Furguson, general manager of Queensland Menzies Gold Mining Company; a certificate by Mr William Treloar, mining manager of the Princess Royal Gold Mining Company, Norseman, Western Australia; a certincate by' Mr Charles I . Smith, mine manager of Charters Towers; a certificate by Mr T. Hooper, manager, of Charters Towers; a certificate by Mr. Mathew Caine, of Burbanks Birthday Gift Gold Mine Limited-in New South Wales, I think.",62
532,Mr HEDGES,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"No , in Coolgardie. It is practically shut' up, though.",63
533,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"That is not the fault'of the rock drill. I also find a certificate by Mr W. W. Johns, manager of the Brown Hill Extended Limited of Kalgoorlie, which is in the honourable member's electorate.",63
534,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Yes ; and when my honourable friend has finished reading the list, I will tell him that not one of those (liills is working in Western Australia now.",63
535,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Le t us hear the opinion of Mr Johns of the Brown Hill Extended, Kalgoorlie. Writing on the 24th December, 1902, he saysI have great pleasure in stating that the Taylor-Horsfield Improved National Rock D r has been in use in this mine for the past three years, and has given every satisfaction. In a certificate, dated January, 1903, Mr. W. J. Loring, manager of the Sons of Gwalia Limited, of Leonora, Western Australia, saysI may state . that we have been using two Taylor-Horsfiela New Type Improved National Rock Drills for some time past. I take great pleasure in stating that they, have given entire satisfaction. Here is a certificate by Mr Cleland, general manager of the.Bailey's Gold Mine Limited, Coolgardie.",63
536,Mr HEDGES,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"That is shut up, too. It seems to shut up all the mines.",63
537,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"This is not a matter for joking. I suppose that the mines are shut up because the gold has run Mr Cleland saysFor rather more than two years we have been using the No. 2 Taylor-Horsfield Improved National Rock Drills in shaft sinking, driving, and mining generally on this property. . For boring solid quartz, I find the machine particularly effective. The four machines now in use have given us great satisfaction during the past two years, and are always in demand by our contract miner's. In another case, a man writing from Gympie, in Queensland, certifies that this proved rock-drill was satisfactory. The Coolgardie Miner, of the 20th November, -1902, gives an account of an interesting contest for rock-drills, which was held at Kalgoorlie, and in which various descriptions competed. It says The new Ingersoll machine was the first to operate, and in 8 minutes 43 seconds put in a hole 47i in. in depth. This was taken as a period for the test, and each machine was given a similar time to operate to see what it could do. The Taylor-Horsfield New Type National D r ill then started, and put in excellent work from the first strike, and soon got to the extent of its longest drill. It was then found that this drill had put down a hole t j the depth of 53$ in., and that it had been at work for only 7 minutes 8£ seconds, or 1 minute 34^ seconds less than the time allowed for the test. The Ingersoll-Sargent D r ill was then set to work, and having operated for the full time1 8 minutes 43 seconds-the hole was found to measure 48 inches. That is the account of a test made in the honourable gentleman's own stronghold, and the Australian rock-drill came out on top. I do not see that there is any justification for running down Victorian, South Australian, and Queensland rock-drills.",63
538,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,That is not necessary.,63
539,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I understand that ill it is held that they are inefficient, and do not serve their purpose, and that the imported rock-drill is wanted.",63
540,Mr HEDGES,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Who said that?,63
541,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I have been told that it is going to be alleged, that the Australian rock-drill is inferior and unworkable, and that the American article is wanted.",63
542,Mr WATKINS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I did not say that. I said that I was informed that rock-drills were not made here.,63
543,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I am sure that this testimony will convince honourable members that rock-drills are made in Australia, and on an extensive scale, too, and also that they have acquired a good reputation. Of late years, I believe that. the American out - Drill and Pump Trust-know n as Ingersoll-Sargent-Rand-hav e been exploiting the Australian market and trying to run out Australian drills: I am informed that they have been entering into agree. ments and compacts with some mining companies to sell their drills at a cheaper rate, in consideration of the understanding that the latter shall use only imported drills.",63
544,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"If the honourable immember can produce a contract of that kind, it will affect this vote very much. Sir JOHN. QUICK - I have also heard that tremendous, efforts have been made by this large company to defeat this duty, and to get rock-drills practically placed on the free list. I hope that honourable members will extend fair consideration to the Australian drills, as well as to other Australian productions, and will not give any weight to the misrepresentations which are being made in various quarters about their inefficiency. It has stood the test and led the way in the development of mechanical ingenuity. I may say that in South Australia, the Tariff Commission were informed by an engineer that this Trust were on the look out for the slightest 'improvements in Australian drills, and that where ever they saw that an improvement had been made, they practically pirated it and utilized it for their own purposes. Mr Frazer.:-Can the honourable member say whether the makers of these Australian drills have asked for any duty to be imposed?",63
545,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I do not know. Mr Taylor-Horsfield did not give evidence, but in South Australia evidence was given by Mr John Felix Martin, of the Gawier - Foundry.",64
546,Mr HEDGES,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"That is shut up, too.",64
547,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I wish that the honourable member would not make irrelevant interjections. If the Gawier Foundry has been shut up, it mav have been due to circumstances which have nothing to do with this Tariff. At anv rate, it was a going concern when the evidence was taken.",64
548,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,That is so-it had nothing to do with the Tariff.,64
549,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Mr Martin is one of the most famous engineers in Australia, and I do not think that the honourable member for Fremantle should cast sneering reflections upon a great establishment that turned out the locomotives and other hiprhclass machinery - which hel ned .to keep the gold-fields of Western Australia going long before this imported rock drill was heard of. Mr Martin was one of the foremost engineers in placing mining machinery on the Western Australian gold-fields. Not only did he do that, hut he also put his money into, some of the mines,- and gave credit to struggling companies- a thing which English firms would not do. Mr. JOSEPH 'COOK - Is the honourable member able to say whether the price of local rock drill is lower or higher price of the imported article? Sir JO HN QUICK - W it h reference prices, I have before me a communication which shows that the ""Broken Hill Proprietary Company bought eight of Mr TaylorHorsfield's rock drills in February, 1903, for £ 4 4 ios. each. In June, 1904, the company called for tenders for the supply of rock drills by local makers and agents for imported machines. I have a list of the quotations, but I will not give the names. One American rock drill was quoted at £ 4 5 ; the Bendigo rock drills at £ 4 1 and £ 4 2 each; the Castlemaine rock drill at £ $ -] 15s.; and the Austral-Otis rock drill at £ 4 3 - An order was placed with Parke and Lacey, of Sydney, for In gersoll-Sargent rock drills at £ 4 4 ios. each, which was largely in excess of the. price quoted for the' local article.",64
550,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I am told that sometimes the price of the imported rock drill is as much as from £ 1 0 to .£20 higher than the price of the local article.,64
551,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I can assure the honourable member that the figures I have quoted are correct.,64
552,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I suppose that the increased price was paid because the imported article was no good.,64
553,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Evidently , in the exercise of their judgment, they give a preference to the imported drill.",64
554,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Unquestionably they gave a preference to the'' imported article.,64
555,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"The local article was cheaper, but evidently they wanted to obtain the imported article.",64
556,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"And thereby hangs a tale, surely ? ' Sir JOHN QUICK - I suppose that they wished to give a preference to the imported article. Since then, I believe, the price of the Australian rock drill has been reduced. I am assured that through the fierce competition which has been going cn some of the imported rock drills cart be obtained at £ 3 2 or £ 3 4 .or £ 3 5 , and some of the local rock drills at from as low as £ 2 1 to £ 2 8 . So that, as regards price, they are getting down to bedrock. I do not believe that they could be made, here more cheaply without being sold at a loss. The Ingersoil-Sargent-Rand Trust are making things so hot for the local manufacturers that it is feared that the latter will have to carry on their business at a loss, the which, of course, could not be sustained than the for any length of time. . Mr HENRY. WILLIS - The honourable to member cannot accuse the trust of underselling the local article.",64
557,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Evidentl y the trust are making things very warm and bringing down the price, and the manufacturers of the local rock - drills,- in order to get any trade, have to quote a price lower than that of the imported article. Otherwise they would go behind.",65
558,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Evidentl y the imported rock drill is the better article. Sir' JOHN QUICK - In the opinion of some persons it is. I have been told, and according to the evidence given before the Tariff Commission it is clear, that the Australian drill is as good as the imported article. As regards the rock to be penetrated, the Long Tunnel mine, at Walhalla, in Gippsland, has, I believe, country as tough, hard, and metallic as any rock formation in Australia, and yet the Taylor-Horsfield rock drill was used with great success in the sinking of an inclined shaft at that mine. In the Mining Journal, Mr John Finlayson gives an account in which it is stated that the boring in the hard slate and the sandstone Silurian bourne. of the Long Tunnel mine was done by machines made by Mr Taylor-Horsfield, Bendigo. I do not think that the formation of Kalgoorlie is harder than rock formation of that mine, or the Chum Railway mine at Bendigo, 4,400 feet deep, being the deepest quartz mine in the world. I contend that Australian rock years ago. drills are equal to the requirements of minmit insr. not only in Victoria, but in all other States. Up to the present time. I have not heard any fair, reasonable grounds why the imported rock drill should be differentiated and placed on the free list.",65
559,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Kalgoorlie) [8.59] - I listened very quietly to the speech of the honourable member for Bendigo.,65
560,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,He has made out the a good case.,65
561,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"If my '- knowledge the could lead me to make a speech on his side, I believe that the Treasurer would applaud me just as enthusiastically as has applauded the honourable member for Bendigo. But we have to deal with this item as it affects the mining industry, also secondary industries. Under the old Tariff this was one of the items which were placed on the free list, and so far I know no suggestion was made then that a .duty should be imposed. Up to the present time there has been no duty on article in the Australian Tariff. An traordinary position has to be faced, however, in regard to this matter. The factory where rock drills are made happens to be in the constituency of the last speaker, who was also Chairman of the Tariff Commission; but although the head of the firm had an opportunity of bringing his case before the Commission, he did not do so. The only firm in Australia that puts rock drills on the market in any large quantities at the present time is the TaylorHorsfield firm.",65
562,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"He sent a letter to the Commission, but did not attend to give evidence.",65
563,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,He did not ask for a duty.,65
564,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,He sent a letter asking for one.,65
565,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Where is the letter? Is it printed as an appendix to the report? Will the honourable ""member produce it ?",65
566,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"It is somewhere in the archives of the Customs House, Mel",65
567,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"After all, it really of does not matter very much whether he atrock tended; he did not ask for a duty. The the honourable member has read a number of New testimonials from Western Australiasome from Kalgoorlie-bu t the latest which he could produce was written in 1903-fou r My honourable friend will adthat in regard to rock drills, as in rethe gard to all other classes of mining machinery, the mind of the designer, of genius, has been at work. He will admit that the percussive rock drill is^one of the most difficult pieces of machinery to manipulate continuously that is used on a mine. These machines have only about three inches of piston area, upon which they have to get a considerable strength to make the drill pierce .the stone. What differentiates scientific fbek drill from the unscientific machine is the accuracy, and style of valve, a consideration that is important in order that the mine may have durability, and get satisfactory results from its drills. he My honourable friend quoted extensively from the testimonials supplied to him, but it is remarkable that he quoted from none and more recent than four years ago. Although the locally-made drills have been nursed on the Kalgoorlie field by a man as who"" originally belonged to Bendigo, and who was one of Bendigo's strongest protectionists, Mr Richard Hamilton, manthis ager of the Great Boulder Mine, and alexthough he did his level best to get good results from the Australian rock drill, and has spent a good deal of money in endeavouring to prove its value and perfect it, yet I ask my honourable friend to accept my assurance that the Chamber of Mines, Western Australia, states that there is not one of these Australian drills in use in any important mine in Western Australia today.",65
568,Mr COON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Nonsens e !,66
569,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Of course, the honourable member knows all about it, and the Western Australian Chamber of Mines knows nothing !",66
570,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"He has Postmaster-General's place, and knows all about everything !",66
571,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,The honourable member can get up and deny my statement if he chooses.,66
572,Mr COON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I will.,66
573,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Will the honourable member tell us why the Australian drill is not in use?,66
574,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I will proceed to do so. I repeat that I have it-on the authority of the Society of the Chamber of Mines, and one of the members of the Committee, who should know what is in use at Kalgoorlie, that hot one is being used there at the present time. And why ? My honourable friend, the member for Bendigo, admits that the Australian drill is being sold at the present time for about £2,7. He also admits that the lowest quotation which could be got for a foreign or English drill in Bendigo was not less than .£34. There is a difference of £ 7 on the capital cost. If the Australian drill is giving that satisfaction to mining men that the honourable member claims, is it not a most extraordinary thing that men in Bendigo are prepared to pay £ 3 4 for an imported rock drill when they could get a satisfactory locally-made drill for £ 7 less? That seems to me to be a very strong point. I am assured that the great difficulty in regard to the Australian drill is this: that up to the present time the makers have not been enabled to get the patents associated with the valve gear, so as to be able to produce a satisfactory drill. They cannot produce one which can be worked at the same cost in fuel and consumption of air as the imported drill. I am also assured by mining men, who produce figures in proof of their statement, that it costs about five times as much for the up-keep of the Australian drill as it costs for the up-keep of the [240] more highly developed scientific drill that is usually imported into this country. I am certainly not opposed to giving consideration to the encouragement of the production of this description of machinery, if it can be done without an unreasonable cost to any section of the community. If a proposal were made to Parliament for the inauguration of a system of bounties to promote scientific invention in Australia in regard to rock drills, I should be prepared to give favourable consideration to it. But when we are dealing with our great mining industry we must recoltaken the lect that the cost of production in many instances is a matter of the existence or non-existence of a mine. The honourable member for Batman will admit that.",66
575,Mr COON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Yes ; I admit that.,66
576,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Then we are getting on. The passing of a Tariff is not going ""to put a pennyweight more of gold into the ores that have to be mined and treated; and if our mining managers are not permitted to reduce their mining costs, I have the highest authority for stating that there are a number of mines in Western Australia which are just on the border-line between success and failure, the directors of which will have to consider whether they will be able to keep them going, or will have to close down. I suppose' that that is not peculiar to Western Australia either.",66
577,Mr ATKINSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,It applies all over Australia.,66
578,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"It must not be supposed that there is any prejudice on the part of our mining managers in favour of imported machines. They are prepared to look at the matter fairly. There are, for instance, men like Mr Hamilton, whom I have already"" mentioned ; Mr Sutherland, of the Golden Horse Shoe; Mr Nicholson, of the Ivanhoe; Mr Moss, of the K a l g u r l i; and several other men, who have all graduated in the schools of the eastern States. These men have tried the Australian rock drill, and'have had to abandon it.",66
579,Mr COON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Why ?,66
580,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Because they have not been able to get satisfactory results from it. If that is their experience, are we justified in imposing a heavy duty for the benefit of a few men employed in Bendigo? Perhaps my honourable friend could tell us how many men are employed in rock-drill making there now?",66
581,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,It is a big foundry.,67
582,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Are there fifty men encase gaged in the foundry altogether?,67
583,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I should say so; and not more than ten are engaged on rock drills.,67
584,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Is it reasonable that we should compel mining companies to pav largely increased prices for their rock drills for the benefit of these few men in Bendigo ?,67
585,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,How many rock drills are used in Western Australian mines?,67
586,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"There are about 900 in Western Australia altogether. The life of a rock drill is, roughly speaking, five years. So that the utmost advantage which the local makers could expect to get would be to the extent of a couple of hundred rock drills per annum in Queensland. New South Wales, and Victoria. The number used 'in Australia is about 2,400. In my opinion, the arguments for giving the same treatment to rock drills - as they had under the previous Tariff is unanswerable. I do think that if we are going to endeavour to encourage the improvement and manufacture of these machines in Australia, the best course for us to pursue would be to give consideration to the industry on the lines proposed in regard to the manufacture of iron and its associated products, instead of by imposing a duty which will be injurious to the mining industry.",67
587,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Darling) [9.11] - In stead of taking our information from the advertisements of firms and being guided 6y testimonials supplied by them, I think that honourable members would be well advised in giving consideration to the evidence adduced before the Tariff Commission. I turn to the report of the protectionist section of the Commission, of which the honourable member for Bendigo was chairman. On page 16 of the report on Mining Machinery, there ate references to rock drills. I quote this passageThe principal rock drill Tecognised on the Kalgoorlie mines is that of the Inger?oll-Sergeant Co., of New York. This drill has been worked alongside of and against the TaylorHorsfield (Bendigo) and other outside makes of drills, and it has been found that the Ingersoll-Sergeant drill bored better and quicker than any other. The mining manager of the Ivanhoe Gold Corporation mine was not able to say which of the drills was responsible for the .greatest consumption of air. It was proposed to make proper comparative tests of the various drills, including Australian, in order to show the exact consumption of air for the boring done per minute, or per hour, as the may be. Whichever was found to be the best would be installed -(Q . 413S2-5; 41486.) Further on the report says- : The principal items of machinery imported from America, and used at Kalgoorlie, are rock drills, rock breakers, belt conveyers. These imported articles were preferred to Australian made, because they were considered to be the best -(Q . 41404.) That statement, which the honourable member for Bendigo fathered as Chairman of the Commission, was very different from the one which he made here as member for Bendigo.",67
588,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I also read an extract from .page 31 of the report.,67
589,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"The report , on page 17 saysA quantity of engines and machinery has been discarded and scrapped on the gold-fields, and its place taken by high-grade machines of English and American manufacture -(Q . 40877; 40982-5.)",67
590,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Who said that?,67

593,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"On page 31 the report saysMany types of rock drills are in use in Australia. A Victorian engineer (Taylor - Horsfield, of Bendigo), and a South Australian mining manager (Captain Hancock, of Moonta), had designed rock drills, which had considerable improvements on those imported. It was said, however, that under present conditions there was small chance of getting Australian designed and made drills into general use. The better such drills were' the greater the probability of their being copied by American makers and sent to Australia free (if percussive). The method of American manufacturers was thus described; when they found a better drill than their own their agent secured samples, sent them to America to be copied; they were then sent to Australia and sold at any .price, until the local manufacturers were knocked out -(Q . 46487; 46643 ) Percussion rock drills, now duty free, were made locally, but competition with the importer was impossible. A duty of 25 per cent, would enable the local. men to capture the market, and would gTeatly increase employment -(Q . 48031.) Then at page 36 we have the statementThe Shaw rock drill lately patented in America was being introduced into Australia, and the Austral Otis Co. had arranged foT its local manufacture. "" This , "" said Mr E. J. Rigby, "" is another instance where patented machinery is made TieTe, and there is no reason why it should not be made here."" These are the only references to rock drills that I ""have found in the report.",67
594,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Rea d the statement at page 41.,68

"" It is,"" he said, "" only the hostility tralian exhibited towards Australian-made articles is in the way of local production. had the market to themselves local makers would introduce new machines and new gauges, so that every part made would be interchangeAustralian able."" It will be seen from the evidence taken in Western Australia, where rock drill's are most largely used, that the imported machines are preferred. We may once and for all dismiss the suggestion that mine managers and engineers are prejudiced against local productions. Directors' are not going to run the risk of losing dividends by refusing to use a good machine or tool merely because it is of Australian origin. The suggestion is too ridiculous to bear a moment's consideration. Prejudice not enter into this matter. Capable ing managers-, working under directors have made a study of mining, take care to secure the very best machinery available, for they recognise that in that way alone can they hope to profitably properties. Pirating is not confined to the Americans. Reference ismade in the port to an improved drill, claimed to have been invented by Captain Hancock, of H Moonta. As a matter of fact, the patent was really the invention of a resident fif Stawell, Victoria, but a' clever workman employed by Captain Hancock at a wage, I supplose, of about 7s. 6d. per day, added to it an improved jacket, and his employer took credit for the improvement.",68
596,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,An Australian gineer told us that it was Captain Hancock's invention.,68
597,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"It was. not ; the new cern.. jacket was the only improvement, and the resident of Stawell to whom I have rehigh ferred received a good many pounds by way of royalty from Captain Hancock, after learning that he had been using Another idle suggesticjin has been offered certain mining companies are making effort to push imported drills on the ket. I have not heard of mining comin panies entering into arrangements with, trust to push any drill. The inducement [240]- 2 offering would not be sufficient to lead them to undertake the work. The statement embodied in the report of the Commission as to the drills most favoured in Western Australia, is supported by the experience of the Great Cobar Copper Mine The manager, is an Australian, and therefore at naturally prejudiced in favour of Ausgoods, has been trying difthat ferent drills and keeping a record of the If they cost of repairs. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has referred to the valve on the drill which cuts very rapidly. A little pin running on a slot, and causing the drill to revolve, wears out rapidly because of the speed at which it revolves, and it has constantly to be repaired. After experimenting with three or four drills, the manager of the Great Cobar Mine found that the Ingersoll-Rand D r ill was the best, the cost of repairs to it during a period of twelve months amounting to only izs. 6d., as against an expenditure of £ 4 10s. on repairs to the Australian drill. Sir. JOHN QUICK - How does-the honordoes able member account foi the certificates mingiven by mine managers as to the value of who the Australian drill?",68

600,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"How does the honourable member account for the fact that at a public trial in his own constituency it was found that the Australian made drill was not so effective as was an imported drill?

Why should we punish the mining in that dustry when by doing, so we can do no an good for the .local manufacturers of mardrills? I have here the statement made a circular sent to honourable members a by Mr Thomas, mining engineer of Western Australia, and a man of large experience in mining. He estimates the total annual consumption of drills in the Commonwealth at between 400 and 500, and gives the running age of a drill at about five years. He puts the cost of these drills at about £ 5 0 each, which is considerably higher than we are told is the present cost of the machines. As it has been opened up, I suppose the discussion on this item will be concluded; but I . think the Committee should favourably consider the proposal of the honourable member for Newcastle to omit boring machinery from this item. I appeal to the Committee to let the mining industry have a few of the implements required to carry it on admitted at a reasonable rate of duty. I appeal to honourable members also to be guided by the views of men who have to handle these drills, which are likelv to be more reliable than the opinions expressed in advertisements published by firms who have drills for sale.",68
603,Mr COON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Batman) [9.34] - I have listened with attention to the previous speakers on this item. We have in connection with this item again to consider the questions of monopoly and protection. Before Victorian manufacturers of these drills entered into competition for the trade, the price of drills was £ 8 0 apiece. I wish the Committee to bear that in mind. Since we have had local competition for 'these machinles, the price has come down, and I am given to understand that they can now be purchased for about £ 3 0 each. The honourable member for Darling spoke of the annual cost of repairs, as amounting in the case of the imported to 12s. 6d., as against -£4 ios. for the locally-manufactured machine. In answer to that, let me inform honourable members that the deepest shaft in Australia was sunk 252 feet with a locallymade drill, at a cost for repairs of only is. per foot.^ The honourable member also informed the Committee that straps were used in connection with the locally-made drill. I know of no straps being used in connection with, them, and I have worked both imported and' locally-made drills.",69
604,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Where did the honourable member work them ?,69
605,Mr COON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"In a shaft 1,000' feet deep.",69
606,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Where ?,69
607,Mr COON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"At Maldon. Perhaps the honourable member would like to know the time, as well as the place? I am prepared to have an imported drill worked alongside a Taylor-Horsfield National drill, and if the latter will not bore""5 feet more quickly, and use less air in doing so, I shall be prepared to admit the imported drills free. I wish to say that Victorian manufacturers should be credited with bringing this machine up-to-date. When these drills were first imported it took three men to cart them around. The pistons of the imported drills were so brittle that if one broke it could not be repaired, and had to be replaced at a cost of £ j ios. Australian manufacturers have succeeded in manufacturing a piston that can be repaired. In the next place, the chuck attached to the piston of the imported drills was of so brittle a character that in working pieces of metalbecame detached and workmen were injured in this way. The Australian manufacturers' have; improved the machine in that direction also. But what do wefind today ? We find the company which has been referred to adopting the Australian chuck, and putting it on to their machines.",69
608,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Whic h company?,69
609,Mr COON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"The Ingersoll-Sargent Company. Australian manufacturers have made improvements upon the machine, and brought the price down from _£8o to £ 3 0 , under the operation of a protective duty of 25 per cent., which was in force in Victoria prior to Federation. Now we are being asked to allow the imported d r ill to come in practically free. The honourable member for Coolgardie referred to Western Australia, and let me say that the deepest mine in that State is only 2,500 feet deep, whilst .'the deepest mine in Bendigo is 4,000 feet deep.",69
610,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Wba t has the depth of. the mine to do with it ? .,69
611,Mr COON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Honourable members would have us believe that a drill which is worked at a depth of 4,000 feet is not good enough for working a mine 2,500 feet deep.",69
612,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Is the stone harder at the greater depth?,69
613,Mr COON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Certainl y it is, and the difficulty of working is greater. I ask honourable members why the miners at Long Tunnel prefer the local to the imported drill, where they might use either? In carrying out a contract at Walhalla at the present time the miners prefer to use the local drill, ancl yet we are told that the Trust at the back of the imported drill should be allowed to flood Australia with their machines. Under the protective Tariff of Victoria, the wages in one foundry alone totalled £10,000 a year; but since Federation, only £6,000 a year has been paid in wages. Would the mining industry have benefited in the way it has done in this connection, but for the protective Tariff of Victoria? 1 say it would not. It was the operation of that Tariff that brought down the price of the drill, and now we are being asked to place this machine on the free list that the importers may secure a monopoly, and put up the price again. These drills are being made in many parts of Victoria, and I believe also in South Australia. There is plenty of local competition, and, to secure orders, the local manufacturers of drills are obliged to sell them practically at cost price. I venture to say that no member of the Committee can tell me the exact price no*w being paid for the imported article. The importers try to secure a monopoly by saying, "" We will let you have our machine at a certain price if you agree to use no other in connection with your mine.""",69
614,Mr HEDGES,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,The honourable member is trying to get a monopoly for the Victorian manufacturers.,70
615,Mr COON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I am not. This is not a Victorian question; it is a Western Australian question. Honourable members have not been able to show that the locallymade drills cannot do the work required of them. A test took place three, years ago in Western Australia, and the TaylorHorsfield National machine beat the imported machine out of sight. The men wlio have to use these drills are the best judges of their value, and I have shown that they prefer to use the locally-made drills. That is being proved at Broken Hill at the present time, where men on contract are using Australian in preference to imported drills. In Australia today, over 131 mines are using locally-made drills.",70
616,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Then what is the honourable member grumbling about?,70
617,Mr COON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I am grumbling because some ihonorable members wish that imported machines should be admitted free, when they can be made in Australia. I ask honourable members who are in favour of a protective Tariff which will give employment to labour, to impose such a duty on these machines as will encourage the use of the locally-made article. I have not the slightest doubt that if we can place the locally-made machines in mines throughout Australia, they will be found to do the work as well in the future as they are shown to have done it in the past. The only reasons urged against the proposed duty have been from the importers' stand-point, and I venture to say that behind the move being made to-night, there is the importer if he could be seen.",70
618,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,That is not fair.,70
619,Mr COON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Onl y importers' reasons have been assigned for the opposition to the duty.,70

622,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Can the honourable member prove that the importer is behind the opposition to this duty?,70
623,Mr COON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Le t me tell the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that locally-made f r ill s were sent to Western Australia this year and last year also by the firm to which I have referred.,70
624,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Where did they go to?,70
625,Mr COON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I do not know to what mines they were sent. I did not travel after them. It is sufficient for me to say that they were-sent to Western Australia, where we have been told that none of the locally-made drills are at work at the present time.",70
626,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"That is rather a bad advertisement for them, because they have evidently been "" scrapped.""",70
627,Mr COON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"They were sent to Western Australia, where they beat the imported machine in a test at Kalgoorlie. If honourable members vote against the duty, the result will be that imported rockborers will be dumped in Australia and the local factories will be closed up.",70
628,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Why was not that the case before ? These drills were free under the last Tariff.,70
629,Mr ATKINSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"If the whole Australian market was secured, to how many more men would .employment be given ?",70
630,Mr COON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Fiv e hundred. Under the Victorian Tariff, one. foundry alone was paying £10,000 a year in wages, but since the duty was taken off, it is only paying .£6,000 a year. I have clearly shown that this machine is capable of doing the work, and that one foundry alone has turned out 3,000 of them. On a test it showed itself equal in every way to the imported machine. ' Its manufacture has been the means of reducing the price. The honourable member for Flinders the other night said that he was prepared to vote for the proposals of the Government on a certain item, because they were framed in relation to the Excise duties. I trust that honourable members who are in favour of protection, or who take the view held by the honourable member for Flinders, will vote on this item to keep out the imported article, and to give employment to men who are now out of work. There has not been a single reason advanced why rock drills should be struck out, and I trust the Committee will vote for the highest protection it is possible to get.",70
631,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Robertson) [9.48] - The honourable member for Batman made a very fine speech in favour of the Australian-made rock drill, and satisfied me that its manufacturers are doing a roaring business. He states that 500 or 600 drills are in use in Victoria, attach a good deal of weight to what was' said by the Chairman of the Tariff Commission. Although he quoted from a trade circular, it is not fair to say that what he quoted was not correct. The drills to which the' honourable member for Bendigo referred are to be found in some of the principal mines in Western Australia - I was upon the fields some months ago, and saw the Bayley's Reward claim.. There was no reason to suppose from its appearance that the best of everything had not been put into it. It was closed down because they could not get gold, and not because the drill did not do its work. It is no part of my business here to run down a colonial production. I believe that the Australian drill is a good one, but, so far as I can gather from the evidence quoted by the honourable member for Darling, the imported drill will do the work quicker and better. Still that does not mean that the local drill will not do its work. The honourable member for Bendigo quoted an extract which showed that there had been some competition between the two drills, and that the colonial article was a first class one. Still, the imported drill is so better that the makers can afford to keep its price above that of the colonial article. The honourable member for Batman stated that its owners will only allow people to buy the imported machines if a guarantee is given that they will not use the colonial article. But only a man who is sure of his ground will make such a stipulation. If his machine were inferior, he would be told, "" I do not want your machine, andi would not have it on those terms.""",71
632,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,He sells it at a; lower price to get the monopoly.,71
633,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I thought the honourable member pointed out that the imported machine costs £ 7 more than doesthe local drill. That is not a very large difference, especially to rich mines. Apparently the differencebetween the two machines is small, or the difference in price would be greater. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has stated over and over again that, as a protectionist, he would not agree to placing on the free list any article which can be produced here of good quality. But where is the honourable member on this item? Let him.vote with the protectionists. All through the Tariff, a large amount of protection has been giver* for articles of excellent manufacture that will do their work. If that is to'be the policy the protectionist ought to stand by the colonial article. While I am in favour of free competition in manufactures, and would open our ports to allow the best articles to come in, so as to keep the local maker up to the highest pitch of efficiency, I would not say that the imported article should be taken in preference to the colonial. All things being equal, I should give the choice to the colonial article. I bave come to the conclusion that in this case the colonial rock drill is not quite so good as is the imported machine, and, if that is so, we should allow the latter to. come in. But the local manufacturers have nothing to fear, because everybody in Victoria uses their machine. The honourable member for Bendigo has pointed out that at immense depths it is better thar* any other. My desire is to have the local article made as good as is the American) or English production. That' will never be brought about unless the imported machine is allowed free entry to our marketsThe local machine also has the advantage of the local prejudice in its favour; otherwise, it would not be so largely used. much Although it is proved that it is not quite EO good, its makers can thrive in spite of the competition of the imported article. A. low duty would therefore satisfy all requirements.",71
634,Mr KNOX,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Kooyong) [9.55] - I favour the suggestion of the honourable member for. Newcastle, for the addition of a separate item in this case with a lower rate of duty. - But I cannot agree with those who suggest that the item should be practically free. It is ridiculous to supDose that we are not .able, with our large mining interests, to imake rock drills in Australia, and it is idle to suggest that the manufacturers .should be given no assistance through the Tariff in order to enable them to compete with the machines that come from America, Great Britain, and Germany. But, on the other hand, to put a high duty upon the Ingersoll Sargent and the Rand drills ; would be doing an injustice tp the mining community. None of these mines are in any sense philanthropic bodies, nor do I imagine that the question enters very much into the consideration of the directors or mining managers as to whether a drill is made in Bendigo or America, but the managers-man y of whom, like Mr Richard Hamilton and others who Iiave been mentioned, are at the very top of their profession-hav e unquestionably a strong desire to secure a machine which will do the work effectively and - cheaply, and in such a way as will allow the miner to show the most satisfactory results. I do not wish to prejudice, by any remark of mine, the drill which is made in Australia, but the bulk of testimony from the managers of large mines throughout the Commonwealth will show that the mining industry has good reason for urging that a prohibitive shall not be put upon an article which has proved itself to be so serviceable. That is due to the fact that the makers of three great drills haye joined together, and, as Edison does in America, have their agents all over the world to ascertain what improvements or changes are being made, and secure them. Consequently there is no possibility of an Australian manufacturer ever being in such a completely satisfactory position as to have at his command all the latest ideas --and practical improvements in the way the great combinations have. I shall, there-fore, favour a lower duty than the one proposed by the Government. Some assistance and help should unquestionably be given to the manufacturers, not only in Victoria, but in all the other States. But I do not approve of a duty which would prevent drills of a higher class being introduced for use in the mines here. This drill is being used in some of the mines in Broken Hill and Tasmania, and has found its way to the West; and it would be unjust to our local manufacturers to say that their manufacture does not deserve consideration, seeing that it has been adopted by most capable and able managers. I shall support the suggestion to have this appliance put into a separate line, but I shall ask the Committee to impose a higher duty than that proposed by the honourable member. I think a fair compromise would be to have a duty of 20 per cent, in both columns.",71
635,Mr ATKINSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,That would shut down some mines.,72
636,Mr KNOX,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,There is too much made of that argument; no mine worth working will be shut down by the imposition of such a duty as I suggest. There is no question that these rock drills ought to be made in Australia.,72
637,Mr ATKINSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"So they are, but they are not good enough.",72
638,Mr KNOX,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"We are justified in giving local manufacturers some assistance. They have struggled under the old Tariff, and I have previously protested that we were doing them an injustice. I hope the Government will accept the compromise I have, suggested, and in the case of rock drills impose a higher duty than that attaching to the other machinery and appliances in the item.",72
639,Mr ATKINSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Wilmot) [10.5] - I intend to support the proposal of the honourable member for Newcastle. Australianduty made rock drills are sold in the local market at a. cheaper rate than are the imported drills, and, that being so, I do not see why any more protection is required. The Australian consumption of rock drills is about 5 per cent, of the world's consumption, and, if the idea of imposing a duty is to compel the foreign manufacturer to establish works here, I do not think it will have the desired effect. To make it worthwhile for a foreign maker to put down the necessary expensive plant in Australia, there would have to be an output of 2,500 drills annually, whereas the Australian consumption is about 400 or 500. These facts appeal to me as a business man, and, in mv opinion, the duties will be excessive if they exceed 10 per cent, and 5 per cent. The Hollmann drill is composed of very fine material, which is not available in Australia ; and which, in case of the manufacture being carried on here, would have to be imported, thus adding to the cost qf production. Nearly every part of this drill is protected by patent rights; and therefore I do not see how any good can arise from an increased duty, unless the makers are compelled to put down a plant in Australia. The great desideratum in mining is cheapness in working; and, notwithstanding what so great an authority as the honourable member for Kooyong has said, there are many propositions in Australia which would employ thousands of men if , by means of scientific improvement, they could gain a little advantage in this connection. In Western Australia there aremany old mining propositions which, with a little cheaper working ensured, would become - good going concerns. I down, or a proposition is prevented from maturing, more men will be thrown out of employment than could find work were the whole of the market for this' appliance confined to Australian manufactures.",72
640,Mr CHANTER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Does_ the honourable member think that a small duty like that proposed would cause any mine to shut down ?,73
641,Mr ATKINSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Such a duty would not affect thoroughly established mines, but there are many other ventures which' are only waiting for improved and cheaper means of working in order to employ thousands, who would be consumers of the products of those engaged in other industries.

If these could be worked with the aid of up-to-date machinery, they would employ thousands of miners. It is all very well for the honourable member for Kooyong to urge that the difference between the rates of duty proposed will not affect the working of the mines. His contention is perfectly' accurate so far as mines like those of Mount Morgan, Mount Lyell, and Broken Hill are concerned. But there are many smaller propositions which would be severely handicapped if we imposed a duty of 30 per cent, upon rock-drills. I have never attempted to decry our local manufactures, and I do not say that the drills made in the Commonwealth are not excellent for some purposes. Roughly speaking, the price of the imported article is about £ 4 4 , so that a duty of 30 per cent, would be equivalent to about £ 1 4 - That is the increased amount which the users of these machines will be called upon to pay under the Government proposal. The locally manufactured drill is being sold today for less than is the imported article. It is the acme of absurdity for honourable members to declare that men will purchase the imported in preference to the Australian article as the result of mere prejudice.",73
655,Mr MATHEWS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,The price of the imported machine is about £ 2 7 .,74
656,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I have been informed by a reliable authority that it is .£44. But, assuming that it is £ 2 7 , an ad valorem rate of .30 per cent, would very nearly enhance its cost by one-third. The honourable member for Batman has argued at considerable length that the local drill is superior to the imported article. If that be so, surely there is no justification for the imposition of a duty of 30 per cent.",74

661,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"But English firms have already secured half of the trade, and they ask for no preference as against the trust. The honourable member for Batman mentioned the fact that a shaft had been sunk at Bendigo by means of drills of Australian manufacture at a cost for repairs of only is. per foot. I may inform him that at the Princess Royal Mine, Norseman, a shaft was sunk several hundred feet at a cost for repairs' of only 7d. per foot. These figures, however, convey nothing, because so much depends upon the character of the ground. I hope that the Committee will vote in favour of the lower duly.",74
662,Mr WYNNE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Balaclava) [10.27] - I am sorry that honourable members should have spoken disparagingly of the locally manufactured drill. I have had considerable experience of these drilling machines in connection with the Long Tunnel Company, at Walhalla. There we sank a shaft 2,800 feet in twenty months. The men employed, who were first-class shaft sinkers, sunk as much as 160 feet per month, which, I think, constitutes a world's record. They started by using Taylor-Horsfield drills. They were allowed to use whatever machines they chose. After they had been working some time, acting on the advice of our mining engineer, we substituted American drills. But the men speedily reverted to the Australian machines. The fact that they sank 160 feet per month through granitic rock is convincing testimony of the value of these machines.",74
663,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Why do people pay more for the imported article?,74
664,Mr WYNNE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"We advertised all over Australia for expert shaft sinkers, and we agreed to pay them a bonus for every foot that they sank in excess of 100 feet per - month. We were only too pleased to do so. When the locally manufactured drill can accomplish the work that I have outlined, no complaint can be urged against it.",74
665,Mr HEDGES,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Fxemantle) [10.29] - I do not think it is a question of which is the better drill-the imported or the locally manufactured article-so much as it is one of allowing those who are managing our mines to say what tool they shall use.,74
666,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,That is free-trade.,74
667,Mr HEDGES,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"It is not. We can only' judge of the relative merits of these machines by instituting very severe tests over long periods. That a test' has been made at some sports counts for nothing. The men who are managing the biggest mines in Australia, and in whom the shareholders and directors of the largest mining companies have confidence, men who have been dealing in machinery of this kind year after year, are most competent to judge of its merits. I do not say that drills should be admitted free of duty. It is a question of tools of trade again. Rock-drills are the tools of trade of shaft- too. sinkers and miners. Men very often take contracts to do work of this kind finding their own explosives and machinery. If the Australian drill is so much better than the imported drill, why has it not posses' sion of the market, seeing that it costs £27 as against £ 3 4 ?",74
668,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"It has possession of the market in Victoria, where it receives fair play.",75
669,Mr HEDGES,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Victori a is not all Australia. The States are now federated; but if this talk of Victoria being all tralia continues, it will affect their good feeling to each other. Australia is a very big country, and cannot be governed wholly in accordance with the views of the people of Melbourne or of Bendigo. Men whose employers consider them worth salaries of £3,000 or £4,000 a year to manage mines should be the most capable judges of what is the best machinery to use in those mines. The talk we have heard about American trusts has no weight with me, because some of the best drills that come to this country are British.. The honourable member for Batman proved more than he intended to prove. Statistics show that Australia requires 500 new rock drills annually, so that if Victoria had the whole business of manufacturing drills, the work would not give employment to 500 persons as stated by the honourable member for Batman; that, would be only one drill per man per annum. The honourable member for Darling bears me out in the contention that it is necessary that the big mining companies, such as the Great Cobar Company, should have up-to-date machinery, and should be allowed to say what machinery is best for their purposes. A drill which might suit one kind of rock might not suit another. We have listened to a great many so called experts to-night; but I claim to have some knowledge of this subject, because I have driven underground, through haid rock-blueston e and granite-for a length of half a mile at a time, and I know that a drill which will do good work in one shaft or tunnel may not do good work in another. Any one who knows anything about rock drilling will support that statement. Indeed, men who have been accustomed to deal with one particular kind of rock, if taken to another place where the rock is different, and given the drill to which they are used, will often, prove practically useless, and their drills, The honourable member for Bendigo says that the drills which he mentioned have been used at the Queensland Menziesmine, at Bayley's mine, and at one or two others, all of which are now closed.",75
670,Mr THOMAS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Was the closing of those only mines the result of using the particular drills referred to?,75
671,Mr HEDGES,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I cannot say. Honourable members must draw their own conclusions. No doubt the drills have beeni used in mines which are still at work, and are doing well; but the fact that they have Aus- been used in mines which are now closed, does not show them to be any better than other drills. Had they proved so good as to be able to keep the mines going, there would have been something to say for them. Honourable members have a great deal to say of that small portion of Australia called Victoria, and of the little bit of mining which goes on here. But they forget that nowadays Western Australia produces more gold per annum than all the other States put together.",75
672,Mr MATHEWS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Victori a has been im that position.,75
673,Mr HEDGES,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I am not now dealing with "" has-beens."" Seeing that Western Australia now produces more gold than all the other States of the Commonwealth put together, she should be allowed a voice in choosing what tools shall be used in her mines."" If Victoria, considering the small amount of gold she produces, were allowed to dictate to Western Australia in this matter, it would be a case of the tail wagging the dog. The tail should wait until the dog wags it, and Western Australia is - certainly the dog so far as mining goes. I do not ask that rock drills be treated differently from other tools of trade, or that they be admitted free to the detriment of local manufacturers. But the proposed rates of duty are unreasonablyhigh. I am willing to vote for a duty of 15 per cent. ' Mr THOMAS. (Barrier) [10.41] - I should like to know what rates the Government really propose to agree to in connection with this item?",75
674,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I do not ask for more than 25 and 20 per cent., the rates which have been fixed for other similar items.",75
675,Mr THOMAS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I think that those rates are too high.,75
676,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,There must be uniformity.,76
677,Mr THOMAS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Or e dressing machinery and appliances for smelting, leaching, and metal refining are of as much importance to the mining industry asare rock drills, and if the Minister was prepared to make all this machinery dutiable at zo and 15 per cent., I would support' ithe proposal; but if the Treasurer insists - on duties of 25 and 20 per cent., I shall not hesitate to attempt to have rock drills made free, or dutiable at a mucli lower rate",76
678,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,All other tools of <rade are dutiable at 15 per cent.,76
679,Mr THOMAS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"That would be a fairer rate. No doubt, rock drills can be made miner, in Australia. Whether they are as good as imported drills is for those concerned to say; but I do not think that they can also keeps stores going. he as good, because I have not heard of them being exported, and when manufacrally springs up. turers are making a better article than is being turned out by others in the same' line, they can always sell it, either in sometimes. - or out of Australia. Take, for instance, harvesters. I understand that a large number of these machines are exported Argentine. That, to my mind, shows very conclusively that when the Australian harmining industry. vester comes into competition with harvesters of the world in other markets, it is able to hold itsown. The round same thing would apply to the rock drills. If , as the honourable member for Balaclava has stated, the Australian rock drills are better than the imported ticle, I cannot understand why there is not 12^ per cent. a foreign market as well as a home market for them. I am prepared to give sonable duty to the makers of rock drills to see if they cannot in time compete with the that imported ""articles. At the same time, I pose only think that duties of 30 and 25 per cent, are too high.",76
680,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Le t us impose duties we have been well pleased. of 25 and 20 per cent.,76

Originally the asked for duties of 30 and 25 per cent, only on rock drills, but also on the other articles included in this item. a. majority at his back, and it may be if he attempts to carry his new proposal levy duties of 25 and 20 per cent, on these articles he will win. But. we be able to carry an amendment against so far as rock drills are concerned. that event I would vote for rock drills be made free, but I would prefer that all the articles in the item should be dutiable at 20 and 15 per cent, respectively, because there are other things which are as helpful to the mining industry as are rock drills. I realise that it is one of the greatest industries in Australia. If honourable members cripple the mining and pastoral industries, what will be left? Those great industries certainly maintain the other' industries. Anything which honourable members can do to help the mining industry will be to the advantage of Australia generally, because, I venture to say, that there is no industry which finds such diversified employment for people as it does. Not only does a mine find work for the but it also finds work for an engineer and a carpenter on. the spot, besides providing employment for engineers, carpenters and other artisans elsewhere. It With two or three mines in a locality, a township, gene",76

685,Mr ATKINSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Unde r the old Tariff a rearock drills came in free. Mr TILLE Y BROWN - If they did strengthens the argument I proto use. I am connected with two small mines. We purchased seven or eight Taylor-Horsfield rock drills, with which Evidently these rock drills have established a market. I Some conflicting statements have been Minister made. The honourable member for Bennot digo has quoted some testimonials which were given before the mines in which the He has rock drills were used were shut down: that but the honourable member' for Balaclava to has quoted a very good testimonial, and all it is confirmed by my own experience, bemay cause in the small mines I have alluded him' to we have done some wonderful driving In work. If the locally-made rock drill has to been able to hold its own, as it has done, an import duty of 30 per cent, is excessive. Under the old Tariff the original duty on nearly all mining requirements was 12 J per cent. But under this Tariff, in almost every instance, the Government have proposed duties of 25 and 30 per cent., and it has only been after a very heavy struggle that we have been able to secure some reduction in the rates. It has been truly said by honourable members that the mining industry is a great one - In my electorate it has kept two or three townships going. Surely it is only fair to assume that the increased duties are likely to do considerable injury. The honourable member for Bendigo did not tell everything in connection with locally-made rock drill. I am informed that about three years ago a trial took place between the imported Hollmann machine .and the locally-made machine, that the whole of the mining managers of Bendigo gave the palm to the former; and that it is being used by the bulk of the mines in Bendiso.",76
686,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Is that not disloyal to their own State?,77
687,Mr TILLEYBROWN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I cannot help that. I am dealing with a proposal of the Treasurer which, if carried, will_ involve a huge additional expenditure in connection with the mining industry. The other night the honourable member for Kooyong - stated that the increased duties on mining machinery meant an immediate additional cost of nearly £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 to the mines throughout the Commonwealth. I also have been informed on reliable authority that the increased duties wiil cause a very considerable increase in the expenditure' on those mines. For instance,_ a duty of 30 per cent, on 500 rock 'drills would realise about £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 . What is the use of building up an industry and then crushing it out of existence? I know that in this very city the interests in connection with mining companies are so great that they have almost created a slight financial paralysis. If we keep on increasing the duties on item after item, what will be the result? It is all very well for some honourable members to say that the Government are proposing an increase of only or 10 or 15 per cent., as compared with the duty under the old Tariff. But if we impose an increased duty on every one of nearly 600 items, we shall impose upon the people a burden which they cannot afford, to bear. I recognise that we must have increased duties. But suppose, for the Sake of argument, that the ^duty on a mining requirement was 1 2 per cent, under the old Tariff. 1 Surely an increase to 20 per cent, is fair, and an increase to 30 per cent, unfair. When a locally-made piece of machinery can be sold at 25 per cent, less than the cost of the imported article, honourable members should hesitate before they impose an excessive duty. I recognise that it is no use trying to get the duty down to what I consider would be a fair rate. As the industry for which the duty is proposed is a going concern, there is no need for it to be propped up and buttressed. Surely a going concern the does not require more than a reasonable duty. In this instance the old story of protection cheapening the article is not a factor in determining the issue. The Government Whip sits at the table. while this debate is going on, and takes more responsibility on his shoulders than do Ministers themselves. When an honourable 'member is endeavouring to speak intellivery gently to the subject, nothing but talk goes on between that honourable member, who ought to be sitting on one of the back benches, and the Minister. He interjects frequently in an impertinent manner, and is .constantly in evidence when he should be behind the scenes. Every honourable - member has a right to express his opinion, and it is not my fault that I have to speak at five minutes to 11 o'clock'. SirW ILLIAMLYNE - I do not think that it is anybody else's fault.",77

When they have"" had to give up the use of the locally-made machines and to adopt the imported article, I say that this Committee ought to hesitate before it consents to add duty upon duty against an industry which, in many instances, I can say to my own personal knowledge, cannot afford to bear these increased burdens. I trust that the Treasurer will review the position, and will adopt the conclusion of the honourable member for Barrier, who has urged that duties of .15 per cent, and 20 per cent, should be adopted.

I cannot see why, if a duty of 15 per cent, is sufficient in the case of other machine tools, the same duty should not be adopted as applying to the machine tools of the mining industry. We shall not be acting consistently hy doing so. It will not be defensible to vote lesser duties in the case of industries of minor importance than we vote on account of this immense industry.

Listening to his remarks, one might think that the whole mining industry would be killed if we did not allow rock drills to come in free; but I have more faith in the mining industry than to think that.

But the honourable member for Angas has beeri ing, and so we transferred the pair of honourable member for Corio to the leader of the Opposition, just as during the week, when the honourable member Parkes had paired with the honourable member for Macquarie, he voted on every occasion, his pair having been transferred by the Opposition Whip.",83

I was paired He with the honourable member for Corio until last Tuesday. Being detained by imporbusiness I did not arrive at the House until Wednesday, and, in case the honourable member might have an idea that he was still paired, he not having returned, I asked the Government Whip whether he say expected me to continue the pair on the pairs Wednesday. The Government Whip said that is "" No,"" and, of course, I voted.",83

The leader of the Opposition towards the end of last week asked whether I - would pair with him as he was going to Sydney, and I said I had no objection. I consulted the Government Whip, who said that the pair was quite satisfactory. I have no desire to find fault with regard to the length of the pair, but I had no that it was for beyond the Tuesday; I think I said so at the time to both althe Government Whip and the Opposition Whip. I do not desire to raise any question about that, however, because I know these loosely-made agreements very freI made know that pairs are constantly being changed in the way that has been described.

Government Whip also said that it might be necessary to change the pairs, to which arrangement I replied that I had no objection. Amendment (by Mr STORRER)-to leave out the figures ""25""-agree d to. Mr THOMAS BROWN [11.48] - I do not desire to address the Committee at any length upon this question. I had intended to do so earlier in the evening, but the debate turned upon one matter, in which I was not specially interested. In the proposal which is now under consideration, however, the whole of our mining interests are involved. honourable members will turn to the Budget statement, and to the papers connected with it which were laid upon the table of the House by the Treasurer, they will find that from 1902 to 1906 inclusive, the mining industry exported wealth to the amount of £104,225,000. As against that, the export of machinery, implements, and manufactures of metals was valued at only £ 4 6 9 , 0 0 0 . In this connection it must be remembered that the product of the mining industry has to find its market in the outside world. withstanding this, there are large numbers of persons engaged in the industry who are not working rich mineral fields, but fields upon which the margin between profit and loss is a very narrow one. Yet it is now proposed to increase the taxation upon mining machinery from 12J per cent, to 25 per cent, uncler the general Tariff and to 20 per cent, under the. Tariff for the United Kingdom. I would further remind honourable members thai this industry employs about 112,006 labourers, as compared with seme 16,000 who are employed in the whole of the machine and metal manufacturing industries of the Commonwealth. I desire to call the attention of honourable members to the different treatment which is accorded to the mining industry by other protectionist countries. I find that<in item 222 of the New Zealand Tariff it is specified that steam engines and parts thereof, including the boiler or boilers there for, imported speciallv for mining or gold saving purposes and processes or for dairying purposes, are dutiable at 5 per cent. Again, in item 439 I find that machinery for gold-saving purposes and processes has been placed upon the free list. That is the treatment which the industry receives in a country which believes in a protective policy, but which'does not believe in penalThe izing its large primary industries. A similar remark is applicable to the Dominion of Canada.",83
783,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Does the honourable member think that it is wise at this hour of the night to speak at such length, especially as the general question has already (Calare) been settled?",84
784,Mr THOMASBROWN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I refrained from speaking earlier in the debate in the hope that a reasonable duty would be agreed to. But instead of securing a duty of 20 per cent - whic h I was prepared to accept-the Committee have imposed a duty of 25 per cent, upon mining machinery If under the general Tariff. Consequently I have no alternative but to fight for the insertion of a reasonable rate in the preference column. In Canada all the important machinery used for mining purposes is upon a list of special exemptions. The case of the Wilberforce Gold Dredging Company has already been cited. There is also the case of the Cobar Company, which recently ordered machinery to cost about £ 7 1 , 0 0 0, of which about £ 4 7 , 0 0 0 worth was to come from England and about £ 2 3 , 0 0 0 worth from America. Under the old Tariff the duty-12 per cent. 1 Not- - woul d have - been about £ 8 , 8 0 0 , but if 25 per cent., and the preferential duty of 20 per cent., is charged it-will be increased by ,£17,000, and will come to £ 2 5 , 9 8 7 . About £ 9 , 0 0 0 or £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 worth of machinery included in the order was previously on the free list, but is now dutiable at 25 per cent. That is an instance of the way in which one of our great primary industries, which has been, a source of enormous wealth to the country, is being burdened, so that it will become more difficult for those connected with it to obtain decent wages. I move That the amendment be amended by inserting the figures "" 15 "" in the blank created by leaving out the figures "" 25-""",84
785,Mr MATHEWS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Melbourne Ports) [11.57] - The honourable member for Calare has referred to the Great Cobar mine; but those connected with that mine, as is well known, will purchase nothing in Australia.",84
786,Sir JOHN FORREST,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,It keeps a good many working men going.,84
787,Mr MATHEWS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Because it earns many thousands of pounds profit. It is controlled by a London company, which orders all its requirements from England and from America. I am credibly informed that a large part of its plant, consisting of blast furnaces, smelters, converters, and accessories, all of which could have been purchased in Australia for no more than was paid for it, was imported. The company, when it started, imported even its columns and girders, showing that it is capable of resorting to any device to avoid purchasing in Australia. It has already been determined in connection with similar items that the rates of duty shall be 25 and 20 per cent., and if the free-traders try to force a reduction to 15 per cent, in connection with importations from the United Kingdom, I hope that the protectionists will insist on an all-round duty of 25 per.cent.",84
788,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Franklin) [11.59]. - What was said in connection with the proposal to tax rock drills applies with a hundredfold more force to the proposal to tax ore-reducing appliances. It is lutely necessary to encourage the use of the test and latest ore-dressing and ore-reducing appliances, as they do in other countries, in order that our very low-grade ores may be worked to advantage. The Simmer and Jack Mine, by far the largest gold-producing mine in the world, which uses 600 head of stamps, is working on a 6-dwt. reef. But it can do so only by using the latest and most up-to-date appliances. Here in Australia we have many hundreds of low-grade propositions, and we can work them profitably only by using the most up-to--date appliances. The mining industry, instead of employing a few handfuls of men, as some of the manufacturing industries do, gives work to tens of thousands. We ought to try to give those who put their money into mines a fair chance to profit by their investments. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has had a great deal to say about the mining companies importing their requirements, but we are very glad to get money from abroad to work our mines. Apparently the honourable member would consider a man who put money into Australian mines as an enemy to the country, but what we need is the investment of more capital in mining. I am surprised that honourable members should wish to put a duty of 4s. in the £ 1 on the machinery that we most need in Australia to develop the mining industry. I shall vote for the lower duty.",85
789,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Darling) [12.2 a.m.] The.honourable member for Melbourne Ports has spoken of the Great Cobar mine as an English company which never buys anything in Australia. That mine, however, was for manv years an Australian property, and was developed by Australians. It is only about a year since the English company purchased it, so it is not correct to say that everything at the mine has been imported. Of course, much of the machinery is such as could not be made in Australia, because it is covered by patents. I do not hold a brief for the company, but I feel bound to correct a misstatement.",85
790,Mr KNOX,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Kooyong) [12.3 a.m.] - It is appalling to hear some of the statements made in this Committee. The Great Cobar mine invited tenders in Australia, England, and America for its requirements.",85
791,Mr STORRER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Bass) [12.4 a.m.] - I opposed the reduction of the duty to 15 per cent., but the proposed rate having been struck out, I accept the defeat as regards the higher duty, and am now prepared to absovote for a duty of 20 per cent. Although mining is a very important industry in my district, I do not propose to speak at length on this subject, because I always tear in mind the value of our time, and the need in the country's interest for getting through the Tariff as quickly as possible. Therefore I make my remarks as short as I can. Question-That the blank created in the amendment be filled by the figures "" J 5 "" (Mr THOMAS BROWN'S amendment)-put . The Committee divided.

800,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Hindmarsh) [12.14 a.m.] - I wish to say a few words in reply to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. The protectionist section of the Committee were generous enough to say that special machinery should goon the 15 per cent, list, but now honourable members opposite - som e of whom came here claiming to be protectionists-wan t us to put all lines on that list. The sooner we put an end to that sort of thing the better, I think. Rather than vote for a duty of 15 per cent., I shall vote for these articles to be free. . Either we ought to give protection, or we ought not to penalize the users of any machinery. A duty of 15 per cent, is not a - protective, but a revenue duty. Some of us who voted for a duty of 15 per cent, did so by way of concession in regard to special machinery. But we are now dealing with machinery that can easily be made within the Commonwealth I now admit that those of us who believe in protection made a mistake in the previous case in voting for 15 per cent., because it is evident that advantage is being taken of our generosity. I trust that the higher rate of duty will be agreed to. Personally, I should vote for duties of 35 and 30 per cent, if I had an opportunity.",86

The Tariff Commission arrived at certain conclusions in respect of this industry, one or two of which I propose to read. It is greatly to be regretted that a question of such magnitude- a question dealing with the advanced guard of scientific engineering, and exercising such a momentous influence upon our industrial system, has ro l»e dealt with at this early hour of the morning, and in such a thin Committee. Among our conclusions we found thatelectrical generators, motors, and fans, and other machinery and appliances have been made in Victoria and Queensland under 25 per cent, protective Tariffs, which were in operation at some period prior to Federation.

863,Sir JOHN QUICK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"The Commission were of opinion that only two or three classes of electrical machinery could reasonably be expected to be made in Australia under existing conditions. We thereat Brisfore recommended a duty of 25 per cent, on the machinery which I have named. The Government in its first proposals in regard to electrical machinery adopted our recommendation except as to rates, confining the higher duties to generators, motors up to the capacity of 500 horsepower, fans, and starting and regulating rheostats. But in the proposals now before the Committee they apply the duties to all electrical motive power and machinery, irrespective of horse-power. Motors of a capacity of over 500 horsepower, and other big electrical machinery, are not likely to be made in Australia for many years to come; and any duty imposed upon them will be merely revenue producing and oppressive to the industries that .have to use this machinery. But duties on small motors and generators may give a stimulus to local manufacturers. I am desirous of doing all I can to encourage the manufacture of electrical machinery in Australia; but I do not wish to go beyond what is fair and reasonable. Senator MCGregor, ex-Senator Higgs, Mr Francis Clarke, and myself talked this matter over and came to the conclusion that the highest is no duty that should be imposed on the machinery I have mentioned was 25 per cent., and that bigger machinery should be dutiable at 12J per cent. The proposals of the Government will do more harm than good, and will tend to make the Tariff objectionable. I do not wish to make enemies for the Tariff, my desire being to secure the greatest good for the greatest number, with the least amount of friction. Tn order to bring matters to an issue, and to restore the limitation originally recommended, I move That the amendment be amended by inserting after the word "" machines,"" in paragraph A, the "" up to the capacity of 500 horse-power."" I intend, if that is carried, to move to make machinery of larger horse-power dutiable at 12\ per cent, or whatever lower rate the Committee may decide upon. Mr. Sluyterman, electrical engineer, of Bendigo, when referred to as to the .possibility of the differentiation which I propose, wrote to me-hi s letter is an appendix to the report of the Commission on the subject-that electrical generators and motors can be made Australia up to almost any capacity, say 500 horse-power, provided the insulated conductors and insulating materials, such as covered wire, mica, insulating varnishes, prepared tapes papers, vulcanite fibre, rubber and all insulating compounds, also platenoid and manganin wires (for XXX rheostats) were kept on the free list.",91

Several interjections have been made which would imply that this class of machinery over 500 horse-power is used by only wealthy capitalists' in mining operations. But let me point out that it is used in connection in with electric-lighting plants and tramway systems in large cities. To impose duties of 25 per oent. and 20 per cent, on such and machinery, which cannot be made here, is simply to place a burden upon the great majority of the people who use electric tramways and electric light. I was expecting to hear a few words on this item from of those who pretend to stand up for the rights of New South Wales, and, see that no one has risen to speak, not even the Opposition side, I wish to bring before the Committee a letter which I have received from the Sydney Municipal Counon cil. The letter reads as follows :I am sorry Mr J. H . Catts, M.H.R., Federal Parliament, Melbourne. DEAR SIR, I have the honour, by direction of the Sydney Municipal Council, to invite your attention to ""the fact that by reason of the new Customs Tariff the Council is likely to be involved in a considerable outlay of money to cover the new duty on certain electric motors and other electric machinery and apparatus which are being imported from England for the Sydney Electric Light undertaking. This machinery and motors cannot be reasonably manufactured in the Commonwealth, otherwise purchases would be made accordingly, and the Council is, therefore, obliged to import. In these circumstances I am to represent to you, as one of the New South Wales members of the Federal Legislature, the great hardship under which the Council labours in this connection, and to request you to kindly use every, endeavour to have electric motors placed on the free list, . and the duties on electric machinery and apparatus largely reduced. Thanking you in anticipation, I have the honour to be, Dear Sir, Your obedient servant, F. H . NESBITT-, Town Clerk. As it is pointed out by the Council that the electrical machinery which they want confor the lighting of Sydney cannot be reasonably made in Australia, I presume that it is over 500 horse-power. If it cannot be made here, then duties of 25 per cent.. to and 20 per cent, should not be imposed. The honourable member for Hindmarsh, who is interrupting me, has 'spoken here time.

The duty should at least be made as low as possible. means a tax upon the working people of Sydney and suburbs, to whom the municipal council are endeavouring to supplycheap electric light in opposition to the Gas Company of Sydney- a huge monopoly which has been charging too high a price for a very long time. The Minister having, as I know, sympathy with the great working population of Sydney, will, I trust, see his way clear to assist the Council by allowing it to import its machinery at the lowest possible rate of duty. ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [1.36 a.m.] - The honourable member for Cook who has just sat down, the honourable member for Melbourne, and the honourable member for West Sydney, have interviewed me more than once in regard to the position of the cities of Melbourne and Sydney in reference to electric lighting machinery.

I have considered the matter in the light of the representations made to me, and am prepared to consent to a lower rate of duty than I was at first inclined to accept - I am prepared to accept a duty of 20 per cent, in each column. The honourable member for Bendigo has moved an amendment with the object of limiting the duty to 500 horse-power machinery. On machinery beyond that power I am prepared to take a lower duty than 20 per cent.

886,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Yes , if progress is made.",93
887,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Ver y reasonable pro- gress has been made at this sitting, in my opinion. We have agreed to itemsinvolving many thousands of pounds to the industrial community, and although they Sydney may' not have been many in number they were of greater importance than perhaps ten times as many other items in the schedule. It is regrettable that we have not many electrical experts to advise us. The best advice'that I have been able to obtain, leads me to say that we shall be perfectly safe in making the lower rate of duty operate on machinery over .500 horsepower. The largest dynamo that I can see catalogued as made in Australia is one of 200 horse-power. I think we shall adopt a very fair standard in accepting the suggestion of the honourable member for Bendigo. Our requirements in the way of electrical machinery are so limited that in all probability a dynamo of 500 horsepower will prove to be the maximum required. An increase of duty from 1 2 per1 cent, to 20 per cent, is as much protection as an industry that has reached the stage of development of the one we are considering can expect.from any Parliament. Recognising the impossibility of making a successful appeal to the Committee at this time.in the morning, when we ought to be in bed, I feel disposed to accept the suggestion of the Minister.",93

But whatof ever noise was being made while he was speaking, came from his own corner; and if honourable members representing South Wales have not hitherto spoken on this subject, it was simply because were anxious to assist the Government in getting through the Tariff as quickly as possible, by trying to come to an understanding with the Government to secure a substantial reduction of duty. I venture to say that, so far as this of the division is concerned, the Opposithe tion cannot be accused of having occupied the time of the Committee. The debate has been carried on either by Govery vernment supporters or their allies in Ministerial corner, and if the Treasurer has any cause of complaint, he has no complaint against the Opposition. ably Since both the honourable member for Cook ancl the honourable member for Barrier seem to think that the representatives New South Wales on the Opposition they benches should have made themselves heard more frequently, and at greater length than they have done, I propose, so far as I am concerned, to leave them no - ground for complaint. The honourable member for Cook read a circular letter from the municipal council ' of Sydney which was sent to all'the representatives of New South Wales.",94
889,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,The honourable member for Cook was the first to make any forcible representation in regard to it .,94
890,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Yes , simply because he first caught the Chairman's eye, although other members rose. I intend also to make some equally forcible observations regarding it. I should like to know whether the Minister of Trade and Customs received a copy of the circular letter from the municipal council of Sydney protesting against this duty, and pointing out the disabilities under which municipal bodies will labour if it be carried. Will the Minister agree to the reduction proposed by the honourable member for Bendigo?",94
891,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I understand that the Treasurer has said that he will comply with some of the requests made by honourable member for Cook and by honourable member for Melbourne, and he is prepared to agree to a reducretion of the duties to 20 per cent.",94
892,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Wit h a proposal that on a duty of 12^ per cent, be imposed in He some of the other cases?",94
893,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"No ; to duties 20 per cent, and of 15 per cent., and 10 per cent, in respect of another item.",94
894,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,Is the Minister going New to accept that proposal ?,94
895,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Yes , if honorthev able members are agreeable. Mr JOHN.SON - I should like the Treasurer, who is in charge of the Tariff, to inform us what he proposes to do, because the Minister of Trade and Customs pan has no responsibility in this matter. In letter from the Town Clerk of Sydney undulv it is pointed out thatThe Council is likely. to be involved in a considerable outlay of money to cover the new duty on certain electric motors and other the electric machinery and apparatus which are being imported from England for the - Svdney certainlv electric light undertaking. This machinery nnd motors cannot be reasonmanufactured in the Commonwealth, otherwise purchases would be made accordingly, and the Council is, therefore, obliged lo import. of The municipal councils, representing as, do the most democratic bodies within the limits of their jurisdiction, would be glad to purchase locally made electrical machinery and appliances, but since they are not made here they must have recourse to imported articles to supply their wants.",94
896,Mr WEBSTER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,The Treasurer has already agreed to the amendment.,95
897,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,We have not heard the Treasurer say so.,95
898,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I am quite prepared to accept it now.,95
899,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Where is the Treasurer? I should like to address my remarks to hira, as he is in charge of the Tariff. In the honourable gentleman's absence, and knowing the sharp tactics with which we have had to deal in connection with Tariff matters, I am compelled to put before the Committee my arguments in support of the proposal made by the honourable member for Bendigo.",95
900,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"A proposal which the Government have already agreed to. If that honourable member will let the Chairman put the question, we are prepared to allow it to go at once.",95
901,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I remind the Minister of Trade and Customs that the responsible Minister in charge of the Tariff is not here, and has not definitely told the Committee what reductions he is willing to agree to respecting several of the articles included in the item, and that honourable members on-this side representing New,South Wales have been upbraided for not having put their views on this subject before the Committee. I have promised to remove all cause of complaint on that score, and I intend, to do so. I find, on referring to the Customs returns for 1906, that from the United Kingdom we imported this class of material to \he value of £117,852, equal to 55.57 per cent, of the total imports. Our imports from Germany amounted in value to £21,181 equal to 10.32 per cent. From Sweden, ,£12,966; from the United States, £52,426, equal to 24.72 per cent.; and from all other countries, .£6,845 worth of these materials. The total value of these importations amounted to £212,570. Turning to the evidence taken by the Tariff Commission in connection with these matters, we find that it clearly proves that no duty we could impose would enable the majority of these articles to be manufactured locally, unless the manufacture were preceded by a, very large increase in consumption, and also that the few articles that could be made here could only be produced at an excessive cost. At page 2240 of the Tariff Commission report, it will be found that Mr Crocker, of the Kalgoorlie Electric Power and Lighting. Company, gave this evidencePractically none of the machinery and appliances used for pioducing and dealing with electricity are made in Australia. That is the sworn evidence of an expert in this particular business. Mr Crocker said in his"" evidence that Weymouth and Company, of Melbourne, did a little manufacturing, but added, "" We endeavoured to use one of their motors, but we did not find it working satisfactorily. Moreover, the price was £ 6 7 9s. 3d., while the invoice price of . similar imported articles was£17 ios. iod."" Evidently, therefore, there was a desire to give a preference to the local article, but the deal was found most unsatisfactory, and there was a great discrepancy between the two prices. The figures are so important that I should like to have a quorum present before proceeding. [Quorum formed.] So great a difference in price must have weight with municipal councils and similar bodies, who are responsible for the lighting of cites and' answerable to the"" ratepayers for the proper and economical expenditure of the - rates. If they bought articles at such vastly increased prices they would have to increase the rates. If they find that they cannot get appliances manufactured locally in a satisfactory manner or at a reasonable price they must, to conserve the interests of the ratepayers, go to the cheapest market. Mr Crocker stated in his evidence that at such a price as he quoted it was impossible to use electrical machinery, for mining pur-, poses. This is, therefore, a matter of the gravest concern to those engaged in mining enterprises. Now that the Treasurer is present, I shall be glad to hear what he proposes.",95
902,Mr STORRER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Bass) [2,14] - I desire to make an explanation witli regard to the honourable member for West Sydney, who spoke to me a few days ago regarding this item, as he was very anxious that the duties proposed by the Government should be reduced. Earlier in the sitting, when the honourable member for Cook rose, I rose at the same time, intending to speak on behalf of the honourable member for West Sydney. Then the honourable member for Cook pointed indignantlv to the fact that no Sydney representative had taken up the claims of Sydney !",95
903,Mr JH CATTS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I was referring to members of the Opposition. I know that the honourable member for West Sydney has been very active in the matter.,95
904,Mr STORRER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I am prepared to supbut port duties of 20 per cent, and 15 per cent, on all items in connection with' electrical appliances. Although I have had nine years' experience in a municipal council which has one of the best electric light plants in Australia, I shall not trouble the Committee with detailsThese articles the can be manufactured here, and we should give a certain amount of protection; but I am not an extremist.",96
905,Mr FOSTER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,New England) [2.16 has a.m.] - I do not seriously resent the putation of the honourable member for Cook that NSw South Wales members are negAustralia. lectful in this matter.,96
906,Mr JH CATTS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I spoke of the New point. South Wales members of the Opposition.,96
907,Mr FOSTER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"The honourable member spoke of New South Wales representatives, and, as one, I should like to inform him the arrangement. that I approached the Treasurer over'two months ago, and got a promise from him that he would do his best to see that all the articles that cannot be made here were placed on the free list.",96
908,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,That is quite true. out I had forgotten the fact. That was about lieuAmendment the time. I sought the assistance of profestosional men.,96
909,Mr FOSTER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"I was quite satisfied after with the promise of the Treasurer; and 1 electric am pleased at the present attitude of honourable gentleman. Electrical is going to overtake other machinery; and we know, that in many mining districts, posedwhere wood is becoming scarce, water power is being used, wherever possible, to generate out electricity. The honourable member for Bendigo has pointed out that in the item as it stands are articles which should be included; and I shall have much sure in supporting their elimination. I hot prepared, however, to suggest a lower Tariff than 20 per cent. We should either have a protective Tariff or make the articles free; and 15 per cent, is simply a revenue duty.",96
910,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,The Treasurer says he requires revenue.,96
911,Mr FOSTER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I am willing to assist the Treasurer in obtaining revenue from other sources than mining plant.,96
912,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Franklin) [2.19 a.m.] - The arrangement arrived at seems to be about the best possible under the cumstances; but if there were any hope of getting a still further reduction, I should be content to remain here much longer. Electricity is not the power of the future duties proposed. the power of the present; and in Tasmania there is a project on foot by which enormous electrical power is to be generated for lighting and motive-power purposes. Just when these enterprises are being attempted a paternal Government steps in and imposes taxation to the extent of 4s. in £ 1 on necessary articles, which cannot be made in Australia profitably for many years to come. Launceston, which is one of the most up-to-date cities in Australia, a splendid system of electric lighting, imand electric trams are being introduced; and similar progress is being made in South The proposed duty is wrong from the point of view of progress, and wrong even from a protectionist standI should strongly favour a lower duty; but, believing that those holding the same views as myself have made the best bargain possible, I reluctantly fall in with Amendment (Sir JOHN QUICK'S) agreed to.

913,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Parramatta) [2.24 not a.m.] - In agreeing to the arrangement by pleawhich a substantial reduction has been am made, I regret that the Treasurer does not see his way to make a still further reduction, because these duties are altogether too - high. A great deal of the machinery cannot, and will not, be made here; and any duty will be largely a revenue duty. I think that the Treasurer is acting unfairly in going beyond the recommendations of the A section of the Tariff Commission. However, as there appears to be no chance of securing anything more, I am forced to agree to what has been arranged. But I extremely regret that the Treasurer hascirnot made more substantial concessions.",96

918,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"North Sydney) [2.37 a.m.] - Electrica l meters, that is machines for measuring and recording electric power, are made dutiable under item 180 at 5 per cent., if imported from foreign countries, but they may be imported free from Great Britain. I wish to have water and gas meters treated in the same way. Electrical works are partly municipal undertakings and partly private enterprises, and so, too, are gas-works, though there are more gas-works than electrical works under municipal control. The meters are not instruments which can be made in Australia.'",97
919,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I do not think that an amendment such as the honourable mem-' ber proposes can be moved-in this item. These meters were dealt with as manufactures of metal under a previous item.,97
920,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"-There was some confusion in regard to the matter, because they were taken out of item 164, but were not inserted in the new item. Although we have dealt with manufactures of metals, the machines included in this item also come under that designation, and there are other items embracing manufactures of metal with which we have yet to deal. These meters are not made here.",97
921,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,I am informed that they are.,97

924,Mr STORRER,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,There is nothing to prevent them from being made here.,97
925,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"They are covered by patent rights, ancl are not made even in the large provincial, towns of the United Kingdom, partly because i ; £ powerful, exact and costly machineryis necessary for the striking out of the different parts. This machinery is very expensive, but is capable of turning out so much work when it is put into operation that it is not necessary, and would not pay, to have many plants. Chandeliers; Consequently these parts are struck out in London, and sent to Edinburgh and other cities to be put together. There is no likelihood of their being made in Australia, because the number of meters required annually is not great, after the first supply has been' placed, in position. They should be put on the same footing as electrical meters.",97
926,Mr WATKINS,IMMIGRATION FROM AMERICA TO,"Newcastle) [2.41 a.m.] - I mentioned this matter were dealing with an earlier item, and was told that, because of a re-arrangement that was being made, it should be brought on later. I think that this is the proper place to make the amendment. I stand that the Metropolitan Gas Company We ought to encourage the manufacture o of Melbourne puts together its own gas meters; but there are numbers of small gas works, owned largely by municipalities, that cannot do this. I understand that the parts of gas meters are covered by patent rights, so that they cannot be made here, and therefore it would be unfair to lost. put a big revenue duty on them, which would have to be borne chiefly by the municipalities.",98
