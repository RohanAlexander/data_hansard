2,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"There is a widespread apprehension that forged notes have been put into circulation. When I inform honourable members that some of my constituents at the Vietoria Markets have been losing money to the extent of Is. in the £1 as a result, they will understand ithe urgency of the questions I wish to address to the Treasurer - On notes previously issued the name of M-r. T. S. Harrison has appeared at the 'bottom, and as it is absent from the new notes in circulation, this hae led to the rumour. I ask the Treasure!--(1 ) Why has the imprint of the name of Mr T. S. Harrison, Commonwealth Notes Printer, been removed from new One pound notes? (2) Is it a fact that the removal of Ms Uame hae occasioned gjrea<t public inconvenience, in that it has given rise to rumours of the circulation of forged notes? Will the Treasurer take immediate steps to allay public anxiety 1",13
3,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"I must thank the honourable member for bringing this matter under my notice. I shall have immediate inquiries made, and a public statement on the subject will be made at the earliest possible moment.",13
4,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Perhaps the honourable gentleman could make an announcement, today to the effect that the new notes issued, .samples of which I have supplied to him, are good ?",13
5,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,I will try to do so. SUGAR. FaiCE TO FRUIT PBOGESSEBS.,13
6,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister if it is correct, as announced - by Mr Theodore, that, under the now sugar control, the Colonial Sugar Refining .Company will bo required to supply sugar to the retail trade at a price which is a variation upon what was expected, and whether there will be any variation which would affect the price which those engaged in the processing of fruit will have to pay for the sugar they require?",13
7,Mr BRUOE,Unknown,"The Commonwealth Government undertook to continue the embargo on ithe importation of sugar for a period of two years upon the condition that sugar was made available to the refineries at £27 per ton. That is the broad condition which the Government imposed in exchange for the embargo upon imports of sugar to which it was prepared to agree. Sugar being made available to the refineries at £27 per ton should be available to the public at 4£d. per lb. as a maximum price. Government has no control over the negotiations now being conducted between the Colonial Sugar Eefining Company and the Sugar Pool, but when they are finalized any agreement entered into will be subject to its approval. With regard to the position of the fruit growers, the arrangement entered into provides that sugar shall be - made available for the processing of fruit and other manufactured articles containing sugar at the export parity price. INCOME TAX RETURNS.",14
8,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"I ask the Treasurer a delicate question. Oan he indicate when taxpayers will be required to send in their income tax returns? I hasten to assure the honourable genitleman that I am not in a hurry to send in my return, but I should like to know just when it will be necessary for the schedules to be sent in. Dr EARLE PAGE' - I can assure the honourable member that ample notice will be given to taxpayers of the time within which income tax returns must be sent I hope, in the course of a very few days, to make a statement defining the exact position. MEETING OF PARLIAMENT AT sons, CANBERRA.",14
9,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I may be permitted whether, by way of introduction ito a question which I wish to ask the Prime Minister, to refer to the motion carried by this House on Thursday night to the effect that the Governor General should be requested to summon the Tenth Parliament of the Commonwealth to meet at Canjournment .berra. I wish to ask whether, in event of Canberra not being ready for into the matter. occupation when the present Parliament expires by effluxion of time, it is the intention of the Government to extend the life of this Ninth Parliament until Canberra is ready for occupation by the Tenth Parliament? Question not answered. INCREASE OF OLD-AGE AND INVALID PENSIONS.",14
10,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister a question arising out of an incident which occurred during my visit The to New South Wales during the week-end. I saw a number of old-age and invalid pensioners reading the Governor General's Opening Speech, and the reference therein contained to an increase in the pension to be paid. I wish to know from the right honourable gentleman whether he will"" make provision to enable thf! pensioners to obtain the promised increase of pension before 'he leaves on his trip round the world?",14
11,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"As the 'honourable member's question is obviously very urgent, I shall answer it at once. I am surprised that, with his knowledge of finance and the general principles adopted by Governments in connection with their financial proposals, he did not at once relieve the anxiety of the old-age and invalid pensioners to whom he has referred by telling them that the matter would be dealt ; with in the Budget statement, to be submitted, in all probability, next week.

Five ftonoraB'fa members' having risen Question proposed. ME. COLEMAN (,R id) [3.17]: - My e be object inmoving the adjournment of theistodraw attention-, to the* failure the Wa* Serviee - Homes Commission, were to providehomes for soldiers at I not. more thanthe maximum amount by the War Services Homes Act, namely, £800^, and to generally thi? administration of. the War Service Homes Act. No doubt the Government will complain of lack of notice Of my motion, andwillask. that to the matter be deferred pending eon*-sideration, on. their part, but let me say for us atonce that the excessive valuesin placed on War Service Homes have been under the notice of the present Government and of thei* predecessors for 1 considerable time. Since March last the I have made frequent endeavours to secure from the Goveimmenll a pronouncement of their policy upon thisI raised the matter on the Address-in-Reply I spokeabout it on the Address-in-Reply debate this, session. I havte also put questionsto M i nupont the subject. My effortshalveI t is surely time the Government declared their intention, in. this regard without tbalt hesiand equivocation, which) has eh-a'raeterized their other, statements of policy. I direct the attentionof the Minister for Works and Railways. (Mr Stewart) to the fact that complaints from soldiers who resent the excessive valuations which been placedupon their homes fill the newspapers of New South Wales. Yet nothing of nwoment has been done to allay their dissatisfaction. There is a consider1 able number of soldiers' homes in the 1 Reid electa'atej and the feeling of injus1 ticecaused by the excessive valuations uponthese hotfses by the Adjustmerits; Board is such that their' occupants The have organized themselves^ into a War - Service Home* Welfare Association to resist the exofbitan't claims made upon tshem - So incensed are - they at the ^MisympaDhetic treatment .they receive .under the present administration of the 'War Service Homes Act that they contemplate refusing to pay the instalments due upon their homes. 'The Act originally provided for the '-building of soldiers' homes at a cost not exceeding £700 each. Subsequently, because, it was alleged, of - tihe high cost of material, but mo doubt largely ""because of ""the bungling and maladministration .that characterized the initial operations of - the War Service Homes Commission, the Act was amended to - fix the maximum .cost of a home at £80.0. Those limitations, which were fixed after - a thorough - investigation of possible costs, are being exceeded, and the soldiers who - complain can - get no satisfaction from the - Government. A successful applicant for a home - is required to - sign the following agreement- I undertake and agree ito pay the War Service Homes Commissioner, on demand, all fees, charges, and costs charged by ithe said Commissioner. lit may Ibe argued that, - having signed that form, ithe soldier is legally responsible for any valuation which may be - fixed by the Adjustments Board. Bub such reasoning is ispecious and (dishonest. The Government .originally undertook ,to construct 'homes for - returned soldiers ;at a maximum cost of £7*0.0, which later swas increased ito £800, -,and they ,aa'e morally boumd ito carry out ithat-contract. The .soldiers signed the application form in the belief that it was a mere legal formality, and that the bomes would be 'constructed within the statutory maxim/nan. To require - men to pay more than the 'Statutory .maximum is unjust. They are revolting against this treatment, - and I am afraid that unless the Government make - a satisfactory declaration of policy in this, regard they will experience trouble with many of their soldier tenants in 3STew South Wales, particularly in my electorate. The Adjustments Board has been engaged for - some time in fixing valuations, and during its deliberations many of the - soldiers 'have been treated as tenants of the houses which they have 'Undertaken to buy. They have been kept in a state of suspense', not - knowing what value would be fixed on - the - properties, they have not felt inclined to baike possession of them as purchasers and effect improvements, ;as .they would .do if they knew that the houses would become tiheir own at a - reasonable valuation. The delay - that Jhas taken place in .t&tese assessments is - qiuAte unfair to the r.eturned soldier occupants, amd unjustifiable - in view of all & e facts. In .respect .of - completed valuations the position .of the soldieics is fliot more satisfactory. They hay.e contracted to (pay "" all fees, chasges, and costs .changed by ithe said .Commissioner,"" «oA when they are told that the ; cost of their ihomes - exceeds £800, they have no means of .appeal or other forjn .of remedy; they must .either accept the homes - at an excessive price or surrender them with' as little trouble as possible. The shadowy and mysterious Adjustments Board is completely out of touch with the soldier .occupants. The soldier occupants have no voice in respect of .the .valuations of the properties for which .they are to pay. That is unwarranted .and unjust. If the - Government will - not deliver .the houses at ,a price within the statutory limit, they should appoint an Appeal Board or other tribunal to consider the representations of soldiers who complain that they are the victims of excessive valuations and to deal with other grievances. Another .complaint that' has been made to me is that the valuations exceed not only the statutory - maximum 'but also the fair market value, and vary considerably in the one street. - One house in a street may be valued at £790, and - a neighbouring house, almost identically the - same in construction - and conveniences, at €8'50. 'There is no apparent reason for the variation. These - grievances lhave been ventilated in the House on many previous occasions, - and the 'Government hawe uo excuse for further delaying a definite pronouncement upon this matter - Some .of the properties - which I have person-ally inspected .were valued at £900, and even more, - and .when the men wece notified iof .the valuations they - were told that the prices were not tfina'1, - but were subject to further - adjustment. That is unsatisfactory, for .even if .they were prepared to accept .tihe - valuation .of £90.0., they bad no asautrasnce that that figure would be final. I shall not weary .the House with a - number of specific instances, but I may quote as typical the case «of Mr Sutton, of Lakem'ba, in regard to which I have ;been in correspondence with the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Stewart). This isoldier .entered into possession of a property and understood when he signed the agreement that he would not be required to pay more than £800. He is now called upon to pay £876, which is claimed by the Department to be the market value of the property, including land and 'al l i m provements. The Valuer-General of New South Wales, however, assesses the property at £740, and the Department has insured it for £799. The Department argues that the difference between its valuation and the insurance represents the cost of land, drainage, &c. . This method of valuation is most arbitrary and uninformafcive. The soldier, ' however, considers bhat he is being charged an excessive price, which includes the value of improvements that he has effected at his own expense. But he has no right of appeal. I quote this case to illustrate my contention that valuations in excess of the statutory l i m it are being fixed. I have heard of a number of soldier occupants who are not prepared to effect repairs and improvements to theirproperty because they fear that the value of such work will be added fco the valuation. The men's indignation at the breach of f a it h committed by the Government will be easily understood by honourable members when they have heard of the experience of a soldier named Lewis, who also resides at Lakemba. Mr Lewis complained, to me about the faulty construction of his house. informed me that he. had written to the Department advising them that the wall was tumblingdown, the roof was f all in g in, and his f a m i l y were in imminent danger of in j u r y from the general collapse of the property. This . is an extract from the reply sent by the DepartmentSurvey of this home was made by the mission on receipt of the complaint, and it furniture. was found that, owing to the shrinkage the clay subsoil, the foundations of the home of timber infested with the pest. had failed, causing fractures to the walls. will he necessary that .certain, portions wall be taken down and re-ibuilt, and the home restored, andmade secure by underpinning the foundations at certain points. In eases plaint, statedof this nature it is frequently desired that homos should be kept under observation before the actual work of restoration is put in' hand, and it was desired, in the particular, case under, discussion, to observe the home, and have further information before a design was prepared for the restoration of the home. Firom reports received at this date, the extent mission. Mr Coleman, of work necessary to repair has ibeen definitely ascertained, and the designs for the work prepared. The actual work of re-construction will be put in hand within the next few days. The idea of placing a house in this condition under lengthy observation is rather humorous. This is the type of home for which men are being called upon to pay amounts in excess of the statutory l i m it of £800. It is little to be wondered at that they are up in arms, and protest afc being charged excessive prices for construction work that - has been scamped in such a way. I have also had a complaint from Mr Nugent, of Belmore. He. advised me that half of his roof blew off during a gale, and his f a m i l y were exposed to all the rigours of the weather. This damage was due to the fact that the contractor had omitted to pin the tiles together, with the result that they blew off in the first gale of wind. Damage of this nature, being due entirely to faulty construction, should be repaired at the expense of the Department . without delay. I think there are more war service homes in my electoral division than in any other metropolitan division in New South Wales, and so general is the dissatisfaction that I have been absolutely inundated with correspondence on the subject. I have visited the various soldier settlements to make myself acquainted with the condition of the soldiers' homes, and I am He far from satisfied that a fair market valuation is being fixed by the Adjustments Board in cases where the statutory amount has been exceeded. At Belmore I found only one satisfied soldier tenant, and he was about to leave. There were over 100 dissatisfied with the condition of their homes. Upon inspection, I found numerous instances of cracked walls, and of timber being badly infested with Comborer, which had also attacked valuable Here again the trouble was of due to faulty construction, and the use No It one will suggest that borers were brought of the there by the occupants in a handbag. The Department, dealing with this com' As .to the eradication of the borer, where it may reasonably be assumed that the borer was in a dwelling-house at the time it was constructed by the Commission then the cost of removing the borer will be borne by the Com",15
16,Mr STBWABT,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Does the honourable member assertfchafcfcheborer would never get into those houses?,18
17,Mr COLEMAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"No ; but it is reasonable to assume, on the evidence I have received, that, in 99 cases out of 100, the presence of borer is due to the use of faulty material. The Belmore returned soldiers have gone to some trouble to ascertain what is the fair construction value of their homes, with a view to resisting the departmental claims by every means in their power. If the figures supplied to me by the men are correct, there is every reason to justify their request for a revision of the departmental valuation. One of the men actively identified with the construction of the homes estimated that the average cosfc of erecting a cottage was:-Land , £100; labour, £238 10s.; material,' £350; total, £688 10s. They reckon that this is more than a fair valuation, taking into consideration the manner in which the homes have been erected, but, instead of being charged' £688 10s., some of them have, to pay amounts in excess of £800. At Bankstown, where there is another soldier settlement, the men are also indignantly protesting against the Government valuation. Eor one house in Restwell-street the valuation is £792, and for another in the same street, and built, I am informed, on the same plan, it is £900. There is also a difference in the values fixed by the Adjustments Board for drainage costs. For one house in Restwell-street the drainage cost is placed at £10 l is . , and for another - house in the same street, £52 has been charged for drainage, although, I understand, drainago for the latter house was much more easily provided than for the former. Even though some of these allegations may not be substantiated in every detail, it is the duty of the Government to carry out their obligations to our returned soldiers by giving them homes at the amount contemplated by the Act. It is also their duty to give them an opportunity of voicing their grievances, and having the whole of these matters thoroughly and sympathetically investigated. The men complain that they cannot ascertain how the valuation is arrived at. The method of accounting confuses them. They do not know how far payments are advanced, and they cannot receive satisfactory information concerning the method adopted by the Department in cheeking the payments. The confusion which exists in the minds of the men is shoAvn by the following questions which have been submitted to the Deputy Commissioner of War Service Homes in New iSouth Wales. He has been asked1. Why application forms were duplicated? 2. Why the names of present occupiers of War Service homes were sent to the local councils as owners-occupier s whom the War Service Homes Commissioner now treats as tenants only? 3. Who gave him power to put soldiers in as tenants? 4. Who constituted the Adjustments Board ? 5. How did the Adjustments Board arrive at the values issued to occupiers? 6. Who paid the expenses of the Adjustments Board ? 7. Why does he not supply the purchasers with the cost of the house and not the value. What is the difference between the cost and value J 8. What, in the opinion of the War Service Homes Commissioner, constitutes ""trafficking "" in houses? 9. How is the valuation of drainage arrived at? Confusion exists in the minds of tenants as a result of the lack of sympathy shown them in the administration of the Department.",18
18,Mr STEWAHTJ,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Hav e those questions been submitted to the Deputy Commissioner in New South Wales?,18
19,Mr COLEMAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Yes , land the returned soldiers have forwarded them to me, together with a letter.",18
20,Mr STBWABT,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Do they say that they have not received any reply from the Deputy Commissioner?,18
21,Mr COLEMAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,They may have received a reply during the last few days. The questions were contained in a letter - received by me from the War Service Homes Welfare Association of New South Wales.,18
22,Mr SCULLIN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,On what date did they send the letter?,18
23,Mr COLEMAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"On the 27th of June, 1923. It is quite possible that the questions have been answered; but I am quoting them now to show that up to the 27th June, the men did not know where they stood, and to illustrate their mental confusion and discontent. According to a paragraph in yesterday's newspapers the Victorian! State Savings Bank' is> structing soldiers' homes for £800, and cannot understand why the Government do not write off the losses incurred:, owing to maladministration, and allow those quiring homes to purchase at the amount provided! in the Act. I am now conthe vinced that this, is not a matter which should he inquired into'- hy a Royal Commission;, it is merely a. question Government policy. I blame; not so the War Service Homes Commission' as the previous and present Governments, for not taking the tenants into their fidence, and explaining thei* policy. When this matter was discussed in Houselast August,, the present Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Stewart) wasone of the foremost Critics of the Hughes Government, and demanded a reremedy valuation of the War Service""- horaes-.. then Leader of theCountry party (Dr Earle Page),, in his policy speech tober last,, said, that if he were returned to power and held office, he would, demand a re-appraisement of soldiers' 1 homes, as the tenants should not be vichave timized as they had been up to that Other honourable members', of the Country party were lorad in their condemnation the policy of the Hughes Government, and the honourable member for Eawkner (Mr Maxwell), in debating a. censure States: motion moved by the Leader of th© Opposition (Mr Charlton), said,. ""There fied should be a general re-valuaticrn and. writing down.""' Since the advent of the present Government, of which Mr Stewart isamember; there has not been a rereadjustment valuation or writingdown:. The present' Minister for Works and Railwayssaid* last yearAny ' honourable member who upholds acCionof the present Government in connection with the War Service Homes' Commission condones their action, and should* share responsibility with them for the hopeless tangle in which the scheme is involved. I have been waiting for the Minister for Works and Railways to do something, this matter. The soldiers are not satisfied' with their homes; nor with the condithem tions' upon which they contracted to actory cept them. The members of the Labour party haveconsistently advocated (that retpurchase. turned soldiersshould get their homes for prices - within the statutory amount. cannot beaccused of political "" kiteflysquandered ing "" in this matter; because inOUT policy If r . Coleman. conspeeeh submitted to the electors last OcI tober we told the people that if wewere 1 returned to power we would support a proposal in f avour of t i e soldiers receivreing their homes at the amount prescribed in the Act. In September, 1922, during Hughes Administration, the present"" Minister for Work's and Railwaysand other honourable members of the Country of party supported the Labour party when much it opposed an, amending War Serviee Homes Bill giving the Governanent power to charge an amount in excessof the constatutory limit, and owing toth'at opposition shown the Government were comthe pelled to withdraw the Bill. Notwithstanding the present Minister's strong opposition to the policy of the Hughes Government he has apparently refused to the* grievances. In view of the The many complaints, I am at a loss tounderstand why the Government have not dein Occlared their policy im this matter. (Extension of time granted..]' The JointCommittee of Public AGeornnts) has drawn attention to the irregularities to which I referred to-d'ay, and. honourable memtime. bers from New South Wales know that 'there has> been a good deal of dissatisof faction in that State.

24,Mr COLEMAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Yea - and inother,19
25,Dr MALONEY,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"In - Victoria, in a modiform.",19
26,Mr COLEMAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Yes . The members of the Government who favoured: a' should be prepared to state definitely and clearly that their election promises would' he honoured,, and that homes would be sold to the purchasers at the amount prescribed in the Act. This theaffords the Ministers an opportunity of showing their practical patriotism. theI t was said, that the country was under a debt of gratitude to these men for respondingto the call during the years of war, and that they would be well treated, 1 in even if it meant a revaluation and writing down of the houses built for to bring them within the statulimit' of £700' or £800, according' to. the period' in which they contracted to The amount involved in so doing would be little when compared with We the hundreds of thousands of pounds by the past and present Go1 vernments', and particularly by the War Service Homes Commission, which wantonly entered into contracts regardless of expense. If a revaluation means' a loss of £100,000', as stated by the ex-Assistant Minister' for Repatriation (Mr Hector Lamond)', in September, 1922, that is. as nothing' compared' with the loss of national honour and decency if the G'qvernment refuses to carry out what they have contracted to do.",19
27,Mr COESEE,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Wide Bay) [3.50] - I have a case which I desire to bring under, the notice of the Minister in charge (ME. Stewart). A young man, then engaged in a Queensland saw-mill, volunteered' for service, and was at the Eront four years. On his return he was reinstated in his old position in the saw-mill, and I may here say that he is a practical man with a thorough knowledge of the industry. Early in 1922 he applied for a loan of £400 in. order to purchase for about £527 a house within ten. minutes' bicycle ride ofhis work. That application was not, granted,- and he got no 'satisfaction from the Department,, beyond the statement that there were other housesin course of erection from which he might choose a home. The case wasbrought under the notice of the Department, and also of the Commissioner, who were informed that the young man had paid a deposit of £-127 on the house in respect of which he had made the application. Subsequently the departmental inspector led him. to believe that there was no objection to the house itself, and the young man assures me that the timber used in itsconstruction is better than that in the departmental houses. The Department, however, - wishes this man to purchase from the Department, at a price of £688 19s. 6d., a house that is certainly no better than the one self purchased,, and' is not so suitable his requirements. Since inspection the man has entered into occupation of the house he purchased, has furnished it, andmade a number of improvements in the shape of fencing, outbuildings, and' so forth. Under the circumstances, he ought not to be asked to - lose his deposit, and remove his furniture to another house. No explanation is given by the Department, other than that there is available a departmental house, which is jiust as near to the man's work as that in which he is now living.. He offered ample security for the loan of £400>, a fact which would be verified by any independent valuer.. The Department,, however, offer, haimi a. house at a cost of practically £700', and if he is compelled to accept i the will lose his deposit of £127,. and also the vailue of the improvements he has made in his, present home. He is now being pressed for the balance of the purchase money,which he is unable to pay,, and as. the case is urgent. I hope the Minister, will give it his serious a-md favourable consideration.",20
28,Mr CHAELTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Hunter) [3.54]i - The honourable member for Reid (Mr. Cofem-an) is-1& be commended for bring1 iing' this, matter befbite the House, f t was; discussed in August of last year,, when I submitted a. proposal to permit soldiers to purchasetheir homes at the maximum amount fixed, by the Act - That proposal was. not, adfopitiedi,. andi the Minister then in charge' made-- theastounding statement that-,- if if were accepted, ifr wouldmean thatsomething like £i0Q,WO' would! have to» bepaid to returned soldiers. Thetime has arrived when this mattes: should' be settled one© and for all. Few people would approveo£ the returned: men being mulcted inextra costs because' of thebungling im tha adminisuiation of the War Service: Homes Depaartiiment.",20
29,Mr MCGRATH,WAR SERVICE HOMES,""" Bungling "" is hardly a._ strong, ffnough ternm to use! "" Mr CHABLTCfN - It i * not. In the first iniat'anGe'i £700 was' fixed as the maximum, price of a Wa* Service Home; but' subsequently,, owing to the increased' cost of building material, the amount was increased to- £800. It is also truethat the men. signedan agreement fo pay the costof the homes erected ,"" but 1 in doing so they were, no doubt,, guided by the fact that the Act fixed a maximum of £800. They were dealing withhe him- the Commonwealth Government, and for thought there would"" be nodifficulty in obtaininghomes at a price within the limit. As pointed' out, however, many men have been asked to pay considerably more than £800. If , throughthe maladministration of the Department, the cost of the homes' has been increased, it is only fair thattheCommonwealth"", and not the men themselves, should' carry the burden. We often declare that every consideration should be given' to the returned men, and yet weask them to pay 1 more for their homesthan they ever expected to have to pay. Probably the Minister (Mr Stewart) will tell us that ihere has been an adjustment or valuation board appointed, and that the men are being asked to pay the amounts fixed by that Board.",20
30,Mr REID,WAR SERVICE HOMES,That Board was in operation when complaint was made last year.,21
31,Mr CHARLTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The Board was appointed just about that time, and it has the power to fix valuations over £800. The Board may say that the present value of a property is £900. But it must be remembered that, during recent years, values have risen considerably in every part of Australia. No returned soldier should be debited with a cost over and above that fixed by the Act; and if justice is done no man will be asked to pay more. The increased costs were the result of the departmental bungling. I do not contend for a moment that, where a soldier requires additional work done, he should not pay for it ; that is quite another proposition. But where a man does not ask for anything beyond what is shown in the plans and specifications submitted for his approval, he should not be asked to pay over £800, even though the house may have cost £1,000. The Government should shoulder the burden of any increased costs that were not incurred by the soldier himself. In"" some cases, even with the limitation of £800, it is well nigh impossible for some to redeem their homes, and we ought not to make the position more difficult. A working man, especially one just married, with a small family growing up about liim, is not in a position to meet any extra calls of the kind, especially if he has to contend with sickness or unemployment. I have previously drawn attention to this circumstance; and what I then suggested has come to pass. A number of returned men in New South Wales, some of them in my own district, have written to me pointing out that, in consequence of illness or unemployment, they have been unable to meet their payments. One of these men has been in his home for two or three years, and had, up to a short time ago, .met every payment as it became due, besides devoting any spare money to improvements. Now, however, he is ill , and unable to work. He omitted to make two monthly payments, and thereupon received a letter from the Department to the effect that, unless he could arrange to pay the instalments, he would have to give up the home. It was practically a notice of ejectment. If a private property owner treated a tenant in that way his conduct would be regarded as grossly unfair, and there can be no excuse for a Government Department acting in such a peremptory manner, seeing that the man had not shirked his responsibility, but had been paying regularly until misfortune overtook him. I am sure that the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Stewart) is not in sympathy with such high handed action. The departmental officers should have it made perfectly clear to them that this is not the proper way of dealing with the returned men. On one or two occasions I have been approached by the wives of soldiers, who, with tears in their eyes, have expressed the fear that they would be ejected from their homes if they did not make certain payments, although they knew they had no hope of obtaining the money. These people should not be placed in such a humiliating position. They have quite sufficient worry in endeavouring to keep up their payments, without being threatened with ejectment. Other cases of a similar nature have been brought - under my notice, the threat being embodied in a letter of stereotyped form. When a returned man is able to show that, in consequence of illness or unemployment) he is unable to make up his arrears, every consideration should be extended to him by allowing him to spread the payments over a given period. The Department's first duty is to deal with him in a liberal manner, so that he may be able to complete the purchase of his home. In many instances, I am afraid, the soldiers will never be able to cany out their undertakings. There is another aspect of the matter. The honourable member for Reid (Mr. Coleman), pointed out that many of the houses are "" jerry "" built. During an absence of the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins), I was asked to inspect some of the soldiers' homes in his district. I was unable, at the time, to make an investigation, and subsequently the honourable member did so. It was found that the end had fallen out of one of the homes- a brick dwelling-and others were badly cracked. Similar defects were brought under notice in other localities. I believe the Department made good the damage, but it is not satisfactory to the Government to know that the work was scamped. There are quite a number of matters of this description that need to be investigated. I have no doubt that the Minister is in sympathy with the soldiers, because I recall the speech delivered by him on the motion I submitted in August last. Finality should be reached so that the soldiers may know exactly what they have to pay, and in no case should the total charge exceed the statutory limitation, even if the cost to the country is £500,000. The public, and not the soldier, should bear the loss due to faulty administration for which the returned men are in no way responsible. Those who have purchased homes erected by private people are in a much better position, because, in many cases, their houses have not cost them more than £400 or £500, and some of the owners have almost completely discharged their . debt. I suggest that, in future, a returned soldier should be permitted to have his house erected in any locality he desires, because the block system has not proved satisfactory. Take, for example, the King's-road block, in the Newcastle district. There are considerably over forty dwellings in that block, and there has been trouble, more or less, in regard to all of them, on account of the unsuitability of the site. Why should a man be"" compelled to live in a locality that is unattractive to him? The Railway Department - has established its cleaning sheds in the immediate neighbourhood of the block, and when the works are completed the occupants of the homes will be smoked black. Such bungling is inexcusable. I hope that the Minister will take note of my suggestion, and allow applicants to choose their own sites. I trust that this will be the last time i be necessary to discuss the subject of soldiers' homes. I expect to hear a statement from the Minister as to the policy, to be adopted by the Department to meet the objections that have been raised.",21
32,Mr LATHAM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Kooyong) [4.8] - I feel sure that the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr 'Stewart) is sympathetic with the views expressed by honourable members. He is faced with the.results of highly incompetent administration, as were also several other members of the Ministry in taking over their Departments in the new Government. The most important complaint, perhaps, relates to the prices charged for soldiers' homes. It appears to be perfectly plain that when' a soldier signed an application for a house, he was entitled, in the first instance, to suppose that the building; would not cost more than £700, and subsequently, not more than £800. The Department had no authority under the Act to spend more than £800 on one. house, unless the money were provided from some private source. If , owing tofaulty administration, a larger expenditure has been incurred, ib is expenditurefor which the Commonwealth cannot in. honour hold the soldier liable. The Department had no authority to go beyond the statutory limit, and the soldier was entitled to suppose that the Department would conform to it . Of course,, where a man has undertaken to pay an amount in excess of the limit, it is an entirely different matter. In such a casethe soldier should be held to his undertaking. It is inconceivable, under proper administration, that houses would be contracted for verbally, and, in the absence of an agreement in writing, the general rule should be that the statutory limit should apply. The introduction of that principle will require very careful consideration in particular instances, because some men have already paid more than the statutory limit, while others refuse to sign agreements. I hope the Minister will make a definite statementon this matter, which is causing perhaps a larger amount of justifiable dissatisfaction than any other administrative act by any Government of the Commonwealth has caused. It is pitiable and shameful to see the state of some of the houses. In a house in my electorate I have seen evidence of damp to a height of 2 f t . 6 in. on the t will walls of every room. A returned soldier lived there until his family became ill , when he transferred to a vacant house alongside. He desired to become the permanent occupant of that house, but after six months he was informed that he could not do so, because it would be against the rules of the Department. In circumstances like that, is it any wonder that the most profound dissatisfaction exists.? Another grievance, which is causing - very grave dissatisfaction, relates to the impossibility of obtaining definite and consistent statements regarding the prices to be paid for the hpuses. Honourable members have alluded to the attempts that have been made by the Department to compel soldiers, many ef whom are not well .educated, to sign agreements, in terms required by the Department, by threatening them with expulsion from their homes. That action is unworthy of the Commonwealth of Australia. I am sure that the Minister will give earnest consideration to what has been said, and will do his utmost to remove the cause of these very serious complaints.",22
33,Mr YATES,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Adelaide) [4.13] - I desire to associate myself with the motion submitted by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman). I fail to see where the iGovermnent can start upon the business of reform, or where it will end. The abuses to which reference has been made have been occurring ever since the war, and the position has changed only from bad to worse. No Government seems to be willing to apply a remedy. An appeal has been made this afternoon on a motion for the adjournment of the House, and the honourable member for Kooyong (MrLatham) has made a very nice speech, which will no doubt read well in Hansard. It did not, however, perturb ths mind of any one who listened to his rhetoric. War Service Homes were built in South Australia at a place called Gelland., and it has been proved that th© man who delivers the morning. newspapers can push them through the cracks in the doprs.",23
34,Mr FOSTEB,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Who built them 1,23
35,Mr YATES,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Whoeve r built them, the digger was pinched in the process. I have not forgotten the promises that were made to him. The man who fought was "" a hero,"" and he was told that when he came home he would be treated as a heroThere is not a sphere of activity affecting the digger where some one has not put a talon into him.",23
36,Mr FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Who built the houses to v/hich the honourable .gentleman refers ?,23
37,Mr YATES,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I do not know. I want the Minister to find out, and I ask that something drastuj should be done-some thing more than .a circumlocutory investigation which will bring us round to the spot from - which we start.",23
38,Mr MAKIN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,We want redress for the digger.,23
39,Mr YATES,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"That is so, but up to the present the redress has not been made. The digger fought, and now he is being made to pay. He is being charged ,5 per cent., plus extras, for what he did in France. Honourable members who support the motion should insist upon a tangible result which will benefit the man who is now penalized. I have soldiers' homes in my district from Collinswood and Broadview down to Islington workshops, where War Service Homes have been built on land that cannot be sewered, and the occupants have to use septic tanks. Let any .honourable member go to Glenelg, a watering place on the outskirts of Adelaide, and to Galway Gardens and Novar Gardens, which are suburbs of Adelaide, and they will see no more mean-looking houses than those in which our heroes live. The verandah posts .are comparable with broomsticks.",23
40,Mr FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,The War Service Howes in other parts of Australia are worse than those in South Australia.,23
41,Mr YATES,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"If 'that statement is true it reflects the more shame upon this Parliament, which should have taken steps to insure that the promisee made to the diggers were honoured.",23
42,Mr FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,The honourable member is misrepresenting the position in his own State.,23
43,Mr YATES,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I am stating the true position, and if there is any doubt in . the mind of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster), I shall be prepared next Saturday morning to get out of the express and proceed with him to Glenelg, where I can demonstrate to him the truth of what I say. The houses may be better internally than externally, but they are a disgrace and a scandal in view of the prices charged for them.",23
44,Mr FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Thos e houses average a'bout £150 better value than War Service Homes in any other State.,23
45,Mr YATES,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The honourable - gentleman cannot judge his virtues by the vices of another man. If the houses in another State are worse than those in South Australia, that fact does not excuse South Australia. I do not wish to belittle my own State. The bouses built there may be superior to those provided in iOther States. The honourable member for Wakefield knows that, about four weeks ago, the contractors waited as a deputation upon a State Department and objected to the restrictions that Mr. MCNamara, of the State Bank, had placed upon thern. Mr MCNamara said that he had to compel them to provide lintels of brick, because, when the reinforced concrete lintels were examined, they were found to contain gas piping which could be broken across the knee.",23
46,Mr FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"A Victorian contractor who saw some, of the houses told me that he did not know how they could have beeu built for the money.",24
47,Mr YATES,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"If that is so, then God help the soldier victims of the profiteers in Victoria !",24
48,Mr FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The honourable member is talking "" through his neck.""",24
49,Mr YATES,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Eve n when I talk "" through my neck "" I get nearer to the truth than does the honourable member for Wakefield when he talks through his mouth. I have no desire to be at crosspurposes with any one. My sole object in rising was, if possible, to impress upon the Government the need to honour the promises made to returned soldiers. We all agree that, not only in small South Australia, but also in the other larger States, the profiteer has been using for his own purposes the good money of the Commonwealth, which should have been expended in giving extra value to the home of the returned soldier. I maintain that the returned man has not had that "" spin "" to which he is entitled, and has not obtained a home of the value of the money expended. I am prepared to prove that proper provision has. not been made to protect the returned soldier from the profiteer. Generally speaking, the motion of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) is well timed and very necessary. Nothing has caused this Parliament greater concern than the dishonouring of the promises made to returned soldiers, and the maladministration of the War Service Ilomes Department. The facts are recognised by. the Government because, according to the Governor General's Speech, a Commission is to be appointed to investigate certain contracts.",24
50,Mr COLEMAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,On e contract only !,24
51,Mr YATES,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"It would have been much better if the inquiry had been antedated three years, and then the big frauds, which have since taken place, would have been prevented. The returned soldier is being and has been robbed, and the practice should be [43] ' stopped. When the Kidman-Mayoh contract was inquired into, the Minister concerned stated that some one should be put into gaol. But what is the use of making such a statement when no one is put into gaol ? That was a contract necessitated by the war, and for which the Government paid excessively. The object of the motion is of much more importance, because individuals are being crucified in the administration of the War Service Homes Department, whiqh is not at all fair to the returned soldiers. I add my voice, vote, and vehemence to the efforts of other honourable members to bring about some beneficial result to the "" Digger,"" who has been penalized, rather than privileged. If I have maligned any one in my endeavour to support this motion, it is because I am very anxious to give effect to the promises made to returned soldiers, and, in the process, to see that the taxpayer is protected.",24
52,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Wimmera-Minister for Works and Railways) [4.23] - I do not question the sincerity of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) in bringing the matter of the bousing of returned soldiers before the House, as he is quite justified in so doing. But it would have been more satisfactory to himself, and to, perhaps, all sides of the House, had he given more notice of his contemplated action.",24
53,Mr CHARLTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The Minister may not know that, the other day, we gave ample notice to the Prime Minister, and he entered the Chamber and used up the allotted time. That was the result of giving notice.",24
54,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Whateve r the reasons that actuated the honourable member for. Reid in springing this matter on the Government-- ,24
55,Mr COLEMAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I notified the Minister's secretary at 2 o'clock today, but the Minister was then absent from his office.",24
56,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The honourable member did not notify me at 2 o'clock. He may have attempted to notify me at 2.30. Unfortunately, I was away on business, and knew nothing whatever of this matter until I arrived at the House, when the bells were ringing. I thought, before the Leader of the Opposition's interjection, that the omission of proper notice was unintentional, but it is quite clear, from his remarks, that the short notice was intentional.",24
57,Mr CHARLTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I do nobsay that. But I gave the Minister an instance of what occurred the other day, when we gave ample notice to the Prime Minister.",25
58,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"On e might be led to believe, by the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition, that, in view of his experience the other day, future notices of adjournment motions will be delayed unt i l the last minute.",25
59,Mr COLEMAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Surely an hour is sufficient notice.,25
60,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I do not wish to wrangle over this matter. Numerous new cases have been quoted by honourable members, but as they have arisen in different States, it is impossible for me to reply at the moment to the statements made. The honourable member for Reid said that the Labour party could not be accused of political kite flying on this matter.",25
61,Mr COLEMAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"We brought the matter before the House in August and September last, and the Minister then supported us.",25
62,Mr STEWAUT,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I would be the last to assert that there is pplitical kite-flying on this subject. The main portion of the honourable member's address dealt with complaints made by the W a r Service Homes Welfare Association. Perhaps it is only right that I should mention one or two facts, so that honourable members on all sides of the House will understand the position. I have been informed, rightly or wrongly-if wrongly, I know that the honourable member for Reid will correct me-that the meeting place of this Association is the Trades H all , Sydney.",25
63,Mr YATES,WAR SERVICE HOMES,The Trades H all 'is quite capable of instituting reform.,25
64,Mr COLEMAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,What is wrong with the Trades H all ?,25
65,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The meeting place of the Welfare Association is the Trades H all , Sydney, and its official publication is the Daily M a i l , of Sydney.",25
66,Mr COLEMAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,The Minister is evading the main complaint of excess valuations.,25
67,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I am informing honourable members of the position. I do not intend to evade any matter that has been mentioned this afternoon. The chief complaint has been about the valuations placed upon the homes, and particularly those that exceed the statutory l i m it under the Act. The honourable member for Reid stated that the soldiers had no faith in the decisions of the Adjustments Board or in the values placed upon the homes by that Board. The facts are that the Adjustments Board in New South Wales, and also in the other States, has in cluded in its personnel a representative of the returned soldiers, and the representative of the returned soldiers on the New South Wales Adjustments Board is an architect.",25
68,Mr COLEMAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"What is his name, and by whom was he nominated ?",25
69,Mr STEWAET,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I will reply to the interjection presently. The honourable member for Reid stated that, after a personal inspection of the houses, he was not satisfied with the values placed upon them, but the facts are that these valuations were very carefully arrived at after detailed investigation and consideration of sworn valuations and check valuations of similar types of houses in other parts of Sydney.",25
70,Mr COLEMAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,The point I stressed was that the valuations exceeded the statutory limits.,25
71,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,I had the courtesy and good manners to allow honourable members to criticise the Department without interruption. I listened in silence. That courtesy apparently is not to be extended to the Minister.,25
72,Mr COLEMAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,I do not want to be misrepresented.,25
73,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I will explain the policy adopted by the Department respecting the excess cost of houses. The question may be viewed from many angles. . This is a knotty problem, and only when honourable members know all the facts, for and against, and not a portion of them, can they realise the difficulties which have faced the Department. If the Government say that soldiers shall be charged the statutory l i m it at the time at which they agree to purchase the house, you will find anomalies arise. A man may secure a check valuation, independent of the Department, of, say, £ 9 0 0 . Another man in the same district may want a house which is valued by the Adjustments Board at £ 8 0 0. If we adopt the policy of charging both soldiers the same price, one man will get a £90 0 house for £800, and the other man will be paying £800 for an £800 house. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) mentioned that some soldiers had agreed with the Department to purchase houses which cost more than £ 8 0 0 . If we adhered to the statutory limi t in such cases, the soldiers - would have been obliged to pay in cash whatever the house cost in excess of £ 8 0 0 . Under our policy, however, soldiers have been satisfied to sign contracts to pay up to £ 9 0 0 , and even almost £1,000 for houses much superior to those they could have obtained, had they been compelled to abide by the statutory limit . Something has been said about bungling administration being responsible for excess costs. I wish members to understand clearly that no soldier has been asked to pay, or has been charged for, any bungling in administration. The object of appointing the Adjustments Board was to ascertain by as fair a tribunal as it was possible to obtain, what the actual value of a house was at the time it was to be purchased, uot what the house cost to build.",25
74,Mr FENTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,That was recommended by the Public Accounts Committee before the Board was appointed.,26
75,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The Adjustments Board is composed of men high in their profession, and its membership includes a representative of the returned soldiers.",26
76,Mr SCULLIN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Does the Board take into consideration enhanced values?,26
77,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"No . If the Adjustments Board decides that a house cost £900 to build, but that its value is £ 8 5 0, the soldier is expected to pay only £ 8 5 0 . On the other hand, where a house cost £800 to build, and the Adjustments Board values it at £ 8 5 0 , the soldier has to pay only £ 8 0 0 .",26
78,Mr FENTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Is the Government following the Adjustments Board's recommendations in every case?,26
79,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"In every case where the Adjustments Board's recommendation is that the house has been excessively priced. I will put it this way. The price charged is the actual value of the house, or the cost of the house, whichever is the less. The problem of excess costs is very difficult. It has been receiving the serious consideration of the Government for some time. Before long I hope fco introduce tb the House a measure to iniske certain amendments in the War Service Homes Act. [Extension of time granted.] Some of the amendments will deal with excess costs. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) said that this matter should be settled once and for all. I agree with him. That is what the Government wish. When this measure is before honourable members they will have a better opportunity to discuss the question than they have this afternoon.",26
80,Mr CHARLTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Will you bring that Bill down this session?,26
81,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Yes , and therefore the Leader of the Opposition will not expect me to lay down the whole policy of the Government now. A fitting occasion to do that will be when I bring in the amending Bill . Honourable members will also have more time then fco deal with the question.",26
82,Mr FENTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,If you give us time..,26
83,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"We shall give honourable members reasonable time in which to discuss it . In view of the importance of the question to ttie returned soldiers, and the agitation it is causing the general public, we shall not unduly curtail the debate. Mr COLEMAN"" - Will the returned soldiers be given an opportunity of suggesting amendments?",26
84,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Yes . Representatives of returned soldiers in t h is Chamber will have the privilege and the opportunity, when the Bill is before the House, of submitting amendments. I shall be glad to receive any suggestion which will enable me to incorporate in the measure provisions, that will insure ithat the returned soldier shall be treated equitably, consistently with the necessity to act fair l y towards the general taxpayer. I shall 'be glad of the assistance of honourable members, or of any association representing the returned men, to enable the Government to achieve that object. The Government are anxious to do the fair thing. I have been reminded of the criticism which I passed upon this Department when I was a p r i vate member. I do not take back cno word of what I said regarding past administration. I am not here to defend-and I do not intend to defend - the administrative acts of previous Ministers or Governments. My endeavour is to clean up what has been a bad mess. Honourable members should accord me a certain amount of consideration for having undertaken this task. Considering the nature and extent of the administrative blunders that have been committed over a series of years, no man - I care not who he may be-coul d clean M a i l , or whether it has any. up the mess in a week, a month, or even in six months.",26
85,Mr WEST,WAR SERVICE HOMES,A change of Ministry required.,27
86,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I should have expect cepted the honourable member from my statement. I do not doubt that he could clean up the mess in five minutes. We realise that the honourable member could "" place a girdle round about the earth i for ty minutes."" I shall have investigaMany tions made into the various cases that have been brought forward, and action will be taken to secure justice and dealing for the returned soldiers who affected. Mr F. MCDONALD (Barton) - Ifc is rather a pity that the Minister has not had the time to devote to the study of this question which would have enabled him to do justice to it. so, the Minister has done justice to the question from the Government's point of view, inasmuch as, in the short time which hi-- had at his disposal, he has made quite clear to the House the policy of the Go the vernment regarding War Service We are all glad to know from the Minpolitical ister that he has every sympathy with the men who are in these homes,' and that he will do all that lies in his power to up the mess that exists. The occupants these homes, in common with members, would have been more pleased had the Minister told us that he was pared to go a little further than he indicated. The Minister's insinuation that this was a political move on the part of the honourable member for Reid (Mr. Coleman) is regrettable. It is regrettable, also, that the Minister should have drawn a political significance from the fact that the association referred to by the honortho si ble member for Reid occupies a room in the Trades Hall in Sydney. It is difficult to get rooms in Sydney, and it so happened that this association a convenient meeting room in a building which had rooms to let. The ought not, on that 'account, to have acpotatoes,"" cused the members of that association, or the honourable member for Reid, of having made a political move in bringing ward this question. What reason Minister had for connecting with matter a newspaper in Sydney called the Daily Mail, only he knows. I do know what are the politics of the Daily The - Minister, perhaps, has not had sufficient, time to outline the policy - of is the Department. We did not expect to have that policy outlined, but we did exsome clear indication of the general lines on which it was proposed to work. The Minister is not prepared 'to go nearly as far as is sought by the motion, or, as has been advocated by honourable n members sitting on this side of the House. reasons were advanced by the M in ister for that decision. We on this side contend that, as the occupants of these fair houses entered into contracts on the are understanding that they were not to cost more than a certain sum-£70 0 in the [4.44]. first place, and £800 subsequently-no t more than that amount should be charged except where the extra cost was incurred in meeting the wishes of men who desired Even an alteration in the construction of their houses. If the Minister and the Government, in introducing the amending Bill , will be strong enough to make provision that not more than £800 shall be charged, people of Australia will acclaim them. Homes. They w i ll be perfectly entitled to any kudos they can' get-and I believe they will get a good deal-as the result of their honouring the implied proclean mise made by a previous Government. of - In taking that action they would be honourable honouring the name of Australia. One reason advanced by the Minister against prethe desirability of taking such a step has is that for £800 one soldier might get a 'house worth £900, while another might get a house worth only £850.. That would not be a f e a r f u l happening. The people of Australia do not desire that this matter shall be dealt with upon a basis of £ s. d. They remember that when soldiers left Australia they did not value their services according to consideravery tions of £ s. d. When the soldier got to the Front, he did not say to his captain, found "" I am not going into that dangerous place while, my mate stays behind peeling Minister or anything of that kind. I do not think, therefore, that the Governmentare justified in adopting such an attitude. forI f the Government will be not only fair, the but a little generous, to the occupants of the soldiers' - homes, they will lose nothing by so doing. One of the greatest troubles not arises from the unsympathetic treatment of the returned soldiers by the Department. The Government should make a ment, straightforward declaration that the partment shall assist the men i every possible way. Honourable memunder bers opposite know probably more of than I do about roofs that not keep out the rain, damp-courses that do not keep out the damp, and winnew dows that do not close; but I know as well as other honourable members that l when these defects have beeu pointed out to the Department the soldier, instead receiving a straightforward answer, has been put off from time to time by the Department until he does not know where ideas. he stands. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) mentioned some cases where the borer has been found i the houses. We know that borers were for bred in millions in the wood that has been handled by the War Service Homes Department. It is extremely probable where the borer has been found in W a Service Homes that its presence is due the wood used in their' construction. There is not one chance in millions it has been introduced in the furniture. In the circumstances, the Government might very well lay it down as a principle that in all cases where the borer is found in W a r Service Homes the Department shall accept responsibility for the eradicahas tion of the pest.",27
87,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Where there is reasonhonorable able proof that the borer was in the when it was erected the Commission accepts responsibility. Mr F . MCDONALD - The Minister has says that the Department accepts responsithe bility where there is a reasonable proof that the borer was in a house when it was erected; but we know that that may be very difficult to prove, when there is a possibility that it gained entrance by other means than that of the timber used by the Department in construction.",28
88,Mr STEWART,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Where there is any doubt the Commission accepts responsicost bility. Mr F . MCDONALD - I am glad to know that the Minister now in charge of the Department will not haggle over these matters; because the soldiers did not haggle over the service they were called upon to perform. A case was referred to been signed. by the honourable member for Reid of a house tumbling down owing to subsidence of the land on which it was constructed. That is a case in which summary action should have been taken by the Departweeks but there again its action was cirDecumlocutory, and the returned soldier n was informed that his place would be ""put observation."" All this means waste time, leaves the returned soldier in do suspense, and conveys the impression that the Department may be awaiting some geological period when, perhaps, in stead of the land subsiding, a volcanic upi f t will take place, and the W a r Service home be restored to a level position - We of hope that the Government will take such action as may disabuse the minds of the occupants of these homes of any such Let them take the straightforward course of saying, "" Since you believed that your home would cost you no n more than £800, we will give it to you £ 8 0 0 . "" If the Government would do that it would be acclaimed by the people of Australia. By generous treatment the Government might restore to the returned r soldiers that confidence in it which has to been lost to a great extent as the result of unsympathetic treatment by that the War Service Homes Department. Mr MARR, (Parkes) [4.55] - As one who has probably had occasion to find as much faul t with the administration of the W a r Service Homes Department as any other member of this House, I think it right to say that,. although the member for - Adelaide (Mr . house Yates) and other honourable members have said Ithat that administration has gone from bad to worse, m y experience been to the contrary. In my opinion, administration has very materially improved with in the last twelve months.",28
89,Mr COLEMAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,No one denies that.,28
90,Mr MARR,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The honourable member for Adelaide said that it had gone from some bad to worse, and was still on the downward path. The greatest fault I have to find with the Department is that, whether their homes have exceeded £800, or have less ithan that amount, the returned soldiers have not known when they took possession of their homes what they were to be charged for them.",28
91,Mr FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,An agreement to the effect that they should know should have,28
92,Mr MARR,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"That is so. There are cases in my electorate of men who, having been in their homes for nearly three years, have only within the last few learned, what they are to be charged for them. That sort of thing only gives rise to contempt for the Department and its administration; it is certainly not business. returned soldiers have on this account serious cause for complaint. I think that too much stress has been laid on the fact that there have been a number of badly constructed homes. In the discussions on this subject which we have had hi this Ohamber in the past, and also during this debate, it has been admitted that there has been serious cause for complaint because of badly constructed homes, but it should be remembered that the percentage of badly constructed homes is very small. That will be seen from the report of the joint Committee of Parliament that inquired into the operations of the ""War Service Homes Department. The members of that Committee viewed thousands of homes, and their report is evidence of the exhaustive manner in which they carried out their inquiry. Honourable members have much to say by way of criticism of what has been done in the past. It is easy to criticise adversely the action of Ministers, Commissions, and administrative Boards, but what is wanted in this House is constructive and not destructive criticism. have so far heard in this Chamber very little constructive criticism, particularly in regard to repatriation and War Service Homes problems. I have been amongst the returned soldiers in my electorate, and I know that many of them have good grounds for complaint. I am pleased to be able to say that the present Minister and the branch of the War Service Homes Department in Sydney have gone out of their way to try to remedy complaints.",28
93,Mr COLEMAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Does the honourable member not think that a War Service Home should be supplied within the statutory limit of cost ?,29
94,Mr MARR,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"That is a very debatable point. If the War Service Homes Commission told a returned soldier, when making his application for a home, that it could not supply the class of house for which he applied for £S00, and that it could only advance £800, he would know where he stood. But when a soldier puts in his application, he is not told what the cost of his house will be, and, as I have said, some men have waited for three years to learn what they will be charged for their homes.",29
95,Mr SCULLIN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"What authority has the The War Service Homes Commission for exceeding the statutory limit of advance, other than the authority of the returned soldier ? MT. MARR - The Government have in no case exceeded the advance allowed by the Act.",29
96,Mr STEW AUT,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Where the cost of War Service Homes has exceeded the statutory advance, this has been largely due to the fact that they were erected under the day-labour system, and owing to faulty accountancy the Commission was not. informed of the actual cost until a considerable time after they were erected.",29
97,Mr MARR,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I have always been, and still am, opposed to the group settlement of returned soldiers. I believe it is not in the best interests of the community that any particular class should be grouped together in one settlement. Debate interrupted understanding order 119. CUSTOMS BILL . SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 13th July (vide I page 1110), on motion by Mr AUSTIN CHAPMANThat the Bill be now read a second time.",29
98,Mr CHARLTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Hunter) [5.1] This Bill may be more conveniently considered in Committee. It proposes, amongst other things, the tightening up of certain sections of the principal Act to cover the importation or exportation of goods by aerial service. It is evident that the Government anticipate that in the near future aircraft will be used for the importation and exportation of goods, and are making provision to meet that contingency. There is one clause of the Bill to which honourable members should give some consideration. I refer to clause 39, which proposes the repeal of section 271 of the principal Act. That section provides that regulations framed under the Act from time to time are to be laid on the table of this House.",29
99,Mr GROOM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Clause 39 will not alter that provision, because what the honourable member refers to is already provided for under the Acts Interpretation Act.",29
100,Mr CHARLTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Dealing with clause 39 as it stands, it would appear that on the repeal of section 271 of the principal Act: Customs regulations might be brought into force without being laid on the table of this House.",29
101,Mr GROOM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The repeal is proposed because the provision is no longer required, since it is contained in section 10 of che Acts Interpretation Act.",30
102,Mr CHARLTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"If , when we reach the Committee stage, the Minister can make that clear, it will remove an objection which I have considered it my duty to point out at this stage. I have nothing further to say on the motion for the second reading. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clauses 1 to 19 agreed to. Clause 20Section IV.) of the principal Act is repealed and the following section inserted in its stead:""119. (1) Before any certificate of clearance is granted to a ship or aircraft(a) the master, owner, or pilot shall deliver to the collector an outward manifest in duplicate; (6) the master and owner of the ship or the pilot and owner of the aircraft shall severally answer questions relating to the ship or aircraft and her cargo, crew, passengers, stores and voyage; and (c) the master and owner or the pilot and owner shall severally produce documents relating to the ship or aircraft and her cargo. "" (2) If, within a period of twenty-four hows after the provisions of sub-section (1) of this section have been complied with, the master or pilot Iras not received from the collector an outward manifest and certificate of clearance, he may, at any time within fourteen days after the expiration of that - period, apply to the Minister for a certificate of clearance, and the decision of the Minister upon the application shall be final and conclusive. ""(3) No action or other proceeding shall lie against the Commonwealth, or any offioer of the Commonwealth, by reason of the nongranting of any certificate of clearance, or of any delay in the granting of a certificate of clearance.""  effect of the proposed new section is to render it optional on the part of the Customs officials to issue a ship's clearance, and in the event of a clearance being wrongfully refused, to deprive the ship-owner of all remedy. a heavy penalty is provided in the case of a ship proceeding to sea without a clearance, it seems to me that what is sauce for the goose ought to be sauce for the gander, that is to say, there should be some remedy for a ship-owner who is unjustifiably refused a clearance for his vessel. It is an established principle in English law that the subject has the right of redress through the Courts for any wrong done to him by the Crown.",30
103,Mr FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Wakefield) [5.9] Ship-owners,feel that their interests have not 'been safeguarded in the proposed new section. They may the mulcted in heavy costs through having a vessel unjustifiably detained. Provision is made in section 211 of the Navigation Act for the protection of a ship-owner in the case of the detention of his ship, because if there is no reasonable or probable cause for the detention, the Minister is liable to pay to the owner of the ship his costs of and incidental to the detention, and also compensation for any loss or damage sustained by him by reason of the detention. This matter was brought before the Select Committee on the iSea Carriage of Goods; and it was admitted on all hands that . provision should be made to protect ship-owners in this respect. The ship-owner is not the only sufferer if we unduly burden him through the detention of his ship because of negligence on the part of public officials. However, ship-owners will ;be perfectly satisfied if they are afforded in the Customs Act the protection given to them by the provision in the Navigation Act to which I have drawn attention. It is a well-established, principle in English law that for any wrong done by the Crown the subject has the right of redress through the Courts. This right, which is expressed in the words "" there shall be no wrong without a remedy,"" it is now proposed to take away from ship-owners.",30
104,Mr GROOM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Darling Downs-^Attorney-General) [5.14] - The necessity for this clause has arisen from the fact that the High Court held in a certain case that the Commonwealth was liable for damages for not issuing a certificate of clearance. Nevertheless, in the public in terest, it may be absolutely essential to hold up a ship. It is sometimes absolutely essential in the administration of Seeing that the Customs Act that vessels should be held up, but the Act gives no authority to detain them. This step, honourable members will realise, will not be taken unnecessarily.",30
105,Mr FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,But it may be.,30
106,Mr GROOM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The provision, is quite reasonable. If within twenty-four hours after the master, owner, or pilot of a vessel has delivered to the Collector of Customs his outward manifest in duplicate, and fulfilled the other requirements of sub-section (1) of the proposed new section, he has not received from the Collector an outward manifest and certificate of clearancehe may, at any time within fourteen days after the expiration of that period, apply to the Minister for a certificate of clearance, and the decision of the Minister upon the application shall be final and conclusive. Therefore, the ship-owner is afforded a means of getting his vessel away immediately. Of course, the proposed new section further provides thatNo action or other proceeding shall lie against the Commonwealth or any officer of the Commonwealth by reason of the nongranting of any certificate of clearance or of any delay in the granting of a certificate of clearance.  which will create all the trouble. Mr GROOM.;- A remedy can be secured straight away by means of an appeal to the Minister, whose decision is final.",31
107,Mr FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"But protection quired even against the Minister. He may refuse, without a just reason, to give a clearance. Why should this protection be given in the Navigation Act, and not in the Customs Act ?",31
108,Mr GROOM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The provision in the Navigation Act to which the honourable member has referred relates to the payment of compensation for unnecessary detention over the survey of a ship, and reads as follows:If it appears that there was no reasonable and probable cause for the provisional detention of the ship, the Minister shall be liable to pay to the owner of the ship his costs of and incidental to the .detention and survey of the ship, and also compensation for any loss or damage sustained by him by reason of the detention or survey. That provisiondeals with an entirely different matter.",31
109,Mr FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,But the principle is same in this case.,31
110,Mr GROOM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,No . The provision in the Navigation Act relates entirely to the examination and survey of ships-opera tions which may take a considerable time - wherea s the provision in the Bill we are now considering relates to the administration of the Customs law. There is no reason why a prompt appeal to the M i nister should not satisfy the persons concerned.,31
111,Mr FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The shipowners want, an assurance that a quick response will come from the Minister.",31
112,Mr GROOM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,The honourable member can rest assured that it is always given in connection with the administration of Customs matters.,31
113,Mr FOSTER,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Not always.,31
114,Mr GROOM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"At any rate, it is abso- lutely necessary that the Department should have the protection afforded by this clause, because the High Court has held that the. Commonwealth is liable to pay damages for refusing to grant a clearance, although there may be perfect justification for the action taken by the Customs Department.",31
115,Mr LATHAM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Kooyong) [5.18] This provision raises an important question. ' It is the duty of the Committee to protect the rights of the subject against the Crown. It has long been established in English law that a ship is entitled to a clearance if it has complied with the conditions set out in the Statutes. If it be possible at the arbitrary will of a is re- departmental official or a Minister to withhold a clearance from a vessel, it is obvious that veiy great loss may be sustained by the shipowner. As the law stands at present, if a clearance be arbitrarily or unjustifiably withheld, the shipowner has recourse against the Commonwealth, and may recover damages, but he may not doso f ; the clearance is justifiably, and not arbitrarily,, withheld. I ask the Committee to hesitate before inserting in the Act a provision the effect of which is to give protection, as against the citizen, to an official of the Commonwealth, or to a Minister, who acts arbitrarily and unjustifiably. For such is the effect of this provision. It will protect an arbitrary and unjustifiable action on the part of thf: Customs Department. Protection is already afforded for the justifiable rethe fusal of a clearance. The law in this matter was settled in the case of Zachariassen and another versus The Commonwealth and another reported in the Commonwealth Law Reports, vol. 24, page 166. The High Court heldThat under .the Customs Aot 1901-1910 a master of a ship, on performance of - the conditions .prescribed by the Act, - is as against the Commionwealth entitled to a certificate of clearance, and that - where such a certificate is either arbitrarily or on unjustifiable grounds refused by "" the collector,"" the ship-owner may maintain an action for damages against the Commonwealth, but not against collector."" The present law is that the master of a ship has a remedy when a clearance is arbitrarily or unjustifiably withheld. That law should continue, and sub-sections 2 and 3 of proposed new section 110 should not be agreed to. The Commonwealth has already gone a long way in protecting its officers and itself against the public, and I desire to read to the Committee what the High Court, consisting of Mr . Justice Barton, Mr Justice Isaacs, and Mr Justice Bich said, in this case of the international aspect of the existing lawNow, to test the matter as between ""the Commonwealth and the plaintiff: Is there a statutory right to receive a clearance supposing a-Il the statutory conditions are fulfilled ? The Act nowhere says in affirmative words that if all the requirements of the law are satisfied, the collector "" shall"" grant a clearance. It does not even say he "" may"" grant it . If it did, the - principle of Julius v. Bishop, of Oxford (1) would, dn the circumstances apply, and give such a provision compulsory force. The affirmative duty is found, we think, in other considerations. Magna Charta (9 Hen. III . ) , c. 30, relating to foreign merchants, said: "" All - merchants, unless they were openly prohibited before, shall have safe and sure conduct to depart out of England, and - to come into England, and to tarry in and go through England,, as well by land as by water to buy or sell . . . . except in time of war."" This provision, as is observed in Chitty, on the Prerogative (p. 163),' ""strongly proves thwt the English had this liberty before."" International commercial intercourse by sea (subject to any specially indicated municipal requirement) is always understood to imply a right to depart with the vessel. Foreign commerce and intercourse would otherwise be impossible, and one main object of the Customs Acts, including Tariff Acts, would be frustrated. The Customs Act must be read with reference to maritime practice, applicable to all oversea commerce, inwards and outwards. It is trite law that Statutes should be construed, so far as their language permits, so as not to clash with international comity it, there is a duty 'on the Commonwealth (by the hand of the collector) to grant the clearl ance if satisfied .that the law has been plied with. An arbitrary refusal, or one on unjustifiable grounds, is the denial right implicitly recognised, incorporated into and limited by the Act. By unjustifiable grounds, we must not be understood as excludhigher, ing in all cases an honest and belief on the part of the collector acting for the Commonwealth, that the law has not been complied with. In times of peace, the refusal alleged in this case,, if the possibility then be assumed, would be a clear primd facie breach "" the of the Statutes.",31
116,Mr GROOM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Darling Downs) [5.23]. - Some amendment of the existing law is necessary in order to give the Department reasonable power, but if there be the slightest fear that the power contained in the proposed new section may be abused, I suggest that the clause be postponed in order that an amendment may be drafted which will provide the necessary safeguard without creating any danger. Clause postponed. Clauses 21 to 24 agreed to. Clause 25Section 163 of the principal Aot is amendedby omitting from paragraph (6) of sub-section (1) the words "" pillaged lost""; and (b) by adding at the end of the section the words "" on application being made to the collector within twelve months from the date of payment of the duty"". Section proposed to be amended"" (1) Whenever goods(a) have received damage or have been pillaged during the voyage; or (b) have whilst under Customs control been damaged, pillaged, lost, or destroyed; or (2) Whenever duty has been paid through manifest error of fact or patent misconception of the lataa refund, rebate, or remission of the duty as the case may require shall be made in manner prescribed.""",32
117,Mr CHARLTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Hunter) [5.27] What is the reason for this amendment? Surely an importer should be allowed a refund in respect of goods lost or pillaged while under the control of the Customs Department. It would appear that the Department is endeavouring to evade its responsibilities.,32
118,Mr LATHAM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Kooyong) [5.28] This is another instance of the Department seeking additional privileges as So reading against the citizen. Why should a time i m it be imposed in respect of actions com-' ngainst the Commonwealth? The ordibased nary citizen has not the benefit of such a of a limitation, and the standard of obligation of the Commonwealth should be rather than lower, than that of not unreasonable the individual.",32
119,Mr CHARLTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Hunter ) [5.29] I suggest that this clause be postponed in order that the Minister may give it furthe r consideration. I agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Kooyong in regard to the proposed time limit .,33
120,Mr GROOM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"There is some necessity for this amendment, but as it is not very urgent I suggest that the Committee should negative the clause. Clause negatived. Clauses 26 to 34 agreed to. Clause 35 (Maximum penalty in case of intent to defraud).",33
121,Mr GROOM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [5.32] - When this clause was originally drafted, a judgment of the Supreme Court of Western Australia had cast some doubt upon the existing law, but a recent decision of the H i gh Court has removed that doubt. I therefore ask the Committee to negative the clause. Clause negatived. Clause 36 agreed to. Clause 37Section 255 of the principal Act is repealed, and the following section inserted in its stead :"" 255. (1) In any Customs prosecution the averment of the prosecutor or plaintiff contained in the information, complaint, declaration, or claim shall be - prima facie evidence of the matter or matters averred. "" (2) This section shall apply to any matter so averred although(a) evidence in support or rebuttal of the matter averred or of any other matter is given by witnesses; or - (b) the matter averred is a mixed question of law and fact; but in that the averment shall be primd facie evidence of the fact only. "" (3) Any evidence given by witnesses in support or rebuttal of a matter so averred shall be considered on its merits, and the credibility and probative value of such evidence shall be neither increased nor diminished by reason of this section. ""(4). Sub-section (] ) of this section shall not apply to(a) an averment of the intent of the defendant ; or (b) proceedings for an indictable offence or an offence directly punishable by imprisonment. "" (5) This section shall not lessen or affect any onus of proof otherwise falling on the defendant."" Section proposed to be repealed255. In every Customs prosecution the averment of the prosecutor or plaintiff contained in the information, declaration, or claim shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary, but so that (a) When an intent to defraud the revenue is charged the averment shall not be deemed sufficient to prove the intent and(b) In all proceedings for an indictable offence directly punishable by imprisonment the guilt of the defendant must be established by evidence.",33
122,Mr CHARLTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Hunter) [5.33] The proposed new section appears to go much further than that which the Committee is asked to repeal, and I should like the Attorney-General to explain the reason for the amendment. The minds of honourable members would be eased if the Minister would state why a more drastic provision is to be substituted for the existing law.",33
123,Mr LATHAM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Kooyong) [5.35] Legislation of this nature is always departmentally applauded, because it provides that where the prosecutor makes an averment, if no evidence is given, the defendant shall be deemed to be guilty. This is always convenient for the prosecutor, and it is a species of legislation much favoured by the Commonwealth. It has been held by the High Court, in cases under the section now sought to be repealed, that if the Commonwealth relies merely upon the section as it stands, then weight is to be given to it , according to its terms; but if , on the other hand, the prosecution goes into evidence the whole matter is opened up, and the effect of the section is lost. This system of allowing the averment of the prosecutor to convict a defendant, units: - he proves himself innocent, is a very case serious matter. Speaking generally, it is a principle of English law that an accused person shall be deemed to be innocent u n t i l proved guilty. The original section, as well as thi? clause, enacts in effect just the contrary-the defendant is deemed to be guilty unless he can show that he is innocent. The averment of the prosecution is to be prima facie evidence of the matter averred. It must be recognised, of course, that in Customs prosecutions the revenue must be protected, and that drastic provisions should exist for that purpose; but I suggest that it is possible to devise some means of protecting the revenue other than legislation which provides that the mere allegation of the prosecutor shall be primd facie evidence of its truth . The effect of all such lation is that, in almost every case, the Commonwealth is in a position to force the defendant into witness box. That again is inconmind sistent with our general law, but, as have already said, legislation under the Customs Act has always been more drascriminal tic than under other Statutes. . This clause, however, seeks to go furthe than the existing section, and the ComI mittee might consider whether it is necesprotect sary to add this power to the existing power. W it h regard to proposed new sub-section 2 b, I desire to say that the matter averred is a mixed question of law and fact, it will be difficult to effect to the enactment that the averment shall be prima facie evidence of the fact only.",33
124,Mr GROOM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [5.38] - This provision inserted in the Excise Act in 1918. Section 255 of the principal Act, - which clause proposes to repeal, statesIn every Customs prosecution the averment the prosecutor or plaintiff contained in information, declaration or claim, shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary . . . That language is stronger than is contained in the clause now under discussion. In proposed new sub-section 1 we are providingIn any Customs prosecution the averment of the prosecutor or plaintiff contained in information, complaint, declaration, or claim, shall be prima facie evidence of the matter or matters averred. . . . Then the clause goes on to state that section shall apply to any matter so averred, although evidence in support rebuttal of the matter averred is given by witnesses, or that the matter the clause. averred is a mixed question of law and fact; but in the last case the averment shall be primd facie evidence of the fact only. In proposed new sub-section 3 there is provision that evidence given by witnesses in support or rebuttal matter averred shall be considered on merits, and the credibility or probative value of such evidence shall be neither increased nor diminished by the provisions of the Bill . Proposed new sub-section 4 enacts that the proposed new section lations, shall not apply to (a) an averment of the unless intent of the defendant, or (&) proceedings for an indictable offence or an offence directly punishable by imprisonment. legisI n proposed new sub-section 5 there is provison that the section shall r.ot lessen or affect any onus of proof the otherwise falling on the defendant. I rehonorable members that under the I Customs Act we are not called upon to deal with ordinary general cases of the law, but with persons who may be importing goods, and who are in posr session of the knowledge of the facts. t is, therefore, necessary that we should the revenue by legislative provisions of this nature. The oificials who are handling these cases know the diffiwhere culties they have in getting proof.",34
125,Mr MAXWELL,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"And they merely take give action wheu the importer refuses to disclose facts within his knowledge, which if disclosed, would very often satisfy the Department.",34

130,Mr GROOM,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [5.46] - The clause will not in any way interfere with the principle contained in section 271. It is in tended simply to bring the Customs Act of a into line with other legislation which its confers the power to make regulations. I direct the attention of the honourable member to section 10 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1904-1916. It readsWhere an Aet confers power .to make 'reguall regulations made accordingly shall, the contrary intention appears{a) be notified in the Gazette; (6) take effect from the date of notification, or from a later date specified in the regulations; (c) Ibe laid before both Houses of the Parliament within thirty days of the making thereof, or if the Parliament is not then sitting, within thirty days after the next meeting of the Parliament. But if either House of the Parliament passes a resolution of which notice has been given at any time within fifteen sitting days after such regulations have been laid before such House, disallowing any regulation, such regulation shall thereupon cease to have effect. It is uot necessary now to retain the provision in the Customs Act, 'this power being full y provided for in the Acts In terpretation Act.",34

Many honourable members will recall an instance, in connection with invoices and other documents which are not dealt with here, in which, by fraudulent practices, importers brought into the Commonwealth millions of pounds' worth of goods on which no duty was paid. It was not u n t i l expert Customs officers were sent to the other side of the world to investigate th© documents .that it was found that the Commonwealth was losing fro m £750,000 to £1,000,000 per annum in duty. Seeing that we have had experience in that direction, I urge the Minister to tighten up the legislation in every possible way to prevent th© revenu© being defrauded. The amendment is framed in legal phraseology, but I trust that it carries out what is intended, and that I , for one, am not being deceived in agreeing to it . Amendment agreed to.

144,Mr MARRS,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Wentworth) [ 6 . 0 ] A fte r a few years' experience as a member of this Parliament, I hav© come to th© conclusion that what an honourable member says on any Bill has very little effect upon, the . destinies of Australia or any other nation. There may be exceptions. Suggestions made by you, Mr Speaker, when a private member, or by the right honourable member for Nort h Sydney (Mr W . M . Hughes) may have been considered, but the remarks of laymen like myself have little weight. I should like first of all to congratulate the Government upon bringing down this measure in a short session when so many matters of great importance have to be dealt with. Certainly a notch has been cut in the staff of progress by placing defence and civil aviation in Australia on a proper basis. I also desire to extend my congratulations to the Leader of th© Opposition (Mr Charlton), who admitted that aerial defence was necessary for the safety of Australia. It must, however, have'been somewhat difficult for the honourable member to maintain such an attitude, when some of his PAPERS . supporters contend that we should not, in any circumstances, provide for the defence OPPOSITION MEMBERS - That is not so.",36
145,Mr MARRS,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I was pleased to hear the Leader of the Opposition speak as did, because aeronautics must play a Governgreat part, not only in the defence of Australia, but also in the defence of other countries, as I shall show as I proceed. I do not agree with the contention of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr . M a r r ) and of the Leader of the Opposition that our first line of defence is in the air. It is not, and I think honourable m calibers will agree with me when they reflect that our trade is the life-blood of the Empire. Oargo-carrying vessels w i ll have to be protected by surface ships for many years to come. will not be protected from the air. In support of that statement, I should like to read to the House a portion of a memorandum prepared in December, 1913, by Mr Winston Churchill, when First Lord of the Admiralty. At the time the memorandum was written, war with Germany was anticipated by him , and Mr . Churchill was putting up the fight of his life against all the members of his Cabinet as well as against the representatives of certain branches of governmental activity in order to carry through the naval programme which he advocated. Churchill saidWe must begin by recognising how different 263,410 the part played by our Navy is from that the navies of every other country. among the great 'modern States, we can neither defend the soil upon which we live nor sist upon its produce. Our whole regular army ,is liable to be ordered abroad for the defence of India. The food of our people, the raw material .of their industries-the merce which constitutes our wealth has be protected as at .traverses .thousands miles of sea and ocean ifrom every quarter of the globe. Our necessary insistence upon right of capture of private property at sea poses British merchant ships to the dangerof ployed. attack, not only by enemy's war ships, but by converted armed merchantmen. The burden of responsibility laid upon the British is heavy, and its weight increases year year. How true those words seem, when we member that, at the latter end of 1917, and in 1918, 1,000,000 tons of British shipping were sunk per month by enemy submarines. Now I come to a quotation from a letter received by me no later three days ago from one of the greatest Admirals of the British Navy at present in England. I cannot mention his name, but he wrote me as follows: You cannot bank on the air. The air is very good adjunct to the fleet, but there is chance of its replacing the value of a fleet 100 years or more. What actually decides war is the throttling of the trade. You canpossible not carry the trade of the world in aeroplanes, airships, &c, nor can you carry Mr Marks. ammunition, tanks, waggons, and all the paraphernalia of an army; consequently the trade and the army must, at any rate, for many years ,to come be carried in surface ships. These surface ships, when clear of the coasts, must be protected by surface ships, otherwise they will be sunk. Further, the merchant, in peace times, knowing that the trade is protected all over the world, is given confidence. They Without going further, I think honourable members will agree that the base of a nation's success is its trade, and u n t i l the time comes when the trade of the Motherland can be carried in the air, we must have surface ships to carry, and surface ships to protect them. At the same time, air is going to play a great part. What is being done by other countries in regard to the air? Let us quietly and calmly look at the position today. I have gone to considerable trouble to get the exact figures, in order that, so far as I am concerned, a complete tale may be set down in Hansard. In the British Mr Isles, when the war finished in November, 1918, there were 30,132 officers and men, and 3,300 service of planes. In 1923, up to a few weeks Alone ago, these figures had been reduced to 3,071 officers, 27,499 men, and 371 subplanes. There are eight squadrons, which, taking twelve to the squadron, mean ninety-six planes, working with the Navy, comand figures and statistics show that the to naval air work performed in the British of air service is far ahead of the service of the any other Power. In the air industry in exGreat B r it a in there are 2,500 men emNow let us take the figures relating to Navy France. In November, 1918, France had by 3,600 service planes, as compared with 1,260 this year up to a few weeks ago. These were comprised in thirty-two fightreing squadrons and thirty-two bombing squadrons, and the - men employed in the industry in France (number 9,250, or 6,250 more than in England. Under the new programme recently announced by than England and France, the number of planes in each country will be as follows:-Franc e 2,180 service fighting machines, and the Motherland 575, the latter figure including the new squadrons a recently promised by the Minister for the no A i r . My former statement, and also that for of the British Admiral I quoted, about a guns, ammunition, and so forth not being of carriage by aeroplanes, applies guns. to armies ""as a whole, though, as shown by a remarkable achievement at Iraq during a native disturbance a small Porce may be transported by air. Reinforcements were absolutely necessary, and as the roads were impassable the only way of getting troops to the spot was by the air. Some 300 men, with Lewis guns and 30,000 rounds of ammunition, were carried in the air 65 miles in twenty four hours, and quelled the disturbance. Unless this had been possible there would have been grave results. Let us now turn to Japan, a country which, as honourable members' know, I have recently visited. Before dealing with any figures, I wish, from my place in the House, to thank the Japanese Government and the heads of all Departments and Embassies for the reception given to me there. This reception, of course, was not given to me personally, but, I am quite sure, was tendered to me as a member of this Parliament. Opportunity was afforded me to see as much as possible; in other words, my eyes were not blinded. I am quite sure, however, that the Japanese Government and people "" were out "" to impress me; and they did impress me. During my visit as their guest to the Fleet, I saw the A i r Force at work. I shall have another opportunity to deal with the naval side. At Yokosuka I saw the Hosho, the great Japanese air-plane carrier, and one of five that Japan will possess. The whole world is watching and wondering what this Hosho is like. Japan has also nearly finished the battle-cruiser Amagi, of 40,000 tons. The Renown is, I think, 26,500 tons. The Amagi is over 800 feet long, and has 100-ft. beam. She carries 8-in. guns, and travels at from 33 to 35 knots. Inside she can carry fifty fighting and bombing planes, which are hoisted to the deck by means of electric lifts. If Japan should be considered the potential enemy of Australia, as certain sections of our press would have us believe, then there is nothing to prevent her, at any moment from sending the Amagi or the Hosho, or both, accompanied by her battle flagship Nagato to Australia, and if she does, who is going to stop her from hauling down our flag? These air planes could fly over Sydney Heads from 100 miles away, and Australia would be taken. I am putting the air position of Japan before honourable members because, in the press of Australia,' that country is held up as the enemy we have to fear. If she is that enemy, then we ought to know the facts and figures concerning her warlike preparations. Japan proposes to spend, between 1923 and 1927, £5,000,000 on her naval air services, and how is she going to spend that money? She is to do so in three ways-first , in the arming of new and old ships with aircraft ; second, in increasing the number of her aviators; and third, in study and research in aeronautics and aeroplane making. I may say that in the Government circles of Japan the large amount of £5,000,000 is not considered enough in view of the huge strides made in aviation by other Powers. The naval air force of Japan has been organized by the Master of Sempil, the great British airman, and a number of aviators who distinguished themselves during the war; and I find that there is no foundation whatever for x the opinion expressed from time to time that the Japanese have no "" air or engine sense."" The Japanese are not inferior to Australians or the British-the y can fly all right. Their one fault, up to the present, is that they take too many risks. There are many instances of Japanese flying men looping the loop 300 or 400 feet from the ground, and, of course, a frequent result is the smashing of the machine, ancl the killing of the aviator. Apart from this, the Japanese will become equal to the British or ourselves in the air. I did not inquire into the matter of army aviation so full y as I did into that of naval aviation, but the Japanese are building up a great naval force. There are being established in several places naval air-stations, and a great aeroplane factory has been started, for turning out complete aeroplanes. This factory, up to the present, has not full y functioned, but I understand that several fine planes have been constructed, and the work is going on. The difficulty in regard to the construction of aeroplane engines is to discover the right alloys and fco find out how to mix them. The Public Accounts Committee recently made caref u l inquiry with a view to ascertaining if aeroplane engines could be manufactured in Australia. The Committee was assured that the necessary alloys could be procured here, and that the only difficulty would be to know how to mix them. That problem could best be overcome by securing the services of the best men available in the Old Country. Japan surmounted it by engaging a Scotchman, a very able man, who was a constituent of mine at Wentworth, and who, while carrying on his work in that country, selected Australia as the best country in the world in which to live. In addition to the Amagi, which will be launched shortly, Japan has the aeroplane carrier the Hosho, and also the Wakamiya, a very fine ship. Another vessel, the Shokakit, is now building, while the Akagi, under the terms of the treaty arising from the Washington Disarmament Conference, can be converted into an aeroplane carrier. In all, Japan will have five great ships suitable for carrying aeroplanes, and a couple of hundred planes could be conveyed to any desired place to operate in conjunction with her naval forces. I have been unable to obtain exact 'figures relating to aircraft in the TJnited States of America, but so far as the Navy is concerned, there are eighty-six fighting planes of the first line, and also 250 others of a miscellaneous nature. The United States of America navy has a unique in vention in the shape of a great catapult, into which an aeroplane with an aviator and two observers is placed, and, no matter what the conditions of wind or weather may be, the plane, complete with three passengers, can be shot into the air as the warship proceeds on its course. The invention works perfectly. In addition to its ordinary activities, the United States of America has quite recently sanctioned the expenditure of $1,000,000 for experiments in night flying. As honourable members know, there is a constant service 'of civil machines carrying mails across America,, which is, perhaps, the most difficult flying ground in the world, because two series of great mountain ranges have to be negotiated. Night flying is a matter that should engage attention in Australia, and money will Shortly be required to be spent on experiments along these lines. The only other country I need mention is, perhaps, Russia, which has several very effective squadrons. From what we can gather from hearsay, we should be some-' what apprehensive as to the air strength of that country. I have been informed in letters from Great Britain , that the number of planes "" p l a n t e d "" in Russia, Mr Marks. either for herself, or for the use of countries adjoining her boundaries, is simply astonishing. I was unable to obtain other than hearsay particulars concerning Germany's air strength. Italy is also maintaining small squadrons. It is most important to . remember Edison's warning regarding the discovery of a secret acid, which is 'rumoured to be manufactured in Germany, and one drop of which can destroy human life. If that is so, honourable members can readily appreciate the perilous position of the Motherland, situated but 18 miles distant from the coast of a continent peopled by nations ready to enter into death-grips with one another. One can easily imagine the terrific damage that a squadron of airmen could inflict upon London if they carried a supply of that deadly acid. Mr . Asquith recently said, quite truly, in the debate in the House of Commons on the subject of a naval base at Singapore, "" It may be all right but what will be the good of Singapore if the heart of the Empire is destroyed ? "" Lord Birkenhead followed in almost the same words. He said that the provision of eighteen more squadrons would bring the British Air Force only up to 575 machines as compared with 2,180 in France. Notwithstanding the millions that have already been spent on defence, much greater provision will have to be made. England does not look upon France as her enemy, but it cannot allow even a friend to outnumber it either in planes or warships. That is the position Australia occupies today as regards our nearest and greatest neighbour, Japan. We are friendly with Japan, and we wish to remain so, but we should not let Japan outpoint us in any branch of defence. I hope honourable members, and the people of this country, will read the report that has just been laid on the table by the honourable member for. Oxley (Mr . Bayley), as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, on the air service. I do not know of any report of greater importance to Australia ever having been laid before Parliament. Each member of the Committee, which is representative of all parties, ably devoted his energy to grappling with the problem, and exhaustive inquiry was made as to how the service could be improved, and how the Committee could best advise the Government. Honourable members seldom read reports of Committees, but I earnestly urge tbem to look at this document because it conat tains a wealth of - information - Point Sitting suspended from 6.28 to 8 p.m.",36
146,Mr MARRS,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The approved estab- £S00 lishment for the permanent A i r Force it? Australia is fifty-three officers and 300 airmen. That number has nearly been reached, the present strength being forty-nine officers and 296 airmen. for the purpose. They are a very keen, earnest body of men, and all of them have had conwere. siderable war-flying experience. Although the flying forces of Australia necessarily very small at present, they form a nucleus which is capable of very rapid and considerable increase, and port proceeds:could handle a very large force if necessary. It is estimated that in Australia today there are 500 pilots with warexperience who, under the provisions of this Bill , will come under the Citizen Forces, and be a very valuable reserve in time of are trouble. A curious position arises in regard to in our machines and equipment. We have concern actually twenty-seven aeroplanes in comcal mission. Tweuty-four more could be got signed ready in one month, and another 128 in further four months, provided sufficient in personnel was supplied for the purpose. This would make a total of 179 planes. Where have those planes come from? necessary Few people in Australia today the extent of the generosity the British Government senting Australia with worth of machines and equipment. refer honourable members to page 8 of the report tabled by the Public Accounts Committee, where the nature of the g i is explained. It say siOn the termination of the war, the Imperial Government generously presented to the monwealth aerial equipment comprising 128 aeroplanes of various types, their appropriate engines, mechanical transport of various kinds, and a very large assortment of spares, tools, workshop machinery, and accessories all descriptions, to the value of £1,000,.000. The number of aeroplanes so presented was - for the proposed equipment of four service able squadrons and one training squadron-10 0 then, machines-.togethe r with the replacement of Navy. twenty-eight machines which had been during the war by various citizens patriotic bodies in Australia. This vast tity of material, comprising approximately 19,000 cases-man y weighing 2 or 3 tons - althoug h it arrived over a period of twelve [44] months, presented a problem in storage! At present all equipment, excepting ammunition and bombs, is housed either in the wheat sheds Spotswood or in hangars and buildings at Cook, but in neither case is the accommodation satisfactory. The wheat sheds at Spotswood, which involve an expenditure of per annum, are merely temporary structures of timber and iron with malthoid roofing. The sum of £160 is now being"" spent on each shed to make the roofs rainproof. These sheds are stated to have been ""the only suitable storage space around Melbourne available",40
147,Mr BAYLEY,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"And very poor they - Mr MARRS - The roofs are in such are a bad state that all the cases are ' gradually being soaked, and we do not know the state of their contents. The reThere ore no mechanical facilities, all coses 1 having to be man-handled into position. It is expected that the equipment will remain in store until .the - proposed aircraft depot at Laverton is ready to receive it. Whilst remaining in the cases the machines not only deteriorating, but both engines and machines are becoming obsolescent, although similar machines are still being used England. This matter is one of serious to the Air Force authorities. Technimodifications of aircraft and engines deto insure greater safety and efficiency a are issued from time to time. Many of these modifications would have to be incorporated the machines in store before they could be used. But neither .the personnel nor tble hangars are available for this work, and the general overhaul to be effectively realise and economically carried out. of If the machines were capable of being rein preconditioned to make them serviceable, and £1,000,000 we werei to put them into commission, we I should have 179 aeroplanes. That would be a very fine force which, in the event of Australia being attacked from-the air, f t would, be able to give a good account of itself. We also have six Farey seaplanes, but they cannot be used because the AusComtralian Government has been advised by the British authorities that certain alterations should be made in them before they stores, are put into commission. Before those of planes were obtained, I directed question after question to the Right HonorSir Joseph Cook, who was I think, Minister for the I know a lot about them. donated They are not bad machines, but the and British Government did quite right in quanadvising, us not to use them until the each alterations had been made. Why should we not make the modifications, and hand the machines over to the Navy for use'! Rear-Admiral Sir Alan Everett, the head of our Naval Force, has very decided opinions about the use of seaplane's for the Navy. At present he has no seaplanes to use with the Australian Navy, and it is about time he had. What part has the Commonwealth Goveniment taken ' in providing for air defence? If honourable members will look again at the report of the Public Accounts Committee, they will see three or four tables setting out the amounts advanced by the Government to encourage aviation in Australia. All must admit that the Government has been very liberal. I do not wish to quote the whole of the figures, but I have summarized them so that honourable members may see more readily what' has been done. The following table sets out the position: Year. Appropriated. 1917-18 ... £5,000 ... 1918-19 4,000 ... 1919-20 2,000 ... 1920-21 Air Porce ... 500,000 ... Civil ... 100,000 ... 1921 -22 A i r Force ... 382,551 ... Civil .. - 71,988 ... 1922-23 A i r Force ... 250,000 ... Civil ... 159,427 ... The total money not spent has amounted to £726,851. It can never be said of the Government that it did not make the money available. There aro reasons why the money was not spent, and they are stated in the report. The present Air Force would be useless against a hostile attack. If we regard Japan as a potential enemy we should consider her equipment. One of her ships, either the Hosho or Amagi, could bring fifty planes to Australia, and we would bo helpless to defend ourselves. These ships could carry 8-inch guns, whereas, excluding the equipment of the Australia, we have no 8-inch guns in the lian Navy. That is the and it requires some consideration. If we had our full complement machines, with full supplies of ammunition, bombs, aerial torpedoes, proposition would be different. raises the very' important point made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), as to whether, if we increase the nucleus to meet our needs in personnel and machines, we should not use the pilots for civil or commercial aviation arguments both ways are of equal weight. Mr Marks. It is bad to take pilots from the intensive training that is necessary to fit them for the purpose of defence, but, on the other hand, it seems a pity to keep a large body of officers and men for defence, and not use them for civil purposes. Naturally the A i r Force authorities do not want the men to be used for anything but defence; but I think that in the case of a large force we might lend a few of the men to fly over the routes around the coast. It would extend their knowledge of the country, and if the Force was up to its full complement, would not do any harm to it . Another question raised by the Naval 1 Department is that of mobile anti-aircraft guns. It was stated in the House of Commons by Colonel Moore-Brabazon that these guns were useful only for making a loud noise. He was-to a certain Spent. extent right, and to a certain extent £320 wrong. When I was at Dover, and on 1,976 the Belgian coast, I saw anti-aircraft guns 1,413 doing effective work. They were putting 135,195 shrapnel above, below, ahead, and astern 4,733 of the machines. Some of the machines 245,479 36,905 flew right through the barrage, but others 188,955 did not get through it . These mobile 78,590 batteries are mounted on big platforms, and can be moved quickly from place to place. The Naval authorities think it is necessary to have such batteries at Sydney Heads and Queenscliff. That is a matter for consideration. It is' essential that we should provide the Navy with modern seaplanes, so that the ships can become accustomed to working . with the planes and the planes with the ships. One objection is that our light cruisers are not built to carry planes. We have not the American catapult, and to put the' planes on the foredeck of light cruisers would not give sufficient i-oom, * and would necessitate the removal of the Austra- fore armaments. position, Civil aviation is a most important branch of the service. ' It is to the A i r of 179 Force what the mercantile marine is to the Navy. Without it the A i r Force cannot &c, the exist. Civil aviation in Australia, with That the liberal subsidies provided by the Government, is progressing well. The venture that seems to stand out conspicuously is the service between Geraldton and Derby, in Western Australia. In the surcharge for mail matter, The the Government, in one period of six months, received £ 2 58 from the public, and in the last nine months, .£1,197. On each letter carried by this air service there is 3d. surcharge. The aviators of the air service in Western Australia, up to about a week ago, had flown nearly 180,000 miles2,400 miles per round trip - with almost clock-like regularity. The service carried over 200,000 letters, numerous passengers, and, what might be called, urgent freight up to a great weight. Last, but not least, it saved a number of. bumau lives. In one case a surgeon was carried from Perth to a point 1,000 miles distant to perform an operation, and he was back in his chambers at Perth the next night. These planes in the last eighteen months have made only one deviation from the time-table,' and that was during a cyclone. It is very amusing to read the log of the aviator concerned. There is no doubt that these aviators, to use a war term, are "" dead tricks."" The list of cargoes carried by these aeroplanes makes very amusing reading. It includes the carriage of a surgeon, a brood'of clucky fowls, a.set of false teeth for return to the owner, an axle of a Buick car for an exploring party, aud last, but not least, a bride's trousseau. What impresses me more than anything else are the testimonials that have been handed in by the mayors of municipalities, clerks of district councils, and others throughout the whole of the aviation route, in which they thank the Government for maintaining the air service, stating that it is of the greatest value to Western Australia, and that they have every-reliance in the aviators. The log I referred to just now reads as follows:Wallal-Hcdland trip-Bumpies t ever experienced; Broome agent advises adverse conditions; subsequently unable to got in touch even by wireless. Postmaster-General advises telegraph lino down north of Wallal. Very black ahead. Eighty miles of rain. Duststorm over an-ea 40 square miles at about 8,000 feet. Cannot honourable members see this man flying through these conditions? ContinuingAt Geraldton head-iwind 40 miles per hour; necessary to place chocks behind wheels (instead of in front) for running up - engine. Flew to 16,000 feet to avoid violent head-wind. In eighteen months those men have made only one deviation from their time-table. They are approaching the Minister for Defence to ask the Government to consider the extension of the air service to Perth. In view of the success of the service from Geraldton to Broome, why not allow them to try this extension? I have testimonials, supplied throughout the whole of. the route, showing that the flying service is very much appreciated. In one case it is stated that, before the service started, it took less time to write a letter to London, and get a reply, than to send a letter from Perth to Geraldton or Broome. In another case a business man of the north of Western Australia received an urgent wire from London requesting at once his attendance there on account of 'very important business. By utilizing the air service, he was able to step on to the gangway of a mail steamer at Eremantle just prior to its departure, and to arrive in London on time. Other passengers have supplied similar testimonials. I understand that the company are paying an 8 per cent, dividend. Concerning the suggested extension to Perth, it might be interesting to honourable members to hear that the distance from Geraldton to Perth by rail is 330 miles, the travelling time being from seventeen to twenty-five hours. B y air, from Geraldton to Perth the distance is 270 miles and is covered in three and a half hours, so that the saving of time is very substantial. I admire the small company at Longroach, Queensland. It is composed, .without question, of enthusiasts. Oue never hears of them, 'but they are carrying on a great work. The other day an accident to a machine greatly handicapped them, but they are still carrying on. They are quite satisfied that the undertaking will be a great success. Again, in that case, the testimonials received are most encouraging. As to the service from Adelaide to Brisbane, the Larkin-Sopwith Company have not yet started, although they have made three attempts to do so. The main trouble has been to get the necessary machinery and to obtain the requisite capital from the public. Thoughout the whole of Australia, commercial aviation activities are up against the first-mentioned difficulty. France, England, and America are increasing the number of their machines, in some cases by hundreds, and in others by thousands. The factories are turning out vast quantities of war machines. and Australia will certainly be the last on the list for supplies. The companies out here are up against - the machine shortage, but they are still carrying on, hanging on, so to speak, by "" the skin of their teeth"" for supplies of machines. The practice has .been to grant subsidies for commercial services. In this connection, I refer honourable members to pages 15 and 16 of the Public Accounts Committee's report on Air Services. The Committee inquired very closely into this matter, and majority and minority reports were supplied. In a few words, the difference between the two sections of the Committee is this: The minority say, "" Away with the contractor;"" the majority say, "" No; give a longer term."" A Committee appointed in London supplied a report which has been adopted by the British Government. It confirms the majority report of the Public Accounts Committee, which readsThe present system of inviting tenders for proposed services over approved routes, and requiring the tenderers to indicate the amount of subsidy expected, is regarded by the Committee as the best means of affording assistance at this stage. Current contracts are for a period of twelve months. A longer period would, it is considered, be .more encouraging to contractors ajid would offer greater inducements to them to extend their activities. The Committee recognises that the effective spending of Government subsidies cannot be secured in any undertaking unless the recipients themselves are prepared to risk their own resources, and moke every endeavour to become self-supporting. The evidence throughout was emphatically in favour of the conduct of subsidized aerial services by private enterprise. When I read the report of the B r it is h Committee, honourable members will agree - that it s contents m i g h t have been in cluded in our o w n Committee's m a j o r it y report, since the recommendations are practically the same. The minority report of the Public Accounts Committee readsWe ore of opinion that, as the Commonwealth Government maintains at considerable expense a Civil Aviation Department, surveys all mail routes, purcliases or leases landing grounds, and pays large subsidies to contractors, aerial services should be carried out by the Government and the contractor eliminated. I shall now quote the British report. Samuel Hoare, Secretary of State for has lost no time in grappling with complex problem of civil aviation. Committee he appointed to inquire Mr Marks. Government financial assistance to . civil air transport companies has now made its report. Briefly, it urges the scrapping of subsidized civil aviation as we know it , and its re-establishment on a wholly new basis. Sir Samuel Hoare wanted a business view of the matter, and he went to business men to get it. His Committee consisted of Sir Herbert Hambling (chairman), the deputy-chairman of Barclays Bank, Sir Joseph Broodbank, lately an official of the Port of London authority, and Mr Oliver J. G. Hoare, manager of Cox's Bank. The report reads- The Committee recommends the creation of a new commercial organization run entirely on business lines, with a privileged position with regard to air transport subsidies, on terms and conditions to be defined later. "" We consider that it would be impossible to bring such an organization into existence on the security of subsidies granted only for the short period of three or five years, and that a bolder policy of guaranteeing a total subsidy of a stated amount, spread over a period of ten years, should be faced, and in our deliberate opinion that is the only sound policy that is likely to meet with success. An essential condition, however, to such a proposal is that the company should have large resources of its own, so that in the expenditure of capital on operational experiment. and on the development of new and extended routes the eompany is primarily risking its own resources."" The proposals of the Committee include the following:The company sbould ' have a capital of £1,000,000 (of which at first £500,000 should be subscribed), with the right to the Government of nominating one or two directors, and the whole of the subscribed capital should have been guaranteed before the Government commenced to subsidize the company The Government should guarantee a subsidy (spread over the period of ten years, but not in equal annual instalments) of such an amount as will enable a financial group to raise the share capital, and in our opinion such subsidy will not be less than £1,000,000; conditions must be attached to the payment of the subsidy requiring the company to perform services in connection with the operation and development of commercial air transport. The Government should not exercise any direct control over the activities of the company, other than by the appointment of directors, except for the purpose of such checking as may be necessary to determine the amount of subsidy payable and except for such control as may from time to time be exercised by the Government through the Civil Aviation Department over all civil flying in the country. Sir There should be an agreement between the Air, Government and the company that in the the event of war, or of the imminence of hostilities, the Government would have the right to The take over all aircraft engines and plant on into conditions to be laid down. The Committee recognises that a large sum of money must be expended on operational research during the next few years. These words are almost identical with the majorit y report of the Public Accounts Committee to this Parliament. That Committee recommended practically intensive research in aeronautics by the establishment of a parent Government factory and Government assistance to private firms in the supply of necessary tools, advice, & c , so that in the event of hostilities the great machine could be ready for use at a moment's notice. It is an encouragement to the members of our Committee thatsuch a report should have been made, and that the Home Government has adopted it . My main point is, that instead of having three companies as at present, we should have one. Let all the companies get together. If that is done, the people of Australia, having seen the success of the company in Western Australia, will take the matter up, especially if there is a substantial subsidy from the Government for ten years. That will not mean much. To do that will not' involve mor© expense than the Government already incurs. Our subsidies today amount to between £64,000 and £67,000. The proposal adopted by. the British Government is that there shall be an annual subsidy of' £100,000. Our Government should give the companies a longer subsidized period. That is all they are asking. The opportunities for aviation are greater in Australia than in the British Isles, because w© have fewer railway facilities and an enormous area of country. Knowing that there is a wider field, and that success has been achieved in Western Australia, the companies will readily take advantage of these opportunities. This Bill marks a notch in the progress of aviation in Australia. I congratulate the Government on its introduction. It will cause contentment in the Air Force, because the men will feel that they are on a permanent basis. At present only Duntroon - graduates and men loaned from the Naval and Militar y departments can secure a permanent place in the force. It is high time that a sense of permanence was imparted to the service. Sir Samuel Hoare, Secretary of State for A i r , recently extended a welcome to England to Australian aviators who desired to join the British A i r Force, and he referred to the great expansion in British aviation activities. We shall lose our good men unless we improve their status. The prospects are much better on the other side. This B i ll will not only remove discontent, but will remedy a number of defects in the conditions of service. Clause 95 provides that annuities or gratuities shall be paid to men who are permanently incapacitated, and also to men who retire through age or infirmity. Clause 94 provides that provision shall be made for the widow and family of a man who is killed on active service or whilst on duty' Provision is also mad© for the payment of pensions if a man's death or incapacity occurs through wounds or disease contracted on war service or on duty. This service is dangerous. The men continually take risks, and it will be a satisfaction to them to realise that, whatever happens while they are on duty, their wives and families, or other dependants, will not be left in want. Much comment has been caused by clause 45. I do not care a jot whether it remains in or goes out of the Bill , because provision is made in the Constitution for the circumstances which the clause seeks to meet. Section 119 of ,the Constitution Act readsThe Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion, and, on the application of the Executive Government of the State, against domestic violence. Those are practically the words that we have in the Bill before us. There is, however, an addendum to the constitutional - provision, which may make the clause in the Bill ultra vires. That is a point to which the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) might direct his attention. It is inconceivable that any Government would wilfully send bombing 'planes over towns where women and children are living. \Extension of time granted.] At Broome there are between 2,000 and 3,000 Asiatics. If a cry for help came from the town our only means of sending succour would be by air. It does not really matter whether clause 45 in the Bill is retained or removed, since the Government would still have power to send the machines out to quell a disturbance. The Leader of th© Opposition discussed the general question of war. No honourable member wants any mor© war. We have had more than enough. Personally, when referring to the Great War of 1914, I never used the phrase "" This war is being fought to end war."" I did not think it was being fought for that pose. It was fought in observance of rigid contract to protect Belgium. is an awful thing, but we must take steps to defend our country. One has look around the world and notice what going on to reach that conclusion. tralia must do her share to assist the Motherland. I shall not now touch naval affairs, because there will be another opportunity to do so. From an aviation - viewpoint, however, we should have a seaplane base in the Northern for defence purposes. Planes at that could be of great service to Singapore assistance were needed. There is great, stretch of water to be crossed. Our civil aviation must be because' that would help in the defence Australia. of the country. While I was at Tokio I learned of a suggestion our Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) a meeting of the Pan-Pacific should be convened to consider further steps could be taken to limit the mad rush in armaments. I suggest the Prime Minister should repeat proposal. Another Washington ference is needed. The' mad in respect of aviation is not to start; it has already started. country has only to centre its attention on its first line of defence, whether line be battleships, cruisers, submarines, or aircraft, and other counbest tries will join in the race. The Washing-, ton Conference did not deal with tion. All it did was to say that cruisers should not exceed 10,000 tons,, and that the guns should not be larger than 8 inch. Any country is free hundreds of cruisers so long as they are not above the stated tonnage, and do not is very unfair. carry guns larger than those J apan, France, and other Powers are' goMarks) said. ing to the limit in aviation. all this will end. It is urgently that some person in authority, such as Prime Minister, should move to organize another Conference on the lines of held at Washington, so that the question could be considered with a view to hmitation of expenditure and activity. dealing largely with Japan. I also suggest that it is no use having £1,000,000 gift, such as that of the Imclusion. perial aircraft, lying idle. Let something be done with it. I advise also that the Prime Minister, and those who will to London with him, should be prepared Mr Marks. to discuss the question of airships. Pro-"" purvision has been made on the agenda-paper a for such a debate at the instance of the War Secretary of State for A i r , Sir Samuel Hoare. We should realise the importance only to of airships as a means of maintaining is communication with various parts of the AusEmpire. They may be used for protection and for patrolling, and may become on a valuable factor in maintaining a closer association of Australia-with the Motherland. This is important. It has been discussed in this House by the right honTerritory orable member for. North Sydney (Mr. base Hughes), and we are all more or less in if agreement upon the subject. Finance is not a the stumbling block. I congratulate the Government on bringing down this Bill . extended, It means a great advance in aviation in made by Mr A GREEN (Kalgoorlie) [8.45] that The very alarming speech just delivered Powers by the honourable member for Wentworth' whether (Mr Marks) causes one to wonder whether we derived any benefit from the late war, that * which, it was said, was going to end all his wars. It appears to me that a great deal Conof the mistrust which arises between race nations is caused by the honest alarmists about of which the honourable member is a type. AI t would be quite justifiable for a member of the Japanese Diet to say to his that fellow-members, "" Here is a man who destroyers, came to Japan recently, was given the of hospitality, saw everything, and on his return to Australia made an aviaalarmist speech in the Commonwealth light - House of Parliament, advocating that Australia should use every means in its power to bring into existence an armed to build force to fight Japan.""",40
148,Mr FOSTEB,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The honourable member That is not what the specified. honourable member for Wentworth (Mr . I ask where Mr A . GREEN - It undoubtedly is a necessary fact that the honourable member for the Wentworth has been to Japan recently. He has admitted that he was treated well that by the Japanese people. He was shown whole over their .warships. He now comes to this House and makes an alarmist speech I cannot a draw from his speech' any other conI t sounded strange to me to hear the go honourable member, in the early part of his speech, say that he was pleased to hear the statement of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) that the Labour party was in favour of defence. Apparently that statement caused surprise to the honourable member. I would remind hiin, however, that we, on this side, are just as good Australians as are those who sit opposite. The honourable member's remark.hurt me; it was an in sinuation that the Labour party does not stand for the defence of its country. Distrust such as that exhibited by the honourable member is very largely responsible for the dissatisfaction that is felt by a large section of the people whom we represent. There are authorities on this subject other than the honourable member. . Mr MASKS - Yourself . Mr A . G f REEN - I do not pose as an authority on these matters. The honourable member does. I shall quote authorities to show that the great battleships which the honourable member recommends that Australia should waste its substance in purchasing",45
149,Mr MABKS,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I did not say that. Mr A . GREEN - The honourable member's statement amounted to that. He pointed out that the Japanese were building three enormous battleships. What did he mean by that reference? Did he not wish honourable members to infer that that arm of the service was a danger to Australia, and that, consequently, Australia should take action to counteract what Japan was doing? It is well known that half the revenue of Japan is being spent in this wild race- I think the honourable member used that expression-for naval supremacy.",46
150,Mr MASKS,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Was being spent. Mr A . GREEN - The honourable member told us a few minutes ago that Japan was building at an enormous rate. The impression was not l e ft ""in the minds of honourable members that any slackening had taken place. There are several authorities in the world today who claim that the air force is the force of the future. That is the force to which the Government are paying so much attention in this Bill . . I agree with that. contention, arid I see in it a means by which this country will be able to spend the biggest part of its revenue upon development, instead of making itself bankrupt by indulging in naval architecture. I am in favour of the greatest attention being devoted to the buildingup of an air force, and am firmly i m pressed with its absolute necessity, but there are certain objectionable features in this measure to which we are in duty bound to call attention. . We, in Australia, are a democratic people. We hope, ultimately, to see war abolished. It is our bounden duty to make militarism as democratic as possible. If the workers throughout Australia are satisfied that our defence measures will hot be used against them when they are fighting to uphold their industrial rights, they and the members of this party will wholeheartedly support those measures to make possible the defence of our homeland. The objectionable features of this measure have been outlined by the Leader of the Opposition, who cited particularly the clause which gives power to call on the forces to deal with an industrial trouble. The honourable« member for Fremantle (Mr Watson) was a witness of a regrettable incident that occurred some time ago on the Fremantle Wharf when the wharf lumpers were out onstrike. The Acting Premier of the State went by boat down the river to check a little trouble that had' occurred on the wharf. Troubles of that nature have not our sympathy. We regret their occurrence, because we recognise that they have a boomerang effect .on our movement. We know that, in heated moments, men do things which, in their quieter moments they regret. A f t e r the Riot Act had been read, some of the men commenced to throw missiles at the police. The police had fixed bayonets, and in the mix-up one man received wounds, from which he died. I shall never forget ' the feeling that - was created when it was learned that that man had died.. In order to prevent further trouble the Acting Premier hoisted a white handkerchief. For that action he was blamed by several of the captains of industry in Fremantle; but there .is no doubt that it prevented a great deal of bloodshed. He and his followers left the wharf, and proceeded up the river in their boat. Had they not retired there would have been bloodshed, and the feeling which would have been engendered would never have died down. Whatever else we do, let it never be said that we go out to shed one another's blood. Nothing that could happen in Australia would justify that. During the seventy or eighty our industrial progress in Australia we have not had any trouble-wit h the exception of'that at Eureka-whic h it has not been possible to settle by the presence of a policeman or two. When they reach a calm frame of mind the men on both sides 'are invariably prepared to adopt a reasonable attitude. I trust that the Ministry will alter those portions of the Bill which are deemed to he objectionable. We come now to the great question of naval expenditure. If the Great War has not taught us a better lesson than to indulge in large expenditure for further war, God help us as a nation. There are authorities ' who adopt a view differing from that of the honourable member for Wentworth. Last month an article appeared in MCClure's Magazine, from . the pen of Rear-Admiral W . F . Fullam, who was in charge of the American Fleet in the Pacific during the war, .and should be able to speak on this question with some authority. His article is entitled "" The Passing of Sea Power. '- In order to substantiate his views he cites the opinions of Rear-Admiral Bradley A . Fiske (TJnited States Navy), Admiral Sims (TJnited States Navy), Admiral Sir Percy Scott (Royal N a v y ) , Admira l Sir John Fisher ' (Royal Navy)., Rear-Admiral S. S. H all ' (R o y a l N a v y ) , Admiral Mark K e r r (Royal N a v y ) , A d miral Lord Wester Wemyss, who was First Lord of the Admiralty after the war, Lord Sydenham; and, last but not least. Admiral von Scheer, who commanded the German Fleet at the battle of Jutland, and put up a good "" scrap ngainst the British Navy. Rear-Admiral Fullam sets out to* prove that sea power, as a power in itself, is passing.; that the arm of the futur e is an air force. W it h out more ado I shall read one or two extracts from the article, because no words of mine could drive home the truth better than the manner in which he presents it . He says The wings of "" Sea Power "" have been clipped. New naval weapons have vastly strengthened the defence and greatly weakened the offense in overseas warfare. Great armadas and armies cannot again cross the seas. Force cannot, as in the past, be carried over the oceans. With the sea as a buffer, weak nations can defy the strong. A puny power, without a navy, can challenge the strongest battle Mr A. Green. years of fleet. It can, with intelligent energy, make its coast impregnable against a hundred Dreadnoughts. With an impenetrable barrage of mines, air forces, torpedoes, and submarines, it can easily hold a maritime enemy one hundred miles from its shores. The freedom of the seas is in many respects near realization. Aggression, expressed in ships, is chained to the beach. He says furtherInter-Continental war will be well-nigh impossible in future. The weak will not bow to the strong from overseas.. No one nation can rule the waves 'hereafter. The greatest fighting navy may inspire no fear. A hostile coast can scorn its power. Its guns cannot reach the target. They are like ancient weapons in a modern ago. A dreadnought fleet on an enemy's coast is .like Don Quixote fighting windmills with a .lance. He quotes from Rear-Admiral Bradley A. Fiske, who declared, in 1911, thatA strong force of air-planes supported by mines and submarines would alone suffice to defend the Philippines from invasion. Fortifications were not needed. A defending fleet of battleships was quite unnecessary. He says that Admira l Fiske was right twelve years' ago in making that statement, and he is right today. He f u r ther says that, in 1914, Admira l Sir Percy Scott, of the British Navy, in a letter to the London Times, declaredFirst, that modern weapons have entirely revolutionized naval warfare. Second, that if we were at war with a country within strikViceing distance of submarines, battleships on the high seas would be in ' great danger. Third, that if we went to war, we should probably lock up our ships in a safe harbour, and the enemy would do the same. Fourth, that no fleet could the hidden from the airman's eyes. Fifth, that submarines could deliver a. deadly attack in ibroad daylight. Sixth, that battleships could not bombard «n enemy's port if it is protected iby submarines. Seventh, that the enemy submarines would come to our coast and destroy everything they could. Eighth, that the submarine had driven the battleship from the ocean. Roar-Admiral Fullam points out that these opinions of Admira l Scott were advanced nine years ago before air forces were full y developed, and before heavy .bombs and torpedo planes had been tried against ships of war, and the advent of these weapons greatly strengthens his argument. He further writesAdmiral Sir John Fisher supported Admiral Scott. He declared that the dreadnought was doomed. "" Scrap the lot; the future fighting is in the air,"" he claimed. And these two admirals, Fisher and Scott, had done more tnan any men in the world 'to develop the dreadnought. He says that, summing up his impeachment of the battleship, Sir Percy Scott saysYou must admit that, in the war, we were nearly forced .to submission by starvation. You must admit that the German battleships played no part in reducing us to a state of starvation. You must admit that if our battleship superiority had been doubje what it was, it could not have protected us from starvation. You must admit that the dominant arm of the war was the submarine. You must admit that pur belief before the war that the submarine, jva-s only a toy resulted in our coming to the brink of losing the war. He quotes another authority, Rear-Admiral S. S. Hall, of the British Navy, who statesWe had a grand fleet, with a preponderance of rtearly two to one over Germany alone, and an auxiliary navy of about five thousand vessels. We had the assistance ,of the American, French, Italian, and Japanese navies. held the most favourable geographical position, for a naval war, that the atlas can. furnish. And yet our main naval purpose-the protection of our trade-eould not be carried out. These are the plain sad facts of our naval experience in the last war. In view of the failure of the Navy-unde r the most favourable conditions, with many Allies^-to protect our. trade in the last war, has it any hope of doing, so on its existing basis under less favourable conditions? tect the lines of communication of our battle fleet, if the latter is required to fight out of home waters ? Will the advent of aircraft make the position easier? He goes on to quote w h at A d m i r a l Sims of the A m e r i c a n N a v y h a d to say when he went to L o n d o n in 1917, and reported that the E n g l is h N sea, and that the Germans were w in n in g the war despite the g r and fleet. c a n ' t go on l i k e this m u c h l o n g e r , "" A d m i r a l Jellicoe to l d Sims, and a f t e r t w o years' experience and observation in the world' s war, and a f t e r the b o m b in g of the German ships by our A i r Forces, A d m i r a l Sims made the following statement : There will never again be in naval history one of the Simon-pure naval expeditions carried across the sea to an enemy's port, the defeat of an enemy's fleet, the establishment of an advanced base on his coast, and the pouring in of soldiers and supplies. This has been for ever rendered impossible, against any country that has adequate air and submarine forces. He quotes Vice - A d m i r al M a r k K e r r , of the B r it is h N a v y , saying : No nation would dare send a capital fleet three thousand miles across open water to fight an 'enemy, l t is ten chances to one that it would be wiped out to the last bottom. Without a base it would be whittled away by the air and submarine forces of the enemy, without ever meeting the enemy's grand fleet. [45] These are s t r i k in g statements coming, as they do, from no less t h a n seven or e i g h t of the leading n a v a l authoritie s of the l e a d in g powers, of the w o r l d . RearA d m i r a l F u l l a m quotes A d m i r a l K e r r f u r the r , as s a y in g : As blockading by big ships has been shown to be impossible in the face of modern flotillas, it would appear that there is no use for the battleship where the bases are far apart. Battle-fleets are only of use in certain geographic divisions, where the bases are not far apart. They are of no use for wars in which the combatant countries, are separated by thousands of miles of ocean. He then mentions the f a c t that L o r d Sydenham, a distinguished B r it is h statesman, agrees Will A d m i r a l Sims and A d m i r a l K e r r , in the following letter to an A d m i r a l of t h o A m e r i c a n N a v y : You can't now employ a large battlefleet We in an enemy's near waters if he possesses,a smaller fleet in good order and effective. Japan is a case in point. You, the United States,' and we, Great Britain, can do nothing against Japan separately, and not much more if we were allied. , I am sure you will come to this conclusion. Then e x t passage in t h is l e t t e r has some interest for us in Australia Per contra Japan, and obviously no other Can it even pro- Power can do anything in American home waters, even if your fleet were only as the High Seas Fleet compared to the Grand Fleet. Submarines, minefields, and the air have conferred new powers on a fleet in its own waters, and with the resources of a great nation behind it . That is what so many pundits have missed. It carries far.

A d m i r a l v on Scheer, p r i o r to the Great W a r , stood, for the b at t l e s h i p , as the honourable member for We n t w o r t h does today, but R e a r - A d m i r al F u l l a m says that the recent p e r f e c t i o n of b o m b in g and torpedo planes in the attack ""on surface vessels has b r o u g h t A d m i r a l v o n Scheer to recognise a new era. Admiral von Scheer is quoted as sayingOnly recently experiments made in America have made it clear that a battleship may be sunk by air planes. Even though the chance of such successes would be lessened in the ease of ships under way, and though the factor' of defence did not enter into these experiments, it cannot be.denied that the prospects are favourable to the air plane-sinc e an attacking fleet cannot remain in motion permanently. It requires rest for the engines, time for the taking an board of munitions, fuel, and supplies. It must dock for repairs, lie at anchor, and it is then that the opportunity (or air attack presents itself. The danger involved in being struck by a 2,000-pound bomb from the sky also exists in the mines and torpedoes which threaten the battleship. It is thus exposed to clangers beneath the waters, and from the air, and it has no absolute security against these. Swift cruisers, the eyes of the fleet, are threatened in a still greater degree, since, in view of their high speed, they must be content with weaker armaments. The air plane is swifter, its eyes seo farther, it cannot be so easily pushed aside or into a corner. And thus it may be said to furnish better service than a large and expensive battleship. R e a r - A d m i r al F u l l a m has m u c h more to say in his article, but I will content m y seif now with his s u m m in g - up, w h if o l l o w s: Reviewing the subject briefly, we may say :First,, a battle fleet, cannot carry an attack across the ocean; second, a great army cannot be sent oversea; third, a base 5,000. miles from home, surrounded by enemy bases, is no base at all. I remind honourable members that we are over 5,000 miles from any enemy likely to attack us. Fourth, submarines, air forces, mines, and torpedoes suffice to defend a coast. Fifth, seacoast forts are useless. Sixth, it is only by transporting overseas an overwhelming air force to seize and control the air that one continent can attack another. Seventh, each continent will control its own destiny if it arms itself with modern weapons. That is what we look for in Australia, and I think that I can see daylight in providing such modern weapons. The future for Australia must look black if we are to expend the greater part of our revenue in the purchase of battleships, when a modern battleship costs no less than £7,000,000. A modern battleplane is estimated to cost £2,5.00, so that for the cost of one. battleship Australia mighthave 2,S00 modern battleplanes. Judging by what I have read, and from the opinions of the authorities I have quoted, it is clear that for the expenditure of a comparatively small amount of money Australia might be made immune from attack by even the most powerful naval force in the world. I was recently in conversation with an authority upon air forces in Singapore. To quote this gentleman's own words, he said- Britain is scared s t if f , not of Germany, of France, her present Ally. It is because of Mr A. Green that fact that France is not paying the interest on her debts to Britain, but is spending the inoney on battleplanes. The honourable member for Wentworth quoted interesting figures which I also have found in a publication called Flight. This publication pointed out that in May, 1922, B r it a in had 371 battleplanes, whilst France had 1,260; Great Britain could provide only thirty-one air squadrons, whilst France could provide 105. In its defence scheme to ' "" make provision up to 1925, Great Britain has proposed an increase in the number of battleplanes to. 575, which is an increase of 204. On the other hand, France proposes to increase her fleet to 2,180 planes, or 182 squadrons, as against forty-nine squadrons proposed by Great Britain . The authority whom c h is as I met at Singapore said that-all the air- 1 craft guns, all the aircraf t in England today, and all the great warships of Great B r it a in would not prevail for one moment against the battleplanes of France should that country decide to employ them against-Britain, and that by ' using the bombs which it is well known the nations of the world can' make use of today, and the acid to which the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr . Marks)' has referred, France could crush her present ally in twenty-four hours. 1"" do not wish to be regarded as an alarmist, but, according to some authorities whose opinions must be regarded, as carrying weight, Great Britain's object should be to come to an agreement with her gallant ally for the restriction of air forces. Let me point out the position of Germany. At the conclusion of peace - a Commission of British and French A i r Force officers proceeded to Germany for the purpose of dismantling all German warpianes and insuring that Germany no longer manufactured anything that could be regarded as battleplanes. The manufacture of German aeroplanes' is now restricted to planes for commercial purposes, with the result that Germany has made wonderful progress in producing commercial' aeroplanes, while her late enemies have been interested in other directions. The machines commonly used for commercial aviation in Australia are presumably of the type employed .on the Gteraldton-Derby air service in Western Australia. These are fitted with 240horse-power 'Siddeley Punia - engines, and J but they each carry over the journey of 1,000 miles two passengers, besides the pilot, or 395 lbs. of mail matter - without passengers. They are built of wood and fabric. The Germans have now constructed an all-metal aeroplane. They are the only people, I am told, who have yet succeeded in making an all-metal aeroplane.. It is made of a mixture of aluminium and steel, which is called duralumin. I am exceedingly interested in this development, because, when I recently applied to the Department of the Postmaster-General for ah extension of the Geraldton-Derby air mail service to Wyndham, an additional 400 miles as the crow flies, I was told that the Government were meeting with considerable difficulty in using planes in the tropical portions of Australia. When they have used in Papua, the glue has become so moistened, and the wood has become so affected, that the planes have fallen to pieces. I do not suppose we could buy aeroplanes from Germany at the present time, but, later, we may be in a position to become possessed of allmetal aeroplanes. It is pleasing to note that Great B r it a in is now engaged in experimenting in the manufacture of all-metal planes, and I trust that, as soon as they are produced in British factories, our Government will import - machines of. that type to do the work - we require of them. The German aeroplanes are restricted to the use of engines of 185 h.p., which is 55 h.p.. below those fitted in the planes used on the GeraldtonDerby air service, but, whereas the latter can carry only two passengers and a pilot, the German planes carry six passengers. Thus they have two an'd a quarter times the carrying capacity of our planes, with a little more than three-quarters of the horse-power required to propel our machines. We are told that the air service should be given an opportunity to develop. I trust that the Government will remove the objectionable features of this Bill , so that honourable members on this side of the House can help them to develop it , and so that it can never be said of us, if ever industrial trouble occurs, that we voted for a measure that provided that bombs could be used from aeroplanes against the workers participating in any such trouble. Men in the air are not under that control, which is exercised when a force of policemen is engaged in preserving the peace. In passing, let me pay a tribute to the police. When an industrial dispute occurs, they generally act with a great deal of discretion and tact, and because of this there has been no blood shed among ourselves in Australia. Por this I thank God. If aeroplanes were used to suppress a disturbance during an industrial dispute, and a man in a plane, thinking the situation serious, was tempted to drop a bomb, the result might be so disastrous that the feeling engendered between different portions of the community would never vanish. That is what I fear, and therefore T appeal to the Government to enable us to aero- make'this an acceptable measure. Let us democratize it , and make it more in been accordance with the Australian spirit. If that is done, ' and if the three objections raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) are met, honourable members of the Opposition and their supporters will see that' a system of air defence is set up in Australia that will make this country secure against possible invasion.",46
151,Mr LAZZARINI,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Werriwa) [9.26] At the outset I take exception . to the statement of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks), who, after congratulating the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) on his speech, said that many of the people outside who supported the Labour party were opposed to the defence of Australia. The honourable member has misrepresented the attitude of those who support honourable members of the Opposition. We believe in making a sane provision for the defence of Australia, but we object to the methods adopted by the honourable member for ""Wentworth, and others. We object to the flag-wagging and the Imperialisticmilitarism in which they indulge. We have always opposed it , and shall continue to do - so. The honourable member has very tactfully raised the Japanese bogy. While telling us that he did not think Japan was a potential enemy of Australia, he proceeded to predict that fearful things would happen to this country if Japan were an enemy. I have never heard such calamity-howling in this House, as we heard from the honourable member to-night, when, for instance, he told us how one Japanese vessel could come here and compel us to haul down our flag. Such talk is in the greatest degree injurious, not only to the safety, but also' to the fair name of Australia. The honourable member also told us that airships were not a good means of defence, and he quoted authorities to prove his assertion. To some extent I agree that from a purely defensive point of view, aerial warfare is not as 'effective as other means may prove to be. As the war has proved, airships are essentially an aggressive weapon of warfare, and we must be careful, in providing for aerial defence, to see that the word ""defence,"" which is so often used to cover up aggressive action, is not so used on this occasion. We must not, as a young country, create the impression among the nations that we are in any way prepared to set up a large and effective air force, which may be used in a war of aggression in any part of the world as an adjunct to an Imperial aerial force. It is useless to say that such is not our intention in creating an air force. Every nation has, to its discredit, at some time, carried on an aggressive war, andi t is not for us to say that Australia will never engage in one. If we follow a policy of feverish preparation for aerial warfare we shall be adopting a dangerous course^ which will help to disrupt the peace of the world and certainly will not promote the ideal of world-wide disarmament. The proposed incorporation in this Bill of the, British Army A ct is a serious matter.",50
152,Mr BOWDEN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,The Bill merely says that the Imperial A i r Porce A ct shall apply to the Australian A i r Force when serving outside the Commonwealth.,51
153,Mr LAZZARINI,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The Imperial A i r Force A ct incorporates the British Army. Act. All the pains and penalties imposed by the Army Act apply to the I m perial A i r Force, and, therefore, in time of war will apply to the Australian A i r Force serving outside the Commonwealth, if the proposal in thisB ill is agreed to. Tims Australia will become merely a cog in the Imperial machine. In that our danger lies. To-day there is the keenest competition - between. Britain and France, in aerial defence, and military authorities in Britain are warning the public that in the air France is superior to Britain. I do not know why the Government have again brought forward this provision for incorporating the Imperial Act. A similar provision was defeated in another place when the Bill was introduced on a former occasion, and one would naturally expect that the Government would not revive it . It may be assumed that even if this House were agreeable to this provision it would be again rejected in another place.",51
154,Mr BOWDEN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,It was agreed to in another place when presented a second time.,51
155,Mr LAZZARINI,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"If that is so, the party machine' must have been brought into operation to prevent those who opposed this provision on the first occasion negativing it a second time. However, there are eleven new senators, who, I undertake to say, will vote against this clause. 'Some of the provisions of the British Army Act date back 300 years, to what might almost be called a barbarous and brutal. age. Additions to it have been made from time .to time, but it ""is now so cumbersome that I undertake to say the Minister in chargo of this Bill 'knows very little of its provisions. Certainly very few members have seen a copy of the Imperial Army Act, and in those circumstances its in corporation in an Australian Statute would be preposterous. I hope that when the Bill is in Committee the Government will agree to delete the clause which makes the Imperial Statute applicable in certain circumstances to the Australian ° Force. The consensus of opinion of authoritative writer's is that very few of the weapons used in the last war will be used in futur e warfare. One reads in the press of military authorities and scientists clamouring for a more efficient air force in preparation for futur e international conflicts, and it seems clear that those nations which adopt a vigorous aerial policy will be committing the same faults ""and errors that were committed - by the nations that buil t up huge military and naval armaments prior to 1914. Therefore, Australia should be very careful in the steps it takes towards the creation of aerial armaments. I repeat that aeroplanes and airships are essentially, weapons of aggression, and cannot be regarded as defensive in the same sense as were armies and navies prior to the last great war. The main weapons of an aerial navy will be the deadly poison gases on which professors are today working at high pressure, prostituting their intelligence in order to conceive some hell-brew that will wipe out whole nations. The dissemination pf poison gases will be almost wholly confined to aggressive fighting, because, except in regard ships, this medium eannot be employed very well for defensive purposes. I shall quote a few newspaper extracts to show how the world is preparing for future attacker. warfare, and in order to indicate to the be in safety.""

This gas is now .being made by hundreds, and even thousands, of to live. Life tons per month."" The honourable member for Wentworth' stated that this weapon would be useless on the sea, but the authority I am quoting sayst Nor will it be any safer on the seas than, on the land. General Fries says: "" At sea gases will be used, made by some sort of candle ithat will float. These will give off clouds of noxious vapour. Every human being in a ship expert, must breathe every minute, and such as once got into a. vessel's ventilating system would speedily destroy all life aboard."" of the Another extract which shows the tendency of modern science, as applied to will war, is headed "" Frightfulness from the As there is no Skies,"" and readsThe - aeroplane will add a fresh horror to no warfare in the future, since it will be used set fire to property over unlimited areas.

The fire will spread alike over or water. Thermit and ammonium nitrate, adding heat and extending the flames, make the effect more devastating. These cendiary bombs will weigh 6 i ounces, packed in containers holding about 300, bombing plane will be capable of carrying about 15,000 of these destructive bombs which, when dropped, will fly in all directions. We are also informedWe now have the so-called mustard gases, which are one-third as heavier again as water, and volatilize far more slowly. They can be sprayed from an airplane by opening a and letting out only a few drops at a time. The speed of the flying machine and in this way whole areas con be rendered deadly to marching troops or sailing fleets. , Thisauthority, when asked after the war if it would have been possible to wipe the whole American army of 1,400,000 men in twenty-four hours with any these gases, but more particularly with recently.

This measure will l in k the Australian A i r Eorce up with the Imperialistic scheme, and it is useless to pretend w i ll be used for defence only. countries in the world are engaged in sumc business.

157,Mr LAZZARINI,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"We are providing for aeroplanes and an A i r Porce. accessories of aerial warfare w i obtained elsewhere. It is well known that scientists in the laboratories of nations are feverishly engaged in reside. search work in connection with the manuiv. facture of gases for aerial warfare.

158,Mr BOWDEN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,They will not be called upon to fly. They will probably be gaged in the workshops.,53
159,Mr LAZZARINI,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"That being so, -1 accept the principle. I am not going to delay the House much longer, but, with other honourable members on this side, I protest strongly against the proposal clause 45 to permit the use of the A i r Force f b r the quelling of a domestic disturbance in any p a r t . of the Commonwealth-. When political feeling runs high, will it will be possible for any Government to land describe industrial trouble as a domestic will disturbance, and authorize the use of inbombing aeroplanes to restore order. and, One result of the war is the dislocation one of industry in Australia, and considerable industrial unrest as the result of unemployment. Is clause 45 a threat against industrial organizations?",53
160,Mr BOWDEN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Not at all.,53

162,Mr BOWDEN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"It is really a restrictank tion of a power for which the Constituwill spray it, tion itself provides.",53
163,Mr LAZZARINI,WAR SERVICE HOMES,The Bill ought to contain a clause specifically forbidding the use of the A i r Force for such a purpose out in Austi'alia. in any circumstances.,53

Instead serof all the money being expended on an A i r Force on the m i l it a ry side, much of it could be utilized for the assistance of enpeople engaged in useful occupations in our outback country, and at the same time the members of our A i r Force employed in giving that assistance would secure efficient training.

166,Mr COLEMAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Eeid) [10.0] - I desire to draw the attention of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) to the position of officers i u the Department of Repatriation, who are ibeing dismissed in consequence of the curtailment of the activities of that Department. In conjunction with other honourable members, I have received a request from the Staff Committees of the Repatriation Department asking the Government to compensate the officers who have been retrenched by granting them one month's pay for each year of service provided, of course, that they have completed four years' epntinu'ous service. I understand that the Treasurer has already received some correspondence embodying this request, and as Ana. the men 'have carried out their duties in an efficient - manner over a period of years, it seems to me to be a very modest one. Compensation has already ibeen paid to the officers retrenched from the Defence Department, and the Treasurer has promised to set aside £200,000 to compensate ' those officers who will be retrenched from the Taxation Department, if the Government taxation proposals are agreed to. A good deal of hardship exists amongst the men, and some have heen practically thrown on to the streets, as no provision has been made by the Repatriation DeNoxs. partment or the Government for their re-employment. A large number of them are returned soldiers.",54
167,Mr BRUCE,WAR SERVICE HOMES,They all are.,54

I have had brought under my notice the case of a man who was dismissed and deprived' of his recreation PAIBS. leave on a mere technicality after completing twelve months' service. I feel sure the Treasurer does not approve of such action, and I trust that he will give the House an assurance that the requests of the Repatriation Staff Committee will be favourably considered without delay.",54
169,Dr EARLE PAGE,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Cowper-Trea surer) [10.4],-When any dismissals , have been contemplated owing to the curtailment of the activities of the Repatriation Department, it has always been the aim of the Commission to give as long a notification as possible in order to enable those whose services were being dispensed with to secure other employment. That has been the practice right up to the present. I understand, however, that, owing to some little misapprehension, a number of men were dismissed in one batch-ten , I think, was the largest number. As a rule, only one officer is dispensed with at a time, and usually many weeks' notice is given. Every effort is made hy the Department to - assist retrenched men to secure some other occupation. fWhen' the time arrives to seriously curtail the work of the Department, the Government will give the question raised. by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) every consideration.
