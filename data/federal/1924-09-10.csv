0,NA,Unknown,"materially altering - his budget proposals, for. I know that no Treasurer likes to alter a budget. I suggest that he should amend the bill so as to provide for a grant for ten, instead, of five, years, reducible by £8,500 a year, so that at the end of the period it would disappear.. Treasurer is providing £85,000 for this year, and future Governments, if they do not share his views, can modify the proposal. It will take Tasmania ten years to get out of her nnancial difficulties. The Government of that state is making strenuous, and I might say almost heroic-, efforts to get out of the muddle caused by past governments. Public services are being starved, and grants for education and charitable institutions are being reduced. Savings are being made in every possible direction, and taxation has been increased by 12s. per head. It will takemore than fiveyears f b r Tas^ mania to reach a. state of prosperity that we all feel her natural power and resources: will ultimately secure forher. It is of no use for me to move an amendment to the bill , unless the Treasurer will agree to it . The Treasurer can also secure credit for himself and the Parliament by urging the Ministry to remove immediately the absurd and hypocritical bann placed by the post ofiice upon letters sent to the Tasmanian. lottery.. The Government should notify all post offices of the withdrawal of the prohibition, when the promoters of the - lottery, by notifying their customers in various parts of. Australia, would do the rest. How illogical and unfair it is to apply such a prohibition to the lottery in Tasmania! The Treasurer has sympathized with Tasmania, and he and the Government agree that the peculiar circumstances in which that state finds itself today are due entirely to the disturbance of its finances' since federation. He agrees with the Premier and Treasurer of that state, and with the Tasmanian representatives in this Parliament, ' that Tasmania is entitled toassistance to the extent of £200,000. He ""has undertaken to provide £85,000 this year, and an annually reducible sum during the following four years; but he says that he will prohibit the people of Australia from using the post-office to deal with the lottery in Tasmania.",19
1,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"That policy plays into the hands of a little clique of agents. Mr O ' KEEFE - We know that many - customers of the lottery communicate with it through private channels, and that there are agentsall overAustralia. Mr Fenton. - And the agents get the revenue that the post ofiice should get.",19
2,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"Exactly . The agents came into being when the illogical, unThe fair,, and ' 'un-federal"" provision was made in the Post and Telegraph Act . When a member of another place, I protested against it , and said that such action was an unwarranted interference with the legislation of Tasmania. I pointed out also, that the operations of the lottery were subject to Government supervision, and that it hascontinued to grow mainly because of that fact. It satisfies the craving of those who. will have a gamble. I am not asserting that gambling is right or wrong. For the moment I do not discuss the question whether the State Government should run the lottery as is done in Queensland. I believe that, as a matter of fact, the State Government is receiving as much revenue from Tattersall's by way of taxation as it would receive if it ran the lottery. Tattersall's lottery is well known, not only in every, corner of Australia-, but throughout the civilized world.",19
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt). - - I do not think that the honourable member is. justified, in extensively canvassing a provision of the Postal. A ct on the motion for the second reading of this bill. Mr O ' KEEFE - Y o u , sir, will realise the difficulty I am in , and I ask your in dulgence. Whilst the bill makes no reference to the section of' the Postal A ct to which I have taken exception, or to the lottery to which I have referred, the Treasurer, in his speech, stressed the fact that assistance is proposed to be given to Tasmania by the Federal Government to the extent of £85,000 this year by way of direct grant from the Federal revenue, and to the extent of £111,000 by way of the remission of taxation levied in connection with Tattersall's lottery, which is in future to be lef t to the State authorities to collect. What I am asking is that the Treasurer should take such steps as are necessary to enable the Tasmanian Government to derive not less than £111,000 in taxation on Tattersall's lottery. If it were not that, people in all parts of Australia have discovered that they can send money to Tattersall's through private agencies, the Federal Government would not derive the taxation which it now receives from that institution.",19
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"A xeference to tine tax on the lottery is, of course, appropriate, but an .extensive reference to the provisions of the Postal Act is not in order. Mr OKEEFE. - I hope that the Treasurer will do his ibest ,to induce the Caibinet to consent .to the immediate repeal .of the provision of ithe Postal Act which, if allowed to remain, is likely to interfere with the anticipated operation of the remission of .the Commonwealth tax.

I should like to see a direct grant of £200,000 a thing .better. year made to Tasmania, u n t i l her direct taxation averages that of the other states. That would be a very fair proposal. mania has suffered more than has any other state as a result of its inclusion the federation. It is the Cinderella of the states, and because of its isolated position has not benefited as the other states have ing his taxation proposals. done from the immense expenditure of Commonwealth. I trust that as a result of the operation of the bill it will not be necessary for representatives of Tasmania to appeal Jater on to this Parliament f further assistance. If the lottery has been referred to is not - carried on cessfully, and does not return the antito cipated revenue of £111,000 a year f r its taxation by the state, representatives of Tasmania will have to come to - this Parliament again for .assistance, or state will ""have to cut the painter.

5,Mr WHITSITT,Unknown,"It is not a question of paying low wages. Tasmania has actually to struggle for existence, and taxation there is now so high that many people are leaving the state.

The difference between o m the Commonwealth evacuating that field of taxation and continuing in it and paying over the receipts to the state, is merely the the difference between tweedledum and Therefore I think the if Treasurer should agree to continue the of exfederal taxation .of .lotteries. I telecomgraphed to Tasmania the proposal contained in clause 4, and this is the comment upon it of one newspaper: There is all the difference in the world between - federal and state taxation of lotteries. In the one .ease it is immaterial wliere are located. A federal tax reaches them wherever in Australia they may be. Make it a state levy, and the sweep institution so taxed is at a heavy disadvantage as compared with one in a state„fre e from such taxation; while a stale lottery would probably knock it right out. The budget proposal, therefore, might have hit Tattersall's so hard that not only would this state not receive as much from the taxation of winners as the Commonwealth now collects, but would also suffer loss in the stamp duty imposed on every ticket. The Treasurer said smilingly that Tasmania would receive more in ten years from the taxation of Tattersall's than it would from the scheme which I outlined in the House some time ago. From the point of view of the Tasmanian people T deplore his optimism regarding the gambling spirit in Australia. Only two states-Queenslan d and Tasmania-ar e concerned in the taxation of lotteries, and it would be easy for the Commonwealth to continue to collect that taxation and make grant of it to the states. If the Federal Government is anxious to evacuate taxatiou fields, there are others that it couldabandon with greater advantage, and I regret that the Government has decided to commence the withdrawal at the expense of the State of Tasmania. The Treasurer would do well to abandon the idea of evacuating the field of lottery taxation. Then there will be two taxing authorities in that arena, and the controllers of Tattersall's lotteries will have less inducement to remove to any other state.",20
6,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,"Franklin) [3.55] Honourable members will recollect that some years ago a royal commission recommended that Tasmania should receive from the Commonwealth a grant of £900,000 spread over a period of ten years. That grant has been exhausted, and in each of the last two years an amount of £85,000 has been paid by the Commonwealth to the-state. Because of its geographical position and the impossibility of railway communication with the other states, Tasmania suffers a serious disability. It is further handicapped by the operation of the Navigation Act, which has driven most of the overseas shipping from the port of Hobart. That has caused a big loss of trade to the state, and consequently a loss of revenue. Because of tliese things Tasmania's position is exceptional, and warrants special they consideration by the Commonwealth. Tasmania has suffered more from federation than has any other state of the Commonwealth, and this Parliament should see that it is given a fair deal. At the present time, stagnation is being experienced in some of the principal industries of the state. The saw-mills are closing down,' and men are being thrown out of employment. That also involves a loss of revenue to the state. I endorse the protest of the 'honourable member for Denison (Mr O'Keefe), against the proposal of the Treasurer to reduce the grant of £85,000 by £17,000 per annum. The Treasurer would be acting more generously to Tasmania if he would agree to decrease the grant by only £8,500 a year, thus extending! the period of assistance from five to ten years. I agree also that it would be preferable for the Commonwealth authority to continue the taxation of lotteries. It is certain that if Tattersall's lottery is removed from Tasmania, that state will have to apply to the Commonwealth for further assistance. I hope that the Treasurer will give consideration to the objections offered by the honourable member for Denison. Question resolved in the affirmative.

12,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"No . Officially, there U no such body as the Cabinet. There is. the Executive Council, which is the counterpart in Australia of the Privy Council, and executive councillors here, like privy councillors in Great Britain, are summoned to cabinet meetings. But only such executive .councillors as happen to be members of the Administration in power are, in practice, summoned to cabinet meetings. The Commomvealth investigation branch is not a remnant of the original Commonwealth Police Force. It is a branch of the Attorney General's Department, the members of which have certain specific duties to perform. Under Commonwealth statutes, a great number of matters connected with old-age pensions and income tax administration, and innumerable others, have to be investigated, and, generally, require prompt attention. If the Commonwealth had no investigation staff of its own, and relied wholly on the state police, who are at present hard-worked, it would be impossible for us to get our work done. Last year the number of cases investigated by this branch was 4,822. In addition to departmental work, the members of this branch made inquiries for the royal commission that dealt with the Navigation Act, and obtained for it a great deal of information.",22
13,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Kooyong) [4.9] - Is the Prinie Minister able to make a statement about increasing the accommodation for the High Court in Melbourne? The present accommodation is unsatisfactory, not only to the members of the court, but also to the members of the legal profession and the public. It is very difficult to obtain the accommodation necessary for the hearing of cases. To maintain the dignity of the Commonwealth, and also the effective administration of justice, additional accommodation should be provided. In the. states, it is the practice to distinguish between the ofiice of the permanent head of the Attorney-General's Department and that of the Parliamentary Draftsman. I think that I am. correct in saying that all the states have a separate Parliamentary Draftsman. I am unable to say whether Sir Robert Garran is overworked through acting in the dual capacity of Solicitor-General and Parliamentary Draftsman, but it is almost certain that he ie. There is enough work in framing the legislation of this Parliament to occupy the whole of the time of the Parliamentary Draftsman. The qualifications and activities required of the Parliamentary Draftsman should be distinct from those required of the permanent head of the Attorney General's Department. The ordinary practice is for parliamentary draftsmen to devote the whole of their attention to the work of drafting bills.",22

I suggest that an alteration in the allocation of duties might be considered by the Attorney-General, so that there shall be an officer whose sole duties shall be those of Parliamentary Draftsman, and that he shall not be charged with the work of administering the Attorney-General's Department and its various branches. I do not think that this alteration would necessitate any further expense.",22

18,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Swan) [4.15] - I wish to ask the Minister for Trade - and Customs - certain questions relating to the work of the T a r i ff Board. When the board is considering the imposition of dumping duties upon wire netting or wire brought into this country, will He allow an open inquiry respecting the methods that aTe being adopted by the department to find out the domestic value of these goods in Great Britain? T have information from an outside source, though I cannot say that it is absolutely correct, that the British manufacturers, through the H i gh Commissioner, have assured the Tariff Board that they - are charging Australian importers the same price for wire netting as they charge for domestic consumption according to the quantity ordered. For small quantities the price is higher than for large quantities. I understand that .because of the dumping duties that have been imposed, the British manufacturer is charging the importers in South Africa and New Zealand .14 per cent, less for wire netting than he is charging the importers in Australia and that because of .this extra charge the dumping duties' are not enforced. I should like to know whether the Minister will allow an open inquiry on this subject to be made so - that importers and local manufacturers can appear before the board and give evidence on oath. It seems extraordinary to me that excessive dumping duties, sometimes amounting to £ 1 0 per mile should be imposed on wire netting.",23
19,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The local consumption in Great Britain is very small indeed.,23
20,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"It must be small, but the former Minister .for Trade and Customs (Sir Austin Chapman) said that 75 per - cent, of the wire netting manufactured in Great Britain was for local consumption. I <lo not know where he obtained his information, but it is certainly - not supported by ;the information that I have received. I should like the Minister to give - the committee some information in connection with the lighthouse branch, and the visit I of the Kyogle to Western Austraha. I understand that unless immediate action is taken in connection with the lighthouses and the automatic lights on the coast of Western Australia, W it h a view to attending to these matters, the Kyogle left Sydney some time ago with a union crew, but, when she arrived at Fremantle, the union there decided that those men - should be discharged and others engaged in their place. That - decision was made, - notwithstanding that :the„ crew on the vessel had been - engaged for a period of six months under union conditions. I understand, also, that up to the present nothing has been done. It seems extraordinary 'that a matter of such .importance as attending to the lights round the coast ""should have 'been - neglected for such a Jong period. If the allegations that we hear are 'true, it shows that the department has not acted, in connection with this organization in Western Australia, in a manner consistent with its responsibility.  Trade and Customs) [4.23] - Wit h reference to the question raised by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) concerning the resignation of Mr O'Callaghan, 1 desire to inform the committee that it is a fact that, after, an absence of twelve months at the expense of the Commonwealth, Mr O'Callaghan has tendered his resignation, on the ground that he has obtained more lucra tive employment elsewhere. that it is the intention of the Government to appoint a successor to Mr O'Callaghan, and that it is considered that within the department there are men capable of performing the work satisfactorily. I have not yet been able to peruse the mountain of papers dealing with the dumping duties on wire netting, referred to by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), but I point out to the honourable member that if it is a fact that the English manufacturers of wire netting are. now selling their product for export at the same price that it is sold for domestic purposes, or vice versa, no dumping duties will be imposed. I confess that these dumpingduties-particularly as. they affect wire netting-hav e given me serious thought, and have occupied a considerable amount of my time. I admit also that, so far as I have been able to investigate them,, they are not altogether satisfactory. It has been ascertained that of the wire netting manufactured in Great Britain, approximately one-half is used for domestic purposes, the balance being exported'. I promise the honourable member that as soon as my multifarious duties' will permit, I shall give this matter very full consideration, and I hope soon to place it on a satisfactory basis. It is true that there has been trouble in connection with the Kyogle- a trouble which had its genesis as far back as December last. In spite of the trouble, however, the department some time ago was able to ship certain appliances necessary for the continuance of the automatic lights on the coast of North-Western Australia. I am glad to be able to inform honourable members that the trouble has now been settled. Several of the men are sick, and one, at least, has left the vessel. All desire the termination of their agreement. Instructions were sent to the Director of Navigation yesterday to have the vessel taken to Fremantle and another crew engaged there, and this morning a telegram stating that the position was now satisfactory was received from him. I have instructed that oflicer to remain in Fremantle until the Kyogle sails for the north-West coast, which I hope will he this week, or next week.",23

24,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"My story is the story of the Truro City, an English vessel, manned by a British crew, who were not connected with the Australian Seamen's Union. That union came into the case only because of itsinterest in all men who go down to the sea in ships. The dispute was between the Navigation Department and the Australian Seamen's Union. On the one hand, the union charged the Navigation Department with dereliction of duty, and, on the other hand, the Navigation Department virtually charged the officials of the union with attempted blackmail. Without discussing the merits or demerits of the case, all I have to say is that the matter should be investigated. If it is true that the officials of the union were guilty of blackmail, it is the duty of the department , to take immediate action against them. If the charge of blackmail does not rest against the officials of the union, the charge of dereliction of duty on the part of the officers of the Navigation Department, in failing to act in the best interests of the men, should be investigated. If that charge rests,, it is the duty of the Minister to take action against those cials. The Truro City loaded wheat at position to the law.

"" He said she was 4 inches after above the load line, and it was pointed out to him that the 625 tons of coal would sink her 11 inches below the load line. When urged to take action, he replied that that the loading was the captain's responsibility, and that if the ship was found to and be overloaded, she would be detained. from After having told the representatives of 1 the Seamen's Union that the loading of the ship was not his responsibility, he that wrote in a report to Captain Davis: "" I pliminformed the master that in my opinion' conshe was overloaded."" Although he swore n court that she could go an inch or two considered lower, in his communication to the Direcof Navigation, he said, ""She was awash at that point when she was pulled out into the stream."" He did not intervene, and the coal lumpers, after having loaded 300 tons of coal, refused to put another ton of coal into her. The 300 Capetown. tons of coal had lowered her 8 inches, thus placing her 4 inches below the load line. Every ounce of tank water in her was pumped out, but even then she was below the load line. The men were hauled bewater, fore a police magistrate, who, after ing evidence, said, "" I cannot settle this question, but I will go out and see ship.""

The magistrate said to Captain Airey, "" Do you take the responsibility of saying that this ship absolutely seaworthy?"" and he replied, "" Sir, I do."" The magistrate had no alternative but to accept the expert's advice, and declare the ship seaworthy, but he' fused, at that stage, to fine the men or award, costs against them.

Each of them received £5 as in compensation. Under the agreement the The peace, agreement, which was signed by "" the crew of the S.S. Truro City of the first part, the secretary of the Seamen's Union of the second part, the master of the S.S. get Truro City of the third part, and Johnson and Lynn, Limited, of the fourt h part,"" was as follows: 1. The .sum of £150 in cash shall be paid to the secretary of the' said Seamen's Union to i-ovor legal nnd other expenses incurred and out of the said disputes, and the same be handed to him immediately the said pumping vessel actually puts to sea. 2. That 180 tons of coal be taken out of the vessel prior to leaving the port of Bunbury, and that 50 tons of fresh water as at present be retained on board the said vessel. 3. It is also agreed between the said parties that there shall be no stoppage of wages of man in connection with the incidents leadup to this agreement, and no prosecution in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, and no to go logging in respect thereof. The first port of call from Bunbury shall in Sumatra, and from thence to coal. Colombo, Perim, Port Said, and Oran. should be borne in mind that wheat gains weight in transit to England. The ship had about 80,000 bags of wheat on and board, and each bag on the trip would increase in weight by about 6 lb. The i p cargo would therefore increase in weight by about 200 tons, which, would mean another five inches of draught. The freeboard of the vessel was only about the height of the table above the water. The agreement proceeds5. This - agreement shall be in final settlement, legal and otherwise, between the parties concerned in relation to all disputes as above referred to. 6. It is also agreed between the parties that after several inspections it has ..been decided that 180 tons of coal is the amount to be discharged to settle the said dispute. 7. The discharge-book will not be affected by matters arising out of and leading to this agreement. 8. It .is also agreed, as a protection from further overloading, Chat no more coal he taken aboard between Bunbury and the TJnited JCingdom which, with the coal actually on board at any particular time, shall not exceed 365 tons. That would mean about a nine days' run. A few days later - Captain met Mr Spencer, the agent of the company, in Fremantle. The. newspapers of Western Australia had reported that an agreement had been readied, that the owners had admitted that the vessel was overloaded, and that they had entered into a contract whereby she would make only short runs, and would not be overloaded between Bunbury .and the United Kingdom. Captain Airey .said to him, ""You have put me in a nice hole. have reported that the ship was not overloaded, but you have said that she was overloaded, and have entered into guarantees to prevent further overloading."" Spencer replied, "" I have done of the kind,"" and he - wrote a letter to the West Australian stating that the signing of the agreement was not an admission that the ship was overloaded. ment, he added, was signed under duress. As against that, there is the last paragraph - of the agreement. Apart from the opinions of the seamen, everything-the evidence sworn in court by those adverse to the men, the records of the and legal - documents-shows ship left Denial Bay overloaded, and was overloaded at Bunbury. The owners, in the agreement, admitted that she was overloaded. In view of these facts, what grounds were there for charging blackmail the Seamen's Union, merely took humanitarian defence of the men. It long since the steamer went to sea and disappeared. ifr. Anstey. was loaded to her scuppers with wheat, and was full of coal for a long winter run, Unless the Seamen's Union take their .part, the oversea seamen are at the mercy of their skippers. I admit that, on the face of the documents, there is no evidence against the Director of Navigation. .He wired the Deputy Director of Navigation to investigate. There is direct evidence on the official files that the Deputy Director deliberately lied when he sent wires on one occasion, not in accordance - with statements made to his superior officer, or in accordance with sworn evidence and admissions made in court. The only excuse I can find for this officer is 'that he was acting in accordance with instructions given to him 'by ""the Director of .Navigation in connection with a case which arosepreviously. A vessel had - violated ""the provisions of the Navigation Airey Act, and when 'Captain Airey, tibe Deputy - Director .of .Navigation iin Western Australia, wired to his - chief to ask what action he should ±ake, he was told to take n o - action whatever. Alfhough certain ships were being navigated in contravention of 'the .law, he .was practically told to wink the other eye and perm it the law to be - a dead letter. The Director of Navigation practically told his deputy that if any one made a .noise I about .the matter, he should make the ship-owners wise as to what was being said, and tell them how they might bring their action into conforniitv with the law.  gentleman say when this was done? Mr ANSTEY,-This occurred last year in connection with :boats carrying The agree- black crews entering ports for - which they had no permit. When Captain Airey asked what he was to do in the matter, he was told to take no action, and that if any one demurred he should advise the owners as toi the course they should pursue. Such directions issued by the director to department, a subordinate might be put forward by that the Captain Airey in this case as an excuse for . what he did. Subordinate officers will usually t ry to act in conformity with the known wishes of their superiors. Captain Davis has in this - case charged the with officials .of the Seamen's Union with which blackmail. I do not stand for blackmail, action in or any attempt at it by any organization. is not I say it is the duty of the .Minister for Trevassus Trade and Customs .to take action against She the officers of the Seamen's Union, who are said' to have been guilty ofblackmail. If upon investigation the Minister is opinion that the evidence does not close any justification for the accusation, of blackmail, the officials responsible the accusation should be dealt with. it is shown that there was direct derelicthe tion of duty, and the ship was overDeputy loaded, it is the duty of the Minister substitute for the officers responsible who will administer the. law fairly, not merely in the interests of ship-owners, but in the interests, also, of the seamen who risk their lives at sea. I ask the Minister to do one of two thing's-t with the officials or with the alleged blackmailers.  Trade and. Customs) [4.55] - I . must express' my appreciation of the courtesy of the Acting Leader' of the Opposition (Mr Anstey) in giving me some little notice that he intended to refer to this case on the Estimates of the Trade and Customs Department today. I think we can both agree, in fairness to both sides, that its ramifications and"" intricate provisions makethe Navigation Act most difficult toadminister. I have bad an opportunity of perusing thepapers i this case, which I placed at the disposal of the Acting Leader of the Before dealing with the case,, it is necessary that I should say that accusations with regard to the men concerned were made at the instigation of the captain of the vessel and not of the officers of the. department. Briefly, facts of the case are that the Truro City left Denial Bay, i u South. Australia, the 3rd July, with a cargo of wheat. admitted by the honourable member for Bourke, the president of the Seastatements men's Union in Melbourne,, a couple of days after her departure, forwarded the Director of Navigation a telegram _ received from Denial Bay, to the effect that the ship was overloaded when leavthey ing that port. We both agree as to these facts. Steps were immediately taken to the vessel arrived at Bunbury. have the matterinvestigated'. Deputy Director of Navigation in they Western Australia wasinstructed by gram to proceed to Bunbury, the ship's next port of call, and detain her there unseaworthy if she was overloaded. her arrival at Bunbury an examination him. of the vessel was made and, according to the evidence on the file, of other persons besides the Deputy Director of Naviga-r of tion, Captain Airey,. there was no evidence disof overloading. More coal was loaded at Bunbury,. u n t i l the ship was, according to for experts,, just down to her - load line. The If harbour-master at Bunbury reported that ship waa not then overloaded. The Director of Navigation stated, to in a report, to the head office, that there men was no definite evidence insupport of the allegations that the vessel was overloaded, when she left Denial Bay. He reported most definitely that he thought o deal that the vessel was properly loaded and seaworthy at Bunbury. There is also considerable evidence culled from the newspapers that the vessel inspected and passed by firstthe Deputy Director of Navigation in WesternAustralia was perfectly seaworthy. The captain of the Huntress, and the captain of the Mesopotamia, attended the court when the case was in vestigated by the magistrate, and, although theywerenot called as witnesses, the solicitor, representing the ship informed the magistrate, of their attendance, and: of the fact that: they were pren pared to confirm the evidence tendered by Captain H a r r is as to the seaworthiOpposition ness, of the vessel. Mr E . RILEY - Were any seamen the major called aswitnesses?'  before the court charged by the captain the with the offence of refusing to serve. The crew left the vessel soon after loadon ing ceased at Bunbury, and themaster As took proceedings against them for being absent without leave. In view of the made, the magistrate hearing the charge is alleged to have visited the to vessel, ancl on returning to the court he ordered the crew to return to the vessel, stating that she was not overloaded when left her. The men returned to the ship on the 12th July, four days after They The informed the agent of the vessel that declined to discuss the position with, telehim, as they had placed the matter in the Hands of the secretary of the local as branch of the Seamen's Union, and On would accept any arrangements made by The vessel sailed from Bunbury on the 26th July after the agents had consented to the discharge of ISO tons of coal, and also, I am informed, had paid the representatives of the union £150 for what were termed legal expenses. I should like at this stage to read a letter that was sent by the agents of the vessel at Perth, Johnson and Lynn Limited , to Captain Airey. It is in the following terms:Referring to our conversation of this morning with reference to the paragraph appearing in Saturday's West Australian re the agreement entered into between the cre'w of s.s. Truro City and ourselves, this agreement does not in any way admit that we agreed that the steamer was at any time overloaded, and was only entered into under duress, and as Mr Houghton, secretary of tlic Seamen's Union, stated that until the. crew's demands were complied with the steamer would not be able to leave Bunbury. I had alreadyinterviewed the members of the crew, and they informed me that they declined to discuss the position with me as they had placed the matter in Mr Houghton's hands, and would accept any arrangements made with him. Under the circumstances, we had no other alternative but to accept their conditions, namely, £150 cash, and the ship to 'be lightened to the extent of 180 tons coal. This was done, and the steamer sailed from Bunbury on Saturday, 26th instant, after having been held up in Bunbury ahout seventeen days. The steamer was about 4 inches light when she sailed. Though admittedly they are ex parte there are two outstanding statements in that letter to which I direct attention. The writer says- "" The agreethe ment does not in any way admit that they Davis."" agreed that the steamer was overloaded and he further says that the agreement was entered into "" under duress."" ' Mr MATHEWS - Some of these people need a little duress.  ber suggests compulsion? Perhaps the to be a most capable officer, case would have ended there, and there would have been no reference whatever to the matter in this Parliament, but papers were forwarded to the head office, and the Director of Navigation submitted a report to me in connection with the matter. He suggested that the papers should be sent to the Solicitor-General for an opinion as to whether a prosecution would not lie against the union for incitperial ing the crew to break their agreement. The papers were sent on, and the opinion of the Solicitor-General was returned. ordered that no action should be taken, and honourable members will underpartmental stand what that meant. that the facts as I have stated them are fair l y substantiated by the file which I placed at the disposal of the honourable member for Bourke. I cannot extend to the honourable member's references to Captain Davis, Director of Navigation, the sympathy that they may deserve, because there is evidence in the speech of the honourable member, and also in the Seamen's Journal, that the Seamen's Union is doing its best to hound Captain Davis from the position he holds. The honourable member for Bourke, as a member of the Royal Commission on Navigation, signed his name to a minority report which suggested that Captain Davis, when giving evidence before that commission, had almost committed perjury . Officers of the Commonwealth have no opportunity to reply to accusations made against them by members of Parliament, and it ' is the responsibility of the Minister in charge of a department whose officers have been assailed, to put their case fairly before the House. The Australian Seamen's Journal has made exceedingly bitter comments upon Captain Davis, for what reason I have yet to ascertain. He is accused of depriving seamen of some of the advantages of the Australian awards on the slightest pretext, and in another paragraph it is said that, "" by the time this matter is settled there may be another man in position now held by Captain J . K in g In the administration of the "" ; Navigation Act, with the owners on the one side and the men on the other, and with labour fro m all parts of the world complicating the issues in our ports, it is impossible to please everybody, but I have worked with. Captain Davis, and I membelieve him to have a fair mind, and I know he exhibited some sense of fairness in the investigation of the Port Lyttleton the industrial trouble recently. He has held very onerous and responsible positions. Graduating from the forecastle, he acquired an extra master's certificate, and after the war he was in entire control of the British transport arrangements for the demobilization of the Australian I m Force. A Minister should take his officers as he finds them, and I do not intend to be prejudiced by ex parte stateI ments concerning Captain Davis. There have been references also to another deofficer, Captain Airey. A f t e r I think the remarks made by the honourable member for Bourke, it will be my duty to peruse most carefully the papers, because it is the desire of the Trade and Customs Department to avoid industrial troubles, and proceed with the work which it was created to do. I offer no opinion on the issue which has been raised this afternoon, but a cursory examination of the papers shows that Captain Airey's statements were endorsed by the Harbour Master at Bunbury, and several other independent captains, and the magistrate after taking evidence and visiting the ship, ordered the men to return to duty. I assure honourable members that it is my desire to administer the Navigation Act with absolute fairness, and I believe that the departmental officers try to do likewise. I hope that with that assurance the honourable member for Bourke will be satisfied.",26
26,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Bourke) [5.12] - The issue I raised this afternoon related to the Truro City, and not the Navigation Act or Captain Davis, but as the M i nister has thought fit to offer a defence Captain Davis, I assure him that I am not the instrument of a vendetta by an outside organization or individual. M opinions are based upon my own observaoverloading, tions. I would never take advantage of my position in Parliament to improperly assail an official, before I made any comments or signed any report, I said to the officer concerned, "" This is what I propose to say about you. Have you any answer to vessel offer to the commission or to me? If have any further evidence that will alter my opinion, I shall be pleased to hear it Could I have been fairer ? In regard to the Truro City, I said that when the vessel left Denial Bay, in South Australia, for Bunbury, it was loaded below the Plimsoll line. The Minister has not answered that statement, but on the 21st July Captain Airey reported to his chief, an admiles mission by the captain of the Truro City in private conversation, that had consumed 171 tons of coal and 35 tons of water on the passage from Denial Bay to Bunbury, and that that had lightened the ship. That additional weight of tons would have increased the draught by 5 inches, which means that the vessel was below the load line when leaving Thevenard. In his first report Captain Airey said that the vessel was not overloaded. In his later report he said that she was. In the light of the evidence that is before with the ship. us it is not necessary to ask seamen to go into court to prove the facts. Yet Captain Airey said that there was not sufficient evidence to justify a prosecution. What would justify a prosecution ? Surely if the vessel left port loaded below the Plimsoll mark a prosecution was justified. We have the evidence that when she left Thevenard she dragged her anchor, which, with 15 fathoms of chain, was abandoned. That would indicate that there was a pretty heavy strain on the cable, but the officers of the ship say that the break was due to a weak link. The lo3t chain was not replaced at any port in Western Australia. It is evident that the ship waa overloaded 4 or 5 inches when she left Denial Bay. The Minister laid emphasis on the statement made by the agents of the Truro City to Captain Airey in Perth. They said, "" We never admitted in the agreement that she was overloaded.""  ment was signed under duress.",30
27,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I have with me a of facsimile of the agreement signed by the captain and the agents, and in it they admit that the vessel was overloaded, and y agreed, as a precaution against further to take certain action. If the captain was being blackmailed there was no need for him to admit anything. and He could have said to the seamen, "" Here is your blood money ; let us go to sea."" If the men were only seeking blood money what did it matter to them whether the carried sufficient coal for the voyage you to Cape Town and sank, or merely sufficient to steam from port to port. ? There . "" is evidence, also, that the agents cabled to the owners in Britain for permission to take out 160 tons of wheat, and take in 50 more tons of coal. The owners replied instructing the agents not to take out any wheat but to take out coal. The result was that the ship could not steam 4,000 to Cape Town, so her destination was altered to Mauritius, a distance of he 3,000 miles; then it was shortened to Colombo, and finally to Padang, in Sumatra. Let. the Minister investigate this matter. He has admitted that Captain Davis suggested that the men should be 206 prosecuted - Well, prosecute them. ",30
28,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,Prosecut e the officials of the Seamen's Union. ,30
29,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"No , ib is on the officialfile. I repeat that I amnot the instrument of a vendetta by any organization. I am actuated by my own knowledge of the character of some of the officials in this country. Many of the provisions of the Navigation Act are peculiar to Australia. Most of the officers of the Navi gation Department areabsolutely antagonistic to the act. They have no sympathy whatever with the White Australia policy.",31
30,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,"That is not correct.. Mr AjSTSTEY - I have a perfect right to state my own views, even if they may be incorrect; but the opinion that I have arrived at from the facts as I understand them is that the officers of the Navigation Department are absolutely hostile to the act. They favour, of course, an act based on that of Great Britain , which would give them greater emolument without the extra responsibility imposed by our act - As a member of the Navigation Committee, I refuse to sign any m a j o r it y or minority report made by the other' members, or to make any statement u n t i l Mr Oakley, Captain Davis, or other officers of the Navigation Department have cleared my mind of any prejudice or misconception that I may have formed because of the investigations of the committee. Truro City is a case in point, and there are many others. . There can be no effective administration of the Navigation Department u n t i l it is controlled by nn officer who has a desire, not, only.to conform to the letter of the law, but also to maintain the White Australia policy. It is true that skippers have risen from the fo'castle, and it is also true that some men who-have risen from pick and shovel work have made the worse bosses. It is no recommendation tq say that a man has risen from the fo'castle. The old type of skipper knew no law but the belaying pin. The old methods of handling men have been superseded, and if Captain Davis wishes to have the support of the men who go down to the sea in ships, he should administer the act fair l y and impartially. MT . LATHAM (Kooyong) [5.24] Under item 174 of the tariff schedule it is possible to admit free of duty machines, machine tools, and appliances, as prescribed by departmental by-laws. I have been concerned with a case which indicates to my mind that the Minister's discretion allowed under the by-laws is not fair l y exercised. I shall refer to the facts of this case so that the committee may understand what is being done under this item of the tariff. A well-known company in Melbourne, the Commonwealth Barbed Wire and N a i l Works Proprietary Limited, i m ported in 1923 a nail-making machine, the cost of which, f.o.b. at New York was £338 . The duty charged here on that machine was £ 1 3 3 7s. The company afterwards discovered that, earlier in the same year a number of similar machines had been admitted duty free for the use of"" a competitor in Western Australia.. Application was then made for a refund of the duty. The reply from the department was that the departmental practice was such as not to make it permissible, as long as that practice existed, to return the duty. The duty had been lift ed for one day and one day only-fro m 31st March to 1st A p r i l, 1923-to permit, the importation of tliese machines into Western Australia. I do not complain of the admission of them duty free, because, according to the department, and according, to the information that I have The received, such machines cannot be manufactured in Australia.; but what is fair in Western Australia, is also fair in Victoria, and it, appears to. me unfair andunjust to admit several machines free of duty in Western Australia, and a few months later to charge a duty of £133 7s. on the sametype of machine imported into Victoria. Theexplanation of the department is double barrelled, and I desire to place it . fair l y before the committee so that honourable members may judge whether the policy behind the explanation is satisfactory. The first point in a letter, dated the 5th June, addressed to me from the department is that the Victorian company imported the machine without previously notifyin g the department that it was about to import it . The Western Australian company on the other hand notified the department before the machine was imported. That is one ground of distinction, taken by the department.",31
31,Mr WEST,Unknown,That is a regulation?,31
32,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"I do not know whether it is a regulation or not, but it appears to me to be an altogether insufficient and improper ground for the distinction that was made. There is no reason in it at all. If it is fair that a man in one state should be permitted to import a. machine duty free, it 13 equally fair that another man should bring in a similar machine free, and that he should not suffer because he had failed to notify the department that it was his intention to import it . That distinction fails altogether. The essential matter to be considered by the department, respecting the second importation, wa3 whether a machine of the kind imported could be made in Australia at that time. There is no dispute about - that. Such a machine could not be manufactured here at the time of the Western Australian importation, nor at' the time of the Victorian importation. The departmental letter further stated that it was the practice of the Minister to make a concession on machinery which waa necessary for certain industries, and which could not be manufactured in Australia, and to admit the first importation free of duty, provided access to it was given to local engineers in order that the mechanism might be available as a model. Several machines were admitted duty free into Western Australia, although there was no reason to allow more than one to be. imported merely as a model. Further, from a practical point of view, of what use to Victoria, as a model, is a machine in Western Australia? This machine is not and cannot be made here.",32
33,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,An inspection of the machine might show that it could not 'be made here.,32
34,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"I am informed that this machine cannot be made here. would poiut out to the committee the injustice of this method of exercising the discretion reposed in the Minister, which was really intended to confer an advantage upon Australian manufacturers. The idea of putting Item 174 in the tariff schedule wa3 to permit machines and machine tools for use in Australian production, which could not be manufactured here, to be admitted free if brought from Great Britain , or in other cases subject to a 10 per cent. duty. The intention of Parliament is being frustrated by the practice of admitting duty free, as a model, only the first importation of a certain type of machine. The idea of using this machine as a model is illusory, because a single machine is, in practice, not available to the whole of the trade. In fact, the trade would not know bhat the machine was in Australia. On the l'9th June, this year, I wrote to the department asking it to send me a copy of the regulations under which a concession was made in Western Australia, and refused, in Victoria. I received a. reply from the present Minister, dated the 2nd July, but it did not contain the regulation that I had asked for, and which I thought might throw some light on this peculiar :set of facts.. He informed me that he had carefully perused the correspondence on the subject, and, under all the circumstances, he .saw no reason to disturb the action taken by his predecessor six months ago. I have - again written to the - department asking for a copy of - the regulations, but have not yet received it . I do not know whether the regulation justifies these proceedings, but if it does, then it is opposed to - the spirit of the legislation enacted by this Parliament, and should, therefore, be altered. . Mr MANN (Perth) [5.35] - If the Minister will give me his assurance that the inquiry by the Tariff Board with reference to duties on agricultural machinery, which is said to be proceeding, will be an .open one, on the lines laid down in the amendments recently made to the Tariff Board Bill in this House, I shall have nothing furthe r to say regarding this matter. As some evidence has probably already been taken in private, I desire the further assurance that, i u that case, the inquiry will be reopened, so that both the importers and the manufacturers, as well as any others who may be interested, may have the fullest I opportunity to hear the evidence, and to produce such rebutting evidence as they may desire to bring before the board. This is in essence an inquiry with a view to a revision of the tariff.  Trade and Customs) [5.37] - I desire, first of all, to make some observations regarding the - remarks of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham). The honourable member referred to item 174, "" Machines and machine tools and appliances, as prescribed by departmental by-laws."" The honourable member also raised the question of a one-day classification of a machine-.under this item, and of some apparent inconsistencies in its administration. From the date mentioned by the honourable member it will be clear that I , personally, have had nothing to do with the particular decision under review. Nevertheless, I shall not be forced by a second or third, or even a ninth application for concessional items, into reviewing all the decisions made in previous years. I am speaking entirely from memory when I say that I was under the impression that soon after my accession to office I received a note from the honourable member in.which he asked me to review this particular item. That will be attended to. I again inform the honourable member that as all these applications to classify items under item 174 are for reductions of duties, the department necessarily must be exceedingly careful that it does not in terfere with the will of Parliament, which imposed specific duties for the protection of Australian industries. That is the principle which guides the actions of the department with regard to these items.",32
35,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"A principle which we all wish to see enforced.  ported into Australia which are not commercially made in this country, and particularly if they are for the benefit of our primary and secondary industries, they will be admitted under this concessional item 174.",33
36,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"The machine to which I referred was not admitted under those conditions.  partment has not laid down any hard and fast rules of conduct, like the laws of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be altered, in connection with requests for notice of importation, I point out that inquiry at the Customs Office will greatly facilitate the business of importers, for the reason that experience there has shown that hundreds of imported articles, which importers ask to be placed under this concessional item, are made in Australia. The department can give information to would be importers which should be siifficient to satisfy them that their requests cannot be complied with. The honourable member referred to the importation of a machine duty free for one day. That action was quite reasonable. If a concession of duty, which is equivalent to a present of money, is given to the importer of a machine, it is reasonable that he should give to others an opportunity to examine the machine with a view to similar machines being made here. The honourable member, I understand, referred to a planing machine.",33
37,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"I referred to a nailmaking machine. Several were imported into Western Australia, and one into Victoria.  were probably different. I am not acquainted with the details of this case, but 1 can inform the honourable member that matter nail-making machines are made in Australia. I shall carefully peruse the honourable member's remarks in Hansard, and shall again investigate the case, but I anticipate that vfi discrepancy in the actions, of the Department will be disclosed. The Tariff Board has already maae some progress in connection with its in quiry into the effect of the tariff on agricultural machinery. The board has received a deputation from those who wish to see the duty lifted, and also one from those who desire to see the local industry established on sound lines.",33
38,Mr MANN,Unknown,"That is not taking evidence.  some evidence in Victoria, and it proposes to visit New South Wales and the other states i u due course in connection with its inquiries. As soon as the T a r i ff Board Bill becomes law, the board must take evidence on oath in accordance with the provisions of that law.",33
39,Mr MANN,Unknown,"Will that apply to the action already taken?  has been done by the T a r i ff Board during the last twelve or eighteen months, which, in my opinion, should be preserved. If some evidence in relation to agricultural implements has already been taken, not on oath, and if , later, furthe r evidence must be taken on oath, it may be necessary to re-enter some of the regions of investigation to obtain evidence on oath so that a proper report may be presented.",33
40,Mr MANN,Unknown,"I take it that is a definite assurance from the Minister that that will be done?  direct in my reply, and I hope that it is considered satisfactory.",33
41,Mr A GREEN,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [5.47]. - I desire to direct the Minister's attention to the buffalo fly pest, which is affecting the Kimberley district, in Western Australia, and also the Northern Territory. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) and myself have for some time been in communication with the members of the Institute of Science and Industry regarding this matter. It appears that up to date the matter has been practically side-tracked, but that was not because of any remissness on the part of the late Minister for Customs. We found that the Institute of Science and Industry, after nearly twelve months had elapsed, sent a letter to the Western Australian Government, and that there had been considerable haggling as to the proportion of the expense which should be borne by the Commonwealth and the state respectively. There the matter remains, while the pest is taking charge of the cattle in the north»western portion of Western Australia and in the Northern Territory. I hope that the Minister has some additional information regarding this matter. I desire also to refer to the work of the Australian trade representative in the East. Since I have been in this House, I have not seen a report from that officer. I do not say that he is not doing useful work, but we are entitled to know what benefit the country is receiving from the expenditure of £2,500 on his office. The late Minister was dissatisfied with the efforts of the late Trade Commissioner in China, Mr E. S. Little. It will be within the memory of honourable members that literature was disseminated by him, indicating the disaster which was likely to follow our efforts to establish trade with China, if his services were dispensed with. While it may be advisable to have a government representative in the East, that being the natural market for much of Australia's produce, I believe our trade can be extended only by the different industries in Australia appointing direct representatives, who are familiar with the details of their respective businesses. could get into touch with the government representative, if there was one. Only in that way can the government representative be made of any use. Let us see what benefit we have derived from the ap[166] pointment of Mr Sheaf, at a salary of £2,500, in the Straits Settlements. In 1918 our exports to the Straits Settlements were valued at £1,563,000, and in 1921-22 they were valued at £1,876,000. That represents an appreciable increase, but our export trade to Singapore is only 1.47 per cent, of the total trade to that port, which, like Hong Kong, is a large distributing centre for the surrounding territory. Our exports to China ' in 1918-19 were £314,000, and in 1921-22, £509,000. Those figures represent a slight increase, but the balance of trade was against us, because in 1918-19 we imported £1,094,000, and in 1921-22 £950,000 worth of goods from China. I draw from personal experiences my opinion regarding the value of trade commissioners. I was in China a few years ago, when I was a member of the Par- 1 liament of Western Australia. I got into touch with Mr Holyoake, a member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. He was the most democratic member of that assembly, and' that was why I selected him. He introduced me to trade representatives, and, having previously written to several firms in Australia, I made inquiries to ascertain why Australian traders did not do more business there. I inquired particularly regarding Swallow and Ariell's biscuits, Jones' jams, canned fruits, dried fruits, and fresh fruits. The representatives of Messrs. Swallow and Ariell and Messrs. Henry Jones and Company told me that these estimable firms, the quality of whose products is certainly unexcelled, were unable to secure a fair portion of the trade because they would not pack their goods to suit the Chinese market. I do not presume to dictate to such firms about the management of their businesses, but it is right that I should mention the facts to honourable members to show why Australian manufacturers are not doing the amount of trade that we consider they should do. Perhaps these firms do not regard the trade in that part of the world as being sufficiently .important to warrant special treatment. The packages of some of the goods were blue, which is the colour of Chinese halfThey mourning. Anything more likely to prejudice our products in China could hardly have been devised. I mention that fact to illustrate the loose methods of our manufacturers in their trade relations with the East. What I was most concerned about was our trade in oranges apples with Hong Kong, which is a British settlement, and is much nearer to Australia than it is to San Francisco. Our fruit is as good as any that is raised in California, and, although the assistance of the intellect of Little, the essential facts do not seem to have been stressed. oranges and apples are of a quality ought to beat the.American apples out of the Chinese market. manufactured goods, of course, the prospects are different. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) produced to honourable members a very ornate packet that had contained fornian raisins. It was sold at 3d.' jn Australia, and 10 cents in China, Philippines, and the Straits Those raisins were 'packed much more ornately than ours, although the Sunraysed product is packed very well. Th«Sunraysed dried fruits are as good as, if not better than, the but they have representatives pushing their goods-we An American who recently came from Hong Kong and the Philippine told me that he was surprised, until he found that we had no direct tives there, that our products had not a greater hold on the Hong Philippine markets. Meat Council sent .a representative to the East, ancl that was the right line of action. American trade representatives over China. Very little will be achieved in extending our trade in the East unless the producers of Australia appoint direct representatives and spend a few-thousand pounds to advertise their products The presence of Mr Sheaf at Singapore, and of Mr Little in China, is of no value to the Australian people. I was in Singapore about a year ago. A member of the Western Australian Parliament, now a Minister, was with me. His business was to find a market for Australian flour and other goods in Singapore. I plead ignorance as to the presence there at that time of an Australian trade representative, who was costing us £2,500 a year. I did not it until a week after I left. with my friend to to whom we had letters of Englishmen and Chinamen but we were never directed, nor did the Mr A. Green. thought enter our minds, or the minds and of the merchants with whom we negotiated, to ask to be directed to Mr Sheaf. As far as 1 know, no report of Mr . Sheaf's activities has been tabled in Parwe had liament. I am not finding fault with Mr him, for I . recognize that I may have had bad luck in missing him ; but I assert Australian that a government representative cannot that be expected to know the requirements of oranges and all industries. With  the honourable member. recently Mr A . GREEN - Let me direct attention to the different methods pursued in Cali- China before the war by the merchants of other countries. The English, the French, and Russian firms adopted similar Settlements. methods. They established branches or agencies that had no special knowledge of the articles to be sold. Those agencies employed compradores, who are well educated Chinese. They speak English Californian, fluently, understand the requirements there, of the Chinese trade, and are have not. trusted implicitly. They do all the selling, and get what is called a Islands "" cumshaw,"" which represents their profit as middlemen. The Englishrepresenta- man in business in Singapore know nothing of the comprador's relations with his Kong and Chinese customers. Before the war the The Australian Germans sent from their own industries men who understood the particular business with which they were connected, swarm and could sell the articles they were required to sell. These men went with a knowledge of the dialect of the province in which they were to work. They sold direct to the Chinese, and as a result the Germans in China were rapidly overhaulthere. ing their competitors. The British authorities in Hong Kong have not been blind to the necessity for educating English merchants in the different dialects. The U n i versity of Hong Kong has done excellent who is work, but its facilities for teaching the Cantonese and other dialects have never Western been properly utilized by the trading population. But the methods of the Germans were entirely different. They availed themselves of every facility that offered. They attended the Hong Kong University know to learn the Chinese dialects, and thus I went used an English university to assist them different firms to fight their rivals in trade. I should introduction. like to be informed of some of the actiassisted us, vities of Mr Sheaf in Singapore.",34

It is a very imporless tant item to universities and educational institutions, for it provides that scientific apparatus for the use of universities - educational institutions may be admitted to this country free of duty if it cannot reasonably be manufactured in Australia. Many difficulties have arisen in the ministration of this item, which was certhe tainly intended by Parliament' to operate in favour of education and the advancecated elsewhere. ment of science and learning. The Customs Department has to determine whether the articles can reasonably he manufactured in Australia. I have been tralia. associated for a long time with the government of the Melbourne University, and am acquainted with the other univerorable sities of Australia, all of which have pealed to me to do what I can to improve tration. the administration of this item. complaints are not very serious in Melinstruments, bourne, because decisions here have been reasonably prompt, but when apparatus is they can for their students. imported into the other capitals, months are sometimes lost in obtaining departbuy mental decisions. The department rethey quires notification in advance of the articles proposed to be imported, and months may pass before a decision is given. The result is that education is suffering because of departmental ineffibe ciency. The ex-Minister for Trade and Customs (Sir Austin Chapman) gave directions that these questions admission should be handled on the 'spot, and that there should be ho retific ference to Melbourne unless such referwell. ence was unavoidable; but I still hear from the universities that such questions are referred to Melbourne. A conference of university representatives held in Adelaide within the last fortnight, stated that the difficulties still exist, and that it is impossible to obtain prompt mental decisions. I feel sure that I shall have the sympathy of the Minister my request that decisions be given promptly, and locally whenever possible. I hope that the Minister will and unambiguous instructions to that effect. I wish now to refer to something else which arises under the administration of the same item in the tariff. Some these articles of scientific apparatus must be of a particular description or type, I and are manufactured only by particular manufacturers. In certain cases it is useto have anything else for the scientific instruction of students here. Unless they can be instructed with a particular instruand ment, they are not properly instructed. In such cases it is of no use to inquire whether these special instruments can be made in Australia. They are not made adin Australia, and they are required for instruction of our students, if they are to be as proficient as students edu",36

The heart of the honourable gentleman is in the right place if his memory is a little def eotive. vite the sympathetic atteutiou of the honourable gentleman to these matters as being important to education in Australia. There are very few things that are as important as education. Before I resume my seat I wish to say a word upon another subject. I see, with very great regret, that there has not yet been any satisfactory recognition by the Government of the great services that could be rendered by the Institute of Science and Industiy. There are, perhaps,, greater possibilities for Australia in the institute than in any of our other activities. We are not, as a nation, attempting to use the best abilities in the country in scientific research in the publio interest. We have ever so many problems to solve in Australia. The universities are inundated with them, and are unable to cope with them all. Looking at the matter merely from the material point of view, we might save millions every year as the result of a few discoveries which might be made by the expenditure of a few thousand pounds, but the Government will not provide our able scientists with money for their investigations. This is a penny wise, pound foolish policy.",37
48,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"Denison) [6.13] - I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs something to which I think he can attend as a matter of administration. Certain repairs are being carried out at the present time in connection with the Customs House at Hobart. It is very remarkable that those occupying this very fine building for so many years should have had to depend upon an obsolete gas lighting system. Now that repairs to the building are being carried out, I hope that the Minister will see that an electric lighting system is installed there.",37
49,Mr MARR,Unknown,"Parkes) [6.15] - I can endorse what has been said by the honor-' able member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) with respect to the admission of certain articles coming up for review by officials of theTrade and Customs Department. I can refer to the case of certain machines used in the manufacture of boots. These machinesare made practically in only one part of the world, and they are not sold, but aare only leased, to various boot, manufacturing firms in Australia.. We have for years imposed a very high duty on these machines. During, the last few I in- years, in respect to quite a number of them, the duty has been increased by 80 per cent., although the rent obtained for them by the makers has remained the same. This matter has been under discussion since 1922. In March last, the department advised that further inquiries-were being made in England as to the production cost of these machines in order that a basis might be established for the imposition of the duties. Our tariff is a protective and not a revenue tariff, and as these machines are not and cannot be made in Australia, our own industries are being injured by the imposition of high duties upon them, which merely add to the costs of production of manufacturers of boots in Australia, who have to compete with firms in other parts of the world. If any duty is imposed upon these machines it should be merely a nominal one. With respect to what has been said by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mt. A . Green), I agree that trade with the East is a vital matter for Australia. I understand that the Minister for Trade and Customs is prepared to recommend the Government to pay the travelling expenses of commercial agents who will collect orders for Australian goods in the East. I contend that the sending of commercial travellers to the East to collect orders will not meet the case. No one will gainsay the fact that the East offers a tremendous opening to Australian producers, primary and secondary. One has only to visit Java to see the necessity for some organized system of marketing Australian products. Boats running to Java every four or five weeks carry fresh fruit in refrigerated chambers, and it has to be sold within 30 hours after it is taken from those chambers. In order to secure the fruit for sale, natives in Surabaya deposit bicycles and all sorts of things as a guarantee that they will pay for the fruit after they have sold it. The crux of our difficulty is the lack of cold storage in eastern ports. I understand that the Dutch Government is prepared to pay half the cost of providing cold storage at Surabaya. We could send a tremendous amount of fresh fruits from Australia to Java if on their arrival they could be placed in cold storage, and a continuous supply provided. To show what Australian producers are up against I may mention that one shipment of dried fruits was sent from Adelaide eighteen months ago. It was placed on board the boat at from 4^d. to b\ per lb. It arrived in the East at a maximum price of 6^d. per lb. The growers of the fruits on the Murray received a debit note of 16s. lOd. per ton, whilst the fruits were retailed in shops in the East at 2s. 4d. per lb. Mr E. RILEY - The Minister for Trade and Customs cannot alter that.",37
50,Mr MARR,Unknown,"I have said that the honpopulation orable gentleman's proposal is to commercial agents to the East to collect to orders for Australian products, but the first thing to do is to establish a organized marketing. Unless this is whilst a traveller may collect orders once at Shanghai or Hong Kong and Surabaya, he will never collect any more. We cansioners not compete with American exporters in the East with our present lack of any tem of marketing. The big firms here buy from local manufacturers, and sell to busithe ness houses in the East who do not themselves distribute the goods. They sell to wholesale houses, who again sell to dissire tributors, who sell to the men in the bazaars, where the goods are bought by public. The Americans send their goods direct to distributing agencies in the East. We can never hope to sell our products until we have a proper marketing system. valorem.",38
51,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,A Commonwealth GoTerritory. vernment marketing agency.,38
52,Mr MARR,Unknown,"No ; I do not believe i that; we should leave this business to the private firms. The American people sell their goods abroad as American goods, without distinguishing the firms that produce them. Until we can adopt the same co-operative principle in the marketing of our goods, we shall never do a big trade abroad. Tor many years past the Commonwealth Government has been wasting money on commercial agents in the Orient. Their positions have been more or less social. New South Wales has' had a commercial agent in the east for the last twenty years. If a commercial traveller for a business firm wrote reams of reports to say that the firm could do no business in the district entrusted to his care, he would soon get the sack. What results have the Government agents been able to show? Leave the finding of new markets to the private firms. The Canadian Government has established in Shanghai an exhibition hall; the rent is paid by the Government, and every Canadian who has goods to sell has a right to exhibit and sell them from that centre. In the same way the Commonwealth Government might help the producers of Australia to market their goods. It is useless to send out government commercial agents. There are 600,000,000 people in the Far East, and if we can only reach 10 per cent, of them, we shall have a market of 60,000,000 people, or ten times the of Australia. If it is necessend sary to send commercial travellers all centres, small and large, throughout Australia to collect orders, system of surely it is even more imperadone, tive to pay similar attention to all the principal cities and towns in the East. I am afraid that trade commiswill be as big a failure in the sysfuture as they have in the past, and I urge the Minister to seriously consider discontinuance of these appointments. Jlr. JACKSON (Bass) [6.24] - I deto direct the attention of the committee to the matter - of film censorship. the When the tariff was under consideration about three years ago, honourable members opposite drew attention to the proposal to impose a duty on imported films at so much per foot, instead of ad I was then in the Northern This chamber adopted the ad valorem duty, but it was rejected in n another place. I regret that decision, because the flat rate of l i d . per footon foreign films-British films are allowed to enter free of duty-ha s a detrimental effect on the production of British films, and hinders the development of film production in Australia. The newseducational. papers and. advertisement hoardings indicate that, in respect of picture 'shows, Australia is becoming more Americanized every day. At a recent conference one .Bpeaker said that American films could be divided into two classes-the half thac are rotten, and the other half that worse. I do not fully endorse that statement, but the figures I shall submit regarding the .censorship of films will startle the committee. We also from time to time sordid details of the happenings amongst the "" movie "" comcourse munities on the western coast America, principally at Hollywood. wife stealing, and there The American film combines pracdoubt tically control all the big picture theatres, and not only receive some of their profits, but also extract from the smaller theatres immense rentals, I know, from personal experience, that the small picture shows make very small profits.

53,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Is the honourable member thinking of the artists' Sydney? ' Mr JACKSON - The orgy that is ported to have occurred at that gathering is one of the consequences of screening a certain class of picture in Australia. The censorship statistics would convince honourable members of that. The reputaare tion of our singers, actors, and resses is world-wide, and there is the slightest doubt that we have the for film production, but the flat rate duty givc3 no encouragement to an tralian producer, and an unfair advantheatres tage to the expensive film. We read the production of some big picture cost $100,000 or $200,000; yet the on it per foot is no higher than that small comedy produced for a few sand dollars. That anomaly should not exist. An imported machine is subject to duty according to its value, and the same principle should apply to picture films. Last year, Australia imported ably destroyed. 20,041,126 feet of film under item 1094, and, under item. 1096- "" films, n.e.i."" 3,757,451 feet.

54,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to S p.m.,39
55,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"Before the adjournment, I stated that of 24,000,000 feet of film imported into Australia only 75,000 feet were for educational purposes. are What is even more deplorable is the nature of many of the films and their pernicious effect upon the children and read youth of this country, who make millions of visits to the picture theatres in the of a year. Many of the pictures of deal exclusively with husband or is no that crimes which are committed day after day by the youth of this country are attributable to the pernicious pictures screened in many of our and theatres. Picture screening is a tremendous business. During the financial year 1922-23 no less than 66,000,000 admissions were paid for in the picture theatres of Australia alone. This works out at twelve visits an inhabitant a year. As thousands of people living in the country newer see a picture show, ball in and thousands living in towns see a picture show perhaps once a week, it recan be imagined what effect picture films have upon the people in the capital cities. The Minister should try, if possible, to increase the number of educational films, and to decrease the' number of films which having a harmful effect upon the comactmunity. I am credibly informed that the not wonderful films which were screened betalent fore honourable members, showing the deof velopment of our country life and indusAustries, have been offered to the various here for free use, but have been that refused, so great is the influence of the has film combine in Australia. Not only that, duty but private companies producing other on a Australian films find it very difficult thouto screen them in our theatres.

57,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"Exactly . I go further, and say that it is the Minister's duty to find out who are the people responsible for the production of . those films, and to prohibit the importation of their films into Australia. In addition to the films that were cut, sixteen were entirely rejected. The censorship of films is costing Australia £50 per week, but even if it cost £500 or £5,000 per week, the expenditure would be justified. It is time that 'we as Australians turned our faces towards London instead of to Los Angeles.",40

59,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,Of course not. I have seen some of the censored films.,40
60,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,Has the honourable member seen some of the films that were not allowed to be shown to the public?,40
61,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"Yes . I saw certain films in Sydney, and it amazed me to think that any one could be found to take part in their production, and others to exploit them throughout various counof tries. Honourable members in Melbourne were invited to see clippings from cenAmerican sored films recently; but one ex3d. perience of that kind was quite enough for me. The philanthropic work of many wealthy Americans throughout the world has been of immense benefit, but it is being counter-balanced by the American trade in pernicious picture films. I force the film combines in Australia to use Australian and Britisli films, in preference to American films. I suggest that this, can be done by restricting the portation of American films by 10 per cent, this year, on last year's importamised tions, a further 10 per cent, next year, and the following year, to 50 .per cent, of last year's importations. This would give the American producers plenty of warning, allow the British proture ducers to cater for the Australian trade, and also give Australians an opportunity to commence the manufacture of films here. The Minister should endeavour to impose an ad valorem duty, inuse stead of a flat rate of l ^ d . a foot of film. I suggested recently to a person interested in the picture film business, that the importation of film should be restricted by 50 per cent. within three years. He said to me, "" Do you know what that would mean?"" I said, ""Yes, it would close half of the theatres."" He said, ""Think of all the people who would be thrown out of work!"" I have yet to be told that it would be a national calamity if a large number of our picture theatres were closed, and if the management of them were forced to buy Australian and British films. During the year 1922-3, 1,269,069 feet of film were imported into this country from the TJnited Kingdom, and 20,674,548 feet from the United States of America. No less than seveneighths of the number of films imported into this country comes from the United States of America.",40
62,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,Can the honourable member say what is the value of the American films imported here?,40
63,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"No , but I can give the honourable member some idea of the farcical way in which these films are valued. The film combines pay here a duty of l j d . per foot, and in Great Britain, a duty of 5d. per foot. Recently the price unexposed film was 3d. per foot, yet the value here, for Customs purposes, of developed films, is put down at per foot. The position is ridiculous. The fixing of duty on picture films should be placed on a proper footing, in order to give the British and Australian producers the opportunity to screen their films in this country, films with a sentiment that want to is entirely British or Australian.",40
64,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [8.10]. - I recently asked the Minister for Trade imand Customs a question respecting the importation of picture films, and he proto investigate the whole matter during the recess, to see if a more satisfactory state of affairs could not he brought about. I do not wish to indulge in wholesale condemnation of picfilms, as I have seen some, that have been delightfully refreshing and wonderfully educative to me. A number of communications have been received by some honourable members, urging them to their influence to ensure a better class of picture being shown in Australia. It is quite possible that the screening of films will have a damaging effect upon the eyesight of the people, more especially half a generation hence. The oculists aud the medical men of Australia should be asked to make some estimate of the damage that is sustained by the eyesight in viewing the screening of pictures. This is a cheap form of amusement and, for that reason, very popular with the working class. There is no doubt that continual attendance at picture shows must have a detrimental effect upon a person'""s ©yes. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) mentioned the case of a certain firm in Victoria, which imported a machine from Great Britain, and later applied to the Customs Department for a refund of duty, because machines of a similar type had previously been admitted into Western Australia free of duty. I understand that the Minister for Trade and Customs refused to refund the duty. I can quite understand that; because many firms in Australia have branches in each capital city, and it is quite likely that a branch in, say, Western Australia, might obtain permission to import a certain machine free of duty, and another branch, perhaps under another name, in another state, might apply later for. a similar concession. If the permission were granted, machines of a similar type could be landed free in each of the states, and thus six machines might be admitted into Australia free of duty. One pattern machine is sufficient to be introduced free, as from it others can be made.",40
65,Mr MANN,Unknown,"In this case, the applito cations were not from the same firm.",41
66,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"In this particular stance, that may be so, but conber cessions of the nature I have indicated could be asked for. During the war, when importations were restricted, machines, based on pattern machines obtained from abroad, were made in tralia, and proved satisfactory. should we not carry out the same system in time of peace, and thus provide emstill ployment for our people and establish new industries? I make a plea on behalf of our lighttions, house-keepers, who are doing valuable work round the Australian coast. any body of men is doing valiant duty in the interests of the whole community, and particularly of those who go down to sea in ships, it is this noble in our lighthouses who control the lights that guide navigators when travelling along the coast at night. If anything can be done to relieve the tedium of their lives, I do not think that this Parliament will deny it. Wheu I think of men and women, and sometimes children also, living in isolated positions on our coast, with no opportunity for entertainment or means of education, I cannot but feel that they are worthy of the best that we can do for them. This is the day of wireless broadcasting. Atcomparatively little expense, these people could have the monotony of their isolated existence relieved to a great extent by the provision of listening-in sets. Those sets might well be supplied by the Government. By such means these persons would be brought into touch with the rest of the world in a manner which now is impossible. The Minister may find some better means of assisting these people, but something should be done for them. Some of us, who have visited them at their lonely stations,. know something of the conditions - under which they live. Life to them is more in the nature of a tragedy than real living. They receive their salaries and their supplies from time to time, but beyond such periodical visits they come little in contact with the world. They see little of any one but the members of their own families. I hope that the Minister will give this suggestion his earnest consideration.",41

I have travelled along a considerable portion of the Australian coast, and know something of the livin g conditions of those in charge of our lighthouses. Many of those along the Queensland coast have their supplies thrown into the water in sealed casks. Honourable members have probably heard of the case of the lighthouse keeper who> having lost his reason, took a number of children out in a boat, never to return. I trust that the suggestion of the honourable member for M a r i byrnong will not be lost sight of. We were promised that when the Prime Minister went to England the question of a 10 per cent, preference in relation to goods imported into Australia which were of 25 per cent. British manufacture would be considered. A considerable time has elapsed since the right honourable gentleman returned to Australia, yet up to date nothing has been clone. should not object to the great increase in Customs revenue during recent years if we felt that the imported, goods were really of Bi-itish manufacture, bul honourable members know that to comply with the requirement that the goods shall be of 25 per cent.

I appeal to him particularly as Leader of the Country party. name "" strawboard "" indicates that the principal raw material used in the manui facture of the article is straw.

Those farmers who thresh their crops sell straw to the strawboard manufacturers. As the locally manufacfacture. tured strawboard is of a quality satisfactory for the binding of parliamentary rethe preference? ports and statutes, it should be pui'chased by the Tender Board in preference to strawboard from Holland, Japan, or other countries. Our most serious competitors in this business are Holland and Japan - low-wag e countries, against which it impossible for our mills to compete with the out adequate protection. I hear that one of our big mills has closed down because the Commonwealth Government, in comsubstantial mon with other users of cardboard and strawboard, is purchasing the cheap labour product of other countries. bers of the Opposition do not stand for that kind of thing. If the wealth Government is accepting tenders from Japan and Holland, it is not doing what the State Governments are doing. The Victorian Government has given orders to all its departments to use locally manufactured articles whenever they are and fair in the public interest. obtainable. If the Commonwealth vernment would do the same we should have our people employed in using the waste products of our farms. I hope the Treasurer will confer with the board, and lay down the principle, if it is already laid down, that the board must deal with Australian manufacturers. That is a fair request to make. surer may smile",42

72,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Then why are the facKembla. tories closing ? They were in existence not only during, but before, the war, and they supplied Australian demands satisfactorily. The Government might as well paste over all its office doors the sign, "" No Australians need apply,"" for under its. regime Australians are being thrown out of employment, factories are being of closed, and the cheap products of other of countries are being imported.",43

It is the practice of all Australian governments to give preference, but they do not disclose the extent of it . I admit that last year some strawboard was imported Meminto this country.

I am informed by the board that all recent requirements have been bought from Australian mills, and that practice will be continued as long as the rates asked are reasonable I Gocan say from my personal knowledge that the board gives every encouragement to up the Australian manufacturer by allowing him a substantial monetary preference, and by furnishing him with all the in not formation necessary to enable him to undertake the manufacture of articles required by the Government.

76,Mr A GREEN,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [8.43] I suggest that the Treasurer should consider the issuing of a new set of postage stamps more in accordance with modern requirements than the existing stamps. They could be made a valuable advertising medium. There are precedents for sucli issues in Canada, America, and other countries, which from time to time have issued very fine sets of stamps depicting their principal industries. I suggest that our stamps should depict the pastoral, mining, and other industries of Australia. It is true that Tasmania took the lead some time ago, but the attempt was not quite so artistic as it might have been. The present issue of postage stamps, with a representation of the head of K in g George that would j u s t if y H is Majesty in sueing the Postmaster-General for libel, and its indefinable emu and kangaroo, should be abolished. If the Minister was acquainted with philately he would recognize that other countries have issued artistic postage stamps for the purpose of advertising themselves. Such an issue of stamps would more than repay the cost of printing it . No doubt philatelists throughout the world would purchase these stamps to the value of thousands of pounds. W it h a view to advertising Australian industries or scenery, I have no doubt that we could print stamps that from an artistic point of view would be equal to those printed in Canada.",43
77,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,I shall bring the honourable member's remarks under the notice of the Postmaster-General.,44
78,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Maribyrnong) [8.46]. - I do not know whether the Treasurer has compared the recent £ 5 note issued with a £ 1 note. They are of the same size and of much the same colour. This similarity between these notes of different denominations may lead to loss by people who can ill afford it . I suggest to the Treasurer that notes of different denominations should be printed in different colours or of different sizes.,44

80,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"Capricornia) [8.47] Division 20 of these Estimates, which covers a proposed vote of £91,123 for the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Office, is one of great importance to thousands of people throughout Australia. Honourable members, fortunately, do not .know what it is to endure the privations that thousands of old people suffer who have to live on the present pension of 17s. 6d. per week. They have, however, been brought into touch with many of these people, and are aware that some increase in the present pension is uecessary. There is an old people's home in my electorate which was visited by the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) when he was at Rockhampton last year. The honourable gentleman has met many of these old people,, and he must be aware, from his experience in all parts of Australia., that the present old age and invalid pension is quite insufficient. I ask the honourable gentleman to urge upon the Government the necessity for increasing the pension to at least £ 1 per week. Every honourable member has received numerous letters from old people asking for an increase in the pension, and the following letter, which I received from an old-age pensioner in Central Queensland, is typical of many that I have received: I plead with you. to endeavour to have the old-age pension and invalid pension increased. This is badly needed. I have a struggle to make both ends meet in food only, and in cheap cotton shirts and pants-blanket s are out of the question. I want some nap badly, and so do otlier chaps, too. I believe my bedclothes would not be admitted in a rag-andbone shop. For bed clothes I have to use bags, 1 cannot afford to buy blankets. I am 66 years old. I have ""to sit up every night two or three times to fight for my breath, as I suffer from asthma. I have been a Queensland outback worker since 1881, shearing, fencing,, well-sinking, droving cattle, and station work, ancl so I am done up. The writer mentions, further, that he is. obliged to obtain medicine because he is not in good health. His case is typical of thousands of other cass3. Honourable members will agree that the increase in the old-age and invalid pension has nob covered the increased cost of living. I move That the amount of division 20. "" Invalid and Old-age Pensions Office, £911,123,"" be reduced by £ 1 . I submit this amendment as an instructhe tion to the Government to bring about an increase in the old-age and invalid pension from 17s. 6d. to £ 1 per week. I ask honourable members irrespective of party to vote for the amendment. Mr F. MCDONALD (Barton) [8.53]. Some time ago the Treasurer promised to introduce an amending bill to rectify some of the anomalies of the pension system. It is a difficult matter to provide in an Act of Parliament for all cases, and these anomalies have not unnaturally arisen from the difficulty of interpreting the act. I hope the Government will, at the earliest opportunity, introduce the promised bill, and when framing it will have regard for some of the cases that are continually occurring. In some cases a father and several sons have combined in an effort to secure for themselves a piece of land or other property. A f t e r years have gone by they have decided to sell the property. The parties to the arrangement have entered into no legal agreement to secure the rights in the property to which they are morally entitled. It has been placed in the father's name, and when it is sold it is held by the Pensions Department that the father has disposed of a property which belonged entirely to himself. I can quite understand that the officials are in no way to blame for this, because they must take a legal view of the matter. If they decided in one case that the sons were entitled morally and legally to an equal share with the father in the proceeds of the property, they would be obliged to take the same view in dealing with all similar cases. But a wide discretionary power to deal with such cases might be left in the hands of the very capable men who are administering the Old-age Pensions Department. arrangements are, as a rule, entered into by persons who are ignorant of the legal requirements, and at a time when it is not expected that any of them will become an old-age pensioner . They have not, in consequence, provided against the difficulties which have subsequently arisen. I hope that the Treasurer, in drafting the amending bill, will have some regard to this matter. I have no doubt that we have in the Public Service men who will be able to frame an amendment of the law which will enable it to be interpreted in the liberal spirit in which it is framed.",44
81,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,"Reid) [8.56] - There are a, number of amendments which I should like to submit, but I shall not take up the time of the committee with them at this stage. I have one or two suggestions to make to the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page). I support what the honourable member for Barton (Mr F . MCDonald) has said, and I should also like to direct attention to the anomaly that exists in connection with the property exemption. An old-age pensioner may be in possession of a. home, the value of which runs into thousands of pounds. Whilst he remains in occupation of it his pension rights are safe-guarded, but if he leaves his home he immediately forfeits his pension. I am aware that the officers of the Department have already directed the attention of the Treasurer to the hardships that arise fro m this particular provision of the act. I hope that a simple remedy will be adopted so as to increase the amount of money which a pensioner is permitted to have, whilst at the same time drawing his pension. The amount which a pensioner is allowed to earn should also be increased. I have known one or two old men well over 70 years of age who are still able to work, and who consider it an insult and a disgrace to be told that they must not work, or they will forfeit their pensions. Under the act a pensioner cannot earn more than. 12s. 6d. a week, which is a ridiculous limitation. I hope that the Government will not continue the course of placing what is virtually a premium upon idleness, but will allow pensioners to earn larger amounts than they are now permitted to earn. A u important matter is the arrangement of a reciprocal agreement with the New Zealand Government in regard to old-age pensions. I have repeatedly raised this question. I hope These the Treasurer will give a more definite reply than I have previously received from him. Many years ago, at the instance of the New Zealand Government, headed by Mr Massey, the Fisher Labour Government of the Commonwealth entered into an agreement providing for reciprocity in the matter of old age pensions between the Commonwealth and New Zealand. The Fisher Government subsequently went out of office, and nothing has since been done in the matter, although the New Zealand Government has on several occasions asked the present Government, and its predecessors, to come to some working arrangement. The failure to do so rests upon the Commonwealth Government. I have carefully examined the files, and I find that the matter has been uuder the notice of the Primed Minister's Department, which has constantly brought it under the Treasurer's notice. On examining the file I found that it contained  Deane, the official secretary to the Prime Minister's Department, to the Secretary of the Treasury, asking him when this matter would be finalized. The communications regarding the reciprocal agreement go back as far as 1910 or 1911, and the New Zealand Government is ready to make an arrangement when the Commonwealth Government is prepared to do so. I should like to see reciprocity in the matter of old-age pensions arranged, not - only between the Commonwealth and New Zealand, but between all parts of the Empire in which old-age pensions are paid. In the absence of such an arrangement with New Zealand serious hardship is imposed upon seamen, shearers, and men engaged ' in the meat industry and other seasonal occupations, whose time is divided between the Commonwealth and the Dominion. For instance, a shearer's absence from the Commonwealth while he follows his occupation in New Zealand interrupts his Australian residence, and disqualifies him for a pension! Invalid pensions are not covered by the agreement made by Mr Fisher and Mr Massey, but I hope that when* action is taken to give effect to it they will be included, for at present Australians who are injured while following their calling in New Zealand have no claim upon either Government. I urge the Treasurer to give honourable members a definite promise that the agreement will be ratified. The Government must admit that it has been negligent, in this regard. The New Zealand ' Parliament actually passed a bill to r at if y the agreement made in 1911, but since Mr Fisher left office no action has been taken by any Commonwealth Government. The arrangement is based on humanitarian principles; its adoption would not, involve either the Commonwealth or the Dominion in very great expense, but would remove an in justice to nomadic workers on or near the basic wage, who particularly need a pension in their old age.",45
82,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [ 9 . 2 ] - I have the greatest admiration for the officers who administer the pensions. My experience is that they are sympathetic, and whenever possible interpret the regulations liberally, in order to treat pensioners generously. But I know of several glaring cases of injustice caused by the rigidity of the act. For instance, a blind man earns about 10s. or 12s. a week for working in an institution. His wife earns about £ 2 a week, but as she did not care to have a blind man in the house she turned him out. There are in the institution other blind men who every fortnight draw their pension, but this unfortunate fellow, because his wife will not consent to a deed of separation, has to live on the 10s. or 12s. per week that he is able to earn. Another sad case of which I have knowledge is that of a man who is periodically incapacitated by rheumatism, and has"" to enter an institution. wife earns about £ 2 per week, but as her occupation requires her to .maintain a good appearance she has not more than sufficient money to feed and clothe herself. Yet her earnings debar her husband from receiving a pension. I could enumerate many other anomalies of the kind . The only way in which they can be obviated is by amending the law so that any person who has reached the prescribed age, and has resided for' a stated number of years in the Ccimnionwealth, shall be entitled to a pension. If that were done there would be no need to maintain a large staff to subject claimants to an in quisitorial examination. It is unfair that a man who, because of t h r if t , has an in dependent income of £ 1 or 25s. per week, should be disqualified for a pension. I understand that many men in Scotland commence at a very early age to contribute to a fund which, in their old age, will yield them a small pension. Such an income would disqualify a resident of Austi'alia for an old-age pension. We shall never have an equitable system of old-age pensions until age and residence are made the only essential qualifications. A f t e r all, the j>cnsion is merely a means of circulating money. Many old people draw their pension on the Thursday or Friday, and probably not one in ten has a stiver lef t on Saturday. B y Monday the whole of the fortnightl y payment for pensions has returned to the banks. All that the pension does is to slightly stimulate the circulation of money, and as the pensioners do not buy German pianos or Dutch clocks, but spend the whole of their small income on food and housing, the primary producers particularly benefit by these disbursements. I hope that the Treasurer will seriously consider the advisability of liberalizing the act in the manner I have indicated.",46
83,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"Gwydir) [9.10'|. - I very much regret that the Government by referring the pensions law to the royal commission on national insurance has deferred the introduction, of amending legislation. If , however, any amending legislation is to be introduced before the report of the commission is received it should be submitted to Parliament as soon as possible, because very shortly the Government will be seeking the haven of recess. When the present Treasurer was a private member, and as Leader of the His Country party was attempting to dictate to the Government, he brought forward many schemes for the amelioration of the lot of the poor, but he is not attempting to bring any of them to fruition now that he is in a position to give practical effect to them. The reference to the royal commission on national insurance means further delay, and meanwhile the aged people are suffering disabilities by reason of a law that has not advanced with the times, and is not elastic enough to allow justice to be done in many deserving cases. I support the statements of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) regarding the claims of men engaged in nomadic occupations. Shearers, for instance,- may commence their occupation in North Queensland about January or February and work down through New South Wales and Victoria, until in December they leave for New Zealand. A married man whose wife remains in Australia is presumed to be still resident in Australia, but the residence of a single man is interrupted by the annual visit to New Zealand. Although the shearer earns in New Zealand money which he brings back to Australia, ""his temporary absence from the Commonwealth disqualifies him for a pension. Rheumatism is very prevalent amongst men who engage in shearing. One of the saddest oases that has come under my notice is that of a shearer who was afflicted with this malady before he left Australia and became totally incapacitated in New Zealand. He had lived in the Commonwealth all his life with the exception of the periodical visits to New Zealand, and although the department admitted that he would have become totally incapacitated had he remained in Australia, yet because the incapacity occurred in New Zealand he has been denied a pension.",46
84,Mr FENTON,Unknown,'That is a shame.,47
85,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"It is, especially as he had been earning in New Zealand money which he spent in Australia. Although they bring wealth into this country, these men are debarred from the advantage of an invalid pension. At present the man of whom I have spoken is in a hospital, but, because he is incurable, he cannot remain there. When discharged from the hospital, he will have to take to the road, and his position then will be deplorable. This anomaly should be remedied, and it would be remedied in twenty minutes if the Government thought fit. Although the old-age pension was increased last year,"" surely a. further concession should be made to pensioners who are over 70 years of age, and unable to earn anything at all. Last session a majority in this Parliament favoured increasing the pension from l-5s. to £1, but the Prime Minister, on the score of economy, refused to agree to that proposal, and, consequently, the pension was increased from 15s. to 17s. 6d. only. I ask him to give favourable consideration to increasing the pension to £l.a week for those who have passed the age of 70 years. I endorse the remarks of other honourable members respecting the excellent work carried out by the officers who are administering the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act. They are very conscientious, and the department is admirably managed. It is one of the best departments with' which honourable members have to deal. The Deputy Commissioners of Pensions do not receive magnificent salaries in comparison with those of officers of other departments. Mr E. RILEY - That applies to the members of the clerical staff also.",47
86,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"The Commonwealth Public Service is the worse avenue of employment for young men today, and unless the conditions are materially altered, and the salaries increased, we shall not be able to maintain the high standard of. efficiency which now exists in the Public Service. The Deputy Commissioners of Pensions are charged with the responsibility of disbursing millions of money. The total pensions bill of Australia amounts to over £6,000,000 per annum, and as public opinion is in the direction of increasing the scope of the pensions, these men will bear a greater responsibility in the future. They should be paid salaries commensurate with the responsibility they bear. The heads of the various branches of the Defence Department in some cases do not bear ' nearly the same responsibility as do the Deputy Commissioners of Pensions, and yet they receive far greater salaries. When it is time for the Deputy Commissioners to retire, efficient men will refuse to take .up their work owing to the inadequate salary attached to the positions. I remind the Treasurer of the promises he made to old-age pensioners, not only on the lic platform, but also when criticizing previous Government. Probably later stage, other honourable members this side will quote from Hansard exapart tracts of his speeches to remind him his promises.",47
87,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Cowper-Trea surer) [9.23] - I remind honourable members opposite of what took place vernment wben the old-age pensions were being dealt with by this House last year. Government for the first time since oldmember age pensions were instituted in 1908 by the Deakin Government, then brought up the pension to the standard of the cost of living. It was increased 30s. to 35s. a fortnight. vernment, in addition, dealt with practically every anomaly of the adminisentations stration of the Old-age and Invali sions Act, and modified the law in favour of the old-age pensioners themselves. N only that, but the Government appointed a royal commission on national insurance to deal with old age, invalidity, and employment. That commission is now sitting, and the Government is awaiting its report before dealing with ters in a comprehensive way, and on a basis that will be satisfactory to people, and remove for all time the which has been mentioned by honourable members opposite to-night, that age pension is a charity and not a pension in its true sense. Mr E . RILEY - Who said that?",48
88,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Honourable members opposite stated something to that effect.. The Government, and, honourable members, desire that the system of pensions should be placed on a proper basis, so that people in their declining years shall receive an adequate amount to ensure their living in comfort. Although the Labour Government was f o many years in office, it did' not attempt to increase the' old-age pension between 1910 and 1915, and yet honourable memment bers opposite try to belittle the efforts this Government to assist the old-age sioners. This present Government brought the pension to the highest possible stancompanies, dard in accordance with the cost of ing, and also appointed a royal comseverely mission on national insurance, with the ultimate object of bringing about a position which will be completely pubsatisfactory to everybody, and mete the out proper treatment to the aged and at a infirm . The Government view this maton ter from a national stand-point, quite from party politics. At present, the of old-age pensions are costing £1,700,000 more than they cost three years ago, and this increase is due to the action taken by the Government last year. The Goare unable to do anything u n t i l the royal commission on national insurThe ance makes its report. The honourable for Reid (Mr Coleman) raised the subject of reciprocity with New Zealand. The last communication we received from the New Zealand Govern^ from ment was made in 1921 by the WardThe GoMassey Government. Since the present Government has been In office, no repreat all have been received from d PenNew Zealand. Even if they had been received, nothing could be done u n t i l the o t report from the National Insurance Commission had been presented. It should be available-at any rate that portion of unit dealing with old age and invaliditywithin a reasonable time, and 'the House will then have the advantage of the comthose matmission's recommendations. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [9.28]. the - The Treasurer's statement that the preidea sent Government is the only government that has increased the old-age pension is the olduntrue and misleading. Dr EART.E PAGE - I said that this is the only government that has increased it in accordance with the standard of living. Mr E . RILEY - That is not correct. . Dr EABLEPAGE - I proved concluI think, all sively that it was so. Mr E . RILEY - The Labour party, when in power, when the cost of livin g was not nearly as high as it is now, increased the pension from 10s. to 12s. 6d. The Government which was led by the honorr able member for Nort h Sydney (Mr W . M . Hughes) increased it from 12s. 6d. to 15s. Last year a majorit y in this Parliawished to increase it to £ 1 , but that of proposal was defeated by two votes. This penGovernment is prepared to reduce taxation, and to give large bounties to wealthy while at the same time neglectliving the poor pensioners who are suffering from the high cost of living. We were told that after the war we should get back to pre-war conditions, and that the cost of living would come down, bu t bhat anticipation has not been realized. If the Government continues to grant bounties as it has been doing of late, these old people who now receive a pension of but 17s. 6d. a week will be among the greatest sufferers.. I cannot understand the logic of the Treasurer who is willing to grant bounties to the wealthy people of the community, and at the same time refuses assistance to people in poor circumstances.  [9.31] - The Treasurer informed us that the present Government was the only one that had attempted to remove anomalies. I should like him to mention some of the anomalies that it has removed. great reluctance the Government agreed to an increase in the* pension to 17s. 6d. a week> - Now. the Treasurer says that the increase from 15s. to 17s. 6d. a week was in keeping, with the increase in the cost of living. The increase in the pension represents an increase of 1 6 | per cent. Does he mean that the co3t of living during the last eight or nine years has increased only to that extent?",48
89,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The supplied to me officially by the Commonwealth Statistician, who had checked them.  here in the quarterly summary of Australian statistics for March, 1924, the latest figures supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician. On page 72 he gives the figures in respect of food and groceries for each of 30 towns for the months specified, and compares them with the figures for 1914. The period covered1914 to 1924-is the same as that referred to by the Treasurer. The figures of the statistician show an increase of 53.1 per cent, in the cost of living during that period. The Treasurer says that the Government has done everything that the statistician's figures required to be done to make the increase in the pensions equal to the increase in the eost of living. some of the states the increase in the cost of living since 1911 has been as high as 62.6 per cent.; in no instance has it reached a lower level than 40.7 per cent. Those figures are an absolute denial of the Treasurer's statement.",49
90,Dr EARL EPAGE,Unknown,I shall give the rect figures in a $ew moments.  Minister Cannot gsft away from the figures of the Commonv.ealth Statistician in his official publication. In a speech in Adelaide yesterday the Treasurer informed his audience that for the past three months he had had no time to think of anything expect the patching up of the Bruce Page pact.,49
91,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"That statement is as correct as the figures mentioned by the honourable member.  statement appeared in the press; if it is not correct I hope that the Minister will correct it . According to th© press reports, the Treasurer told the meeting in Adelaide that he rushed away to address them, and that for the past six or seven weeks he has had no time for anything but to keep With this precious arrangement together, and so retain his job. In the face of statements of that nature, it is not to be wondered at that the Treasurer has become confused between the 16f per cent, increase in the pension and the 53.1 per cent, increase in the cost of living. A pension of 15s. a week was better in 1915 than 25s. a week would be today. If it is intended that the pension shall be increased proportionately with the in figures were creased cost of living, the Treasurer should have no objection to the amendment by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde).",49
92,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"In 1914, the pension was only 10s. a week.  Treasurer spoke of the period when the Labour party was in power. That party was in power u n t i l 1916.",49
93,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The pension remained at 10s. a week u n t i l 1915. It : was not until 1916 that it was increased to 12s. 6d.  a pension of 12s. 6d. a week was equivalent to a pension of 22s. 6d. a week today. If the Treasurer is willing that the pension should be increased in the manner he has indicated, he should be willing to increase it to at least £ 1 a In week. Every pensioner should be - entitled to earn, in addition to his pension, a sum equal to that pension. That is to say, if he is receiving 17s. 6d. a week by way of pension, he should be permitted to earn at least an additional 17s. 6d. a week. Personally, I consider that cor- people of an age sufficient to entitle them to a pension should be entitled to earn as much as they can obtain. I draw attention to another anomaly. If a pensioner is living in his own house, the rental value of which, is £ 2 a week or more, his pension is not reduced, but if he pays a similar sum as rent for a house, no allowance is made to him. If he has in the bank a sum exceeding £ 5 0 there is a reduction of £ 1 in respect of every complete £ 1 0 over that amount. Whether a pensioner pays rent or lives in his own home is no justification for such differentia l treatment. I am acquainted with the Deputy Commissioners in three of the states, and know that they are sympathetic towards the claims of the pensioners in this regard. They believe that those who pay rent should not be treated differently from those who live in their own homes. The ex-Minister foV Trade and Customs (Sir Austin Chapman) some time ago said that, in his opinion the pension should be not less than 30s. a The time is overripe for these poor old people to get better treatment. If they were allowed to earn an amount equivalent to their pension of 17s. 6d. per week, their income would be £90 a year, and no one in this country-certainl y not the Deputy Commissioners of Pensions, who are sympathetic men-ca n truth full y say that that is too much to allow them to have in the evening of their lives. It would barely suffice to provide them with the means of existence, and it is difficult to see how some of them manage to exist on what they get now. The Treasurer says the Government has another scheme in hand. What is it? It is that a commission is considering national iusurance. sent Ministry came.into office to restore responsible government, but whenever it is faced with a difficulty it passes its responsibility to a board or commission. It has brok«n all records for shifting responsibility, and it has laid itself open to c cism, particularly because it came into office to restore responsible government. It is no answer to the demand for in creased pensions to say that a commission is dealing with national insurance. Does the Government recognize the justice of the claim? That is the point. all the poor old people now livin g are dead the commission may bring in its report. Instead of giving a satisfactory reply to the claim, the Treasurer merely says that he has not had time during the last few months to think of anything but the one all-absorbing topic of the pact. He has said that the Government has removed anomalies, but it has not. It is up to him to say what anomalies will be removed in the future.",49
94,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"(Cowper-Trea surer) [ 9 . 4 8 ] - I should like to detail the anomalies that have been removed, and to correct the misstatements of the honourable  Last year, when the amending Invali d and Old-age Pensions Bill was being discussed, I produced a letter from the Commonwealth Statistician showing the varia1 tion in the cost of living since 1909, when the old-age pension was first paid. That letter showed that the amount of food, groceries, and housing accommodation that would have cost 20s. in 1909 cost 34s. 3d. in 1923. This Government so week. acted that the pension was increased from 20s. to 35s. a fortnight, which was 9d. more than the equivalent of the pension in 1909. The comparison made by the Statistician was between the year when the old-age pension was first paid at 10s. per week, and the year when we raised it to 17s. 6d. Having regard to the cost of living in 1909, the pension in 1923 should have been 17s. l^d. Now let us consider the position in 1914, when Labour had been three years in office. There had been an in crease of over 20 per cent, in the cost of living, but the Labour Government had not increased the old-age pension by one penny. The honourable member for  The pre- me to make a comparison between 1914 and the present day, and that I intend tu do. In 1914 the invalid and old-age pension, when the Labour Government came into office-and that Government did not alter it for two years-was 10s., r it i - and the honourable member for Hume has said that there has been an increase in the cost of living since then of 53 per cent. The old-age pension, which was 10s. in .1914, was increased by this Government in 1923 to 17s. 6d., which was an increase of 75 per cent. The honourable member When is thus condemned out of his own mouth.  surer has said that the pension was 10s. in 1914, whereas it was 12s. 6d.",50
95,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"It was increased from 10s. to 12s. 6d. in 1916, and from 12s. Gd. to 15s. in 1919. The point I wish to make is that Labour was in ofiice for five years before it thought of increasing the rate of pension, although i u that period of time there was an increase of nearly 40 per cent, in the cost of .living. I shall now show-what the Government has done to remove anomalies. The honourable member for Hume said that no attempt has been made to deal with anomalies that existed under the previous administration. If honourable members opposite would read their own speeches as carefully as they read mine, they would find that when the last Invalid and Old age Pensions Bill was being discussed they very generously recognized that the position of old-age pensioners had been greatly improved by this Government. The property exemption was increased fro m £310 to Parents who had invalid children had' previously been unable to obtain a pension for them if they income of £4 5s., but announced that in future those cases would be dealt with on their merits. The 2s. per week pocket money allowed to pensioners in institutions was in creased to 3s., and ar. allowance of 2s. was given to inmates of institutions who previously received nothing. applied to pensioners in hospitals was that for the first 28 days of their detention the whole of their pension was set aside, so as to be available for them when they were discharged, but the Government's act provided for the payment of 3s. a week for four weeks to enable them, to purchase dainties. An amendment was accepted to' improve the lot of people who were blind when they came to this country. The Government proposed that those who had been here for 25 years should get a pension, and accepted an amendment by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) to reduce the period to twenty' years. In addition, an increase was allowed in the amount that could be earned by old age pensioners to supplement their pensions. Those are only a few of the alterations that were made at that time, and in the face of them it is idle for the honourable member for Hume, or any other honourable member, to ignore or misrepresent the fact. The first occasion on which the pension has been raised in proportion to the increase in the cost of living was last year, when the Government presented its bill .",50
96,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [9.56] No one could appear in a more.unhappy role than the Treasurer .(Dr Earle Page), when he poses as the champion of the in valid and old-age pensioners. His record is well known to those who are faced with financial difficulties in the eventide of their lives, as well as to those who are subject to various forms of invalidity. Since his entry into this Parliament, he has repeatedly opposed the increase of invalid and old-age pensions. I shall quote from a speech delivered by him on the 6th July, 1922.",51
97,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,Will the honourable member read the whole of it? It is a very short speech.,51
98,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"That is so, and there is very little in it . There is also very £400. little in the Treasurer's attitude today when he attempts to belittle members'of the Opposition for trying to improve the had an lot. of invalid and old-age pensioners. If it was I do not quote any part of the speech that the Treasurer regards as material, I shall be prepared to listen while he quotes it. I shall, however, do him no injustice in the quotations I make. In my opinion, his speech was most discreditable to him. He saidThe rule There must be many anomalies in connection with the pensions, and we admit that during the last three or four years the old-age pensioners have suffered considerably by the increased cost of living. But one of the primary causes of the increased cost of living is the excessive taxation being imposed by both Federal and State Governments, which withdraws so much money from the commercial and reproductive undertakings and is absorbed in huge Government expenditure. We believe that a substantial reduction in Federal Government expenditure and a cessation of extravagant administration would be more helpful that any other single factor in reducing the cost of iiving, but especially in view of the disappointing and unsatisfactory statement of the national financial position made by the Treasurer (Mr Bruce) yesterday, we are opposed to any further increase in the current national expenditure at the present time. Associated with the Treasurer at that time was every member of a party that has ceased to exist, namely, the Country party. Its members supported their leader, and voted against an increase being granted. His excuse was that while he recognized the difficulties of the pensioners, the increase in the cost of living, which created those difficulties, was directly due to the excessive taxation imposed upon industries by the federal and state governments. Since then there has been a very considerable remission of taxation, and large bounties have been given to wealthy interests. notwithstanding, the same difficulties confront the invalid and old-age pensioners today as confronted them when the Treasurer made the speech from which I have quoted. His attitude then was - as illogical as it is The Treasurer was unsympathetic on that occasion, and voted against the proposed increase in the pension. Later on, in 1923, the honourable gentleman was also opposed to an increase to £ 1 a week in the pension. ""Under duress the Government prevented a number of its supporters, approved of the increase, from voting for it . There were some honourable members who were prepared to take their political lives in their hands, and they voted for the increase, although they were told that to do so would' involve the fate of the Ministry. I find that amongst honourable members associated with the Labour party on that occasion was the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister) and the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Watson). But the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Sir Austin Chapman), who,, during the whole of the time. I have been a member of this House, has professed to be the champion of old age and invalid pensioners, opposed the increase when it was last proposed. find his name recorded in the division list with those who voted against it . Time and time again this honourable member placed on the notice-paper a motion for the increase of the old-age and invalid pension to £ 1 per week, but when the acid test was applied to him, and he was given' an' opportunity to vote for the increase he had himself previously proposed, he voted against it . It ill becomes honourable members on the other side to accuse honourable members on this side of being insincere in their attitude on this matter. The records of this House prove the'sincerity of the desire of honourable members on this side to assist these people in their hour of need. We have no wish to exploit this question for political purposes,, but we are justified in calling attention to the hypocrisy, cant, and humbug resorted to by honourable members on the Government side in their desire to make it appear that they have been the life-long"" champions of the old age and invalid pensioners. The Treasurer has said that he has remedied a number of anomalies that have beeu shown to exist in the administration of Yet the act, but I can mention one that has, BO far, not been remedied. An aged couple, after a life-time of t h r if t and care, are able to secure a home for themselves. Enfeeblement in their declining years makes it necessary for them to live now. with relatives or friends. In that case whatever they receive as rent for their home is counted against the pension paid to them. There is little encouragement to t h r if t in that, and little consideration for the sacrifices these old people have political made to secure a home. I appreciate many desirable features of our old-age who and invalid pensions system, and I pay a special tribute to the central administration. We have in the central office very capable officials, who are thoroughly sympathetic with the pensioners. I am sorry that I have not the same confidence in the sympathy of the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions in Adelaide. He carries out the pension work in addition to other work which he has to perform, and I must say that I regard him as a man who is totally unsuited for the position he occupies as Deputy Commissioner of Pensions. I trust that the Government will , in their attitude towards invalid and old-age pensioners, exhibit the sympathy which they have shown for the landlords of this country, I whom they have relieved of taxation to the extent of over £2,000,000, and the wealthy sections of the - community on whom they have bestowed bounteous gifts. It would better become them to give some measure of consideration to the old people who have borne the heat and burden of the day,, and who have a right in their declining years to greater consideration than they have received.",51
99,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,Denison) .[10.6] - The Treasurer has taken a great deal of credit to himself for having removed a number of anomalies arising out of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act.,52
100,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,Old-ag e pensioners during the last year have assured me of their appreciation.,52
101,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"There are still many anomalies remaining to be removed. An ounce of fact is worth a ton of declamation and argument, and I can direct attention to a case which came under my notice with in the last two or three days. There is an old couple who lived an honourable l if e in Tasmania. They have reared a family, the members of which have now their own responsibilities. By scraping and saving all their lives on the small income they enjoyed, this old couple were able to get together enough to buy two little cottages, for which they paid £400 each. They paid only a small amount down, and mortgaged the cottages for the balance. Whilst they remained in Tasmania they lived in one of the cottages, and the amount received in rent from the other was, under the act, a charge upon the amount of their pension. ing to medical advice, the failing health of the wife necessitated their removal to Victoria. They were then receiving rent for each of the cottages, and out of this they had to pay interest on their mortgage and rent for the accommodation they secured here. They have applied for the pension, and it has been refused. In order to receive a pension, this old couple must return to Tasmania, against medical advice, live in one of their cottages, and sell the other, or stay in Victoria,"" lose their pensions, and pay rent in this state, because the rent they are receiving from their cottages in Tasmania is not set off against the rent they have to pay here. This case is typical of many, and it shows one of the anomalies that the Treasurer has yet to remove. The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham) mentioned a serious anomaly, which still exists. A resident of the Commonwealth may live in Australia for practically all his life, but if he leaves the Commonwealth for only twelve months and becomes incapacitated elsewhere, he loses his right to a pension on his return to Australia. I know of a case similar to that mentioned by the honourable member for Gwydir, .and it is that of a person who had lived in the Commonwealth, but went to New Zealand for twelve months, where she became totally incapacitated by a trouble, the seeds of which were sown in Australia. She had to return to relatives and friends in Tasmania, and on the decision of the departmental doctor that she had become totally incapacitated in New Zealand, she was unable to receive Is. of pension here. There are many similar cases throughout Australia. ask the Treasurer, when taking so much credit to himself for the removal of anomalies, to see if there are not still . further anomalies which might be removed. When this matter was under consideration last year, I directed attenMr O'Keefe. tion to the fact that deputy commissioners of pensions in the different states should be given more discretionary power. Although, perhaps, there are some exceptions, the officials of the central office and in each state generally take a sympathetic view in administering the act. : They complain, however, that they have not the discretionary power that should be given to them. The Treasurer might take still more credit to himself if he asked officers who are sympathetic with Accord- old-age pensioners to see whether it is not possible to do away with a few of the unnecessary questions of an absolutely, inquisitorial character which applicants for pensions have to answer. We claim that the invalid and old-age pension is not a charity, but a right, to which the old and infirm people of Australia are entitled. But a semblance of charity is imparted to it by the inquisitorial questions that are asked. The Treasurer stated that the Labour party has not done as much for the invalid and old-age pensioners as has the Government of which he is a member. I was in this Parliament when the pensions were first introduced, and I know that but for the pressure exerted by the Labour party upon the government of the day there would be no federal pensions today.",52
102,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,Nonsense' .,53
103,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"It is well known that the Labour party put a pistol to the head of the Deakin Government, which it was siipporting, to compel it to honour its promise to the people of Australia.",53
104,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,Who put in the Constitution the power to pay these pensions ?,53
105,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"That power remained dormant until the Labour party in this Parliament insisted that the Government which it was keeping in power should cease its "" shillyshallying,"" and bring down a scheme for invalid pensions as well as old-age pensions. The Treasurer has no right to take credit to himself and his party for having done a great deal for old-age pensions. Only twelve months ago honourable members on this side, during an all-night sitting, fought for an increase of the pension from 15s. to £ 1 , and it was only because honourable I members opposite, some of whom had declared themselves in favour of the increase, failed to support us when the ministerial whip was cracked, that the increase was only 2s. 6d. Those are facts that the people will not forget at the next elections.  [10.19] - The Treasurer stated that when the Labour party was in power from. 1914 to 1916, during which period the cost of living increased 20 per cent., it did nothing to bring about a corresponding increase in the old-age pension. The fact is that during those years the Labour party increased the pension from 10s. to 12s. 6d., an advance of 25 per cent. As the increase in the cost of living was only 20 per cent., the pensioners, received a net advantage of 5 per cent. Dr EAEL E PAGE - Betwee n 1909 and 1915, when the cost of living increased by between 30 per cent, and 40 per cent., the Labour party did nothing ro increase the old-age pensions.  Treasurer is playing the game a little low down. Before Labour lef t office in 1916 it had increased the pension by 25 per cent.",53

107,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"And did nothing increase the old-age pension.  we finally left office we brought about a 25 per cent, increase. The Treasurer's only reply to that is that during a portion of our period of office we did nothing. That is a quibble.",54

Mr F. MCDONALD (Barton) [10.27]. - The Treasurer stated that certain anomalies which existed in the pensions administration have been removed, but that has not been my experience. a number of applications for old-age pensions were rejected on account of anomalies that had not been rectified at that time, and those anomalies have since been removed, honourable members should have been informed of the change so that they might advise their constituents to renew their applications. I know of no unsuccessful applicant who has since received a pension because of the removal of anomalies which previously debarred him. The reference of this matter to the Royal Commission on National In surance is most unsatisfactory. The Treasurer quoted a number of statistics to show that the Government has done more for the benefit of the pensioners than did the Labour party wheu it was' the years in office. I knew the Treasurer in his school days, and there was no boy more clever at mathematics. W it h a set of figures he could prove anything. I am not sure whether it was he or another member of his family who succeeded in proving to the satisfaction of a group of students, who considered themselves fairly smart at mathematics, that two equalled one. Unless, honourable members of this committee have a thorough knowledge of mathematics the Treasurer will prove to them that two equals one. Indeed, he has succeeded in doing something of the kind by his adroit handling of the statistics relating to the increase of old-age pensions by the composite government. I congratulate him - upon being still as efficient in the handling to of figures as he was in His youth. It is remarkable, however, that honorablo members opposite when they think they can detect some remissness in the Labour party of years gone by say, "" We are doing more than Labour did in former years, and, therefore, we are doing more than the Labour party of today has the done."" But at other times they reverse the argument, and endeavour to prove that any good that has come out of the Labour movement was the achievement of the Labour party of old, and, therefore, no credit is due to the Labour party of today. Those things, they say, were done by the Labour, party of old, and all the good men who did them in the old days left the Labour party-fel l by the wayside-and joined, not this composite government, but its predecessor. All the good things that were done by the old Labour party are not to be credited to the present Labour party, but if the supporters of If the Government find any remissness on the part of the old Labour party in regard to the wants of old-age pensioners, they make the people believe that the present Labour party is responsible for it . They cannot have their cake and eat it , too. The honourable member for Reid (Mr . Coleman) referred to reciprocity respecting old-age pensions between Australia and the other parts of the British Empire, particularly New Zealand. I understand that in 1911 negotiations were entered into to bring about reciprocity with New Zealand. The Governments of New Zealand and Australia then recognized the hardships suffered by certain people because of the absence of reciprocal provisions between those two countries. The Labour party, showing a keen in terest in the affairs of the old-age pensioners, went so far as to enter into an agreement with New Zealand, which was signed by Mr Andrew Fisher, the then Prime Minister. When the Labour party went out of office, Sir Joseph Cook became Prime Minister, and the agreement went by the board. It was honored by New Zealand, but not by the Commonwealth. The Government and its supporters cannot escape the charge of refusing to r at if y that agreement. Cases have recently come under my notice of extreme hardship suffered by people who have come here from the Old Country.",54
109,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"I know of one man who shot himself because he oould not get a pension. Mr F . MCDONALD - Tw o families of immigrants came to this country, attracted by the advertisements which this Government is having displayed in the Old Country. brought his father with the other his father-in-law. These men have been able to obtain the basic wage of this country, out of which they have to maintain the old people, who are able to earn nothing, and receive no pension at all. If some agreement had been entered into between Australia and the British Empire no doubt these old people would - have been able to obtain a pension from Great Britain . I hope that the Government will at least r at if y the original agreement with New Zealand.",55
