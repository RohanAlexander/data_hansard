0,NA,ZZZZZ,be absurd in the extreme to say that an individual remaining in work should have to take a 2 per cent discount but that one of his or her colleagues who left the day before and took a retirement pension should receive full indexation. I strongly support the legislation. It is a vital part of the Government's overall Budget strategy.,56
1,Mr CONNOLLY ,ZZZZZ,"Bradfield) (5.18)-The honourable member for Bendigo ( Mr Brumby), who has just treated the House to a long dissertation of the various elements of the Government's policies and why the Government needs to cut back expenditure, has missed the most salient fact of all. One of the key reasons why we are in our current difficult economic situation is that over four Budgets, despite the rapid economic improvement which took place after the breaking of the drought, and especially in the first two years of this Government as a result of the success of the Fraser Government's wage freeze, the breaking of the drought and a general improvement in our international terms of trade-elements which should have given the Government the opportunity to establish a sound economic base-no advantage was taken of those elements; so the opposite situation now prevails. Not only do we have a Treasurer ( Mr Keating) who talks about the country being a banana republic and a Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) who talks about us being in a state of war in economic terms; we have now had to listen to the honourable member for Bendigo suggesting that this legislation is essentially 'insignificant'-his word-in the context of the Government's budgetary policy. The honourable member for Bendigo and all Government members would do well to take heed of my words. Superannuitants, whether through the Defence Force retirement and death benefits program or through the Australian Public Service superannuation scheme, do not regard this legislation in any sense as insignificant. The Opposition accepts the need for all sections of the community to be prepared to tighten their belts, but this Government, particularly the Treasurer, is unable to set an appropriate example. Today in Question Time we saw how, time after time, the issue of the Treasurer's allowances was raisedMr Brumby-I take a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. This issue was raised a number of times before you took the chair. The Deputy Speaker then in the chair ruled that the matter was not pertinent to the debate. I fail to see how the question of travelling allowances, which are decided by the Remuneration Tribunal, has anything to do with the payment of Commonwealth superannuation pensions. I respectfully suggest that the honourable member is completely out of order. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs Darling) - The honourable member for Bradfield is out of order, and, I point out, not just in terms of relevance. No member of this House can criticise another member's actions without putting forward a substantive motion to give honourable members an opportunity to vote on it. Therefore I direct the honourable member for Bradfield not to bring up a matter involving specific criticisms of a member of this House again.",56
2,Mr CONNOLLY,ZZZZZ,"Madam Deputy Speaker, the words in the Budget, if I may paraphrase them, are to the effect that the burden of sacrifice must be spread equally throughout the community. I do not know of any place in the Standing Orders-if I am incorrect, I trust that you will bring it to my attention-where it is suggested that, in the context of debate, a member is forbidden the opportunity of drawing the attention of the House and the Australian people to examples of grotesque inconsistency in the Government's approach to the very policies that it is trying to apply to the Australian people. If in that context I have to mention the Treasurer, so be it. That is the reality. The record stands with those words. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member for Bradfield is deficient in his understanding of the Standing Orders on the point which I brought up. I repeat my ruling that no honourable member may criticise the actions of another honourable member without putting forward a substantive motion to that effect. I ask the honourable member to heed that ruling.",56
3,Mr CONNOLLY,ZZZZZ,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The essential ingredients of the legislation turn around two elements: Firstly, its impact on the Defence Force retirement benefits arrangements and, secondly, on the Public Service superannuation scheme. The Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme has for many years been one of the key elements which have made service in the Australian armed forces a career worthy of this nation and of the people who have contributed to it. It is an unfortunate fact that the honourable member for Corio ( Mr Scholes), when he was the defence spokesman for the then Opposition in 1983, gave a commitment that a Labor government would not cut the DFRB or DFRDB schemes. Since then, on no fewer than two occasions, fundamental changes have been made that will affect not only future recruitment to the armed Services but also, in a very real sense, those who have given their service to Australia and who have now retired and are, therefore, the least able in our community to defend their interests. Because of that, the Opposition believes that it is our prime responsibility to bring home to this House and to the Government that the way upon which it has entered into this set of arrangements leaves very much to be desired. I thought that in a Labor administration we had a government which believed in conciliation, arbitration, in taking through issues and in trying to seek consensus, which is the Prime Minister's favourite word. I find it extraordinary that the Treasurer in his Budget Statement simply put it down as holy writ that the 2 per cent deduction in pensions would take place, irrespective of the fact that it is the responsibility of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to make those determinations. The virtue of that system-it is a virtue that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations ( Mr Willis) tries to espouse time after time in this House-is that it gives all parties the opportunity to put forward their point of view. The fact of the matter is that no organisation, least of all the Federal Executive of the Armed Forces Federation of Australia or, to the best of my knowledge, the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, the Professional Officers Association and any union concerned with Public Service, has been given any opportunity to discuss this matter in advance of the budgetary decision or in the context of the conciliation and arbitration discussions which would normally precede a decision taken by the Commission to vary or reduce, wages and benefits by 2 per cent across the board, as proposed by the Government. In the armed forces context, the Government is saying that it wants to see the pension of returned service men and women, people who have given their service to Australia, reduced by $161.54 this year. That cost will compound to $2,031 over 10 years. That is calculated on a very generous basis-the assumption of a mere 5 per cent inflation rate. Since we have had nowhere near that rate in the four years of Labor Government, one could safely assume that while this Government remains in power the level of real loss of income to the DFRDB contributions-will be greater. I emphasise the word 'contributors'; it is a contributory scheme and the benefits have accrued from the contributions made over a quarter of a century by men and women who have helped finance this procedure as a means of ensuring some independence in retirement. There is nothing more damaging to any retiree under any scheme than not to know the basis upon which he can plan for his future. I do not think that is an unreasonable objective. I hope that all honourable members share it. However, the way in which the Government has gone about these amendments demonstrates yet again the fundamental weakness in taking one element of a problem and trying to shave costs and ignoring the others. I trust that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr Holding), who is at the table and who has a wide knowledge of defence matters, would be aware that it costs some $lm to train an Air Force pilot. Yet in this grand gesture of cost saving by the Treasurer, in the context of the DFRDB proposals, the savings will be $4.7m in 1986-87 and $6.3m in 1987-88. I add that, in the context of the Public Service superannuation changes, the savings will be $7.9m in 1986-87 and $llm in 198788. That is on the basis of the 2 per cent discount. The point I wish to make is this: When our Services are definitely being bled, especially of their officer cadre, it seems pathetic in the extreme for the Government to say, with a great beating of its breast, that it is saving a miserable $4.7m when, as I said earlier, it costs $Im to train one pilot. In the past seven months there have been in excess of 562 male officer resignations. That applies to all three Services-the Navy, the Army and the Air Force. By any stretch of the imagination, the total cost of training 562 officers would be nothing less than $200m. Yet we see, gradually, perceptively and deliberately, a consistent eating away and a reduction in the conditions of service and the fringe benefits of the men and women who contribute to Australia's defence in our armed services. It is great in times of peace for a democracyas was the case in years past, and the years between 1918 and 1939 were no exception-to denigrate those men and women who have made that contribution. Something divides them from the rest of us, and it is simply this: In their decision to join the armed forces, they, in every sense of the term, put their lives on the line for our defence, to protect our freedom. Here we have a government turning on those people who have given their service, and retired or are about to retire from the armed forces, and saying: 'Thank you very much. We do not want you any more. We are now going to reduce your benefits, and we do not really care whether those benefits are so low that you then have to take the old age pension'. The same principle applies to the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. I wonder how many members of this omniscient Government which knows so little about so much realise that whereas it is general folklore that the Commonwealth superannuation scheme is massively generous and better than anybody else's, 61.35 per cent of all retirees from the Commonwealth Public Service receive benefits through their sion scheme which are so low that they automatically qualify for some or all of the age pension. I simply put it to the Governmentbecause I honestly believe that it has not examined this fact-that proposal is simply increasing the number of superannuitants, whether it be under the DFRDB scheme or the Common'Yealth superannuation scheme, who will qualify for the age pension. I hope the Minister at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr Holding), is an expert in such matters and can answer all these issues, whether with the advice of his experts or otherwise. I ask him seriously to tell the House whether, in the calculation of the alleged savings-I emphasise them again-approximately $4.7m in 1986-87 for the DFRDB and $7.9m for the same period for the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, the Department of Finance advised Ministers as to what the flow-on effect would be of going down this road, which would simply enable those at the bottom end of pen- the pension, whether Commonwealth superannuation or DFRDB, to qualify for access to the old age pension because they have broken through the minimum income level. In 1985-86, pension ceases to be paid when income reaches $218.60 per week or $11,367.20 per annum. I seek the leave of the House to have included in Hansard table 18 from the Commonwealth superannuation scheme report for last year, which sets out these details. Leave granted. The table read as followsTable 18: Pensioners Classified by Annual Amounts of I'ension at 30 June 1985 Showing Significant Income Limits for Entitlement to Social Security Age I'ensionNumber and Percentage - All Adult Pensioners AIlllllal Amolllll or SpOIISC.1 SUperllll111WfifJll PCII.liOIl ('olher .If)r llU'Oln£' , Social Sccuril\' I'"" 1])(11('.1) Numhcr Numher Lc"" than I O()() 3M I O()() - 1560 6.,2 I 561 - 26()() 261 2601 - 2999 3X7 3 ()()() - 3224 2JX 3225 - 3 '!'!'! 67X 4()()()-4999 321 5 ()()() - 5304 5X3 5305 - 599'!

4,Mr CONNOLLY,ZZZZZ,"These statistics bear out clearly the errors which can be created by a government which is not prepared to look both vertically and laterally at the impact of its decisions. The most fundamental thing is that this Government has not had the courage in the last Budget to say to the Australian people: 'We are going to reduce significantly all old age pensions by 2 per cent'. But by its action today, by bringing to this House legislation which is going to hurt those least able to defend themselves, whether they be pensioners under the Defence Force retirement benefits scheme or under the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, millions of pensioners throughout Australia will be saying: 'I wonder whether we can trust this Government again. Are we going to be the next people whose benefits will be cut, allegedly to save money?'. We are facing a government which, through its duplicity, and especially the duplicity of its Treasurer, has demonstrated that we have one law for the people and another law for members of the Labor Party.",60
5,Mr IAN ROBINSON ,ZZZZZ,"Page) (5.35)-I rise to strongly support the Opposition's amendment in relation to the Superannuation and Other Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill. The amendment proposes that the concern of the House be expressed at the Government's decision to alter the level of and to discount the Defence Force retirement benefits and the Defence Force retirement and death benefits before there is a proper determination in matters of this kind and before a national wage case has considered the proposal for a 2 per cent discounting in wages. The Bill imposes on superannuitants a burden greater than that being proposed for the community generally. Of course, it will come into effect before the issue of the equivalent discounting of wages is given consideration. I believe that the case put this afternoon by the Government, and put very weakly by two back benchers-the honourable member for Bendigo ( Mr Brumby) and the honourable member for Banks ( Mr Mountford)-obviously in the absence of any strong proposition by Government Ministers, reveals that this is just another attempt by stealth, through this Budget, to cut away from people their real rights. When we consider the position of superannuitants in the various categories, but particularly in the defence forces, we find that it is nothing more or less than the implementation by this Government of a philosophy to take away from the prudent section of the community with the express purpose, as indicated by those Government back benchers, of giving more to the less prudent sections of the community. I in no way suggest that the needy pensioner or the needy person in the welfare area should be deprived of any form of benefit, particularly not those who come well below the poverty line. But here we have a different issue entirely. This issue is one of the realities, and the reality on this score is that of breaking a promise-a promise made by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) back in 1983-that there would be no cuts in superannuation and no cuts in benefits for the members of the defence forces and that the Government would look after their interests. Mr Adermann-Yes, they broke that promise.",60
6,Mr IAN ROBINSON,ZZZZZ,"They have not done it. As the honourable member for Fairfax has said, they have broken that promise and they are proceeding to break more and more promises. The diabolical factor in all of this-it is apparently one about which the Government is not the least bit concerned-is the fall in the strength of the armed Services. The resignations referred to by Opposition speakers this afternoon show clearly that the defence Services are suffering severely because of the lack of incentive for those who would want to serve in any of the branches of the armed Services. Mr Adermann-Destroying their morale.",60
7,Mr IAN ROBINSON,ZZZZZ,"The honourable member for Fairfax is dead right. It is destroying their morale. That morale is absolutely essential if we are to maintain at a reasonable strength the personnel required for an effective defence policy and for an effective armed service in this country, in whichever branch it happens to be. What is not being admitted by the Government in this debate is simply that part of the reward promised to those who entered the Services, when they sought to enlist, was that they would receive certain benefits. This is one of those benefits. The Government is quickly endeavouring to chisel away at these benefits, because it does not have an interest in the maintenance of an effective armed service for this country. The Government's acceptance of the report of the Dibb Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities, in fact its attitude on the whole question of defence, is such that this measure is clearly much more a matter of philosophy than a matter of Budget strategy. The amount that is being saved in this legislation is very small. In regard to total Budget outlays, these alterations will reduce the Government's commitment in this financial year by only $12.6m and in the next financial year by $17.3m-a very small amount indeed. But its effect on beneficiaries and on the morale of those in the various Services is quite different. Of course, the effect is demonstrable. Let us compare it to the circumstances that exist either in the private sector or in other sectors of government. By chiselling away at this particular element we are discouraging those who have as their objective, as part of the maintenance of their role, a degree of self-reliance in the future. When they see that self-reliance disappearing, what do they do? They look at their personal situation and say 'Is it worth it?' and they opt to leave. This legislation gives a further them. impetus to the fall-off in those areas of defence which are so important to this nation and which will be increasingly important in the years ahead. The honourable member for MCPherson ( Mr White) emphasised this point. He is one who has had vast experience in this field. He pointed out very effectively this afternoon the dire consequences of this kind of reduction in recognition of service to the country, whether it be in the Public Service or in the defence forces. What has been lost sight of, undoubtedly, is that by reducing the benefits we merely push many of these people further into the area of social welfare. This, I believe, is a tragic approach by any government that wants to encourage people to have greater reliance on their own resources in their retirement. If there is to be a trend in this direction, let us think of the consequences. It means that people will say: 'Is it worthwhile to contribute to a superannuation fund? Is it worthwhile to try to provide for one's retirement?'. The answer, obviously, is that, if this is to be the Government's policy in future and if this is a lead towards its attitudes, it is contrary even to trade union policy. I do not know what the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs ( Mr Hurford), who represents the Minister for Finance and who is at the table, will tell us about that. But on the one hand we have a very great demand from the trade union movement for an expansion of superannuation, for an all-embracing system of superannuation in this country, and, on the other, in this case we are reducing a genuine, proper and sensibly based superannuation provision. I am amazed that the honourable member for Bendigo this afternoon could cite percentage bases when making comparisons about existing benefits. In other words, he put to this House that, even with the cut in superannuation benefit, there were still people on full salaries who, in percentage terms, were receiving less. What utter humbug! What rubbish! It is rubbish because one cannot refer to percentages when one makes that comparison. Of course, on a percentage basis, there would be people receiving lower salaries. Is that any surprise? Mr Hollis-Don't ask me. I didn't make the speech.",60
8,Mr IAN ROBINSON,ZZZZZ,"The honourable member is the only Governmentback bencher in the House at the moment who can back up his colleague. There are two Ministers at the table. I do not know whether we will hear from them, but I hope that we will hear from one of Mr MCGauran-it was typical of the honourable member for Bendigo.",61
9,Mr IAN ROBINSON,ZZZZZ,"Obviously, the honourable member for Bendigo is an academic. At least, he expresses, on behalf of his back bench colleagues, an academic attitude on all matters on which he speaks. His attitude this afternoon was certainly academic, because the comparisons he made just do not hold water. If one uses merely the percentage approach, quite obviously one is fooling people who deserve a better coverage of information from the Government about what is actually being done. We know that the Minister representing the Minister for Finance, in his second reading speech, indicated to us that this measure was being implemented on the premise that because the automatic increases in superannuation were based on certain weighted averages-on the average consumer price index for the six capital cities-it was pretty generous. But let us look at the real facts. We are talking about an increase, that would have applied, in an average superannuation situation, of about $962 a year. This proposal cuts that amount back to $753 a year, which represents $4 a week. If one relates that to present day living costs-and that is the issue-$4 a week is a very substantial erosion of benefit for those people who are receiving a superannuation benefit. It is sheer humbug for honourable members to compare it on a percentage basis with actual wages, simply because wages run at a very much higher level than does superannuation, and understandably so. Superannuation, in the main, is a retirement benefit. Let us turn to one other aspect that has not been mentioned much in this debate. I draw the attention of the House to what this Government has done to superannuation generally since it came to office, despite its promises in 1983. I refer to the determinations for commutation, which very greatly reduced the rights of the individual, and the introduction of hefty tax on superannuation. We are now dealing with a reduction in the superannuation levels. So what is the Government's intention? There is no doubt as to what its intention is. It would rather see everyone on social welfare, and have no superannuation schemes or have superannuation schemes that merely equate with social welfare. That, surely, destroys every incentive and initiative and is an appalling approach by any government, let alone a neo-socialist government of the sort that is occupying the treasury bench at present. In conclusion, I remind the House that the amendment moved by the Opposition to the motion for the second reading is that the Opposition, whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, expresses great concern at the way in which this measure has been introduced, the basis that has been applied for its introduction, and the decision not to allow a proper approach by way of reference to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal before making the determination. I hope that the community will recognise how shabbily superannuitants have been treated by this Government.",61
10,Mr HURFORD ,ZZZZZ,"Adelaide-Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs) (5.50)-ln closing the debate on the second reading, I want to thank all the members who have taken part. Some, of course, made more worthwhile contributions than others. The Government rejects the second reading amendment from the Opposition for a number of very good reasons. The first part of the amendment reads: The House(I) expresses its concern that the level of discounting of superannuation . . . imposed by the legislation has not yet been proposed in a National Wage Case, let alone given effect by a decision of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Leader of the National Party of Australia ( Mr Sinclair), who I understand led for the Opposition-I apologise that I was not able to be here at the time-apparently made some reference to page 10 of the Budget Speech and quoted the part that states: . . . the Government will argue to the Arbitration Commission that the proposed increase in wages be cut by 2 per cent. The honourable member then claimed that in my second reading speech I refused to refer to the 2 per cent discount recently applied to wages. Of course I referred to that discount. The amendment and the argument of the honourable member are built on a misconception. We are talking about the 2 per cent discount that has already applied. As I said in my second reading speech, on 26 June, in the national wage case decision brought down on that day, a 2.3 per cent increase was granted in relation to the September and December 1985 consumer price index increase of 4.3 per cent. The 2.3 per cent increase applied from the first pay in July 1986. The difference between the 4.3 per cent which would otherwise have applied and the 2.3 per cent that applied was the 2 per cent, which is the rationale for what is taking place now. The amendment is, of course, nonsense. It is built on a misconception. Superannuation fund pensioners received automatically a 9.2 per cent increase based on indexation on 3 July 1986 in respect of the April 1985 and March 1986 increases in the CPI. To introduce equity, the Bill is applying a 2 per cent discount. I draw attention to another part of the Opposition's misconceived amendment, which reads: (a) the Bill imposes on Commonwealth superannuitants, without consultation, a burden greater than that proposed for the community generally. It does not. As I have explained, the community generally has already had the 2 per cent discount to indexation applied to general wages. There is no inequity in what is being proposed. The honourable member for MCPherson ( Mr White) made a comment to which I want to refer. He said that members of the defence forces have been required to pay in 5.5 per cent of their salary over a number of years and that now their benefits are being reduced. He seemed to assume that the 5.5 per cent of their salaries covered the benefits that they received. The contributions based on 5.5 per cent of salaries which were paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1984-85, for instance, totalled about $84.5m. All benefits under both schemes are paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and in 1984-85 they comprised about $732m. What a great difference from the sum of the 5.5 per cent contributions. Members' contributions do not subsidise, so to speak, the annual indexation of pension payments. Members who retire without a pension entitlement, for example, receive a refund of their 5.5 per cent contributions. The cost of indexed pension increases is borne by the government of the day, and this Government has not abrogated its responsibilities under the various Acts that provide for an annual increase in Defence Force retirement pensions, but in the current economic climate the rate of pension increase cannot be sustained. For the sake of equity, too, it has been necessary to apply the 2 per cent discount. Most Australians understand the concept of equity, and that applies to those who have retired. These are people who have given their services in the Defence Force and elsewhere and who are beneficiaries of the fund. They will not be making the sort of fuss that the Opposition is making. As I have said, the amendment is a nonsense. The same can be said of the honourable member for Page ( Mr Ian Robinson), who seemed to see some need to suggest that the Bill is in conflict with the Government's desire to extend superannuation. There is no conflict at all. It is a tragedy that for so many years we have had so few people benefiting from retirement benefit funds. The Government has a keen desire to ensure that superannuation is extended to lower income group people in the community who presently do not have this benefit. Even though the times are difficult ones economically, with a reduction in the prices of our exports being imposed from outside the country-these problems are not in any way due to government policy-we are not putting aside our objectives. We wish to ensure that proper retirement benefits go to those who deserve them. The Bill is not in conflict with the Government's desire to extend superannuation. It is a measure which is bringing equity in benefits in line with the 2 per cent discount in respect of wages that has applied to the rest of the community. I commend the Bill to the House.

11,Mr LLOYD ,AUSTRALIAN LAND TRANSPORT,"Murray) (6.05)-The Bill before us is the Australian Land Transport (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 1986. Its purpose is to reduce the amount of Federal road finance for 1986-87 by $50m to $1,245m. This will be achieved by reducing the hypothecated excise on petrol and diesel fuel by 0.235c per litre, which in turn will reduce the amount to be retained in the Australian Land Transport Program Trust Fund and thus to be available for expenditure on the nation's roads. The MinEmptyHere this bad news in June, but the road construction industry, State and local governments, automobile associations and others can be forgiven for being confused, because since then there has been a further reduction, in the Budget, of $24m. The result for 1986-87 - and I presume we can accept that there will be no further reductionsis the dismal figure of $1 ,245m allocated for the nation's roads, which is the same level in current or nominal terms for the third year in succession. It brings with it an equally dismal record for this Government, because for only the second time in the 11 years during which the Australian Automobile Association chart has provided figures on this, and for which I will seek incorporation in Hansard later, there has been no increase in nominal or current dollar terms for Federal road expenditure. Both of those years were during the term of this Australian Labor Party Government-that is, last year and this year. To understand fully both what this $74m reduction in Federal road finance means to the level of road construction and maintenance and what it does to the incorrect but nevertheless persistent bombast of the Government in relation to its priorities for road expenditure, I shall quote from the Minister's second reading speech on the Australian Land Transport (Financial Assistance) Bill 1985. I want to highlight some of the arrogance-which I think must now be obvious to everyone and which we tried to show last year-of the Government. The Minister said: The Bill now before the House will be the foundation upon which our overall approach to transport will be based. It provides a use related basis for determining Federal expenditure on land transport more the arrangements incorporate an automatic adjustment to match future inflationary movements as measured by the consumer price index. BILL 1986 It guarantees the continuity of the greatest road building program in Australia's history, which has been progressively implemented during our two years of government. Together with the Australian Bicentennial Road Development-ABRD-program, federal expenditure on roads will total $1,245m in 1985-86. Later he stated: The Bill establishes a trust fund, which will operate on a similar basis to the ABRD Trust Fund. It provides that an indexed share of the existing excise charge on motor spirit and diesel fuel will be paid into the AL TP Trust Fund based on collections from I July 1985 until 30 June 1990. He further stated: The future level of expenditure under AL TP will· depend upon the following two factors: - The rate of consumption of motor spirit and diesel which is the best measure of road use-and the rate of movements in the Consumer Price Index to maintain the AL TP excise component in real terms. Specifically in this Bill we have the fulfilment of this Government's long standing policy commitment to the improvement of our nation's road system-a system which under conservative governments was starved of essential investment funds. What an arrogance that is when we see what is actually being spent by this Government on the nation's roads. What is the real position with this Government's level of expenditure? There are two ways of determining whether the Federal Government is giving adequate priority to road expenditure. The first is based on excise, that is, the percentage of fuel excise or, for that matter, total Federal fuel taxes-both the excise and the levy-allocated to roads. I believe that this comparison is unreliable because there are, as we are now finding almost daily, considerable variations depending on the import parity price which, in turn, alters the crude oil levy and the excise relationship. Also, it is does not recognise the legitimate right of a Federal government to tax fuel to an acceptable degree as part of that government's income requirement. However, I agree with those who criticise the excessive level of taxation, which amounts to about 9 per cent of total Commonwealth income, when in this current year only about 16t per cent of that amount will be spent on our roads. Let us compare that figure with the high point of over 21 per cent in 1983-84, the first full year of the initiation of the Australian bicentennial road development program by the honourable member for Gwydir ( Mr Hunt) on behalf of the coalition systems. FurtherGovernment. The Australian Automobile Association uses the second form of comparison, that is, the percentage of total government expenditure allocated to roads.

12,Mr LLOYD,COMMONWEALTH ROAD FUNDING AS A PROPORTION,"The three important columns in that II-year table indicate, first of all, total funding or total Federal expenditure on roads; secondly, the total Budget outlays or expenditure; and, thirdly,-the right hand column-the percentage of total Federal government expenditure which is actually allocated to roads. For example, in 1976-77 the percentage of total Commonwealth funding was 1.80 per cent, and the level was the same in 1979-80. The low point was in 1981-82, when the percentage was 1.66 per cent. Funding then climbed rapidly with the introduction of the bicentennial road development program. It reached its peak of 2.12 per cent in 1983-84, the first full impact year of the 2c per litre levy. I remind everyone present that the ABRD program was introduced in 1982 by the honourable member for Gwydir on behalf of the coalition Government. In 1982-83 the levy was lc per litre and in 1983-84 it was 2c per litre. I also remind everyone that the levy was opposed by the Australian Labor Party at that time. However, since then, in government, the Labor Party has been very quick in its Press statements and speeches to claim the credit for the beneficial effects of the ABRD program on our road finances. The Labor Government has not just been content with accepting the credit for the ABRD program which it initially opposed; it indexed that 2c per litre levy and has paid all of that indexed portion into Consolidated Revenue. Over the five-year period of the bicentennial road program, over $500m of what should be money in 'Hansard a table supplied by the Australian Automobile Association. Leave granted. The table read as followsAustralian Automobile Association Figures NA OUTLA YS-1976-77 TO 1986-87 ($ Million) Road Total Road grants funding Grants/ Total % Total % % funding increase outlays outlays outlays 434 0.0 24,023 1.80 1.80 478 10.1 26,664 1.79 1.79 508 6.3 28,911 1.76 1.76 565 11.2 31,444 1.80 1.80 628 11.2 35,994 1.74 1.74 685 9.1 41,188 1.66 1.66 117 851 24.2 48,792 1.50 1.74 417 1195 40.4 56,430 1.38 2.12 417 1245 4.2 63,712 1.30 1.95 440 1245 0.0 69,917 1.15 1.78 440 1245 0.0 74,764 1.08 1.67 for Australia's roads is disappearing completely into Consolidated Revenue. The Government and the Minister love to boast how they have given such a high priority to road finance in their Budgets. To make that point, I refer to the Minister's second reading speech. The Government always cites the figure for 1981-82, the last full year of the coalition Government. The Australian Automobile Association table confirms that low point. Let us look at the situation over five Labor Budgets. For a start the figure given for funding in 1981-82 is always wrong because the figure for the last coalition Budget-1982-83-is far higher. Labor has falsely claimed the credit for the 1982-83 funding level. The first full year of the 2c per litre levy, the high point of Federal road finance, was 1983-84. Once again it flowed automatically from the coalition Government initiative. In 1984-85 there was a funding reduction in real terms of several per cent. In 198586 the $1,245m funding level, the figure for the previous year, was retained. Therefore the reduction in real terms is the full extent of inflation for that year. In 1986-87, the current year, the funding level of $1,245m has been retained, once again bearing the full reduction of inflation for the year. The three Budgets that have on them the imprint of Labor-1984-85, 1985-86 and 1986-87-indicate a fall of about 20 per cent in real terms in finance allocated by this Government for road expenditure and maintenance around Australia. That is the real story of what this Government is doing for road finance in this country. The Minister and the Government have been fond of citing in all their Press releases an 82 per cent funding increase in nominal terms since 1981-82. I know that the Government can still use the 1981-82 figure because the Automobile Association table indicates that 1.67 per cent of total government expenditure in 1986-87, compared with I .66 per cent in 1981-82, will be allocated to roads. However, I caution it against that because the Federal· Budget deficit will certainly blowout far beyond the guesstimate of the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) of a little over $3.5 million. Put another way, expenditure for this financial year will be far greater than $74,764 million, and that is the figure on which the Automobile Association table is based. We have only to remember 1985-86 when final Government expenditure was over $800m more than the original guesstimate. The Government has to increase its expenditure by only $236m to $75 billion to reduce that percentage to the same as it was in 1981-82. To get the figure down to 1.65 per cent, which would be the lowest level of Federal expenditure in the II years covered by the Automobile Association table, total expenditure has to increase by only an additional $690m. I again remind honourable members that the deficit blow-out last year was over $800m. Even looking at those figures is being kind to this Government because the calculations do not include AL TP finance, which can be diverted from road expenditure at the request of the States to interstate mainline rail upgrading, and I would be interested to hear from the Minister what is happening in that respect. There is also the uncertainty of further amendments being introduced in the mini-Budget next year, and for that matter, next year's Budget. There is the uncertainty of what to expect in real money terms for road finance in the years ahead. That does not even include one other aspect of uncertainty: The phoney accounting of a $24m reduction in this year's Budget. That $24m is additional to the $50m which we are specifically referring to and is money that is being collected this year from the motorists. It is collected as excise and paid into the AL TP trust fund. It is not being allocated for the much needed expenditure on our roads; it is being kept in the trust fund to artificially reduce the deficit. I return to the earlier point of fuel taxation versus government revenue versus road finance. The Industries Assistance Commission inquiry into Certain Petroleum Products, which is still in progress, is of considerable interest. The second draft report was released in August. It was released ahead of the Budget. But that second draft report is dramatically different to the first draft report which was released earlier in the year. The second report recognises the deliberate Government policy of breaking the import parity price policy by taxing the difference. In other words, instead of the motorists benefiting from the reduced world price of crude oil the Government pocketed the difference. Mr Beale-Did it give it back when the price went back up?",65
13,Mr LLOYD,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"It did not. In fact, it made it worse. The House will recall that in the Budget it increased the levy by a further 3c a litre. It just compounded the problem. The lAC is highlighting, to those who read these reports, that this Government is now using fuel as the most direct source of revenue that any government ever has to overcome its budgetary deficit problems. The lAC concluded that the excise on petrol and diesel is too high, and that it is unfair in its impact. I certainly agree with both those points. One has to consider how country people need to rely on fuel for the greater distances, for freight, et cetera. All road users-indeed anyone who is in an export industry-have the added burden of the relatively high price of fuel for use on farms and in other industries in relation to many of our competitors. The lAC in its draft summary recommended: As discussed in chapter 6, and as suggested by a number of participants at the first draft report hearing, a broadening of the commodity tax base by introduction of a Broad Based Consumption Tax (BBCT) or a Value Added Tax (VAT) would be expected to have a number of benefits. In particular, as discussed in the Draft White Paper on reform of Australia's tax system, such taxes would have the ability to relieve the burden on the income tax system. In addition they would provide scope to reduce petroleum excises. The Draft White Paper proposed a BBCT at a rate of 12t per cent. A further $2 billion would be raised by increasing this rate to 15 per cent. This would be sufficient to allow the excise rate on petrol, diesel and aviation fuel to faH to a level more comparable to other products in the economy. We must seriously consider that lAC recommendation. I would be very surprised if in its final report it moved in any substantial way from its recommendation of the introduction of a broad based consumption tax in which fuel is taxed at the same rate as other products and services and not at the punitive rate which it has become in this country, and that specific road user charges be levied, but that all the income derived from those specific road user charges-there are a number of ways in which such charges could be made-would be allocated for the construction and maintenance of this nation's roads. The total cost of the tax and the specific road user charge would be less than current fuel taxes. In addition to the Labor Government's failure to maintain Federal road finance in real terms and the prospect of a continuing and accelerating decline between now and the next election and the end of the ABRD program in 1988, we pose a serious question: What happens after 1988 when the ABRD program and its 2c a litre levy ends? The ABRD now constitutes over one-third of Federal road finance. It is imperative that Federal road expenditure be maintained either by an extension of the ABRD program or by a combined AL TP and ABRD program which in total will maintain the level of road finance for the nation's roads and, what is more, guarantee that that level be maintained, unlike the very uncertain situation this Government has created. Mr MCGauran-1t is certain in one waythat the road funds will be decreased over the years.",66
14,Mr LLOYD,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"The honourable member for Gippsland makes a very relevant and important point on behalf of the rural electorate, that fuel taxes, in total, must be lowered over a number of years but that expenditure must be maintained. At present, the coalition is studying the best way to achieve this end. I make this point for the Minister: The coalition parties are once again committed to the continuation of specific road grants for Federal road finance. The Opposition's concern over the Government's failure to maintain the nation's roads has caused the Opposition to consider an amendment. I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not opposing the passage of this Bill, the House condemns the Government for its disgraceful neglect of the nation's roads by(I) being responsible for a dramatic fall in Federal expenditure in real terms since 1983-84 from 2.12 per cent of total budget outlays to 1.95 per cent in 1984-85, and 1.78 per cent in 1985-86 and an estimated 1.67 per cent this financial year, as measured by the Australian Automobile Association; (2) retaining Federal expenditure on roads at the same nominal level at $1,245m for the third year in succession; (3) creating the dismal record of being responsible for the only 2 years since 1976-77 of not ing Federal road expenditure in nominal terms; (4) reducing the allocation to roads while at the same time increasing fuel excise tax by over 300 per cent in 3 years of Government; (5) artificially reducing the budget deficit by $24m and depriving the Australian Land Transport Program (AL TP) of this much needed finance, which has already been collected and allocated from fuel excise tax, and (6) generally abusing the trust fund principle for the AL TP and the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund to cover the reduction in the Government's budgetary commitment to roads'.",67
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,Mr Leo McLeay)-Is the amendment seconded? Mr Beale-I second the amendment. Sittin2 suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,67
16,Mr HOLLIS ,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"Throsby) (8.00)-I am pleased to speak on this important legislation put forward by the Government. It is also interesting to follow Opposition members who have spoken on this debate in this place. I was going to say that it is interesting to analyse their speeches but as frankly there was not a lot in their speeches to analyse I will not say that. Obviously I reject the amendment moved by the honourable member for Murray ( Mr Lloyd). I thought it was a bit of a joke where in the preface to the amendment he condemned the Government for its disgraceful neglect of the nation's roads. If there is any group of people in this chamber who should be condemned for the disgraceful neglect of the nation's roads it is those people who occupy the Opposition benches today. During the seven years they had control of the treasury bench they let the roads of this nation fall into decline. For them to come in here this evening and for the honourable member for Murray to move an amendment condemning this Government for the disgraceful neglect of the nation's roads quite frankly is humbug. It is also time that the Opposition parties really decided what they wanted. It is no good them running around the country calling for . cuts. 'Cuts, cuts, cuts' they are saying. They want cuts in this and cuts in that, but they especially want cuts in government expenditur-. As soon as the Government takes an economic decision, they run around the country criticising the Government and calling out 'spend, spend, spend'. They want more money spent on this or on that. In the mornings they call for economic restraint and cuts and in the afternoons they call for more spending. (Quorum formed) I would like to thank the honourable member increas- for Wakefield ( Mr Andrew) for giving me this extra audience this evening. I would like to ask Opposition members where the funds are going to come from for them to do all they claim .should be done, especially on roads, at the same time as cutting costs. They just cannot. We know it, they know it and the Australian people know it. They are just talking humbug. All honourable members accept that road transport is a fundamental part of the Australian way of life. Well designed and constructed roads make significant contributions to Australia. They reduce costs, save lives, encourage all forms of industry and repay to Australia far more than they cost. However, in the current economic circumstances where Australia is under pressure from external factors, it is essential that each section of the economy and of the community makes a contribution to the overall well-being of the country. No government has a better record in Federal road funding than this Hawke Labor Government. There has been a substantial increase in road funding since this Government came to office. I will tell honourable members just how substantial this increase is. Road funding represents an increase of 82 per cent over the amount provided in 1981-82-the last full year of the previous Government. Even when the increased costs of road construction are taken into account, road funding in 1986-87 is still 24 per cent above that provided by the Fraser Government in 1981-82. Funding for arterial roads, which is primarily a State responsibility, has increased by 91 per cent since 1981-82. That is a 31 per cent increase in real terms. Funding for local roads has increased by 60 per cent since 1981-82, which includes an increase of 2 per cent over 1985-86 and an increase of 10 per cent in real terms. Under this Government, Australia now has a fully sealed highway all around the continent. I am sure that all honourable members, like me, felt a sense of pride at seeing the Minister for EmptyHere the last link in the north of Western Australia was sealed a few weeks back. This had been one of the major national highway objectives-another magnificent objective achieved by this Government. Other objectives being met are upgradings to meet the growing needs for safe and efficient road transport between major centres of population. The Government stands by its fundamental objectives and it is committed to improving one of Australia's greatest national assets, our national highway system. Total expenditure on the national highways has been increased by $262m to $564m since we have been in government. In fact, it is the largest Commonwealth works project ever undertaken in Australia's history. Yet the pathetic leremiahs and whingers opposite continue their ignorant bleating. They have no imagination, no daring and totally lack the initiative necessary to build for the nation what it needs most-a better, more efficient transport system to get our goods to market. In my own electorate of Throsby over the past years a considerable sum of money has been spent on the national highway. Work is well progressed on the much needed Berrima-Mittagong by-pass. This work will cost almost $50m. The work by-passing the historic town of Berrima is almost complete. Work has commenced on the second section from the Wingecarribee River to Welby and work is about to commence on the We1by-Alymerton section, which is estimated to cost over $30m. Despite all the money spent on this section, and bearing in mind that not one penny was spent by the previous Government on this section even though it was represented by a Liberal Party of Australia member, the Liberal-National Party members, including the honourable member for Gilmore ( Mr Sharp), who should know better, and the two local State members-the honourable member for Goulburn and the honourable member for Camdenkeep peddling the story that money has been diverted from this section to the Newcastle area. This, of course, is nothing but fanciful fabrication. As well as the millions to be allocated on this section, almost $11 m has been allocated to the Illawarra-Hume Highway interchange and some $18m has been spent in by-passing Marulan. One of the most heavily trafficked and dangerous sections of the Sydney-Melbourne route will thus be eliminated. I am pleased that local roads have been allocated $258m for 1986-87. This is $5.1m more than they received in 1985-86-an increase of 2 per cent. Federal support for local roads also has to be seen as part of a total package for local government. In addition to the increase in specific purpose road funding, general purpose financial assistance for local government is to be maintained in real terms over the next two years. Councils are free to use these funds for any purpose they think appropriate, including road construction and maintenance. Overall, local government has fared well in the Budget, particularly given the present economic circumstances reflecting high levels of Federal commitment to local government. We recognise the restricted revenue base for local government and the pressures being placed on their road systems. For far too long under conservative governments they have been the poor relation. A major proportion of Federal road funds75 per cent-is spent in non-metropolitan areas, maintaining employment and substantiating economic activity in rural areas. It is estimated, example, that for every $1 m spent on better roads, 60 jobs or thereabouts are created. These jobs are vital, especially in country areas. So much for the humbug and hypocrisy of National Party members, such as the honourable member for Cowper ( Mr Nehl), who last week, in this chamber, called for a zero deficit. Yet he blames the Federal Government for the condition of the Pacific Highway, a State road for which we have no responsibility and for which even less money would be available if his plans for the deficit were to be fulfilled. He should explain that to the people of Wauchope and Kempsey, because I most certainly will be explaining to them when I am up that way that he called for a Budget deficit. Last week he called this Budget a Clayton's Budget. He said that there should be real cuts. If there are to be real cuts, where is the money to come from for road funding? The honourable member for Cowper calls for real cuts in the morning and for more expenditure in the afternoon. This is symptomatic of the Opposition's whole approach. Let there be no confusion. The message is clear: We cannot go on spending what we do not earn. If honourable members opposite vote against this Bill, they vote for a higher deficit. They cannot have their cake and eat it too. Their opposition is a fraud. Our fellow Australians who travel over highways and see the fantastic amount of work being done can see that their taxes are being well spent. Some people might be fortunate enough to be driving along one of the super highways into which we have put so much money and listening to this broadcast on their car radios. Those people should ask themselves whether the roads they are driving along are better now, under the Hawke Labor Government, than they were under the previous Fraser Government. I invite those people to write to me and give me their answers. No matter how the Opposition tries to manipulate and juggle the figures, the bottom line is still the same. We have increased total road funding by 82 per cent since being elected to government. The rest from the Opposition is sour grapes. All the arguments about excise revenue and statistical mumbo-jumbo are a smokescreen and are totally irrelevant. This Bill is no more than a temporary alteration to our committed road funding program; and it is totally responsible, given our economic circumstances. No State in the Commonwealth of Australia has received a reduction in funding-I am pleased to see that the temporary Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard) is in the chamber to hear for me wind up-and planning for future construction and maintenance can continue unabated. I admit that the expectations of the States might be dented somewhat, but the States being what they are, they have eyes bigger than their bellies. In any case, I can see no reason why the pain of economic necessity should not be shared by them as well as everyone else. It is a pity that we cannot be a generous as we would like to be, but we must face up to the facts. Honourable members opposite are condemned by their own words. They live in cloudcuckoo-land. In short, people in glass houses should not throw stones. I never cease to be amazed at their short memories-their political amnesia. I know that my colleagues who will follow me in this debate will remind them of their appalling record. I commend the Bill to the House.",67

Anyone with any nous at all is aware that almost all, if not all, the programs, including the bicentennial road program, were started under the previous Government.",69
18,Mr HOWARD ,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,The Minister for Transport condemned the program.,69
19,Mr EVERINGHAM,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"He did. He has condemned so many things. He is the biggest knocker around. I found the second reading speech of EmptyHere little difficult to stomach-almost as nauseating as all the signs one sees when one drives through Labor electorates, which say: The Federal Government-Building Better Roads'. The Government does not seem to appreciate that it is the Australian taxpayer who is paying for those roads. The Federal Government has not built a road that I know of-it has financed a fewexcept perhaps in the Australian Capital Territory. But misleading advertising is not really a problem to this Administration. While speaking in fine phrases about the benefits of roads to all Australian communities and about bringing all Australians together, to use of the words of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke), this Minister has supervised outside this House a calculated program of withdrawal from exactly those commitments. In particular, the Minister has seemed intent on putting as much distance as he possibly can between northern and southern Australians. This Bill is about reducing the percentage of duty paid on fuel for the Australian land transport program. Talking about fuels, the jokes are even going around the schools these days. They say that the Treasurer ( Mr Keating)-'the world's greatest Treasurer'-is the only man who can defy Newton's law; the price of petrol keeps going up and never comes down. It is ironic that those who individually contribute the greatest amounts to the levy, the long haul truck and road train drivers who cart Australian goods along Australian roads to and from north Australian communities, are made to suffer most under the policies of this Government. This Bill will swipe from the Australian Land Transport Trust Fund much needed dollars for road improvements levied on users who are certainly trying to bring Australians together and will pay it into the bottomless pit of Consolidated Revenue where it can help defray the costs of midnight VIP flights from Sydney to Canberra. We can expect that the nearest these dollars will come to assisting transport needs is by funding some 'peace' bus, or by helping to move the professionally unemployed from one protest site to another. In the life of the Hawke Government, shipping services to the north have been abandoned after a long history of gross ineptitude on the part of the Australian National Line. We had the promise of a railway to the north of Australia. 'Trust me' said the Prime Minister; 'Territorians, you can trust me'. We still have that television commercial. We play it at every election. 'Only a Labor Government can be trusted to build the railway'. That promise was cynically dumped by this Government and this Minister. The promise of new domestic and international terminals at Darwin Airport has been deferred, which is too polite a euphemism for it. Alice Springs Airport, one of the busiest airports in Australia, has been left in the lurch whilst, in a politically discriminatory way, funds have gone to a much quieter airport than either Alice Springs or Darwin airports-to Townsville Airport. Even the allegedly compensatory road programs have been struck from the list of priorities. Yet the Minister has the gall to talk of bringing Australians closer together. The roads within Kakadu are not all that flash either. The Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment ( Mr Cohen) said the other day, I think, that we can expect an avalanche of tourists and much greater export income as a result of Crocodile Dundee having been filmed at Kakadu. Let me say that the roads and facilities are pretty poor. There are exactly 32 units of tourist accommodation available in Kakadu National Park, because that is all this Government has permitted to be constructed, despite numerous groups wanting to put tourist facilities into the park. When Northern Territorians talk of railing against this Government, it is more than just a deliberate pun. When this Government is thrown out of office at the next election, it will be a matter of great celebration in my distant and remote electorate, the Northern Territory, which, the Minister may care to recall, is still a special responsibility of the Commonwealth. I had cause to mention the accelerated Stuart Highway program in speaking on the 1985-86 Budget. I said then that the program could more aptly be named the 'dust to dust and ashes to ashes program'. Let us look at the historical facts on Australian land transport, particularly as they affect the road program between northern and southern Australia. In 1982, the Australian bicentennial roads program was introduced, with its special emphasis being on the national highway system, and its timing to take us to the end of 1988. The notional allocation to the Northern Territory under that program was determined at $11.1m. In addition, this year the Territory should have received another $4.4m. This extra money was in direct compensation for the totally unnecessary and deliberately punitive freeze imposed upon the Territory's road program by this Minister in 1983-84-the justification being that everything was on hold while the Darwin-Alice Springs railway was under consideration. 'Under consideration' was a nice euphemism. The railway was about as much 'under consideration' as is a chicken on the chopping block. In 1985-86, instead of the expected $15m for roads, being the total of Australian bicentennial road program sharing and the shortfall from the 1983-84 freeze, the Territory received just $10.6 million. That means that the Territory suffered just short of a one-third cut in road program funding in the 1985-86 year. On top of this, the ASH program was totally abandoned. In 198485 this Government announced a program of upgrading for the Stuart Highway of $27m over three years, with $2.7m to be allocated in the first year. This was not an election promise. We are all quite used to seeing those broken, and we might have adopted a 'believe it when we see it' attitude to that announcement had it been so. This was announced as part of the Budget, and was a consequence of the Federal Government's decision to renege on the railway. But in the 198586 Budget the anticipated funding of $8.6m was dropped completely. This year, of course, it has not re-emerged and, as part of across-the-board cuts, the Territory loses a further $800,000 from expected Commonwealth funding. This Government placed an impost of 3c per litre on fuel in the Budget, and a few days later added another 2c under the parity pricing scheme. That 5c a litre total will hit road construction as hard as anything else, with estimates in the Territory being that the price hike will mean a $750,000 cut in capital works. Across all Australia the cuts to road construction will run into the tens of millions of dollars. The net of fuel price hikes, capital works cuts and the penny-pinching thrust of this Bill means that Australia's road programs have suffered a very severe setback. In the Territory alone, even a modest mathematician such as myself can calculate a loss of funding of more than $30m to road land transport over three years. Demon strably, money is not being spent 'bringing Australians closer together'. This Bill is part of the desperate effort of Administration to find funds to finance its maladministration and high spending years in office, and to try to reduce the appalling deficit that it has run up in that time. For the sake of all Australia, I hope that the Government succeeds in reducing the deficit since it must, most certainly, be undertaken as a matter of great urgency. I ask the Minister to drop the rhetoric about bringing Australians closer together while he is demonstrably doing everything to put distance between them.",69
20,Mr MILDREN ,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"Ballarat) (8.25)-1 take considerable pleasure in speaking on the Australian Land Transport (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 1986 as I think that, once again, it recognises the value of the Australian Land Transport (Finance Assistance) Act 1985. It is important to compare the record of this Government on roads with that of the previous Government. It should be recognised that in 1981-82 the Liberal-National Party Government's outlay on the roads of this nation, in adjusted termsadjusted to current prices; although it certainly did not sound like that in those days-was $685m. In the following year, 1982-83, which was the last year of the Fraser Government's term of office-it did not complete its full term; thank goodness-the figure, in adjusted terms, was $850.9m. For 1983-84, which was the first year of the Labor Government, the figure was increased to $1,195.2m. The figure for 1986-87and last year also-is $1,245m. That is an increase, since the Government came to office, of 81.8 per cent. I do not think that anyone can deny that. It is nonsense for people to talk about pennypinching. In my State of Victoria there has been an increase of 84.3 per cent since that time. The figure went from $137.8m in 1981-82 which, as I said, was the last full year of the Fraser Government-thank goodness-to $253.9m in 198687. I shall now make a comment about funding in Queensland. I recall travelling to Townsville, which is now gloriously represented by my colresult league the honourable member for Herbert ( Mr Lindsay), who is an extremely diligent worker and spokesman for his people. I remember travelling there in 1981. I was very concerned, as were the people in that area, about the appalling condition of the roads in that State. They recognised fully just how serious the effect of those appalling roads was on the development of north Queensland, in particular the development of tourism for those ordinary Australians who just this want to drive up there. At that time, the Fraser Government's miserable contribution to Queensland-(Quorum formed) I appreciate the fact that so many of my colleagues have come into the House expressly to hear this speech. It is interesting, when I was talking about the appalling state of Queensland roads, that it was a Queenslander who did not want to hear about it and that that person was not set down to speak on the Bill. At that time, as I said, the miserable contribution of the Fraser Government to Queensland for road funding was only $139.4m in current prices. This compares with $257.6m, which has been allocated to Queensland by the present Government in the 1986-87 Budget. Compared with the sum allocated to Queensland in the last year of the Fraser Government, this is an increase of 84.8 per cent. Mr Robert Brown-How much?",71
21,Mr MILDREN,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"An 84.8 per cent increase the highest percentage increase received by any State from the Federal Government. As my friend the honourable member for Murray ( Mr Lloyd) said, much of that has come from Victoria. We do not mind, I suppose, we altruistic Victorians, supporting mendicant States-not too much, though. It bears stating that the Federal Government recognises just how significant is the development of roads to the future of Queensland. This contrasts with the many years of neglect that were evident under the previous Government. It also indicates just how ineffectual were the National Party members from Queensland. It is to the credit of the Labor Party representatives from Queensland that that State has done so well out of the Commonwealth Budgets. It is marvellous to see my friend the honourable member for Bowman ( Mr Keogh) and also the honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr Gayler) here this evening. One of the major successes of the Government's road construction program has been to achieve a fully sealed highway all round Australia, as has been mentioned by my good friend the honourable member for Throsby ( Mr Hollis). At this point, it is only fair to give credit previous Government, which initiated the Australian bicentennial road development program, even though it must be said that it was introduced as a pre-election device to shore up its collapsing fortunes. Happily, as history records, its electoral ploys failed. At least the program continued. During 1986-87, it is expected that $564m will be expended on the national highway system. The Government is determined to proceed with this program even though, because of the economic constraints imposed upon it by the downturn in returns on exports,'its objectives will take somewhat longer to achieve. I guess this is disappointing to us all. Certainly my constituents in Ballarat will be looking forward to seeing money becoming available for the bypass road round Ballarat and the improvements to the Western Highway. Mr Snow-We can come and see the Swans now.",71
22,Mr MILDREN,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"That is right. The Swans in Ballarat is a very good football team. I know, because I happen to be their No. 1 ticket holder. In the fiscal year 1986-87, it is expected that there will be a reduction of $50m to $836m in the Australian land transport programs revenue. This follows the decision to cut the excise rate hypothecated to the AL TP by O.235c per litre from I July 1986. This is a special one-off measure that has been taken because of the impact of the current economic stringencies. Now it will, however, maintain the indexation and interest earning integrity of the AL TP. In 1986-87, the ABRD revenue is estimated to be $423.5m. What has to be stressed, however, is that the adjustment of the AL TP excise rate and cash payment limits do not alter this Government's fundamental commitment to the development of a better roads system for Australia. I have been particularly heartened by the responsible attitude of municipalities in my electorate of Ballarat and by their very mature recognition of the Government's determination to control expenditure, yet maintain as high a rate of expenditure on the nation's roads as possible. Mrs Darling-What do they have to say?",72
23,Mr MILDREN,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"Those people recognise that they will have to ensure that the programs which they put in place are run as cost efficiently as possible. Money is also available for roads through local government grants, if they wish to use them for this purpose. They recognise that, under the local government grants, all local councils did well this year. They recognise as well as does the Government that, with less to the money to spend, the time frame within which the road building objectives are to be met has to be lengthened. But I stress that we are nonetheless committed to our road program. I am proud to say that this Government has directed most of its expenditure on roads to the improvement of national, rural arterial and rural local roads-Mr O'Neil-So they should.",72
24,Mr MILDREN,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"True. As the honourable member for Grey said, so they should. It is a pity that people on the other side of the House do not recognise the same thing. This represents 75 per cent of the total funds available for road construction. The sums to be spent on the two major programs are $439.6m on the ABRD and $81O.4m on the ALTP, which is a total of $1,250m. I stress once again that the hypothecation principle of the 1985 legislation is unchanged. The AL TP trust fund will continue to receive a specified proportion of the duty of excise and customs levied on motor spirit and diesel fuel. The indexation. provisions will continue for the rest of the AL T program. Under the hypothecation principle, $81Om will be allocated to the trust fund in 1986-87. Over the life of the program, more than $4 billion will be allocated to it. This the first time in history that we have had a hypothecation excise since this program was introduced, and it has given some assurance to road construction bodies-at both State and local government level-of the funding that will come through. It is important to remember that although the AL TP excise rate has been marginally reduced, it will continue to be indexed in line with movements in the consumer price index, thus maintaining the real value of road funding to the States. I support this Bill before the House, and I suggest that there is absolutely no merit in the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition. Therefore, I commend the Bill to the House.",72
25,Mr SHARP ,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"Gilmore) (8.38)-The people who live in the electorate of Gilmore are vitally concerned with the Australian Land Transport (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill because, as with most rural communities, roads are a major means of communication-in fact, the most commonly used means of communicationwithin the area. Over the years, people who live within the electorate of Gilmore have become very used to what can only be described in very kind terms as a substandard system of roads within the boundaries of this electorate. For some time, the electors of Gilmore have been talking to me about the need for an improvement in the quality of their roads. During my time as the member for Gilmore, I have looked around the electorate and have seen a number of roads, which, quite justifiably, live up to the reputation of being substandard. Trunk road 92, which runs from Braidwood through to Nerriga to the south coast near Nowra is a road on which many members of this House have travelled. They would agree with me that it is a very substandard road. In fact, it is probably the worse road in the electorate of Gilmore. Certainly, it is an issue that is' of great importance, and that is why this Bill is important to the electors of Gilmore. The Princes Highway, on the south coast of New South Wales, running through Nowra, is a road that could be at best described as a goat track. The Olympic Way that runs through Cowra and Young is a disgraceful road. The road from Crookwell to Boorowa is a disaster. In fact, if honourable members drove on it at this time of the year they would be lucky to get from one end of it to the other. The road from Young to Boorowa via Murringo is a road that, despite a tremendous amount of lobbying, patience and work, is still not of a standard that most people would call satisfactory. Overall, throughout the electorate of Gilmore, there are a host of roads which are substandard. The Bill that is before the House is of great importance to the people in my electorate. Over the last few years we have been given a great deal of hope that these roads might be improved. In fact, when this Bill was introduced, many people thought that it would be the vehicle by which we would get better roads. Of course, as time has progressed, people have suddenly realised that this Bill will not be the be all and end all of road construction throughout Australia. As the honourable member for Murray ( Mr Lloyd) has pointed out on previous occasions, if one takes into account the cutbacks that this Government has made in road funding over the years, there has been a real cut in road funding of about $150m.",73
26,Mr SLIPPER ,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,How much?,73
27,Mr SHARP,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"One hundred and fifty million dollars. To put that figure of $150m into some sort of perspective, if one uses as a rule of thumb that it costs about $Im per kilometre of road construction, it amounts to ISO kilometres of beautiful bituminised four-lane dual carriageway highway that could be constructed throughout the country every year. To put it on a more local basis, it represents 1,500 kilometres of the sorts of local roads that most rural Australians drive on-that is, the $100,000 a kilometre type road. Prior to the Australian land transport program, the Fraser-Anthony Government introduced the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund.' This was seen to be a means by which we would get better roads. We would get roads that would not be built in ordinary circumstances. So people in my electorate have been looking for a means to get better roads. In the centre of the electorate of Gilmore is the city of Goulburn. The Hume Highway runs through the main street of Goulburn. At the last count, about six million cars a year travel down the main street of Goulburn. EmptyHere",73
28,Mr SHARP,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"It also has the giant ram, which is a major tourist attraction. Some 720,000 people have been through it in the last 12 months. It was opened by the Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism ( Mr John Brown) just one year and three days ago. But the people of Goulburn have six million cars a year driving down their main street, in excess of 600,000 semi-trailers through the year and, I am told, in excess of 200,000 buses. Each of those vehicles belches out carbon monoxide, makes a noise and destroys the quality of life that Goulburn residents could achieve if those vehicles were diverted around Goulburn. Of course, the people of Goulburn have looked for some time now for a bypass to be built around the city. The construction of a Goulburn bypass has been an issue that has become quite relevant in the last few months. There has been a great deal of debate in the local media. I would like tonight to refer to some excerpts from the Goulburn Evening Post, the daily newspaper in Goulburn. On Monday, 14 July this year, there appeared a letter to the editor of the Goulburn Evening Post, written by none EmptyHere Morris). In the letter the Minister refers to the promise concerning the construction of a Goulburn bypass. The letter reads: From the outset, the strategy adopted entailed the provision of only four lanes from Sydney to Albury for the Hume Highway by 1988. It makes no commitment on the timing for the completion of any town bypasses such as Goulburn, and therefore, there is no question the Federal Government's deferral of these bypasses. Later in the letter the Minister refers to some comments I have made in the paper previously. He states: Mr Sharp also needs to be reminded that the completion of the existing four lanes through Goulburn rather than a bypass at an earlier date was the clear choice the Goulburn City Council during the consultation which led up to the formulation of the construction program for the Hume Highway. Four lanes have now been constructed, fully paid for by the Federal Government, conforming with that preference. The Minister was saying that there has never been a commitment to build a Goulburn bypass, that the commitment was only to construct four lanes from Sydney to Melbourne. I refer to a document entitled 'Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program-Annual Report 1984-85'. Page 4 reads: SYDNEY-MELBOURNE NATIONAL HIGHWAY Continue work to provide four-lane travel route. Provide bypasses of major towns including . . . Goulburn . . . I refer also to a document entitled 'Capital Works Program 1984-1985-List of Projects'. It states: Goulburn bypass. Construction of dual carriageways including bridges. Commencement 1984-85. Completion 1987-88. Estimated cost $25.0 million. So there has been a commitment in the past to provide Goulburn with a bypass. We still do not have it. The Minister in his letter also refers to the fact that it was the preferred choice of the Goulburn City Council not to have a bypass, rather to have four lanes down the main street. Let us see what the then Mayor of Goulburn City Council, Alderman Ernie MCDermott, said about that comment by the Minister. I point out that Alderman MCDermott, who has now retired, was Mayor of Goulburn for 17 years. He was the Labor candidate for the State seat for a number of years and is a distinguished and well regarded citizen in the local community. Alderman MCDermott is referred to in the main article of the 14 July issue of the Goulburn Evening Post. The first couple of paragraphs read: EmptyHere has placed the blame for the Goulburn bypass delay on the Goulburn City Council-a claim denied by former mayor Mr Ernie MCDermott. Mr MCDermott, who was mayor for 17 years, said today there was never any agreement to delay the bypass in favour of the four lane roadway through . Goulburn. I think that speaks for itself. One wonders what of has happened to the Goulburn bypass. The Minister for Roads in the State Parliament, the Hon. Laurie Brereton, sheds a little light on this question. To give you a little of the background, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Minister for Transport for some time has said: 'It is not up to me to decide whether the Goulburn bypass is built. We as a of Federal Government provide the States with the funds and it is up to the States to determine when and where they will spend those funds, and whether or not you are going to have a bypass around Goulburn'. I will read from a letter which the Minister for Roads in the State Parliament, the Hon. Laurie Brereton, wrote to the State member for Goulburn, Mr Robert Webster, on 15 September this year. He stated: Funds are unlikely to become available for the construction of the Goulburn bypass until the early I990s. If the Commonwealth Government can provide more funds, then the Department of Main Roads would be in a position to advance anticipated commencement dates for a number of works funded under the national over entire highways construction program. Mr MCGauran-He is too busy with Darling Harbour.",73
29,Mr SHARP,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"He is too busy with Darling Harbour, but he should be spending more time on the Goulburn bypass issue, because it is a very serious local issue. So the Minister for Roads in the State Parliament says: 'If the Federal Government were to give me the appropriate amount, I could build the Goulburn bypass as quickly as possible'. One wonders where the money has gone that the Minister refers to as being necessary in order to get the Goulburn bypass up and running. The Minister for Roads sheds further light on this. I refer to an excerpt from the Goulburn Evening Post of 3 January 1986: The State Roads Minister Mr Brereton last week accused his federal counterpart, Mr Morris, of diverting $181 million intended to improve the Hume Highway to special work on the Sydney-Newcastle F3 Freeway. Strangely enough, that happens to be very close to the Minister's electorate. I think that Mr Brereton, in his honesty, has shed some light on what has happened to the money that would finance the construction of not only the Goulburn bypass, but also a lot of other bypasses and a lot of major highways throughout Australia. I suggest that the people of Goulburn have been sold short on this issue. What they will be looking for in future is a government that is prepared to put its money where its mouth is and not juggle the funds to suit its own parish-pump approach to politics. The people of Goulburn and the electors of Gilmore will be looking for a government and a Minister that are prepared to make the Goulburn by-pass a reality.",74
30,Mrs DARLING ,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"Lilley) (8.50)-The Australian Land Transport (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill and the essential elements of road funding which it embraces represent a set of issues which are at once related both to the security and vitality of our economy and the health and safety of those Australians who participate in it. The question of road funding which this Bill addresses is linked inseparably to road safety and the causal relationship between the construction of a safe and effective road system and the greater safety of Australian road users, a truism which no observer could fail to recognise. For the same reason, no informed observer could ever fail to recognise the impact of the road funding policies of the present Federal Government in this area. This performance, and the comparatively deficient performance of our opponents, is pertinent to the debate. The Hawke Government has a strong record in road funding, and has had since it came to office. It is a record which in comparison with the previous Government shows not only a broader long-term commitment to the overall road funding needs of the nation but an attempt to redress the past neglect of funding needs of certain States which suffered under the unequal distribution of funding in seven years of the Fraser-Howard Administration. Cold, hard facts support this view. Federal road funding has increased substantially since the Hawke Government came to office. This Government has increased the level of actual road funding by 82 per cent since the last full year of the Fraser Government. The greatest individual increase has been in the ing of arterial roads. Despite being primarily a State responsibility, funding has increased by 31 per cent in real terms since this Government came to office. The allocation of funds for arterial roads for 1986-87 and the actual cash increase in Federal funding has been enormous. It has been 91 per cent or $201.6m. That is since the allocation of $422.3m since 1981-82. Funding of local roads has increased by 10 per cent in real terms since the last full year of the previous Government. In 1986-87, the Government will continue to assist the rural sector with 75 per cent of all road funding going into national, rural arterial and rural local roads, creating employment and sustaining economic activity in rural Australia. If we compare these achievements in just three years of Labor Government with the seven year performance of the previous Liberal-National Party Government, the difference is nothing short of spectacular. Let us consider these figures. In the last full year of the Fraser Government, 1981-82, Federal road funding was 25 per cent below that provided in the last full year of the previous Labor Government, 1974-75, and 30 per cent lower than the peak achieved in 1972-73. These figures are significant because they show the comparatively disastrous performance of our opponents in the area of road funding. This Government has maintained a considerable performance over a three-year period and any rationalisation of road funding in this legislation should be viewed within this context, particularly given prevailing economic circumstances. This Government recognises that unless fundamental economic issues are addressed, the longer term implications for all Australians will be far more serious than the impact of a small adjustment to road funding. But this temporary adjustment should not mask the reality of a sustained and real improvement to road funding in this country, which must be appreciated in the context of the overall three-year performance of this Government, and not just within the constraints of this exceptional Budget year. This effectively invalidates any criticism made by the Opposition in this debate about the level of road funding, the excise rate, the national highway, the AL TP, the ABRD or any other aspects of this legislation. This decision to adjust the AL TP excise rate and cash payment limit does not alter this Government's commitment to developing a better and safer road system for Australia. The variation in this excise is a onefundoff measure that is necessary in the present economic circumstances. The essential elements of the AL TP legislation, hypothecation and indexation will not be compromised and more than $81Om will go into the AL TP trust fund to be used for future road funding. For the first time in Australian history, a Federal government has set up a special trust fund to cover main road programs. This GovernEmptyHere Morris) believe in planning for the future of Australia. While the AL TP excise rate has been marginally reduced, it will continue to be indexed in line with movements in the consumer price index, and the real value of road funding to the States will therefore be maintained. The fuel excise for the ABRD program remains unchanged. This Government has been able formerly to allocate a portion of excise for road funding despite difficult economic circumstances. Federal funding of local roads has increased by 2 per cent in this year's Budget and local government will benefit from not only the specific road funding but from general purpose assistance, which will be maintained in real terms over the next two years. The national highway and bicentennial road programs have been enormous successes in the improvement of our roads. Australia now has a fully sealed highway, which stretches around the entire continent. This is something about which we should be proud. We have only to take to our highway to realise the benefits of this Government's road program. A map put out by the Minister for Transport and the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) indicates the national highway very clearly, including improvement of roads, of course, in Tasmania. As I have said, it is something for us to be proud of as a government. Spending on the national highway will increase by $5m in 1986-87, and while some of the considerable objectives of the program may not be achieved within the original time span, the present Government has greatly improved the highway in all States. This issue of equal distribution of road funding between each State is quite significant in debate. The Cameron Federal Road Funding Inquiry into the distribution of road funding is due to report to the Government by the end of next month and there are many issues in my home State of Queensland which have some relevance to the questions faced by that inquiry. In particular, I have been struck by the massive improvement to Federal road funding which has occurred in Queensland since the election of the Hawke Government and the quaint but predictable misrepresentation of that funding by the Queensland Government. (Quorum formed) Mr Deputy Speaker, it will take more than one quorum to stop me speaking about the quaint but predictable misrepresentation of Federal funding by the Queensland Government. The dramatic increase in Federal road funding in my home State is evidence of the Hawke Government's commitment to rectify the past neglect of the previous Liberal-National Party Government. I am all too familiar with the antics of Queensland Ministers in misrepresenting Federal funds in all areas of government policy, and I would like to offer a few facts in this area, which will give a true indication of the situation. An analysis of the amount spent on Federal road funding shows that Queensland has received an 84 per cent increase since that granted in the last year of the Fraser-Howard Government. This represents a real increase of 26.4 per cent for Queensland since the Hawke Government came to office. This figure is notable not only because it is part of a considerable national improvement in Federal road funding, but also because it shows that Queensland particularly has benefited from the policies of the Hawke Government. It is the largest increase of any State and is more than two per cent higher than the average national increase. In every aspect of funding, Queensland has received a generous proportion of the available Federal funds. Queensland has the second highest increase of any State in national and local road funding and the third highest increase in arterial road funding. Arterial roads are usually the responsibility of State governments, yet the Federal Government has increased its spending in this area by 91 per cent since it came to office. I would like honourable members to keep that in mind. In an article in the Courier-Mail this morning the following was said: Mr Hinze told the Australian Road Federation all the blame for the lack of road funds lay with the Federal Government. He said that the State Government recognised this the worth of the Gateway arterial project and allocated all the funds for the roadworks from the South-East Freeway to the Bruce Highway. That is misrepresentation, as I shall demonstrate. In this morning's Brisbane Sun Mr Hinze said that Queenslanders could expect to pay the price for quality arterial roads in the future. He actually has a plan for the Queensland Government to introduce tolls on major Queensland highways. If the Queensland Government were properly to utilise the funding which this Government, under the Minister for Transport ( Mr Peter Morris) has fed into Queensland for roads, instead of misusing it and misrepresenting the situation to cover up its inadequacies, it would not have to call for tolls on arterial roads.",75
31,Mr SCOTT ,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,We know for whom the bell tolls.,77
32,Mrs DARLING,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"As the honourable member for Hindmarsh has just pointed out, we now know for whom the bell tolls. In the last financial year the Federal Government spent $117.6m on 67 projects on the national highway in Queensland. If any member of the Queensland Government or its former coalition partner wishes to criticise any aspect of road funding in Queensland, it is quite obvious where the legitimate blame must be placed. It must be placed squarely at the feet of the Queensland Government, because the Federal Government has more than fuifilled its role in providing road funds to the State. In fact, if the Queensland Government were less willing to manipulate politically and to misrepresent Federal funding and more willing to co-operate with the Commonwealth by using funds effectively-(Quorum formed) Mr Deputy Speaker, I have been trying to outline the deception of the Queensland Government in misrepresenting the Federal funding of roads in Queensland, which has received the highest percentage-84 per cent-increase in funding. The Queensland Premier attempted in March this year to claim credit for a $44.6m project on the Bruce Highway, which was entirely funded by the Federal Government. In my electorate I have seen evidence of this lack of acknowledgement of the contribution of the Federal Government. The Gateway Bridge and the Gateway arterial road were opened earlier this year to a great fanfare by the State Government. Part of the Gateway arterial road is situated in my electorate, and part in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Griffith ( Mr Humphreys). It came as something of a shock to me to discover that the State Government had given no recognition whatsoever to the $21 m contributed by the Federal Government for the road and associated works in Lilley. In fact, the Premier went on record in the media as saying: The company has provided the bridge and the State government the approach roadworks'. That statement was a clear deception and was designed to alienate the Federal Government from the public relations exercise which the State Government had undertaken in an election year. The State Government has no right to politically manipulate Federal funds, particularly in an area of such crucial importance to the safety of Queenslanders. The deliberately deceptive tactics of the Queensland Government merely highlight the dire situation of a State government on the verge of collapse. State governments, regardless of their political persuasion, should assist Federal governments as much as possible in improving the welfare of all Australians. It is particularly galling that the Queensland Government misrepresents the funds of a Federal government which has assisted the State to such a great extent. There is no doubt about the direct causal relationship between road construction and maintenance and road safety. The enormous increase in road funding under this Government has been a major influence on the reduction of the road toll in Queensland, as well as in the rest of the nation. The yearly total of fatalities on Australian roads has decreased by 12.6 per cent in recent years. This legislation will also play its part in the continuing struggle for the advancement of road safety, and it is in keeping with the economic safety needs of the Australian people. We are facing a situation in which economic restraint must be addressed for the long term benefit of the nation. This legislation addresses this problem by maintaining the integrity of the progress and funding increases achieved to date under this Government and by providing a solid foundation on which future road funding can be expanded and improved for the benefit of all Australians.",77
33,Mr GOODLUCK ,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"Franklin) (9.1O)-Many Tasmanians will be listening tonight, and I intend to tell them a little about what is happening to their contribution to road funding throughout Australia and about the price they are paying for petrol. Road safety and the construction and maintenance of our roads should be beyond politics, but one always finds that it cannot be because one dog will try to kill the other dog. I have listened intently to the Minister for EmptyHere years. When the Liberal and National parties were in government he attacked and attacked. He now expects everybody to sit back and allow him to take a media run and all the credit for most of the things that are occurring today. I know that that is the name of the game. One must be able to sell, and I must admit that the Minister for Transport has a good way of selling his product. When the taxpayers of Australia are paying for road construction and maintenance it should, to a degree, be beyond politics but, regrettably, it never is. A dog fight always occurs, with statements that a certain amount of funding should be allocated elsewhere and that another amount of funding should be allocated somewhere else. Somebody mentioned freight compensation; it is not called equalisation any more. The people of Canberra are nice people, but $17m plus is spent on their bus service and on the most beautiful roads and footpaths in the world. I compare Canberra with poor old Tassie which has footpaths that one could hardly describe as being suitable to ride a pushbike. Some of our roads need construction and maintenance work. At the moment the people of Tasmania are paying 64c a litre for petrol. In the 1986-87 Budget brought down on 19 August, excise on petroleum products was increased by 3c per litre, together with other increases in July and August. This brings the excise rate to 23.884c per litre. For every litre of petrol sold, roughly 30c goes to the Federal Government. I would like to think that that money was distributed in a fair and equitable way, that every State and every motorist in Australia was paying a fair price. Regrettably, that is not the case. The Prices Surveillance Authority was set up by the Federal Government to bring down fair wholesale prices. It recommends a maximum wholesale price in every capital city in Australia. When I see the petrol prices in the capital cities I actually feel sick inside, because the people of Tasmania probably have the lowest incomes of any people in any State of Australia. Their roads are not as good as those in most other States. They need their motor vehicles and at this point they are paying 64c a litre for petrol. It is hard to understand why they should have to pay it. Mr Nehl-How much are they paying?",77
34,Mr GOODLUCK,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"They are paying 64c a litre. The other day, when I asked the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) a question I tried to be very fair. During the 1983 election campaign the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) consistently said that the petrol tax was stealth at the petrol pump, that everybody at the petrol pump was paying taxation. The Prime Minister, in his election campaign, said that he would reduce the price of petrol by 3c a litre and that he would freeze the price of overseas crude. However, he and the Treasurer got caught in what is occurring. The poor old consumer, the poor old motorist, is just the milking cow for the Federal Government. He is just one who has to pay for some of these hare-brained schemes, the one who has to pay for the construction of roads, the one who has to be able to make the Budget balance and, regrettably, he wants a fair go. We all supported import parity pricing. That means simply that we wanted to pay the same price for local crude as we do for imported crude. We said that we would do it when Mr Fraser was Prime Minister because we wanted conservation. There was a world shortage of oil, we wanted to look for alternatives and we in Australia wanted to be self-sufficient. But at the moment there is a world glut of oil. The other day the price of a barrel of oil went from $US8 to $USl3. It is the cheapest it has ever been. Yet we are still paying, on average, l3c a litre more for our petrol right through Australia than we were when the Prime Minister came into Government. We are still paying more in excise than ever before. The poor people of Tasmania are still paying 64c a litre and they ask whether it is fair. It is not fair. The other day I read an article in the Melbourne Age which was spot on. I rang a young lady, Jenny Conley from the Melbourne Age, who did a lot of research into this matter. I complimented her on the fact that she was able to pinpoint exactly what is occurring in this country. The oil companies need taking to task for what they are doing. They know dashed well that if we are to have fairness in Australia they have to play the game too, as does the Federal Government. If it is fair for somebody to construct roads in Australia for the benefit of everybody, it has to be fair that every consumer, every motorist, pays a fair price. However, Tasmania is paying through the neck. Some of the truckies who are driving around Tasmania tonight, finding it difficult to survive because of the high costs of fuel, tyres, insurance, buying a truck on hire purchase or leasing it, et cetera, must be saying to themselves: 'How much more of this penalty of a high price for fuel can we bear?'. The farmers of Australia are having the same problem. They are paying through the neck. Fishermen and everybody who is involved with transportation is paying. Everyday in Tasmania we hear such glib, open liners as: The poor housewives are paying through the neck for their food products, et cetera'. Nobody gets to the real root of the trouble. It is the high cost of fuel and the high cost of transportation which are killing Tasmania. My friend and colleague the honourable member for Denison ( Mr Hodgman) and my friend and colleague the honourable member for Bass ( Mr Smith) know that what I am saying is absolutely true. The people of Tasmania have had it up to the neck. The situation has reached a crisis level and is having a dampening effect on the economy of Tasmania. The Premier of Tasmania had to increase the price of petrol by 5c a litre in his Budget because he knows that it is the only simple way of getting revenue when he is short-sheeted. The Minister for Transport may laugh, but the people from Tasmania are not stupid; they realise that the Hawke Government has done nothing for Tasmania. The Hawke Government shortsheeted Tasmania in the Budget and regrettably, to balance the Budget, the Premier had to take a step which he did not want to take; he had to increase the price of petrol by 5c a litre. That has had a dampening effect.",78
35,Mr HODGMAN ,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,They had a gun at his head.,79
36,Mr GOODLUCK,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"The Federal Government had a gun at his head, as the honourable member for .Denison says. We need to get a bit of fairness into the .whole system. If the consumers of Australia are to pay 2c a litre for road maintenance and construction under the bicentennial program, and if we are to have a satisfactory highway around Australia for safety and transportation, the collection of revenue must be fair for everybody. I ask every honourable member in the House to help me in my concerted campaign to get equality and a bit of fairness into the pricing of petrol. I do not want to see the price of petrol in Queensland at 43c a litre when the people of Tasmania are paying 64c; I do not want to see it costing 49c in Melbourne when people in Tasmania are paying 64c; I do not even want to see it costing 52c in Western Australia when the people of Tasmania are paying 64c. Arguments can be put forward about the roster system and about there being too many service stations, but the pure and simple fact is that if the Prices Surveillance Authority-an organisation controlled by the Federal Governmentfixes a maximum wholesale price of petrol in Australia-and oil companies can sell below it to suit their whim and fancy, it is to the detriment of all Australians and we need to do something about it. It is to the detriment of the truck drivers, of the consumers who drive cars and of everybody else if it is not done on a fair and equitable basis. I hope that this debate on the road system will be conducted in the same vein. Let us cut out the stupid politics about this road and that road; if we all get down to sane fairness we will get somewhere. I hope my wife is listening tonight. I lost my pet cockie and I hope they find it in Tasmania.",79
37,Mr SNOW ,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"Eden-Monaro) (9.20)-Three years ago road conditions in south-eastern New South Wales were at an all time low. Today, there is no doubt about it, roads are better. Naturally, in a large country with a small number of taxpayers to cover each kilometre of road, it is difficult to achieve the standards of the more populous countries. Between 1975 and 1983 the expenditure on roads was slashed by 23 per cent. Under the dedicated representation of the EmptyHere can compare that 23 per cent drop in seven years with a 12 per cent increase in real terms in three years since that date. The expenditure on roads was down 23 per cent under the Lynch and Howard Budgets. There has been a 12 per cent increase under the Keating Budgets. Expenditure was down $517m under the Lynch and Howard Budgets. It has increased by $144m under the Keating Budgets under the stewardship of the Minister for Transport. It is not as if this Government has increased petrol taxes to the same extent in real terms. In the seven years fuel prices rose by 300 per cent. Compare that 300 per cent increase in fuel prices in seven years with a mere 25 per cent increase in three years to 1986. Fuel-related taxes rose by 400 per cent under the Fraser-Howard Budgets. Tonight some honourable members have consistently called on the Federal Government to cut government spending, yet every time an issue comes up they call for an increase in spending. So tonight we hear yesterday's courageous economic Rambos, the slashers of public spending, coming here and shrinking back into the wet caves of economic darkness where they feel most comfortable. Yesterday'S dries are today's wets. They are dry before they go into battle and wet when they reach the front. Confronted with a vote winning issue, no matter what the cost, they are there saying that the Government is not spending enough. They cannot tell us, they will not tell us, where they will make the cuts. I will tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, where they will make the cuts-where they made them last time and that is roads. How will they do it? (Quorum formed) The Opposition did not like it when I challenged it to tell us where it would make the cuts. As I said before we know where it will make the cuts and that is where it made the cuts last time-on roads. How will that be done? The last statement that I can find from the Opposition makes it very clear. Under its policy it would hand funding for arterial and local roads to the States. Every local council, every ratepayer must have grave reservations about $260m of their taxes especially earmarked for local roads disappearing from their revenue source like quicksilver. Local government funding would have to come from the States, competing with schools, hospitals and other State programs. But it will not happen because ratepayers will not vote for a Federal party which refuses to earmark funds for local roads. Arterial road funding would also be handed to the States under Liberal-National Party policy. Again, people will reject that policy. Today the Federal Government is specifically earmarking $420m for arterial roads such as the Princes Highway, the coast road from Queanbeyan to Bateman's Bay, and other important arterial roads throughout Australia. Imagine what would happen if responsibility for $90m of arterial road funding to Queensland was handed over in its entirety to the present Queensland Government. The honourable member for Lilley ( Mrs Darling) tonight quoted Minister Hinze in Queensland who is threatening a toll on Queensland road users. A newspaper headline reads: 'Hinze plans toll on roads'. What would he do in the unlikely event of a Federal coalition government asking his Government to find $90m for arterial road funding. Of course, that would require an impossible coincidence; first, the tion of a Federal Liberal-National Party government, and secondly, the re-election of a National Party government in Queensland. It is a government with the highest total per capita fees in the nation. It has been my privilege in recent years to represent the Hawke Government at the opening of a number of important bridges and roads in the Eden-Monaro electorate. A couple of months ago I opened the Sutton interchange on the Federal Highway. It was an excellent opening. A couple of months before that I opened the Burbong bridge on the coast road. More recently, I opened the two bridges at Numerella on the Monaro Highway. I attended with the State Minister for Roads the opening of the Saucy Creek bridge out of Bombala. Next Monday I will be opening a bridge near Bega. Spending on roads returns a dividend to the community. Better roads mean less fuel costs, less accidents, less wear and tear, and cheaper transport. I welcome the assurance of the Minister for Transport that he will quickly deal with any request from the New South Wales Government for funds for the Princes Highway and the coast road on the basis of a high priority by that State. There is also important work to be done on trunk roads 91 and 92 in my electorate. As I said, we are a small nation in population but a big nation in geographical area. We have a lot of responsibility. I congratulate the Government, particularly the Minister, on the way it has handled those responsibilities.",79
38,Mr TUCKEY ,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"O'Connor) (9.28)-We all know that this Government is capable of just about doing anything with figures. I have a simple economic theory that says two plus two equals four. Under this Government it can be any figure. The honourable member for EdenMortaro ( Mr Snow) was just saying how the Government has managed to increase road funding. I think he used a figure of $140m. That is just not enough. The funding for the Australian bicentennial road development fund that was instituted by the previous Government would have to be close to $500m this year. I say that because I note that the Minister mentioned a figure of $440m last year. Even he, of course, fiddles with figures because in his previous second reading speech in this place on this subject he said: As I have noted earlier, together with the $440m to be provided under the ABRD program, the Federal Government's road building program in 1985-86 will total $1,245m an increase of 82 per cent on 1981-82. elecThe first point I make about 1981-82 is that it had only half the ABRD collections then because it was introduced at Ic per litre and later expanded to 2c per litre, and it was an initiative of the previous Government. What is this Government doing in this Budget-the greatest sleight of hand trick since the Treasurer worked out how to get $17,000 of the taxpayers' money on his house. The sleight of hand trick is that the Government is leaving money in the bank. The Government is putting the tax burden on Australians but it is then leaving it in the bank in the Australian bicentennial trust fund so that it can say to Australians that there is some fiscal restraint. I am all for fiscal restraint. I will not be classified in any category, but I am all for fiscal restraint. But let me tell honourable members that when I set out to save money, I save it in the places where it is best saved. I certainly will not cut down spending on roads and those things which the Minister for Transport ( Mr Peter Morris) tells us are of great importance to our nation. When the Minister was booming up this policy in his previous second reading speech, which is like the accord-we are getting into the Bicentennial and the Australian land transport program or whatever we call this particular thing-we are getting into mark 2. The next one will be mark 3 and everyone will spend a little less money. We will just be doing it a different way. This is what he said: I cannot emphasise too strongly the importance that efficient transport systems have to the economic well-being of all Australians. About $1 in every seven spent in this country is on transport. Transport impacts on every facet of our economic and social activity. If he believes that, what is he doing letting road funding be cut? The Government did not cut expenditure this year; it is spending more mopey overall. All this carping we have had here about our overseas problems has ignored the fact that this Budget is the biggest taxing Budget an,d the biggest spending Budget in the history of Australia. It just so happens that this Minister was unable to protect his portfolio and so he got the cuts. But that is not so for the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment ( Mr Cohen). He did not have any cuts. He had an increase in real terms, which was reported in the Australian.",80
39,Mr GEAR ,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"Oh, go on!",81
40,Mr TUCKEY,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"The honourable member for Canning might like to listen. The article in the Australian stated: The individual interests in the arts by members of the Hawke Cabinet played an important role in preserving arts funding in the recent Federal Budget, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment, Mr Cohen, said yesterday. 'I think we're very fortunate that this present Federal Government has got a lot of Government Ministers who are interested in the arts,' Mr Cohen said in Adelaide. The Treasurer ( Mr Keating) is really good on museumsthat is where he keeps up on the value of his clocks; obviously Mr Anderson does not go there because otherwise he would not pay him so much for themhe's really been a tremendous help to me. 'Gareth Evans . . . has a real interest in the ballet, John Button... and Brown . . . in the opera.' While other departments fell under Mr Keating's axeincluding our roadsthe arts came through scathed . . . Spending on the arts was increased by $500,000 in real terms. Mr Langmore-Thank heavens for that.",81
41,Mr TUCKEY,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"In fact it was up. I am pleased to hear that too, but I just wonder how the beer drinkers of this country, Labor's so-called constituency, feel about having their taxes put up on their simple entertainment every six months by the people opposite. Honourable members opposite are the ones who indexed the excise on beer. They are the ones who indexed the excise on fuel, and now they will not even keep their promise of spending a lousy 5c of that particular 24c per litre on roads. They are cutting back in the very area where some good could be done. This is where it is going-off to the arts and everything. Talk about a mob of Bollinger socialists! We have got them here. They cannot look after their own working class constituencies, people who cannot afford to go to see Joan Sutherland. I have a list here of professors who will be subsidised, all Bollinger socialists, to go to the opera and the ballet, but honourable members opposite will not do much for the working class people whose simple pleasures are driving their motor cars and having a few beers. There is every system in the world to interfere with that. Mr Robert Brown-And you are a bloke who owns a pub.",81
42,Mr TUCKEY,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"Yes, I do own an hotel, and my concern is for the people who drink there because I mixed with them while all these Ministers went off to the ballet. This is the point. Mr Robert Brown-And you water the beer.",81
43,Mr TUCKEY,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,I certainly do not. The honourable member for Charlton should not say things like that. That is being stupid. Mr Robert Brown-Some of your comments have been much worse.,81
44,Mr TUCKEY,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,Only when they were true. The honourable member can cut that out. That is unnecessary. Mr Robert Brown-And some of your comments-MONICA,81
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,Mr Rocber)-Order! The honourable member for Charlton will stop interjecting. John Mr TUCKEY-The honourable member for Charlton knows that it is starting to hurt.,81
46,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"If the honourable member for Charlton persists in interjecting, the Chair will have to take action. relatively unMONICA",81
47,Mr TUCKEY,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"We know what this is all about. We are reducing the amount of money. The Minister told us last year that, together with the Australian bicentennial road development program, Federal expenditure on roads will total $1,245m in 1985-86. But what does the Minister tell us in this speech? He says: This measure, and the decision to hold payments in 1986-87, under the Australian Bicentennial road development-ABRD-program and the ALTP to $1250m forms an integral part of the Government's overall economic strategy. One can see that those two figures in dollar terms are exactly the same. In fact, it is down $5m in actual dollar terms, according to what the Minister said in those two speeches. We know what that means in real terms under the sort of inflation that honourable members opposite have re-established in this country. As I said, we have had the accord mark I, and the accord mark 2 and now we are into the tri-cord. Everyone of them seems to get a little closer to our policies. Last night the honourable member for Stirling ( Mr Ronald Edwards) was on about our not having some policies. I give honourable members opposite credit for repetition. They are good at it. They keep telling people. They are like our Treasurer ( Mr Keating). Is he not great? He is like an economic vacuum. We have asked him questions about how his actual legislation runs. In fact, an honourable member from his own side said to him: 'Tell us the story of the log book that everybody hates'. He said: 'You do not have to worry about the log book. You only fill in the private kilometres'. His own Commissioner of Taxation had to correct him, and I came into this Parliament and reminded him of the irresponsibility of that statement.",81
48,Mr LLOYD ,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,Was that the VIP fly-by-night Treasurer?,82
49,Mr TUCKEY,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"That could be he. It is the $17,000 kid. But the whole thing about it is that he misled Australia in a very bad and irresponsible way because there would have been people out there who might not get their field audit for five or six years who could have been filling in private kilometres in their log books, and when confronted with their field audit they would have had all their deductibility for vehicle usage disallowed, if they had listened to the Treasurer. I have met a few farmers, truck owners and small business people who believe what the Treasurer told us, along with the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke), that interest rates would fall. Those poor people went out and borrowed money because they trusted the Treasurer. They believed him. What happened to them? They are now paying 18 per cent and 20 per cent for their money. People came to me the other day in Townsville to tell me that cars are being sold in that townMr Robert Brown-That is not in your electorate.",82
50,Mr TUCKEY,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"No, but I was there doing some campaigning. I was shocked to hear that people-I got this from the horse's mouth-are selling their motor cars so that they can keep their homes. I am not telling honourable members something that did not happen. That is the truth. Those people are doing it because of what has happened to the interest rates regime in this place. It was the Treasurer who misled some of these people into buying homes and extending themselves on credit; they believed him. But he cannot tell us any of these things when 'we ask him questions. What are some of the other things that the Treasurer cannot answer when he comes in here? He could not even answer a question from an honourable member on our benches yesterday. Honourable members opposite were at it again today. As soon as there is a little criticism of the Treasurer, Government members say: 'Oh, you never ask us any economic questions'. Why should we bother? Someone asked the Treasurer this simple question yesterday: 'If I now put up my $200, which the Government increased from $2, to appeal my taxation assessment, will I get it back if I win?'. The Treasurer said: 'I have not got the paper with me. I do not know'. The reasonable odds are that one would get it back if the appeal was won, but he could not answer that simple question on his own legislation. This is this great guru. He knows only one thingwinning the argument. He never wants to be confused by the facts. When somebody else asked him what the score was on housing he did not know from his fellow Minister that in fact housing estimates had gone down by 10,000. The honourable member for Charlton need not rise to take a point of order as I am finished with the Treasurer and I am nearly finished with what I am saying. Mr Robert Brown-The honourable member has certainly anticipated my point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I know that this has been a fairly wide-ranging debate but it is important that the honourable member get back to the essence of the Bill we are considering.",82
51,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,Mr Mildren)-I ask the honourable member to address his remarks to the Bill.,82
52,Mr TUCKEY,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"I am only too pleased to do so, Mr Deputy Speaker. There are other aspects of this expenditure cut. This measure is an expenditure cut. I have already said that I approve of expenditure cuts. However, I do not want to see them made in such basic areas as our roads. Mr Lee-Oh!",82
53,Mr TUCKEY,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"I have just given honourable members examples. The Bollinger socialists opposite want to tax petrol and beer, the working man's pleasures, so that all their professor-type Ministers can go off to the opera and the ballet. That is all right; that is their judgment. But just let them go and sell it in a few of the bars around their electorates when they put up the price of beer again at Christmas time, as they will. Three State Premiers have done so by dramatic . amounts recently-Premiers Cain, Unsworth and Burke. They blame the Federal Government for it. They say that it did not give them enough money. The Government probably gave them too much. The other facts of life are that the Australian bicentennial road development program money impacts on rural areas. It is being paid; it is not discounted. That is a problem for rural people. Let me remind the House that the honourable member for Franklin ( Mr Good luck) told us tonight how difficult it was for people in remote areas who pay huge fuel taxes. The Government has put up the tax on fuel from 6c to 24c per litre. That sort of tax is going on rail freight, road freight and stock freight. All these things are hurting people in remote areas. It is time honourable members who represent remote areas remembered that. It is also contributing to the fact that some people must sell vehicles and such things just to keep the family home. That should not be the case. Thirty per cent of the cost of running an owner-driver's truck goes in taxes. Thirty-five per cent is what he has to pay for fuel. These things should be realised and considered. This measure is not a sensible solution. It also makes a joke of the sorts of statements the Minister made in this House when he introduced this novel means of funding road construction.",82
54,Mr LINDSAY ,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"Herbert) (9.42)-The Australian Land Transport (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 1986 amends the Australian Land Transport (Financial Assistance) Act 1985 by varying the rate of duty calculated in accordance with section 16 of the principal Act from 3.845c per litre to 3.61c per litre, to apply from 1 July 1986. The Australian land transport program, initiated by the Hawke Government, represents the commencement of a truly national transport strategy for Australia. It is a comprehensive strategy. It addresses the problems of providing adequate funding in a cohesive way for roads, railways, transport research and road safety. It will ensure that Australians receive an efficient transport system and that their economic well-being will never be impeded by an inadequate transport system. Prior to the election of the Hawke Government in 1983, and with the notable exception of the Whit lam Government, the history of road funding by the Commonwealth was a sorry record of deliberate neglect. In the early 1920s the Hughes Government provided assistance to the States for roads, primarily as a means to alleviate unemployment, especially among ex-servicemen. Previously, some Commonwealth funds had been made available through the Department of Repatriation for making or repairing development roads. The Main Roads Development Act 1923 represented the first occasion on which the Commonwealth used its powers under section 96 of the Constitution to 'grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament sees fit'. That is, it was the first form of specific purpose grant. A grant of $1 m was provided to the States in 1923-24 for expenditure on the construction of main roads, main trunk roads between important towns where no railways were provided and arterial roads through country areas unable to finance the heavy costs of road construction. The basic argument used in support of Federal Government road funding-to speed up the construction of main roads-is still used in support of Federal Government road grants today. North Queenslanders bitterly remember that it was not until 1962, some 13 years after the Menzies Government took power, that the Bruce Highway from Brisbane to Cairns was completely sealed. In 1974 the Whitlam Labor Government introduced the National Roads Act and the Road Grants Act and thereby assumed full funding responsibility for roads which had been identified as being of special national significance, such as the national highways. This ambitious program to rebuild the land transport system of Australia was dealt a savage blow by the Fraser Government. For example, real road grants by the Federal Government to the States were slashed by 29.5 per cent during the seven years of the Fraser Government. Queensland suffered a major cut in Federal funding for roads. Almost all State governments and councils in Australia were furious at Federal government cutbacks in road funding. Honourable members will vividly remember that during the years of the Fraser Government, Australian roads were cracking and crumbling under the strain of declining Federal government real funding for our national road network. There is no doubt that the Fraser Government's culpable failure to allocate a fair share of road users' taxation to the upgrading of Australia's road system was a direct cause of the increased tragic toll on the roads. It was an act of brutal cynicism and displayed a callous disregard for human life. The national highway was falling into decay. The then chief executive of the National Roads and Motorists Association, Mr George James, was reported in the Australian of 19 March 1982, as saying that the Fraser Government bore a 'great responsibility for the failure to reduce the road toll'. He continued: If New South Wales wants to achieve a major reduction in the road toll it will have to receive much treatment from the Federal Government. In New South Wales we have how reached crisis point. We are now seeing the wastage of assets which will take generations to repair. He blamed the cutbacks on the then Federal Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Gwydir ( Mr Hunt). On 17 March 1982 a report by the Bureau of Transport Economics on road construction price indices was tabled in this Parliament. The report confirmed that Fraser Government road funds, expressed in real terms, had been sharply reduced. It showed that road construction costs rose by 15.9 per cent in 197980 and by 15.3 per cent in 1980-81. These rises compared with increases in Fraser Government road funds of 7.5 per cent in 1979-80 and 11 per cent 1980-81. This sharp reduction in Fraser Government-funded road works was made when road users were being clobbered with a heavy fuel tax, levy increases and record personal taxation. The Liberal member for Franklin ( Mr Good luck) was a member of the Fraser Government that trebled the price of petrol, quadrupled the fuel-related tax take and slashed more than half a billion dollars from road expenditure. In 1981 more than 3,500 Australians were killed and about 90,000 were maimed or injured on Australia's roads. The appalling death and injury toll on Australia's roads, which cost $4 billion in the last year of the Fraser Government in monetary terms alone, was fostered by the Fraser Government's low priority on roads. There was no fairness in the Fraser Government's policies. While motorists paid the burden of tax evasion by shrewd operators, the Liberal National Party Government squandered millions of dollars on lavish living for itself-international safaris, purchases of Boeing 707 flying hotels for overseas junkets, personal chefs and butlers, and propaganda to prop up an incompetent and dying government. When the Hawke Government came to office, it was faced with a massive Budget deficit. During the 1983 election campaign it was suggested by the Fraser Government that the prospective 1983 Budget deficit would be of the order of $6 billion. After the election it was revealed that the prospective deficit was $9.6 billion. Notwithstanding these considerations, the Hawke Government recognised that a high priority had to be given to investment in roads as a basis for aiding economic development and creating jobs and to redress the decline in the road system which had occurred due to the previous years of Fraser Government neglect. 0n 13 November 1984 the Prime Minister of better Australia ( Mr Hawke) pledged to the Australian people that his Government would continue the greatest road building and maintenance program in Australia's history, that within the next three years the national highway system would be brought to an all-weather, dust-free and floodfree standard, and that the Bruce Highway would be transformed to give the growing cities and towns of north Queensland the genuine highway standard link they need and deserve. (Quorum formed) As I said, on 13 November 1984 the Prime Minister pledged that his Government, an authentic Australian government, would initiate the most comprehensive overhaul ever undertaken of Australia's national transport system. In 1985 the Hawke Government passed legislation establishing the Australian land transport program. For the first time, Australia had a truly national transport strategy. The Australian Land Transport (Financial Assistance) Act 1985 established a trust fund into which would be paid, as from 1 July 1985, an amount equivalent to 3.66c per litre of net revenue collected from Customs and excise duties on motor spirit and diesel fuel. That rate was to be subject to an adjustment twice yearly in line with movements in the consumer price index. The rate has been increased, from 1 August 1986, to 3.755c per litre. This provision is consistent with Australian Labor Party policy of returning a fairer share of fuel related revenue to road works funding. Revenue from this duty during the year 198687 is estimated at $8 10m. Funds payable from the Australian Land Transport Program Trust Fund will be allocated on a percentage basis to national roads, urban arterial roads, rural arterial roads, local roads, land transport research and road safety. The Australian land transport program replaced the Roads Grants Act scheme which expired on 30 June 1985. The Australian bicentennial road development program is continuing separately. Federal Government funding under the Hawke Government's Australian land transport program and the Australian bicentennial road development program will provide a record $1,250m for road construction, maintenance and research in 1986-87. By way of contrast, during the last full year of the Fraser Governmentthat is, 1981-82-a miserable sum of $685m was allocated for all road construction and maintenance. In other words, the allocation of Federal funds under these Hawke Government programs is 82 per cent more in money terms and 25 per cent more in real terms than that provided by the Fraser Government in 1981-82. Total spending on the 16,OOO-kilometre national highway will increase by $569m in this financial year compared with $559m last financial year. The urgent need for adequate roads and the ever-increasing pressure on Australia's road system, especially the national highways, demand that road funding be placed on a predictable and assured basis. Now, for the first time ever, road funding under the Hawke Government is on a predictable and assured basis. Hawke Government road legislation gives encouragement for State and local road authorities, the construction industry and equipment suppliers to plan over a longer term, thanks to the certainty of funding. In contrast, the policy of the Liberal and National parties is the abolition of specific local road funding for the States and local government authorities. The Australian land transport program provides the most comprehensive approach ever in funding for roads. This program will sustain the record level of Federal funding for roads which has occurred since the Hawke Government came to office. The Hawke Government is determined to achieve its commitment to upgrade the national highway system by 1988. The accomplishment of this great national undertaking will earn for the Hawke Government the enduring gratitude of every Australian. It is the fulfilment of a pledge made to the Australian people in the 1984 election policy speech by the greatest Prime Minister in Australia's history, Bob Hawke.",83
55,Mr NEHL ,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"Cowper) (9.57)-What a performance Australia has been treated to tonight. The honourable member for Throsby ( Mr Hollis) and the honourable member for Herbert ( Mr Lindsay) came in here and trotted out the tired old cliches and the stale pastry, saying that it was the Fraser-Anthony Government that caused the trouble; that Mr Fraser and Mr Anthony were the bad boys. Whenever honourable members opposite cannot stand up to the truth, whenever they cannot face reality, what do they do? They blame the Fraser Government. What a useless lot of people they are. Mr Braithwaite-Look; they have run out of the chamber.",85
56,Mr NEHL,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"Of course they have run out of the chamber. They know when to get out. I tell them and you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that by the time. I have finished tonight I shall have demonstrated conclusively how wrong they are continually to blame their own sins, shortcomings, faults and transgressions on the Fraser Government. It is time that they had the maturity to take what is coming to them, because it is coming soon. At the next election, they will get what is coming to them. The honourable member for Herbert-Dr Charlesworth-And a good speech, too.",85
57,Mr NEHL,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"A good speech! It was a speech full of distortions, half truths and statistics. As DisraeIi said, there are lies, damned lies, and statistics. Mr Gayler-That is what DisraeIi said.",85
58,Mr NEHL,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"I am glad that the honourable member's memory is also correct. The honourable member for Herbert said, and I can quote him, that under Fraser the people of Australia were being clobbered by heavy road tax and by the highest ever taxes. How can any member of the Hawke-Keating failed Labor Government have the utter gall to stand up in this chamber and suggest that the Fraser Government had the heaviest road tax and the highest taxes? The Keating Government, the Hawke Governmentthis current Labor Government-is without doubt, factually, the absolutely highest-taxing government this country has ever seen. It defies description. It defies imagination that any government, particularly a Labor Government, can say that it wants to look after everybody and care for the workers when all it is doing is taxing people all the way. Petrol taxes have never been higher. This is the truth. This is the reality. How can they sit there and tell us these lies, these falsehoods? Then the member for Herbert moved further and he said that the Prime Minister-good Lord!-had pledged to initiate the most comprehensive overhaul of road funding. I can tell you, Madam Deputy Speaker, this Parliament and the people of Australia, that if that is the most comprehensive overhaul of road funding, by crikey Australia wants its road funding to go in a different direction. He said also that it is the very first time we have had a truly national transport policy, and he said, with great emphasis and feeling, that for the first time under the Hawke Government we have a predictable and assured future for road funding. Let us just consider what that predictable and assured future really is. I would like to refer to a table produced by the Australian Automobile Association, which covers Commonwealth road funding as a proportion of total Commonwealth Budget outlays from 1976-77 to 1986-87. Mr Gayler-In 1976-77? You are getting really up to date now.",85
59,Mr NEHL,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"The honourable member might complain that I am going back a few years, but that is all that the Government speakers have done. That is all they ever do. If they want to go back to the past, I will go back to the past with them, because the figures from the past condemn them, especially in the Whitlam years. My earlier figures were only starters. Now come the fireworks. If we look at the record, we see that in 1977-78 the real increase in total funding for roads under the Fraser-Anthony Government was an extra 10.1 per cent. The next year it was an extra 6.3 per cent. The next year, 1979-80, it was up by 11.2 per cent. The next year, 1980-81, it was up another 11.2 per cent. In 1981-82, it was up another 9.1 per cent. How can they possibly sit there, stand there, open their mouths and suggest that the Fraser Government did not provide additional funds for road funding? In 1981-82, it was up 9.1 per cent. Then we come to the 1982-83 and 1983-84 figures. Of course, they are very significant years, because that was when the first money started to flow from the Australian bicentennial roads program.",86
60,Mr LLOYD ,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,Who introduced that?,86
61,Mr NEHL,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,I am about to come to that. One of the Government speakers tonight grandly proclaimed the virtue of the Hawke Government in introducing the bicentennial road program. What a load of nonsense. The man who introduced that was just sitting on my left-the honourable member for Gwydir ( Mr Hunt)-and he deserves-MONICA,86
62,Deus ex machina,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,Opposition members interjectingMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs DarIing)-Order! The House will come to order. I wish to warn you that the merriment is denigrating into rabble. Will you please come to order.,86
63,Mr NEHL,OF TOTAL COMMONWEALTH BUDGET,"Thank you for your protection, Madam Deputy Speaker. I can see that the people on your right need that control. The reality is-there is no confusion about it in the minds of intelligent, sane people-that the bicentennial road funding was started in the FraserAnthony Government's time. It was conceived, developed and introduced by the honourable member for Gwydir. The thanks of every person in Australia are due to that man sitting there on the Opposition front bench. In the first year when the bicentennial funds started to flow, we had an increase of 24.2 per cent. The next year, 1983-84, which was the year of Mr Keating's first Budget, very nicely and appropriately for the Australian people the bicentennial road funding money really came on stream, and the increase that year was 40.4 per cent. I know that it suits the political purposes of those sitting on the Government benches to claim: 'We did this; we provided - an extra 40.4 per cent.' But the reality-most Australians know it-is that that bicentennial road funding money came from the initiative of the honourable member for Gwydir in the Fraser-Anthony Government. The other point that should be made about that is that the 2c a litre all went towards road funding, but when the Hawke Government came in, it indexed the 2c a litre. I suppose that could be reasonable, provided that the money obtained from it went to roads, but is that happening? No. The Government is siphoning off all the extra money and taking it away from roads. Apart from the 1983-84 Budget, when the big boost came from the bicentennial money, what is the record of the so-called world's best Treasurer in his last three Budgets? In 1984-85, the amount of money provided in total for road funding increased by 4.2 per cent. That was the smallest increase since 1977-78. We can see why there is some value occasionally in going back a little into history. In 1985-86, the increase was zero, zilch, nothing. In 1986-87, the percentage increase was again nothing. Yet they have the hide to stand there and say: 'Australia, the Hawke Government is saving you'. My goodness gracious me, what a load of nonsense. I seek leave to incorporate this table in Hansard. Leave granted. The table read as followsNA Year AL TP ABRD 1976-77 . 434 1977-78. 478 1978-79. 508 1979-80. 565 1980-81 . 628 1981-82. 685 1982-83. 734 1983-84. 778 1984-85. 828 1985-86. 805 1986-87. 805",86
64,Mr NEHL,COMMONWEALTH ROAD FUNDING AS A PROPORTION,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I thank the Minister for his courtesy. This Bill that we are considering tonight seeks to amend the Australian Land Transport (Financial Assistance) Act 1985, and the Bill gives legislative sanction to the announcement of EmptyHere on 12 June 1986 that the Australian land transport program fund would be reduced by $50m in 1986-87, and that this reduction would be achieved by reducing the rate of excise duty payable to the AL TP by 0.235c per litre from 1 July 1986. Clause 3 of the Bill then varied the rate of duty calculated in accordance with section 14 of the principal Act from 3.845c per litre to 3.61Oc per litre. In addition to the cuts effected by the Bill, the Budget further reduced the funds available to the AL TP by $24m. However, in the case of the Budget cut, the funds have been collected by the Commonwealth in trust funds. The $24m appears as income derived by the Commonwealth which has not been spent. The Budget decision to increase the excise payable on petroleum products and diesel fuel will provide the Commonwealth with an increase in revenue of $625m, thereby boosting excise revenues from petroleum and diesel sources to an estimated $5.6 billion in 1986-87-up 96 per cent on the revenues collected in 1985-86. It is extraordinary that any government can increase the revenues from excise by 96 per cent in one year. I find that absolutely amazing. Mr MCYeigh-That would be a world record, wouldn't it?",87
65,Mr NEHL,COMMONWEALTH ROAD FUNDING AS A PROPORTION,"It has to be a world record. The Commonwealth is now collecting 23.884c of the cost of every litre of petrol or diesel.

The financial high point in the roads funding achieved in 1983 was as a result of the National Party's introduction of the ABRD. In the three years of the Labor Government, collections by the Federal Government have risen by 14c per litre of fuel-a 400 per cent increase in the level of previous revenue collections. At present, 25.948c of revenue is collected by the Commonwealth for each litre of fuel, and that includes the additional 2c per litre rise announced by the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Gareth Evans, within days of the Budget. This compares most unfavourably with the 10.007c per litre of fuel collected by the Commonwealth as excise or duty at the time of the Budget last year. It represents an increase of 15.941 c per litre in revenue collections by the Commonwealth in the last financial year alone. It clearly indicates that this Government-this failed Hawke-Keating Government--is using motorists as a milch cow for revenue. The Commonwealth is not prepared to reinvest funds collected from motorists in roads. In fact, the Australian economy is now hooked on fuel excise and the Hawke Government is mainlining on petrol taxes. What are some of the economic costs of the decision to cut road funds by $74m? There is the loss of 6,512 new jobs. That figure is based on the Australian road system study by the National Association of Australian State Road Authorities, which found that, for every $lm spent on roads, 88 jobs were created. This decision to cut funding for roads has cost 2,738 jobs in road construction, 1,036 jobs in allied supply industries, and a further 2,738 jobs in other industrial sectors. That should be compared with the number of new jobs created in the tourist industry for the expenditure of $1 m. Twenty-six jobs are created in the tourist industry for the expenditure of every $1 m, but 88 jobs are created for the expenditure of that amount on roads. The cutback in road funding will maintain unnecessarily high costs of freight and will work totally adversely to the benefit of Australia and all Australians.

66,Mr RUDDOCK ,ADJOURNMENT,"Dundas) (10.13)-ln the adjournment debate tonight I want to talk briefly about the concept of multiculturalism and the importance to Australia of the extent to which this Government has let down the migrant community by largely terminating the English as a second language program. I think it is important that people understand what multiculturalism means, because it is the concept by which we talk of the important respect that people have for the values, culture and background of people from different countries who have settled in Australia. It is not separatism, as some people often seek to advance. Certainly, one of the most important programs designed to ensure that multiculturalism is not separatism is that in which migrants are encouraged and aided to be able to speak English and to communicate within our community. This is a very strong view held by migrants whom I have met over the time that I have been in public life. It is evidenced by the desire of migrants, when they settle in Australia, to learn English and, particularly, the aspirations that they have for their children and their families in the Australian community. It was therefore with great alarm that I learnt in the Budget that the Government had decided to reduce by almost half the amount of funding available for the teaching of English as a second language-the ESL program. It has been most distressing to migrants, their families and the teachers who are involved in assisting such young people to overcome the very significant disadvantage that they suffer. Budgets are always a difficult question. It has always seemed to me that it is a matter of priorities. If priorities had to be determined in the cutting back of government expenditure in the education area, there are much more fundamental areas, I think, in which changes could have been made than the area of these ESL programs. I would have seen it as being most important to maintain those programs. In order that one can see this in perspective, I think one should look at one of the Government's own reports on this matter. I quote from the report of the Karmel Quality of Education Review Committee, in relation to the funding of programs in this area: The immigration program brings to Australia each year a sizable number of students who have minimal or no proficiency in English on their arrival. Their need for intensive instruction in the English language is immediate and obvious. Without access to English they are deprived of access to education and to an alien culture. Within the group there are those whose pressing needs extend beyond English language instruction because they are illiterate in their mother tongue. These tend to be young people with refugee status who have received no schooling in their homeland or whose schooling has been seriously interrupted. The Commonwealth, which is involved in bringing migrants to Australia, in inviting them to settle here, has a special responsibility in this area. The maintenance of these programs is of the utmost importance. I do not think the States, which will have the responsibility of ensuring that these programs are maintained, will see that they have the same responsibility in this area. I suspect that these programs will be sacrificed when the States have to examine their own priorities. In particular, the smaller States may not have had the same experience in these areas. Some schools which offer these programs, such as those in my own electorate, have small classes. Sometimes only 30 or 40 children in a school require special assistance through the English as a second language tuition program. These schools will be particularly disadvantaged and are more likely to see those programs terminated as a result of the need to save funds in this area. It has been suggested that in New South Wales up to 30,000 children may be disadvantaged through these programs being discontinued and through the lack of access to English as a second language program. It has also been noted that it may lead to a significant number of migrant students having their schooling terminated early if programs of this sort are not available. These cuts that have been made by the Federal Government run counter to advice that the Commonwealth has received through the Schools Commission to increase the amount of funding available in this area and not make a reduction. I must say that I share the view of migrants and teaching authorities who have commented on these decisions that the Government in its more recent steps has been in the business of obfuscation rather than clarification of the situation. One can only describe the Government's more recent announcement as an insulting confidence trick in relation to the migrants and young people who are in need of this very special service.",88
67,Mr LANGMORE ,ADJOURNMENT,"Fraser) (1O.18)-This House is too commonly a forum for destructive conflict. Disputes are sometimes created artificially, as they were by the Opposition this noon, to attempt to achieve a perceived tactical advantage. But the result commonly is simply to undermine the authority of parliament in the community. There is also, however, much constructive discussion. Tonight I want to mention some centrally important good news for the people of the Australian Capital Territory. The Minister for Territories ( Mr Scholes) today released the economic report for the Territory for the June quarter. That report shows that there has been particularly rapid growth of employment in Canberra during the last year. In 198586 the number of people in employment in the Territory increased by 8 per cent, by 9,600 people. This is a remarkable increase. To provide a point of contrast I mention that the Australian population is growing by about 1.6 per cent a year. Total employment in the whole of Australia increased last year by 5.3 per cent, which was itself a remarkable achievement. National employment growth at this pace is the result of successful economic policies. Moderately expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, combined with falling labour costs, in substantial economic and employment growth. The particularly rapid growth of employment in Canberra was influenced by both this national trend and the stimulus given to the local economy by public expenditure. There was substantial growth of employment in public administration and defence. A significant contribution came from the opening of the new Australian Defence Force Academy. Employment remains strong in house building and construction. In the year to March the value of building and construction work totalled $715m, of which about 30 per cent was for private and public housing, 15 per cent was for offices and 16 per cent was for the new Parliament House. That high level of building and construction activity stimulated growth and employmt!nt in other industries such as the wholesale and retail trade, manufacturing and community services. The strong employment growth has reduced unemployment. In the June quarter it was down to 4.6 per cent, and only half of those unemployed were look,ing for full time work. Youth unemployment, too, is low. Most 15 to 19-year olds are attending school, college or university. Of those who are in the work force, the present unemployment rate is 19 per cent, which is about the same as the national average. This is high and of great concern, and continuing to reduce that rate must have a high priority. However, two-thirds of the youth unemployed are looking for part time work. It is clear that many afterif not most of these are students wanting to supplement their income. Total unemployment is low and it is falling despite the fact that the population of the Australian Capital Territory grew last year by 4.5 per cent. The proportion of the adult population now in the work forcewhat is called the participation rate-is 73 per cent, compared with the national rate of 62 per cent. This makes the achievement even more remarkable. I have concentrated on employment and unemployment because these are central concerns in Australia. The issue to which most Australians would like the Government to give high priority is employment. There has been rapid growth in employment throughout Australia for the past three years and unemployme\lt has fallen significantly, but it remains a serious problem. There are still over 600,000 people who want to work and are actively looking for work but who are unable to find a job. For these people, unemployment involves poverty and often loss of personal dignity. No community can be satisfied with this situation. The Government and the resulted whole community must make employment growth one of its top priorities. This is a difficult task but the last three years have shown that progress is possible. The principal requirement is a strong commitment to the goal of reducing unemployment.",89
68,Mr MCVEIGH ,ADJOURNMENT,"Groom) (10.22)-1 suppose it is true that the adjournment debate occasionally generates into the playing of party politics. I seek not to follow that course tonight. I believe it is appropriate, however, that we take the opportunities that are available to back benchers to set the record straight. That is what I seek to do tonight. I wish to tell you, Madam Speaker, that I told the Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism ( Mr John Brown) that I wanted to correct four errors of fact in his answer to a question yesterday. I can understand, having been in the killing pen myself, how easy it is not to give correct figures. I would never plead guilty, of course, to having given incorrect figures. I shall quote from the Minister's reply to a question. Seeing that it came from the honourable member for Greenway ( Mr Gorman), I do not want to imply that it was a dorothy dixer. At page 1117 the Minister said: Therefore, I wonder whether we should believe that the Surf Life Saving Association, which this year is to get $ I m from this Government to continue its work, should go back to the $100,000 they used to give it, or that the Royal Life Saving Society, which is charged with teaching Australian kids how to swim, can look forward to going back to $100,000 instead of the $350,000 it will get this year. The same thing can be repeated in respect of a dozen other organisations. I suppose our Olympic athletes will go back to running chook raffies, like they used to do during the term of office of the previous Government, so that they can attend Olympic games, whereas under this Government they receive $1.4m. That passage contains four errors of fact. Contrary to what the Minister said, the Surf Life Saving Association did not receive $\00,000 in the year of my stewardship, in 1982. I refer to the Budget statement of 1982-83 and I shall be quite happy to table this and other documents. The statement makes it clear that the Association received $400,000. That is one error of fact. The Minister said in his reply that the Royal Life Saving Society-this was in reply to the dorothy dixer-received $\00,000 from the Government of which I was a member. The Budget statement shows that it received $200,000. That is the second error of fact. Very importantly, the Minister said that his Government gave $1.4m to the Olympic athletes. The Budget statements of 1982-83, the year of my stewardship, state that $0.5m of special assistance was provided as the first instalment of a $1.4m program towards team preparation for the 1984 Olympic Games. It was a commitment and a gift from the Fraser-Anthony Government, which the Hawke Administration honoured. That is the third error of fact. The Minister said also that the Royal Life Saving Society is charged with teaching kids to swim. I have the charter of the Society and nowhere does it say that it is charged with that responsibility. That is the fourth error of fact. I want to bring to the notice of the House-Mr Robert Brown-Trivia.",89
69,Mr MCVEIGH,ADJOURNMENT,"If the honourable member thinks sport is trivia, so be it. We know of the commitment of athletes to their sports and I think that it is time that we gave due credit for results achieved and the generosity shown by previous governments. The Minister, in answer to a dorothy dixer-I am not saying that he misled the House-gave incorrect information. I seek leave to table the documents to which I have referred. I do not do this in any spirit of ill will. I just want to have the record set straight. I am not accusing the Minister of having misled the House. Mr MCGauran-Well, I am.",90

73,Mr MARTIN ,ADJOURNMENT,"Macarthur) (lO.27)-For a couple of months we have been hearing, particularly from Opposition members, forecasts of doom and gloom that have been based on what is happening in the economy. We have been told that we are heading to a recession. Opposition members have been guilty particularly of pushing that point of view. They have been suggesting that those whom they support and represent-the business community-are right behind them in suggesting that the economy is heading for a recession. I would like to point out to those Opposition members that they should take heed of an article that appeared in the Bulletin last week, dated 23 September, under the heading, 'Corporate chiefs scotch talk of recession'. I am sure that many Opposition members have not had the opportunity to read the article and I wish' selectively to pull out some points of view that are set out in it. I refer first to Sir - eter Abeles, managing director of the TNT company. He was asked for his view of Australia's economy and whether it was heading for a recession. He said: I do not agree a recession is necessarily there. It will depend, of course, half on our own actions and half on the rest of the world's economy. He was drawing attention to the very things which the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) has been saying. He was saying that many of the things that have been faced by the Australian economy in recent times have been caused by external factors. He added: If theythat is a reference to the forecasters, the economic geniuses that pervade our societysay business will be subdued I would agree with thatbut do not forget we have had some very big years. He was asked what action was needed to avert any likelihood of recession and he replied that in non-political but factual terms the average Australian had to understand that we have to compete with the world. He added: We must knock on every door a hundred times and sell. That is exactly the message that the Government is endeavouring to get across to those in the business community. What did John Saunders, the joint managing director of Westfield Holdings Ltd, have to say on this issue? The article states: . . . he definitely didn't agree a recession was imminent. He said: I'm prepared to bet my bottom rates come down two percent a month before Christmas we'll see a Christmas trading boom. Everybody is trying to paint a picture of gloom which has made people and particularly consumers nervous. The article continues: Saunders's assessment· of confidence in the business community is based in large measure on the demand for space in the group's shopping centres. He said: At Chatswood we have 622 applicants for 130 shops; at Pagewood we have 700 applicants for 150 shops. He went on to say: We must remember we are not the only country having problems selling wheat, sugar and minerals. It doesn't matter what politicians are in Canberra, they would all have the same problems. I think that is a very good attitude to take. The honourable member for Groom ( Mr MCVeigh) made reference to a bipartisan approach to sport. That is exactly the sort of point being made by those in big business in relation to the problems facing Australia. They are providing constructive suggestions as to how we might overcome our difficulties. I would like to refer also to some comments made by Brian Loton, the Managing Director and Chief Executive of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. I am pleased to see that my colleagues the honourable members for Charlton ( Mr Robert Brown), Throsby ( Mr Hollis) and Hughes ( Mr Tickner) are in the chamber tonight, as well as the honourable member for Cunningham, the Minister for Housing and Construction ( Mr West) as we all represent steel producing areas. Brian Loton, when referring to the likelihood of a recession, said: It depends what is meant by recession. We would not expect negative growth because we agree with the government that net exports will make a substantial contribution to growth in 1986-87. The Treasurer has said it. The Budget Papers say that that is the case. Here we have BHP's Managing Director and Chief Executive suggesting that that is exactly the position. Obviously, there is no lack of confidence in the economy, because BHP is investing incredible amounts of money in industry in Wollongong and Newcastle and, indeed, it hopes to start a mini steel mill in the western suburbs-I hope it will reconsider that and put it in Wollongong-and so, too, are many of the other major business concerns in Australia. They are not agreeing with the gloom and doom mentality of the Opposition. They are saying that we can trade our way our of this position, that we can invest and eventually see the Australian economy return to a position of dollar that if interest strength.",90

75,Mr WILSON ,ADJOURNMENT,"Sturt) (10.33)--For some years now the Australian· Broadcasting Tribunal has been criticised for its lack of practical and economic understanding of the industry operations under its supervision. In April 1984 it announced in its publication Abtee that there was to be a review of its information needs. This was a response to the well-known criticisms of the way the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal was carrying out its responsibilities. These weaknesses had been long standing and were acknowledged in the final reports of the old Australian Broadcasting Control Board. On 19 April 1984, the ABT publicly announced that it had commissioned Professor Neil Runcie to conduct a review. The Press release said: The Tribunal considers itself extremely fortunate in securing Professor Runcie's services, especially considering his extensive knowledge and experience in economic and statistical matters and close personal interest in the electronic media. Why, then, were Professor Runcie's recommendations hidden from public scrutiny? In view of the public announcement of the review, the public would have expected a public report of the outcome of the review. The report was apparently due by 30 June 1984, but there was not mention of it in the 1984 or 1985 annual reports of the ABT. With some difficulty I have obtained a copy of the summary volume. The ABT was not forthcoming when I sought this report and it was necessary for me, as a member of parliament, to use the Freedom of Information Act to prise it out of the ABT. In contrast with the public fanfare given to the commissioning of the review, the receipt of the report and its contents have been kept very quiet. No wonder-because to make the report public would expose the ABT's serious internal weaknesses. The preamble of the Runcie report points out that: to undertake economic analysis in the Australian broadcasting system three elements the ABT requires: (i) an organised database; (ii) a body of economic studies of the broadcasting industries, and; (iii) qualified persons to apply economic perceptions and tools to the many broadcasting problems requiring government decisions. The ABT is lacking in all of these areas. Professor Runcie also said that the information requirements of the ABT are wider than economic data, as the electronic media affect every aspect of our educational, social entertainment and cultural activities. In a biting comment at the end of the report, Professor Runcie says: Indeed, the ABT has been likened to 'Dad's Army' fighting imaginary battles with out-of-date equipment and getting in the way of the main broadcasting battalions. There is substance to these criticisms and the ABT must guard against the en tropic effect of its 'closed system', created by its excessively legalistic nature. He goes on to say: Throughout this report I have advocated a multidisciplinary research programme to open up, as it were, the 'closed system', thereby helping the ABT to serve better its functions and the Australian community. The Runcie report documents many of the weaknesses in the present system and lists over 120 recommendations. It criticises the Coffs Harbour inquiry which was confused, costly and lengthy, confirming the need for more systematic information gathering from established stations as well as applicants for licences. The Broadcasting and Television Act places a clear responsibility on the ABT to act as an information collecting body for the community, not just itself. The Runcie report expresses doubt about the ABT's fulfilment of this role. It strongly criticises the chaotic state of reporting by public broadcasters due to the confusing and inadequately designed forms used by the ABT. I ask the Minister for Communications ( Mr Duffy) four questions: Has he read this report? Why has the ABT been so secretive about it? Has it implemented the recommendations of the report? If not, why not?",91
76,Ms MCHUGH ,ADJOURNMENT,"Phillip) (10.36)-I rise to speak, as so many of us have so often in the past, on behalf of the people of Chile, who have suffered now for 13 years under the repressive regime of the military dictatorship of General Pinochet. It is now 13 years since that dictatorship overtook the democratic processes in Chile. The torture, the killings, the imprisonments and the disappearances in Chile over those years have been well documented by groups such as Amnesty International. On Sunday 7 September 1986, after the attempt on the life of General Pinochet, the military regime reimposed the state of siege. The result of that has been a very much increased imposition of the repressive mechanisms of that regime. This has worsened the effect felt by the people of Chile. To make the Australian public and the Australian Government more aware of what is happening in Chile, 11 young Chilean refugees in Australia began a hunger strike on 10 September, in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. Since 4 p.m. on 10 September they have been refusing food. Six of those young Chileans are still fasting. Representatives of the Chilean youth came to Canberra today to make us aware of why their colleagues are undertaking that fearful way of showing the Australian public just how bad the repressive regime in Chile is. I read to the House the following statement that those young people put out: Without any doubt, the reintroduction of the state of siege is just another measure used by the Chilean regime to increase its repression against those who oppose the dictatorship, and a way of openly arresting leaders of political and social organisations. In less than 24 hours, after the reinstatement of the state of siege, hundreds of people were arrested,this is just in the last few weekssome of whose whereabouts are not known, there have been massive and selective house searches, specially in shanty towns, all forms of meeting are banned. There is total censorship of the press, personal mail is intercepted and interfered with and any person who is arrested risks . . . exile and disappearance. Amongst those who have been killed is Jose Carrasco, a member of the National Body of the Journalists Union. He was found dead on Monday the 8th in a street in Santiago. He had been shot in the head 10 times. Amongst those who have disappeared are the President of the Popular Democratic Movement, a clergyman and member of the executive body of the Popular Democratic Movement, members of the Democratic Alliance and a number of leaders of the teachers union. Ei'ght priests have been arrested in the last few weeks and most of those arrested were taken away in front of witnesses as were four students who were abducted by the CNI, the secret police, from a Dutch diplomatic car. Recently, with members of Amnesty International, I visited the Chilean Ambassador in Canberra to protest against the regime in Chile. We did not have to suffer the sort of thing that goes on in Chile when we made diplomatic representations. The Chilean youth resident in Australia have asked several questions of the Australian Government and the Australian people. They have asked the Australian Government, through a public statement, to condemn and denounce the recent escalation of repression imposed since the reinstatement of the state of seige. They protest and question the presence of the Chilean representatives in Australia who recently have made statements to the effect that everything in their country is all right and that the situation is the fault of those who are arrested. Is it the fault of the eight priests who were arrested recently? They call on the Government to interrupt the subsidies given to the private sector if it maintains economic ties with Chile. They call on the World Council of Churches to make a public statement regarding the latest wave of repression and violation of human rights inflicted upon the Chilean people and the Chilean church. They call upon the citizens of Australia to denounce the repression and come out in solidarity with the Chilean cause through their respective organisations, and I join them.",92
77,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Leo McLeay)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,93
78,Mr ANDREW ,ADJOURNMENT,"Wakefield) (10.41)-1I have come i!lto the chamber to participate in this adjournment debate following an outburst just a few minutes ago from the honourable member for MCMillan ( Mr Cunningham). As the Acting Government Whip he challenged the role of the Opposition Whip and expressed his concern and indeed criticised the Opposition's tactic in having alerted you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the absence in the House of sufficient members to form a quorum. I rise tonight to express my indignation that members of the Government should see a quorum as some form of punishment. Those who serve in this chamber ought to recognise that the requirement that one-third of the members of the Parliament be present is not an unreasonable demand to make. There are those who have said-as did the honourable member for McMillan-that the calling of quorums by the Opposition has been done in an irresponsible and bloody-minded fashion. For as long as I have been the Deputy Opposition Whip-indeed as long as I have been a member of the Opposition-I have not known quorums to be called in either a bloody-minded or irresponsible fashion. Every member of the Government ought to know that there has never been a quorum called by this Opposition which was not first precipitated by a member of the Government abusing Question Time. There are those who will raise their voices in indignation but five minutes is not an unreasonable period to be set aside to answer a question. It is as much time as the House makes available for a speaker to participate in an adjournment debate. At no time. I stress thishas a quorum been called in this House without it first being precipitated by a Minister taking more than five minutes to answer a question. I take up the point made by the honourable member opposite. The calling of a quorum is not intended as a punishment but Government members seem to see it as such and so the honourable member for MCMillan expressed indignation about it. If honourable members want an illustration of the even-handed approach by the Opposition Whip to this whole exercise I will tell them that yesterday, in what was an impeccable performance by Government Ministers, no quorums were tripped. Inevitably, in the heat of the chamber, there are those who, from time to time, call a quorum without the Whip being aware of its happening. I have no doubt it has happened no matter who has occupied the Opposition benches. Nonetheless, there is such a reservoir of uncalled quorums in the Opposition Whip's office that if it went on forever it would not matter. The calling of quorums is decided each day and no quorums are ever called prior to Question Time, nor are any called unless Ministers take more than five minutes to answer a question. If the honourable member for MCMillan felt that today's exercise was a little hard for the soft-centred Government members to take, let me remind him that after six minutes he tripped two quorums, after seven minutes three and a good deal more could have been called. I restate the case. It is an indictment on the Government to see the calling of quorums as some sort of imposition on it. It seems that this Government has been anxious to avoid the scrutiny of the House. I am pleased that the Special Minister of State ( Mr Young) is in the House this evening because he has accused the Opposition in the past of declaring Bills urgent Bills more frequently than he has. Such an accusation is nonsense, and any survey of the figures will indicate that the Hawke Government has declared Bills urgent far more often than did the Fraser or Whitlam governments. The Whitlam Government declared urgent an average of 20 Bills per year, the Fraser Government two and the Hawke Government l6-a case, I fear, of this House and its Standing Orders once again having been conveniently abused by the people who occupy the government seats.",93
79,Mr CUNNINGHAM ,ADJOURNMENT,"MCMillan) (10.46)-1I have to rise in view of the comments of the honourable 'member for Wakefield ( Mr Andrew), who reported to the House a discussion I held, in my capacity as Acting Whip, with the Opposition Whip. It has become quite obvious in dealings between one Whip's office and another that the Opposition calls quorums unnecessarily. This evening the honourable member for O'Connor ( Mr Tuckey) was let loose to call two quorums on one of our speakers. Seven Government members spoke tonight and every one of them had a quorum called in his speech. Being the Acting Whip, I took it upon myself to question the Opposition Whip as to why the Opposition was breaking the sensible arrangements that are negotiated between one Whip's office and another in order to have a smooth running of the House. I believe that we on this side are quite amicable towards the Opposition. It has a right to be heard and, as far as the Government and the Leader of the House ( Mr Young) are concerned, we are quite willing to have open debate as is expected in this place. However, as the honourable member for Wakefield has sought tonight to use the chamber as a forum to talk about negotiations that have taken place between the two Whips, I might take a completely different view and have discussions with the Leader of the House in future. Tonight every time Government members stood to exercise their right to speak in this House, quorums were called with the express purpose of disrupting them. We all know that under the Standing Orders the Opposition does not bother to come in when it calls a quorum; it leaves that to the Government. But it makes an excuse. The Opposition claims that it has written a new standing order into the books becauseMr Connolly- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member is quite obviously threatening the Opposition in what he is saying. I suggest that that is a breach of privilege. There is no question that he is threatening the Opposition.",94
80,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Leo McLeay)-Order! There is no point of order.,94
81,Mr CUNNINGHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"It appears that the Opposition is writing a new standing order of its own. It is incapable of using Question Time effectively to challenge the Government on any policy at all. It is claiming that when a Minister is required to give an answer he should be set a time limit. I do not find anywhere in the Standing Orders that a Minister is required, by the Opposition in particular, to answer a question in a particular time. Yet tonight I was informed by the Opposition Whip, in a threatening way and it has been repeated tonight by the honourable member for Wakefield, that if Ministers go beyond a certain time the Opposition will disrupt Government speakers every time they get to their feet. If that is not a threat, I do not know what is. The Opposition Whip stood in my office tonight and told me bluntly that, if our Ministers did not obey a new standing order that they want to impose, they will disrupt our speakers time and again. This is an Opposition that cannot get its message through at Question Time. I have copies here of the answers given to questions asked by the Opposition and asked by the Government that required lengthy answers. The Opposition set the criteria at Question Time today. Would the House like me to go through them again? I certainly could not do it in five minutes. In an answer by the Leader of the House time was put to good use. Certainly he used more than five minutes. One could speak for one hour on the number of people on the Opposition side who have used and abused the parliamentary position that they have held here over many years. The Opposition has not heard the last of that issue if it wants to use these tactics in the future.",94
82,Mr COWAN ,ADJOURNMENT,"Lyne) (1O.51)-The matter I wish to raise tonight concerns the harnessing of Australia's water resources. It has concerned me for a number of years. There has not been sufficient finance to further water conservation. At the present, I do not think we should accept the fact that our markets for primary industry are not good throughout the world as a reason why we should not use more funds generally for these most important projects. I realise that although it is the responsibility of the States to undertake these projects, over the years it has been the responsibility of the Commonwealth to undertake such projects as the Snowy Mountains scheme, and the Burdekin Dam in Queensland. Nevertheless, it is our responsibility as the collector of funds in Australia to see that we have more money available for the development of this great continent. No matter what state our markets are in, no matter what state the economy is in, we will still be dependent upon the products from the farm to earn the wealth for this great nation of ours. Therefore, it important that we should not be left behind in the development of water conservation in our streams and our dam sites throughout Australia. Not only are these resources used for irrigation on farms but they are used also in many cases for domestic purposes. There is also a challenge today for the farmer to grow alternative crops, most of which are smaller crops such as oilseeds, maize, lucerne or other crops for which there may be markets within Australia and overseas. To be able to produce these crops at a reasonable cost it is essential that farmers have water for irrigation. If one goes to America, Europe, or most primary industry countries throughout the world one finds that those countries have harnessed all the resources that they possibly can. In the western water district of California, in Sierra Nevada, there are about 250 dams which have been filled by melting snow. We do not have that quantity of snow here; we are not as lucky as America or other countries. We have done what we can with the snow we have in developing the Snowy Mountains scheme. But we have other natural areas which we can harness. We have rivers running into the sea and we can divert water from one area to another. These things can be done economically. All the States have done a magnificent job in many respects. The State Ministers for water conservation have been restricted because they have not had the funds available. There is a tendency today-particularly for the Commonwealth and for most of the States-to disregard our gIeat challenge to develop water resources. It is a challenge that we, as responsible people, cannot afford to let go. If we are to sustain our primary industries-42 per cent of our exports depend on what is termed 'off the farm'-and if we are to meet the challenge of the economy of this nation over the years to come, we must meet that responsibility and divert more of these important funds into the great natural resources that we have in Australia. Not only are dams such as the Keepit Dam used for irrigation and domestic supply but they are used also for tourism.",94
83,Mr HODGMAN ,ADJOURNMENT,Correct.,95
84,Mr COWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I am sure there are such dams main in Tasmania. Most of these dams are a tremendous attraction for skiing, boating, and most forms of sport. In this way they are very important to Australia. I am very pleased to raise this matter before the House. We have to keep in mind that, no matter who sits on the treasury bench, the challenge is before them. Our minds is so should not be diverted by other unproductive projects which may take their place.",95
85,Ms MAYER ,ADJOURNMENT,"Chisholm) (10.56)-I am appalled at the outrageous hypocrisy of the Opposition members in this House. Time after time honourable members on that side of the House have uttered pious platitudes about the value of family life, yet when a Minister arranges that his family should not be left alone for many days at a time, the Opposition attacks him. Does the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) have to neglect his family, have his young children grow up without a father, in order to do his job? Are Opposition members guilty because they choose politics before their children, or are they simply applying their usual double standard? This afternoon the Treasurer reminded the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard) of a simple fact. If the Treasurer had sent his family back to Sydney, the Opposition would not have even raised this issue. If the Treasurer's wife and young children lived in Sydney while he worked his usual six to seven day week in Canberra it would not have attacked him at all. Who raised this issue? It was the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Everingham), who moved his family to Brisbane so that he could be with them more often. He said, and I quote from the Sunday Territorian of 22 December 1985: I am trying to fix up my personal life so that the people who depend on me are in the best personal situation . . . If I were a solicitor it would be different, but I am a Federal member who's away a lot. If the honourable member for the Northern Territory believes that he can live in Brisbane and still represent his Northern Territory constituents, if my neighbours the honourable member for Deakin ( Mr Beale) and the honourable EmptyHere well outside their electorates and still represent their constituents, I have no argument with that. If I have some concern about it I am prepared to accept that their families are best served by those somewhat unusual arrangements. What I do object to is a personal attack on a member of this Government for exercising the same concern for his family. Sauce for the honourable member for the Northern Territory is not apparently sauce for the Treasurer, and yet there is no doubt about whose contribution to the nation is the more important. Australians have little time for the person who plays the man and not the ball. They have even less time for out and out hypocrites who say one thing and do another. Every time an Opposition member talks about the value of the family from now on, every Australian will be reminded that these are the people who wanted to separate the Treasurer from his family. These are the people who wanted the person carrying one of the nation's most important and demanding jobs to neglect his family. These are the people who wanted young children to grow up without their father. These are the people who put the family last in their priorities. What the Opposition hates is that a man can be a brilliant Treasurer and a good husband and father. What does the Opposition want? Do members of the Opposition want everyone to conform to their doubtful standard because they are inadequate? Do they want to encourage the break up of families of members and Ministers? Do they have no respect at all for the values of family life? Do they care so little about the responsibilities of a growing family that they want those responsibilities carried by one parent? Are they totally without shame? Unfortunately the simple answer to all those questions is yes. No pretence is too great to stick in their throats. No double standard is too disgraceful for them to defend. No mud is too dirty to be thrown, and no ditch is too slimy to deter them. One really has to have a strong stomach to sit in this House and listen to the Opposition, an Opposition whose members are incapable of producing policies that are not laughable, who substitute personal attack for their abysmal failure as policy makers, whose tactics match their characters, who plumb the depths of the political gutters and who want to rise like the phoenix from the ashes of their own incapacity.",95
