The arts do not simply give us a voice and enjoy our spare time and have pleasure in our and growing sector of employment in Australia and international reputation for excellence. Why I say that we were surprised that this had, from the commencement of their political that they recognised the damage that would against allowing that to happen.

The fact is by $22 million over last year's figure, bringing was a clear increase of the aid budget in dollar was not cut, and it is quite wrong to say that it was. There was a slight fall in the measure important-the reason was not that the aid change is that the Australian economy grew at year. Thanks to the sound economic policies economy is bigger and growing. In stating the as a ratio of gross national product, GNP, of course the ratio will be smaller, despite Most Australians are pleased that our economy circumstances. On another aspect', the honourable member this ODA to GNP ratio, the honourable member to muck around with the figures and mislead.' Australian Council for Overseas Aid as his apparent consideration of Australia's justification of to the fact that, by international convention, of a country's GNP. Financial intermediation expenditure and expenditure ,.on computer software again, the GNP-the denominator-will be 6627 in this country. You cannot trust them with the for high income earners are reduced from $86 over $60,000 get a much larger tax cut than at how this budget has been received, when we look at all of the polling, we can see the in the wider Australian community. Something the GST. Some 30 per cent of all Liberal the GST. The churches reject it. The charities reject it. And the people reject it. it is, which is simply another excuse for this which have as their final aim to redistribute income earners to the top. The people who run will be children of this country. Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) to make a brief contribution on what the program and to address the misunderstandings Whilst welcoming the interest shown on the for Calwell during this debate, I must correct last week, the member for Reid referred to an aid cut to record low'. Aid cut to a record low? that this year's aid budget has been increased it to a total of just over $1.5 billion. There terms, and it was maintained in real terms. It of aid as a percentage of GNP. But-and this is program was cut; the reason for the percentage a faster rate than expected in the last financial of the Howard government, the Australian level of overseas development assistance, ODA, if the economy-the denominator-increases, then aid funding-the numerator-being maintained. has grown, despite adverse international for Reid got it wrong again. In the context of said: 'There has been an attempt by subterfuge He refers to an earlier statement by the grounds for this allegation, without any the measurement we use. Perhaps he is referring more items are to be included in the measurement services, capitalisation of mineral exploration are going to be recorded in future. So, increased. However, this is part of an OECD NA 6628 MAIN COMMITTEE agreement-SNA 93, to be precise. To claim this informed and irresponsible. Or perhaps the honourable member for Reid's on comparison of our ODA to GNP ratio to is the subterfuge in that? Using a weighted comparison of OECD countries' overseas aid because provides a more, not less, representative To sum up, the GNP has grown because because of some measurement changes. Even the 0.22 per cent claimed by that honourable cent our ODA to GNP ratio is indeed higher not the end of the mistakes of the honourable of the foreign aid program includes measures et cetera, overseas', and referred to the construction AusAID will incur some comparatively small work in the consulate in Dili but not for constructing else, for that matter. The aid budget is not other parts of the appropriation for the Department aid budget. Therefore, to say that 'much of shows ignorance, frankly, about the appropriations. The aid budget is spent on measures to assist achieve sustainable development by investing You only have to read the budget statement foreign aid program on construction of embassies, purposeful initiatives. Let me enumerate some of this year's initiatives: countries most affected by the financial crisis; Indonesia, taking total flows to an estimated including a $20 million package of cash and in-kind Fund plus humanitarian relief activities via Committee of the Red Cross; an additional for demining activities; a new three-year microfinance will make credit available to very poor entrepreneurs; target of eradicating polio and iodine deficiency the Human Rights Fund so as to expand our rights activities; and increases of $2 million support that government's economic reform achievement. It is part of the process of implementing government in Better aid for a better future very poor people in other countries. There are other errors in the honourable is already clear. The aid program was not cut; in real terms. The ODA to GNP ratio is not 0.22 above the average of OECD donor countries. Wednesday, 9 June 1999 is subterfuge or an attempt to mislead is illclaim of our so-called subterfuge is based the weighted average of OECD countries. Where average has been the long standing tradition in a the weighted average, by its very nature, picture of the total flows of ODA. of the sound policies of this government and so, our ODA to GNP ratio has not declined to member, and at the correct figure of 0.25 per than the OECD average. Unfortunately, that is member for Reid. He also claimed that 'much such as the construction of Australian embassies, of 'embassies' in Dili and Croatia. establishment costs to enable AusAID staff to 'embassies' in Dili, Croatia or anywhere used to construct embassies. Such costs come from of Foreign Affairs and Trade, not from the the foreign aid program' goes for that purpose developing countries to reduce poverty and in programs and projects of real significance. to know that, far from spending much of the the money is spent on substantial and doubling the Asia crisis fund so as to assist increasing country program assistance to $121 million; substantial assistance to East Timor, contributions for the United Nations Trust non-government otganisations and the International $2 million allocated to the emergency program initiative totalling $3 million, which an extra $670,000 to support the global disorders by 2000; a 30 per cent increase in capacity to fund small community-based human to the Solomon Islands government to further program. This is a substantial and purposeful the vision set out by the coalition in 1997 and focusing on what really matters to member for Reid's address, but I think the point it was increased in dollar terms and maintained per cent but 0.25 per cent. Australia remains And no, much of the foreign aid program is not NA Wednesday, 9 June 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE spent on construction of embassies. It is development programs, particularly in our region.

Leave granted; debate adjourned. 6629 invested in real, well-targeted and substantial appropriation bills, the honourable member for of globalisation. That is a major topic and it here and now. There are risks and problems social. The recent crisis in Asia has been an countries. But there is a real and greater danger retreating into insularity, closed markets, trade in goods and services. The interwar years tell us that economic insularity and trade prosperity and peace than is globalisation. the honourable member for Calwell made a plea to cancel debt for the poorest countries. This is reservations about whether it will work. or nothing in the absence of genuine economic the countries concerned. Indeed, it could reward decisions.

The Howard government why we have a quality aid program of which all I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Main Committee adjourned at 7.26 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: National Youth Roundtable: Applications (Question No. 543) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 24 March 1999: Further to Question No. 128 (Hansard, 11 May 1999, page 4159) concerning the National Youth Roundtable, (a) what was the cost of the National Youth Roundtable held in Parliament House, Canberra, commencing 9 March 1999; and (b) how will members of the National Youth Roundtable be assisted to enable them to consult with their peers and local communities on the issues raised by him in opening the Roundtable. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The overall cost of holding the first National Youth Roundtable was $99,980. (b) Between Roundtables participants are encouraged to demonstrate their commitment to a particular issue discussed at the Roundtable by becoming involved in a National Youth Roundtable Community Action Project which is based on participants working, both in teams and at a local community level in one or more of the issues raised at the forum. As the groups are drawn from diverse parts of Australia, this may mean collecting the views of young people on a single issue from remote, urban and regional locations depending on the community of each of the topic group members. The design of the projects involves participants working with members, government and youth to develop community based strategies and practical solutions to local issues. To support each National Roundtable Community Action Project, participants are provided with individual mentoring and support by a YMCA co-ordinator who ensures that each participant is comfortable with the range of their project and has appropriate community links, skills and resources to be able to fulfil the task that undertook to do at the first Roundtable. Federal Government departments have identified a series of resource people who are able to direct and assist Roundtable members with sourcing a range of information about policy development and provide background information. NA Regular teleconferences are held on a monthly basis for participants and their support team to exchange ideas and provide progress reports. Topic teams are also linked via the secure Internet site developed by my Department and will be provided with regular updates on the progress of their team and other teams through this facility. At the second Roundtable the participants will present their findings to the Government. Australia Post: Closure of Essendon Post Office (Question No. 589) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 11 May 1999: (1) Is it intended to close the Essendon Post Office or convert it to a licensed operation. (2) Will the Minister ensure that the Essendon Post Office continues to remain open. Mr MCGauran-The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Australia Post has advised that it has no plans at present to either close the Essendon Post Office or convert it to a licensed operation. As a small, unprofitable outlet, however, the Post Office is likely at some stage to be considered for conversion. Thus, while Australia Post is fully committed to maintaining a retail presence in the vicinity, it is not in a position to give an assurance that local postal services will always be provided from the current Post Office building. (2) As a Government Business Enterprise, Australia Post is responsible for its own commercial and management decisions within the context of Government policies and legislative requirethey ments, including the requirement that it performs its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice. Any decision to change the arrangements under which the Essendon Post Office operates would be at the discretion of Australia Post, so long as it continues to provide services to the Essendon locality consistent with its statutory obligations. Centrelink: Outsourcing Basic Functions (Question No. 597) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 11 May 1999(1) Has the Government conducted research on its own behalf or retained the services of another organisation to advise it on the steps required to outsource or privatise Centrelink's fundamental functions of assessing pension and benefit entitlements and the payment of those entitlements. (2) Is the Government considering outsourcing or privatising any of Centrelink's functions; if so, which functions. Mr Truss-The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) No. However, the Department has sought advice from consultants regarding overseas developments on new di-ections in the delivery of income support and related services. (2) As part of the Government's IT Outsourcing Initiative, Centrelink is currently testing the market for the provision of IT Infrastructure services. A Request for Proposal was released on 28 April 1999, with a Request for Tender scheduled for release in late July. Centrelink is currently evaluating responses to a Request for Proposals in relation to publishing, printing, distribution and related services and for personalisation of bulk customer letters and related mailing services. In line with the Government's decision that each agency systematically review its activities to ensure that agencies are focused on those activities that primarily the responsibility of the Commonwealth, Centrelink is examining its support functions with a view to either re-engineering or market testing. World Bank: Australian Support (Question No. 618) Mr Sawford asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 May 1999: (1) Does Australia actively support the G-Ts action and initiative on forgiving debt. (2) What is the Government's position on the Jubilee 2000 campaign. (3) Is Australia supporting the World Bank's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative; if so, how. (4) Will Australia support the World Bank's comprehensive development framework; if so, how. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Australia supported at the April 1999 meetings of the International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee and World Bank's Development Committee the examination of options to broaden, deepen and hasten debt relief under the World Bank-IMF Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. This examination of options to enhance the Initiative is being undertaken as part of a wideranging review by the Bank and IMF. The review is considering a number of proposals including suggestions by G7 countries. There is, at this stage, no agreed position by the G7 although the issue is. expected to be a focus of the G7 Cologne summit scheduled for 17-18 June 1999. (2) The Government acknowledges the good intentions behind the campaign by the Jubilee 2000 Coalition. The devastating effects on very poor countries of unmanageable debt are well known. The Government does not support the call by Jubilee 2000 for cancellation of debt, free of conditions by creditors. A key part of the solution to the debt problem-and, indeed, to achieving long term sustainable growth-is the pursuit of sound economic and social policies. Debt write-off has the potential to shield governments from their responsibilities to pursue sound policies, and to send confusing signals to those poor countries managing their economies (and debts) well and in a sustainable fashion. It is important therefore that debt relief is provided in a way which supports the pursuit of sound policies and good governanceespecially if the accumulation of unsustainable debts in the future is to be avoided. (3) Australia has supported strongly the World Bank-IMF Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative both financially and by encouraging the World are Bank and IMF to continue progress on its effective implementation. The Initiative aims to reduce the debt of the world's poorest countries to sustainable levels, subject to the pursuit of sound economic and social policies. The Government believe that it is the most credible way to provide sustainable debt relief because it seeks to achieve a lasting solution to the debt problem. Unlike previous mechanisms, the HIPC Initiative deals with debt in a comprehensive way by involving all creditors, including multilateral development institutions. The Initiative has so far committed US$6.1 billion in nominal debt service relief. In June 1998 the Treasurer, the Hon Peter Costello MP, announced Australia's contribution of A$30.5 million. Australia also supports the comprehensive review of the Initiative being undertaken by the World Bank and IMF with significant input from governments, civil society, non-government organisations and international organisations. At the April meetings of the Bank and IMF, Ministers reiterated the importance of ensuring a clear link between debt relief and sustainable development and poverty reduction, and endorsed the examination of options to provide broader, deeper and faster debt relief. Ministers also supported the continuing link between debt relief and sound economic and social policies and good governance to ensure that debt relief is not wasted. The review's conclusions and recommendations are expected to be considered at the 1999 Bank and IMF annual meetings in September. (4) Australia supports in principle the Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF) proposed by the World Bank. Australia also supports the Bank's intention to test the framework in selected countries in the next 18 months. There are, however, a number of operational and implementation aspects of the CDF-including the implications for multilateral and bilateral donors-which are yet to be resolved. The CDF aims to define, under country ownership, long-term development priorities, to improve donor coordination to achieve these priorities, and to provide a common basis for evaluation and accountability for aid programs. The CDF will be piloted over the next 18 months in 13 countries. The Bank has stated its belief that this should be sufficient to show whether it is possible to achieve the kind of broad consultation and consensus building that is needed. At the recent World Bank Development Committee meeting, attended by Australia, Ministers recognised that the ultimate test of the CDF would be in its implementation and they called on the Executive Board to monitor and evaluate progress in the pilot country cases. Australia will be a participant in discussions within the Wodd Bank, and more broadly, aimed at further refining the CDF concept.",233
