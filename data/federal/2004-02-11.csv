Although many people in Australia are able to successfully deal with the quantum of the children and of themselves, there are still inappropriate that their matters are dealt to the Family Court are great. They include the through this inquiry that the cost can extend to that could, incidentally, be spent to set the education or to provide housing and everybitter battle. Another great barrier is the delays not dealt with after a two-year period, which is least of which is the fact that children, dethrough that two-year period into an age where It may be that they have been deprived of conperiod, which will set them back for the rest of provided evidence that the status quo was accommittee members that an adversarial system is and outcomes that are in the best interests of an adversarial process where we are trying to proNA vide a definite and substantive outcome for should enjoy a loving relationship with both these matters are dealt with in a family court against the other and that provides a forum present during the period that their relationship who use this process with malintent and who sibly as some of the legal practitioners who, matters for financial gain.
