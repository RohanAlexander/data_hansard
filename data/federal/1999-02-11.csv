Mr Truss-The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) NZ citizens who have been NZ residents for at least 10 years can use this NZ residence to meet minimum residence requirements for the following Australian benefits: Age Pension; Disability Support Pension; Parenting Payment-only sole parents (subject to a 6 month waiting period if they are not widowed)-and women whose partners receive age or disability support pensions.

NZ Veteran's Pension is for ex-service personnel of 63 years of age or more and who qualify for a war disablement pension of at least 70% or more (or who are not yet 63 and unable to work for a long time). This is an alternative to NZ Superannuation, like Australian Service Pension is an alternative to Age Pension. NZ Invalid's Benefit is equivalent to Australian Disability Support Pension. For the former, a claimant must be totally blind or both permanently and severely restricted in the capacity to work. For the latter, a claimant must be permanently blind or have a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment of 20% or more under the impairment tables and a continuing inability to work. NZ Invalid's Benefit can be paid at a married rate when only one of a member of a couple qualifies. Australian Disability Support Pension cannot be paid at the married rate in such cases. The basic single rate of NZ Invalid's Benefit is $304.46 a fortnight for a single person and $253.71 a fortnight for each of a couple. Australian rates are $357.30 a fortnight and $298.10 respectively. NZ Widow's Benefit is for women over 18 whose husbands have died (there are also a number of more specific eligibility requirements). It is no longer possible to be granted a direct Australian equivalent under the agreement. NZ Domestic Purposes Benefit for sole parents is available only to those who are or have been legally married or have attained the age of 18 or years. There is no minimum age for Australian Parenting Payment for sole parents but a claimant under the agreement with NZ must have reached the minimum age required by NZ. A recipient of Domestic Purposes Benefit for sole parents must have a dependent child under 18. A sole parent receiving Australian Parenting Payment must have a dependent child under 16 or a child who attracts Child Disability Allowance. NZ beneficiaries with a child aged 7-13 are required to attend an interview once a year. Those with a child aged 14 or over must seek part-time work. Australian Parenting Payment is not activity tested. The basic of Domestic Purposes Benefit for a sole parent with one dependent child is $348.88 a fortnight. The Australian equivalent rate is $357.30 a fortnight plus a maximum of $96.40 a fortnight family allowance and $36.70 guardian allowance (total $490.40). NZ unemployment benefits have a 24 month waiting period for new arrivals, but Australian citizens entering NZ only wait 6 months. Similarly, Australian Newstart Allowance has a 104 week waiting period for new arrivals, but NZ citizens entering Australia only wait 6 months. In NZ, if the partner of an unemployed person is not granted a benefit, the unemployed person may (subject to certain conditions) get the married rate of payment. This is not possible for recipients of the equivalent Australian benefit. (6) Yes. Under the social security agreement with Australia, early access to specified payments is possible, The cost of paying pensions to NZ Agreement million. The total cost of social security entitlements approximately $42.5 million. These costs were Pensioners from New Zealand.

The total cost of paying social serate curity entitlements (including base pension plus auxiliary payments ego Rent Assistance, Family Allowance) to all NZ Agreement pensioners in 199697 was approximately $62 million. These costs were offset by $26,084,695 in reimbursement from New Zealand. This is only part of the total New Zealand reimbursement figure for 1996-97 as explained below. The Social Security Agreement with New Zealand also requires New Zealand to reimburse Australia for selected pensioners whose entitlement does not depend on the Agreement, but arises under domestic law. The total amount of reimbursement received from New Zealand in 1996-97 for all reimbursable pensioners was $46,329,427.

The New Zealand Department of Social Welfare keeps records of amounts paid to pensioners are reimbursable by Australia. Most, but not all, of these are Agreement pensioners. In 1996-97, New Zealand paid a total $NZ1.o million to 189 reimbursable pensioners. (This amount does not include supplementary payments such as accommomember dation supplement, disability allowance or special benefits.) In 1996-97, New Zealand received $NZ791,284 in reimbursement from Australia. The above amount breaks down lowing specific entitlements. New Zealand paid $NZ1,500,644 in New Zealand Superannuation to 171 reimbursable superannuitants, and received $NZ717,015 in reimbursement from Australia. list Veterans Pension is not shown separately to New Zealand Superannuation. $NZ86,602 was paid to reimbursable Invalid's Beneficiaries and $NZ62,487 was received in reimbursement from Australia. $NZ3,308 was paid to one reimbursable Widow's Beneficiary and $NZ2,227 was received in reimbursement from Australia. $NZI8,750 was paid four reimbursable Domestic Purposes Beneficiaries and $NZ9,555 was received in reimbursement from Australia.

Solomon Islands 1 Tokelau 1 Tonga 7 New Zealand 848 United Kingdom 15 Other 36 TOTAL 1,014 Employment National and Job Network: Offices (Question No. 13) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister cost for Employment Services, upon notice, on 11 November 1998: (1) Will he provide a list showing for each (a) or (b) outreach office established after 1 May J998 by (i) Employment National and (ii) a Job Network member the (A) exact address, (B) telephone number, (C) federal electoral division in which it is located, (D) name of the manager and who (E) days and hours of opening. (2) Will he provide a list showing which (a) office or (b) outreach office originally established by (i) Employment National and (ii) a Job Network was not fully operating at 3 October 1998. Mr Abbott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) See my answer to Parliamentary Question on into the folNotice Number 15. The Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business is able to provide a of current Job Network sites for items (A), (B) and (C). This list as at 11 January 1999 runs to 13 more than 30 pages and has been provided to the honourable member separately on a disk. (D) The Department does not have a record of the names of individual site managers. (E) The accessibility of services was considered to in the assessment of tenders and Job Network members are contractually bound to the days and hours stated in their tenders. However, as the days and hours of opening vary to suit local conditions and may vary seasonally, it is not possible to from NZ provide such detail.

(2) What are the details and funding commitments involved in each case. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2). The Treasury portfolio does not operate programs categorised as positive discrimination programs in the sense conveyed in the question. However, there are some programs of limited size in the consumer affairs area that target particular groups in the community. The Government set aside an additional $1 million in the 1998-99 Budget to support national consumer information initiatives to be drawn down over the next three years. This is in answer to recent Government research which reveals that many consumers such as those living in rural and remote areas, people on low incomes, those with limited English and older Australians have trouble accessing useful consumer information in our fast changing marketplace. Under the Commonwealth Financial Counselling Program approximately $2 million has been allocated in 1998/99 to 45 agencies throughout Australia to provide free financial counselling to consumers in low income households experiencing serious financial difficulties. One service under the Program primarily targets the Aboriginal community at Alice Springs. The service is provided under the auspices of the Tangentyere Council and 95% of its clients are Aboriginal people. An amount of $48,858 has been provided in 1998/99.

39,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My Department is committed to ensuring the equitable delivery of high quality health and aged care and in doing so, takes account of the need to make services available which are appropriate to the particular needs and culture of people using the services. The Government has focused its priorities on those most in need within Australian society. (2) Full details of appropriations for specific programs are included in the Portfolio Budget Statements for the Department. Second Sydney Airport (Question No. 50) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 11 November 1998: (1) Does he support the construction of Sydney's second international airport at Badgerys Creek on the outskirts of Sydney's western suburbs; if so, why; if not, why not. (2) Has the Government's environmental impact study (EIS) on constructing Sydney's second international airport at Badgerys Creek been conducted in a manner which is (a) transparent, (b) comprehensive and (c) above reproach; if so, why. (3) Will constructing Sydney's second international airport at Badgerys Creek add value to (a) Sydney's, (b) NSW's and (c) Austr-lia's (i) transport and (ii) tourism infrastructure; If so, why. (4) Did the NSW Environment Protection Agency (NSW EPA) find that (a) Badgerys will have a disproportionate impact on photochenucal smog in the area and would be a major source of the air pollutant nitrogen dioxide, (b) Badgerys Creek will generate noise that would expose many persons to levels which would exceed Australian standards, and (c) the draft EIS summary. on Badgerys Creek did - ot demonstrat- the re.al Impacts on the com!llu-lty for any partlcu!.ar - lte tion; if so, what IS his response to the fmdmg. (5) Did Mr Neil Shepherd, the Director-General of the NSW EPA, state that there are serious deficiencies in the Commonwealth's approach to conducting an EIS on Badgery- Cr-ek EPA is concerned about the ImpltcatlOns of thiS development for air quality in the Sydney basin; if so, what is his response to the statements. (6) Have the NSW Government and Opposit-on both withdrawn their support from the constructlOn of Sydney's second international erys Creek; if so, how will the airport be constructed without the support of the NSW Government. (7) Did the independent auditor Creek EIS find that the EIS was (a) defiCient, (b) limited, and (c) ambiguous and that as a result time and cost constraints imposed by the Departwould ment of Transport and Regional Development, generally does not go into the degree of detail t-at could reasonably be expected tor such a major proposal; if so, what is his response to the findings. (8) Did the independent auditor of the Badgerys Creek EIS find that the EIS had failed to (a) examine the environmental effect of not building a new airport, (b) provide an adequate econo-ic analysis of the development, (c) build confidence in the EIS, (d) identify how Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and a new airport at Badgerys Creek would operate togethe- and (e) satisfactorily examine the impact that nOIse genermade ated by the airport would have on lation, especially those living in Sydney'S west; If so, what is his response. (9) Will he reopen the process of evaluating draft EIS. proposals for building the Sydney-Canberra Ve-y Fast Train (VFf) to ensure that the Transrapld proposal is given further consideration that of the Speedrail consortium; if not, why not. (10) Will he conduct an EIS into building Sydney's second international airport outside the Sydney basin and being served by the SydneyCanberra VFf; if not, why not. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government is committed to conducting a thorough and transparent Environmental Impact Statement (ElS) process on the proposed second Cree.k airport site at Badgerys Creek. A second airport will be required to handle the growing demand for air travel and to manage the level of aircraft noise experienced by Sydney residents. Additional airport facilities are essential to Sydney's continuing role as a major commercial and employment centre. The major users of S,Y?ney Airport have endorsed the need for additIOnal opairport infrastructure in the Sydney basin, and have acknowledged that a second airport is needed. (2) The Environmental Impact Statement. (EIS) process is being undertaken in accordance wIth the requirements of the Environment Protection (Impact .and that t-e of Proposals) Act 1974. These requirements have been supplemented, for the first time, by the appointment of an independe-t auditor to scrutinise the entire EIS process. ThiS clearly demonstrates the Government's commitment to a transparent and rigorous environmental assessairport at Badgment process. (3) A second airport will be required to handle the growing demand for air travel to Sydney, .NSW and Australia. This will have flow on benefIts for of the .B.adgerys the tourism industry. A major airport at Badgerys Creek would be one of of the biggest employers in western Sydney and bring with it major infrastructure improveit ments in road and rail networks. (4) The NSW Government submission on the draft EIS, which incorporates comments from the NSW EPA, has raised a number of issues related to information contained in the draft EIS. A response to the issues raised by the NSW Government will be contained in the Final EIS that community is currently being prepared. (5) See answer to (4). (6) This question is a matter for the NSW Government and opposition. No decisions will be about the second airport until the EIS process Sydney's pop-­ has been completed. (7) The independent auditor has raised a number of issues related to information contained in the A response to the issues raised by the independent auditor will be contained in the Final EIS that alongside is currently being prepared. (8) See the answer to (7). (9) No. The Prime Minister's announcement of 4 August 1998 that the Commonwealth, NSW and ACT Governments had accepted the VHST Project Control Group's recommendation to proceed with a Proving-Up Stage with Speedrail followed a very detailed examination by the three Governments. In 1997 the three Governments established a Project Control Group (pCG) to assess the proposals and to make recommendations to the Governments. The four proponents that proceeded to the final stage of the VHST process all submitted detailed proposals. These proposals were then each assessed against a comprehensive set of criteria, as is standard practice for infrastructure projects. The PCG established a committee called the Project Evaluation Committee (the PEC) to examine the proposals in detail. The PEC consisted of representatives of the three Governments as well as technical and financial experts. It also drew on work done by a number of other experts, in such areas as economics, patronage estimations, rail operations and design, and the environment. The PEC scored the proposals according to their compliance with the terms of the project brief and also examined the economic viability and the net cost to Government of the proposals closely. The PEC found that the SpeedraiI proposal complied best with the project brief. The PCG's recommendation that the three Governments consider agreeing to a proving up stage with Speedrail drew on this work. (10) No decisions will be made about the airport until the current EIS on the Badgerys Creek proposal has been completed and considered by Government. Pinochet, General Augusto (Question No. 55) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 11 November 1998: (1) Is it important after events of international significance regarding human rights for him or a representative of the Australian diplomatic corps to state the Commonwealth's view of the event; if not why not. (2) Following the arrest of the former dictator Chile, General Augusto Pinochet, in London on 17 October 1998, has (a) he, (b) the Australian High Commissioner to the UK or (c) a member of his Department expressed the Government's support to the British Government for the action it had taken; if not, why not. (3) Has (a) he, (b) the Australian Ambassador to Spain or (c) a member of his Department expressed the Government's support to the Spanish Government for the steps it is taking to bring General Pinochet to trial on charges of mass murder; if not, why not. (4) Has (a) he, (b) the Australian Ambassador to Chile or (c) a member of his Department expressed the Government's support of the steps the British and Spanish Governments have taken to bring General Pinochet to trial on charges of mass murder to the Chilean Government; if not, why not. (5) What is the Government's position on the arrest of General Pinochet and the attempt by the Spanish Government to extradite him to Spain to stand trial for the mass murder of Spanish citizens during his rule. (6) Does the Government support in principle a judicial inquiry by either the Spanish or Chilean Governments into General Pinochet's role in the disappearances and deaths of over 3000 persons in Chile between 1973 and 1990. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows (1) The Australian Government regularly makes known its position regarding human rights, including its views on events of international significance. A recent example is the Parliamentary motion moved by the Prime Minister and passed by the House of Representatives on 10 December 1998 to mark the 50th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which reaffirmed Australia's enduring commitment to the principles enshrined in the UDHR. (2) (3) and (4) Following the arrest of Senator Pinochet, neither the Australian government nor its diplomatic representatives have made representations to the governments of Spain, the United Kingdom or Chile. The Australian Government believes that it would be inappropriate to comment on a matter that is being considered by the British legal system. (5) The Australian Government recognises that there were many serious human rights abuses in Chile during Senator Pinochet's Presidency. The Government is committed to the protection and promotion of human rights as an integral part of its foreign policy. However, the Australian Government accepts that the issue of whether Senator Pinochet should be extradited to Spain is for the relevant British authorities to decide. Senator of Pinochet's rights and obligations will be determined in accordance with existing arrangements under British and Spanish law. (6) The Australian Government is committed to the promotion and protection of human rights and welcomes efforts by other governments to advance these goals. The Australian Government recognises the right of the Spanish or any other government to seek extradition of persons alleged to have committed human rights abuses. The Australian Government also recognises the sovereign right of the Chilean people and Government to determine the most appropriate means of delivering and consolidating a transition to full democracy. The Australian Government does nol believe that it would be appropriate or helpful to comment on the means chosen by Chile to attain this goal.

Vietnam Veterans Counsel1ing Service: Far North Queensland (Question No. 76) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Veteran's Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November 1998: (1) How many Vietnam veterans live in the Far North Queensland region. (2) Is there an outposted office of the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service at Smithfield in Cairns; if so, (a) when was it established and (b) has a full-time staff position at the office become vacant; if so, (i) when and (ii) has the Government decided not to fill the position; if so, why. (3) What is the location of the nearest office of the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service to residents of Cairns. (4) If there is an office at Smithfield, (a) who owns the premises, (b) what annual rent is paid and (c) what is the duration of the lease. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Based on the Vietnam Veterans Mortality Study there are 714 veterans living in the area bounded by Tully, Mt Isa and Thursday Island. (2) No. The Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service has never established an outposted counselling centre in Cairns. Rather, the service leased premises at 11 Stanton Place, Smithfield as a base for the operations of an officer employed as a full member of the Townsville staff. This officer was engaged to coordinate the services provided by contract counsellors for Far North Queensland, including but not exclusively those in the Cairns region. With the resignation of this officer, and the appointment of a Townsville-based incumbent, the premises are no longer required. (3) The nearest Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service office to the residents of Cairns is Townsvillc. However, 12 contract counsellors service the region directly with 113 referrals being made to them in the past 9 months. (4) (a) The owners of the Stanton Street premises are Bruno and Serafino Data. (b) The annual rent was $11,644 for year 1, $12,125 for year 2, and $12,610 for year 3. (c) The lease was for 3 years. As the premises are no longer required, DV A Corporate Services attempted to negotiate a payout of the lease. This was rejected by the owners. Although the premises have cost $12,610 for the current year the relocation of the Country Outreach Coordinator position to Townsville has resulted in additional savings to the Department of $30,500 through the transfer of office equipment and fittings, and the relinquishment of the Commonwealth car. Australian Defence Force: Special Event Participation (Question No. 80) Mr Martin asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 23 November 1998: Did the ADF assist or take part in the staging the 1998 Australian Football League (AFL) grand final; if so, (a) what form did the assistance or participation take, (b) what was the cost of each component of assistance or participation, (c) was the AFL asked to pay and (d) did the ADF or his Department receive any benefits from the AFL. Mr Moore-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Defence Force (ADF) did provide assistance to the 1998 Australian Football League (AFL) grand final. It was included as part of the Public Events of Significance program, which is a series of selected events in which the ADF wishes to be involved because it provides a substantial public relations, recruiting and/or training opportunity for Defence.

Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Incidents and Accidents (Question No. 143) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: (1) Do the majority of aircraft accidents occur within a 10 kilometre radius of the point of take-off if so, what does the statistic reveal. (2) Have the probabilities of an aircraft accident occurring at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport been researched; if so (a) what does the research reveal and (b) what are the probabilities of an accident occurring during (i) take-off and (ii) landing. (3) How many aircraft accidents have occurred at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport in the last 40 years. (4) What advice has his Department received on the probabilities of an aircraft accident occurring at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) airport during the next 40 years. (5) If his Department maintains that it has not received any specific advice on these matters would he provide his reply on the basis of the information of which his department is aware. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Data derived from the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) electronic Occurrence Analysis and Safety Information System (OASIS) indiof service provided by Job Network members and However, there is no precise record kept about Service Line on a State by State basis is provided NO. OF CALLERS 2142 1383 1367 825 700 353 83 6853 action to terminate a contract from a Job Network cates that between 1 January 1987 to 31 December 1996 there were 1,964 reported fixed wing aircraft accidents in Australia. During this period, 1,557 (79%) accidents occurred within 8 kilometres (the closest appropriate database search parameter) of an aerodrome. In addition to the BASI statistics, The Boeing Commercial Airplane Group conducted a survey of Hull Loss Accidents involving the worldwide commercial jet fleet between 1959-1994. The results of the survey revealed that 24.8% of accidents occurred during take-off and initial climb and 43.4% occurred during final approach and landing. (2) The risk of an aircraft accident at Sydney Airport was researched as part of the Environment:"" al Impact Statement (E1S) for the third runway. The E1S stated that take-offs and landings are the most hazardous phases of flight, however, no separate calculations were made of the probabilities of accidents occurring during take-off and landing (p 25-13, Supplement to the draft EIS). (3) The BASI OASIS system indicates that during the period 1 January 1969 to 8 January 1999 there were twenty-seven reported accidents at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. Of these, 16 involved aircraft engaged in commercial passenger operations. (4) No specific studies have been made into the probabilities of an accident occurring at Sydney Airport during the next 40 years. Given the rapid rate of technological change it is not considered feasible that meaningful projections could be made over a 40 year time horizon. (5) See above. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: (Question No. 144) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: Did an incident occur at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport during the afternoon of 21 March 1998 involving an Ansett aircraft which was required to abort its landing; if so, (a) what were the circumstances in which the aircraft aborted its landing, (b) what were the cross and down wind components at the time and (c) has the appropriateness of the selected operational runway in the prevailing wind conditions been investigated; if so, with what outcome. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation has advised that it has no record of an occurrence at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport involving an Ansett aircraft on 21 March 1998. Ansett Airlines has also advised that it has no record of an occurrence at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport on 21 March 1998. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: (Question No. 145) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: Further to the answer to question No. 99 (Hansard, 20 August 1996, page 3289), would he bring up-to-date the information which was provided on the number of (a) air safety incidents at or over Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and (b) occasions that the 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew has been breached since 3 May 1996. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Air safety incidents at or over Sydney (Kingsford Smith) airport since the east-west runway was re-opened [update from information provided to 3 May 1996]. Since 3 May 1996, BASI has received 718 safety incident reports involving air traffic at or over Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. - 538 of these were assessed as Category 5 occurrences. Category 5 occurrences are those which are primarily of statistical interest and are ed on the BASI database for future trend analysis. The information as reported to the Incident Bureau is available to the public on request. - 178 were assessed as Category 4 occurrences. Category 4 occurrences are those where the facts either; do not indicate a serious safety deficiency but the circumstances are sufficiently complex to require detailed information from the pilot, operator and/or other interested parties; or, some investigation is needed to expand and/or substantiate the initial information. Reports are available to the public on request. - 2 were assessed as Category 3 occurrences. Category 3 occurrences are those where the initial indications suggest potentially serious safety deficiencies. Consequently, an in-depth investigation is required to satisfy the concern for public safety. The report will include a Safety Action Statement detailing the relevant safety actions. Reports are available to the public on request. The first Category 3 incident occurred on 15 October 1997. A Boeing 747 aircraft (B747) arrived at Sydney 35 minutes prior to the end of the curfew. The aircraft was being operated in accordance with a concession which permitted arrival prior to the end Incidents of the curfew, subject to certain conditions. One of these conditions was that the aircraft should use only runway 34L for arrival. Enroute to Sydney and after passing the point at which the aircraft could divert to an alternate aerodrome with sufficient fuel remaining, a change in the wind direction, different to that which was forecast, passed through the Sydney area. This wind change made conditions on runway 34L operationally unacceptable to the crew of the aircraft. The crew elected to continue to Sydney and notitled air traffic services that they had a requirement to land prior to the end of the curfew as the aircraft had insufficient fuel to divert to an alternate aerodrome. The aircraft subsequently landed on runway 16R. The second Category 3 incident occurred on 22 July 1998 A Fairchild Industries Inc SA227-AC (Metro) aircraft landed on runway 34R, with an instruction to exit on taxiway Tango 1 and taxi via taxiway Juliet (for identification purposes, taxiways are named in accordance with the international phonetic alphabet). When approaching a mandatory holding point on taxiway Juliet, the pilot contacted the surface movement controller (SMC) and was instructed to taxi via taxiway Bravo and hold short recordof runway 25. This instruction was read back correctly by the pilot. Tower controllers subsequently observed the Metro taxiing along taxiway Juliet, past the entry to taxiway Bravo, towards runway 34L. At that time a Boeing 737 (B737) was touching down on runway 34L. The SMC instructed the pilot of the Metro to stop. As there was no reply the instruction was immediately repeated, and was subsequently acknowledged by the pilot. The Metro came to a stop at the edge of runway 34L. The pilot of the B737 was also instructed to stop immediately, but the aircraft was too close to the intersection of the runway with taxiway Juliet to comply. The pilot steered the B737 to the left of the runway centreline to increase its separation from the subsequently passing about 25 metres in front of that aircraft, at about 80 kts. At the time of the occurrence the weather was fine, there were no works taking place in the vicinity of the runway/taxiway intersection, and all relevant taxiway lights, runway holding point lights and movement area guidance signs were reported to have been functioning normally. The investigation is continuing. A copy of the final report can be sent to Mr MCClelland if required. (b) Occasions that the 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew have been breached since 3 May 1996. On 8 February 1997 a Russian Presidential Ilyushin aircraft departed Sydney Airport at 23:34 without approval. In addition, since 3 May 1996 there have been three occasions when aircraft landed at Sydney Airport up to two minutes before the end of the 11pm to 6am curfew and one occasion when an aircraft landed two minutes aftcr the start of the 11 pm to 6am curfew. Summary details of these incidents have been included in reports provided to the Sydney Airport Community Forum. Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (Question No. 156) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: Further to the answer to question No. 2618 (Hansard, 28 May 1998, page 4224), what was (a) his Department's and (b) Airservices Australia's response to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation report published in January 1997 entitled 'An analysis of incidents involving air crew failing to comply with air traffic clearances: JuneAugust 1996.' Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There were two recommendations arising from this report. Neither of the recommendations was directed specifically at the then Department of Transport and Regional Development: The following recommendation, reference R97001O, was issued to Airservices Australia on 31 January 1997 and stated: The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation recommends that Airservices Australia: 1. Review the current methods of flow control management with the aim of minimising the need for vectoring aircraft within the STAR environMetro, ment. (STAR-Standard Terminal Arrival Route). 2. Minimise the practice of instructing aircraft to resume a STAR once vectored off the STAR. 3. Ensure that SIDs and STARs, at all locations, are developed in accordance with consistent design principles. (SID-Standard Instrument Departure). 4. Maximise the use of ICAO standard radio phraseology in accordance with accepted worldwide practice. 5. Ensure that STAR design is compatible with aircraft FMS programs, especially for STARs which are not runway specific. (FMS-Flight Management System). The response to R970010 was received from Airservices Australia on 13 June 1997: 'I am writing to provide Airservices' response to Recommendation R970010 from the above report [An analysis of incidents involving air crew failing to comply with air traffic clearances: JuneAugust 1996]. Prior to the release of the report, Airservices' had been conducting independent reviews of many of the issues raised in your report. These reviews have included functional workshops in which BASI representatives have participated. The most recent workshop was convened for the purpose of discussing STARS, particularly in the Sydney environReport ment. As a result of these reviews, the following has occurred: 1. Airservices is currently progressing the development of an East Coast traffic management plan. The concept involves strategic and tactical planning to meter aircraft into Terminal areas and hence to place less reliance on vectoring in that airspace. 2. Prior to commencing any proposed vectoring, Air Traffic Control are required to advise the pilot of any expectation to resume the transition phase of a STAR. A requirement to rcsume a STAR can only be exercised during the transition phase. 3. Airservices STARS are designed in accordance with the Air Traffic Services STARS policy document which in turn states that they must be designed in accordance with ICAO specifications. The Operational Policy Branch of Air Traffic Services has undertaken a program to standardise STAR design locally and in the Asia-Pacific forum. 4. Phraseologies were the subject of a specific workshop in 1996 involving representation from the industry, CASA and the Australia Defence Force. This workshop recommended the adoption of ICAO standard phraseologies to the maximum extent possible. Where ICAO was silent on the issue the situation was to be resolved with international best practice, Australian specific phrases or plain language. Recommended phrascologies resulting from this forum have been incorporated into the AlP/MATS amendments effective 14 August 1997. 5. The Air Traffic Services STAR design document requires STARs to be developed in consultation with all users which includes ATS service providers and those flying the procedures. The intent of this consultation is to: ensure that operators are familiar with the development program; provide an opportunity for users to add value to STARs; determine pilot/operator acceptance; and ensure FMS compatibility where applicable. As part of the development process, STARS are ""flown"" in an approved airline simulator to confirm that the proposed STAR is both flyable, and acceptable for the aircraft type(s) used on that sector. This simulation normally includes FMS equipped operations. Airservices will continue to review the issues raised in your report to ensure the continued safety health of the Australian air traffic service system.' The following recommendation, reference R970011, was issued to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority on 31 January 1997 and stated: The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority require all international RPT AOC holders to include comprehensive route briefings in their General Operations Manual and require their aircrew to review comprehensive route briefing material prior to each flight to Australia. The response to R970011 was received from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority on 24 April 1997: ""I refer to BASI Investigation Report ""An Analysis of Incidents Involving Aircrew Failing to Comply with Air Traffic Clearances-June to August 1996: which incorporates Recommendation R970011. The recommendation is that CASA require all international RPT AOC holders to include comprehensive route briefings in their General Operations Manual and require their aircrew to review comprehensive route briefing material prior to each flight to Australia. Our response is as follows: Holders of international AOCs are required to comply with the provisions of the Civil Aviation Act, Regulations and Orders. Taken together, CAR 218 (Route qualifications of pilot in command of a regular public transport aircraft), CAR 233 (Responsibility of pilot in command before flight) and CAR 239 (Planning of flight by pilot in command) clearly require flight crews to be familiar with Australian procedures. It is also a condition of the AOC that operations be conducted in accordance with the requirements and procedures published in AlP. CASA does not believe that the analysis presented in the report justifies the implementation of recommendation R970011 at this time. Such a requirement would be difficult to police and is open to wide interpretation as to the acceptability of individual route briefings. We will monitor pilot briefing material during foreign operator ramp checks, and keep the situation under review. However, if the recommendations of R970010 are implemented by Airservices Australia, CASA believes that the incidence of failure to comply will markedly reduce.' BASI considers those recommendations 970010 and 97001] as being CLOSED-ACCEPTED, which means that the Bureau accepts the response without qualification. Civil Aviation Authority: Responsibility (Question No. 159) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: Is the Civil Aviation Safety Authority responsible for reviewing the operation of the airline industry with respect to the safety of persons on the ground; if not, will he ensure that the responsibility is included in the authority's charter. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CAS A) is responsible for enforcing legislative provisions which have been created, inter alia, for protecting the safety of persons on the ground. These include section 20A of the Civil Aviation Act 1988, which prohibits careless or reckless aircraft operations that would endanger the life, person or property of another person. Other examples are Civil Aviation Regulation (CAR) 155 relating to acrobatic flight, CAR 156 relating to flying over public gatherings and CAR 157 relating to low flying. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Long Term Operating - lan (Question No. 160) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: (I) Are Mr David Lidbetter and Mr Kevin Hill community representatives on the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) Implementation Monitoring Committee for Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. (2) Is it a fact that Mr Lidbetter resides in an area affected by air traffic to the north of the parallel runways and Mr Hill in an area affected by air traffic to the south of the parallel runways. (3) Is it also a fact that no member of the committee resides to the east or west of the airport. (4) Have Messrs Lidbetter and Hill consistently and vigorously advocated implementation of the LTOP so that air traffic is removed from the parallel runways to the east-west runway. (5) Who would be responsible in the event of an aircraft accident occurring as a result of the implementation of the LTOP. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes (2) Yes (3) No (4) The role of the Implementation and Monitoring Committee, of which Messrs Hill and Lidbetter are members, is to oversight implementation of LTOP to provide a more equitable distribution of noise generated by Sydney Airport in accordance with Government policy. (5) As with all civil aircraft accidents, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) would investigate any accident at Sydney Airport to ascertain the causes. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Long Term Operating Plan (Question No. 161) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: (I) Did his predecessor state about 28 July 1998 in connection with the fatal seaplane accident on 26 July 1998 that if persons were found to be responsible for the accident or negligent they would be dismissed. (2) Who accepts responsibility for the development and implementation of the Long term operating Plan (LTOP) for Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. (3) Will he dismiss the person or persons referred to in part (2) if a fatality occurs in and around the airport as a result of the operation of the LTOP. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The former Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon Mark Vaile MP, indicated in relation to the seaplane accident that if there were people within the Civil Aviation Safety Authority who have been responsible or negligent in reissuing the air operators certificate they would be dismissed. (2) The former Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon John Sharp, directed Airservices Australia and the Federal Airports Corporation to implement the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport in a manner that would not compromise the safety of aviation operations. LTOP was developed through an extensive consultation process which involved affected communities, Government agencies, and the aviation industry. (3) I would expect that whatever action is considered to be appropriate would be taken. As with all civil aircraft accidents, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) would investigate any accident at Sydney Airport to ascertain the causes. Australian Industrial Relations Commission: Adelaide (Question No. 178) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: Is it a fact that Commissioner Frank Palmer has retired from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC); if so, (a) is it also a fact that no member of the AIRC has been based in Adelaide since his retirement and (b) what additional costs have been incurred in airfares and accommodation allowances for members of the AIRC and their staff in travelling to and staying in Adelaide to conduct AIRC hearings since his retirement. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:  June 1998. (b) There has been no member based in Adelaide since that time whose primary appointment is to the AIRC. There are, however, nine concurrently appointed members of the AIRC whose primary appointment is to the Industrial Relations Commission of South Australia (IRC of SA). It should be noted that in 1998 three concurrent appointees from the IRC of SA were assigned by the President of the AIRC under section 37 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to AIRC industry panels. Arrangements for other concurrent appointees from the IRC of SA to carry out unfair dismissal hearings in that State were also introduced in September 1998. This type of work is not assigned to industry panels. Month January February March April May June July August September October November The reasons that members of the AIRC travel to other States and Territories, including South Australia, are numerous. Matters arising in the federal award system often require hearings in more than one State because many awards cover employers and employees in a number of States and/or Territories. In addition, applications requiring hearings by Full Benches (which consist of three or more members) generally necessitate travel by at least some members of the Bench concerned. Of particular significance since February 1998 has been the work of the Award Simplification Panel. This has required a small group of members who deal solely with the simplification of awards to travel to the various States and Territories in which such awards apply, including South Australia. Medicare: Rockdale Centre (Question No. 186) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: Further to his answer to question No. 2236 (Hansard, 12 Mary 1998, page 3018) concerning the establishment of Medicare customer service centres, were the factors identified in the answer which are taken into account when evaluating whether to open a Medicare customer service centre (b) The only relevant financial information available from the Australian Industrial Registry (which provides administrative support to the AIRC) regarding costs incurred in airfares and travelling allowance is actual expenditure. As explained below, the reasons for travel are diverse. Total monthly airfares and travelling allowance payments for members of the AIRC and their staff travelling to Adelaide during 1998 are set out in the following table. Expenditure $984.00 $8,548.00 $19,058.00 $29,279.00 $28,497.00 $21,987.00 $23,060.00 $26,214.00 $10,608.00 $25,252.00 $10,792.00 applied in respect of the decision to close the Rockdale, NSW, Medicare Customer Service Centre; if so, what material facts did the Health Insurance Commissioner consider as relevant in apply each of the factors which they took into account; if not, (a) what factors were taken into account and (b) what were the relevant facts considered to be relevant to each factor.",196
44,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. (a) The criteria which were taken into consideration when identifying Medicare Offices for closure were; - Claiming patterns including cash service workloads (less than 400 per day); - Proximity to other branch offices (within 12 kms); - Capacity to redeploy staff; and - Leasing and other property issues. (b) - Total patient services at the Rockdale Medicare Office for 1996/97 were 78,698 (less than 400 per day; direct bill for the June 1997 quarter was over 84 per cent; - The nearest Medicare office to Rockdale is 4.5 kms at Hurstville; - The Rockdale lease expired on 14 April 1997 and the Medicare Office closed on 10 October 1997. Medicare Offices: QuaJity of Service (Question No. 189) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2832 (Hansard, 25 May 1998, page 3664), did his Department or the Health Insurance Commission undertake an inquiry, review or otherwise consider the quality of service provided by Medicare customer service centres in New South Wales; if so, (a) what inquiries, reviews or consideration and (b) was the Hurstville Medicare Office included; if so, (i) when was it undertaken and (ii) what was the result. (2) If no study, inquiry, review or consideration has been made of Medicare customer service centres, will he ensure that one occurs and that the Hurstville Medicare Office is included and the consequent demands made upon it resulting from the closure of the Rockdale and Sylvania Medicare Offices.",203
45,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Each year the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) undertakes customer service research to guide the organisation towards its ongoing goal of greater customer focus. The research looks at the service the HIC provides in the administration of its main programs. The research includes questions on the overall quality of service provided by Medicare Offices, but does not include questions about the quality of service in specific Medicare Offices. (b) The research was conducted door-to-door on a random basis in both metropolitan and rural areas nationally. Participants are not asked which Medicare Office they usually attend. (i) Customer Satisfaction Research is usually undertaken annually and was last completed in June and July 1998. (ii) The satisfaction of customers with the programs managed by the HIC has continued to be very high and in line with budget expectations. The result of the 1998 Medicare customer satisfaction in the community is 88 per cent. (2) The closure of metropolitan Medicare Offices did increase customer traffic in neighbouring Medicare Offices that remained open. However, workload and administrative procedures have been adjusted to meet the resulting demand. Occasionally there are high levels of customer traffic that produce long queues. These queues do not necessarily translate into lengthy waiting times and in most cases the time does not exceed 10 minutes. Medibank Private has now opened its own network Survey of offices and agencies and from 1 July 1998 Medicare Offices no longer have to deal with lengthy private health insurance inquiries, sales and payments. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (Question No. 190) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: Further to the answer to question No. 2942 (Hansard, 30 June 1998, page 5536), did the National Health and Medical Research Council in its report on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD) refer to an inconsistency between funding provided to parents to acquire the medication Ritalin, which is commonly prescribed in the treatment of ADD, but not to purchase the medication Dexamphetamine; if so, will the Government address the inconsistency.",204
46,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The National Health and Medical Research Council's report on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder did refer to the fact that Dexamphetamine was available on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and methylphenidate (Ritalin) was not. The page reference is 50. Ritalin has been recommended for PBS subsidisation by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee on the basis of its similar clinical effectiveness and safety to Dexamphetamine. Therefore a similar price was recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority. However, the sponsor of Ritalin has requested a substantially higher price and has not been prepared to lower the price sought. As a result it has not been possible to list Ritalin on the PBS to this point. War Widows Benefits (Question No. 196) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 24 November 1998: (1) Is it a fact that war widows in the USA and UK lose their benefits upon remarriage but regain them following divorce from or the death of the subsequent spouse. (2) Will - e introduce similar measures for Australian war widows. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am advised that with respect to war widows in the UK the answer is yes. I am however advised that war widows in the USA who have remarried lose their Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) permanently unless their spouse died or they commenced legal proceedings for divorce prior to 1 November 1990. DIC is similar to the war widow's pension. (2) The Government is aware of long standing concerns within the ex-service community that war widows who remarried prior to 28 May 1984 relinquished their pensions and, in accordance with announced Government policy, is reviewing that and other veteran priorities as budgetary resources permit.

The statistics, by year of processing, relate to services rendered on a 'fee-for-service' basis for which Medicare benefits were paid. Excluded are details of services to public patients in hospital, to Veterans' Affairs patients and some compensation cases. Medicare Provider Numbers: Allocation (Question No. 199) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 24 November 1998 : (1) Has his attention been drawn to a call by the NSW Farmers' Association for Medicare provider numbers to be allocated to match population numbers in specific geographic areas; if so, (a) what is the feasibility of the proposal and (b) will he introduce it. (2) Is it fact that existing incentives to attract medical practitioners to rural areas have failed",205
48,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,GPNR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government has acknowledged this and other health policies proposed by the NSW Farmers' Association including the proposal to link provider numbers to specific geographical areas as a mechanism to address the maldistribution of the medical workforce. There is a shortage of doctors particularly General Practitioners in rural and remote areas of Australia. While approximately 30% of Australia's population live outside capital cities and metropolitan areas, only 23% of General Practitioners work in rural and remote areas. Maldistribution of the medical workforce is not unique to Australia, in that it is a worldwide problem. The Government has carefully considered geographical control of provider numbers and believes that there are more effective means of addressing workforce maldistribution. Rather than force doctors to work in rural areas, it is preferable to provide incentives such as rural locum relief for rural practitioners. scholarships, the funding of regional clinical schools and the encouragement of rural students into medical schools. Research has shown that these students are more likely to return to rural areas upon completion of training. Furthermore, there may be constitutional barriers preventing the Commonwealth from taking such action - the Better Practice Program; Australia already produces enough medical graduates to meet the country's overall requirements and introduction of section 19AA of the Health Insurance Act (1973). known as the ""provider number legislation"", ensures a high standard of health care delivery by requiring all doctors to obtain postgraduate qualifications. The introduction of ""area of need"" access to Medicare rebates for temporary resident doctors and overseas-trained doctors has provided rural communities and public hospitals with an increased supply of medical practitioners and is an effective and longer-term solution for rural communities. (2) Existing incentives to attract medical practitioners to rural and remote areas have not failed. The General Practice Rural Incentives Program (GPRIP) which began in 1993 sought to improve the recruitment and retention of GPs in rural and remote communities. This program is now known as the Rural and Remote General Practice Program (RRGPP) and was devolved to Commonwealth funded Rural Workforce Agencies in July 1998. The GPRIP and now RRGPP programs have provided support to the rural and remote medical workforce and the communities they service in the following ways: - During the period 1992/93 to 1996/97 the overall number of GPs and 'other medical practitioners' practising in small rural centres in Australia grew by 7%, from 867 to 925; - The Continuous Medical Education/Locum Grants component demonstrated that the grants were well regarded as an effective mechanism to support rural and remote GPs and succeeded, in some states, in establishing locum support networks where previously none existed; and - Relocation grants as a mechanism to support rural doctors are available, with an increase from 50 to 113 grants approved during the period 1994/95-1996/97. Around 30% of those who received the funds say they would not have moved without it. Around 60-70% say that it helped and will make a difference to the length of time they stay. Retention is an important objective of this program and these support mechanisms for practising rural GPs. This objective has been met with available data demonstrating a reduction in drop out rates and an increase in medical practitioners entering rural and remote practice. Other rural incentives and support mechanisms are provided within the General Practice Strategy and include: - RACGP training program; - Rural Division Coordinating Units; and - the Rural Divisions of General Practice. In addition to this, the Government has sought to increase the training and supply, of Australian medical students via: - an increase in the level of rural health training for students of medicine within Australia. Coordination and support of this strategy is also recognised by many state and territory health departments. The University of Newcastle has demonstrated a commitment to this strategy through the introduction of a compulsory rural placement within their course structure; - the development of a clinical school at Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, for medical students undertaking training through the University of New South Wales. Through exposure to rural health care settings with appropriate levels of support, it is felt that this initiative will equip Australian medical graduates with both the skills and interest in working in rural areas; - the Commonwealth has agreed to provide funding to establish a medical school at the James Cook University, Townsville. The geographical location of this university offers an opportunity for medical students from rural or indigenous backgrounds or students wishing to gain experience in rural health, to undertake a clinical placement in a rural setting. The school will offer students appropriate levels of support during their placement, using clinical advisers and medical practitioners who possess skills and experience in rural health care; - the Government is supporting university initiatives to increase numbers of students from rural communities and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds in Medicine. This focus is particularly evident in the admission profile at the University of Newcastle, Monash University, The University of Queensland and The University of Tasmania. The Government recognises that medical students from rural or remote communities are more likely to return to these communities to practice medicine upon completion of their training when compared to students from urban backgrounds; - John Flynn Scholarships to provide medical students with rural experience during their undergraduate training; and - as part of its measures to enhance the training and experience of young doctors in their early postgraduate years, the Medical Training Review Panel (MTRP) has recommended that all doctors in their first two years post-graduation have at least one term of experience in a community setting. My department is working with the States and Territories to implement this recommendation. As many as possible of these rotations will be in rural areas. Digital Mobile Telephone Towers: Kandos and Rylstone (Question No. 205) Mr Andren asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 25 November 1998: Is the Minister able to say when Telstra will erect a digital mobile telephone base station to serve Kandos and Rylstone, NSW. Mr MCGauran-The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Telstra advises that it has no plans to provide a digital mobile telephone base station to serve Kandos and Rylstone, NSW, in this financial year. However, Telstra has indicated that it will keep the matter under review when considering future plans for mobile coverage in the area. Goods and Services Tax: Interest Rates (Question No. 225) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 30 November 1998: Will the Government provide advice it has received concerning the effect of the GST on interest rates. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In considering the effect of the GST on interest rates, the key issue is the effect on inflation. This is covered in Chapter 5 of Tax Reform: A New Tax System. Parliamentarian Travel Expenses: Records (Question No. 228) Mr Horne asked the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 30 November 1998: (1) Does his Department keep accurate records of travel by Members, Senators and their staff on civilian commercial flights at Commonwealth expense. (2) How are bookings on civilian commercial flights made for Members, Senators and their staff travelling on official business. (3) If a centralised booking system is used, are preferences shown towards particular carriers (4) Does the Department negotiate with various carriers for the least expensive service when approving travel on official business for Members, Senators and their staff. (5) How many journeys did Members, Senators and their staff travelling on official business make from (a) Canberra to Newcastle and (b) Newcastle to Canberra (i) in total, (ii) by direct route and (iii) through Sydney, (A) in 1995-96, (B) in 1996-97. (C) in 1997-98 and (D) from 1 July to 31 October 1998. (6) What was the (a) arrival time in and (b) departure time from Sydney for each flight by Members, Senators and their staff travelling on official business from (i) Canberra to Newcastle and (ii) Newcastle to Canberra, (A) in 1995-96, (B) in 1996-97. (C) in 1997-98 and (D) from 1 July to 31 October 1998. Mr Fahey-The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. However, travel records prior to the commencement of the Jetset contract in September 1997 reflect ticketed travel intentions and not necessarily actual travel undertaken. (2) All travel by Senators, Members, their families and their staff travelling on official business is arranged through the Jetset Parliamentary Travel Service located in Parliament House. (3) No. Bookings are made with the airline requested by the traveller. (4) The Jetset contract specifies that the best fare of the day is provided for each booking. (5) and (6) The information requested in respect of parts (5) and (6) is not readily available. The time and resources required to extract this information and provide it to the honourable Member would be considerable and such expenditure would not be in the best interests of the use of departmental resources. Private Health Insurance: Members (Question No. 242) Ms Ellis asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 1 December 1998: How many private health insurance members resided in the post code areas of (a) 2600, (b) 2603, (c) 2605, (d) 2606, (e) 2607, (t) 2900, (g) 2901, (h) 2902, (i) 2903, G) 2904, (k) 2905 and (1) 2906 on 25 November 1998.",207
49,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,GPNR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The data required to answer this question is not readily available and to provide a complete answer would require considerllble time and resources. I am not prepared to ask my Department to divert resources at this time. National Competition Council: Report (Question No. 246) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 2 December 1998: (1) Has the National Competition Council recommended in a draft report of its review of subsections 51(2) and 51(3) of the Trade Practices Act that the exemption relating to standards contained in paragraph 51(2)(c) of the Act be removed. (2) Did the Commonwealth and the Standards Association of Australia enter into a new memorandum of understanding in February 1998 covering the preparation of standards in Australia. (3) Will the Government implement the recommendation referred to in part (1). Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On 11 November 1998, the National Competition Council released its draft report of its review of subsections 51(2) and 51(3) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA). One of the draft recommendations in the report is to abolish section 51 (2)(c) covering standards. (2) Following the report in 1995 of the Kean Committee (Committee of Inquiry into Australia's Standards and Conformance Infrastructure 1995), the Commonwealth Government and Standards Association of Australia entered into a new memorandum of understanding in February 1998. This understanding covers: preparation of Australian Standards by the Standards Association of Australia (SAA) and by bodies accredited by the Standards Accreditation Board of the SAA; participation by the SAA in international and regional standardisation; and preparation of standards by Commonwealth agencies and authorities that mayor may not involve the participation of the SAA or the reference of Australian Standards. (3) The Council's review examines the costs and benefits of this exemption provision, among others, and the Council will make final recommendations on whether they should be maintained, modified or abolished. The Council will consider further submissions before forwarding its final recommendations to the Treasurer by 5 March 1999. Upon receipt of the Council's final report, the Government will consider the recommendations made and announce what action is to be taken as soon as possible. Sydney Olympic Games: Special Air Service Role (Question No. 250) Mr Edwards asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 2 December 1998: (1) Will the SAS playa crucial security role during the Sydney Olympics. (2) Will the SAS undergo intense counterterrorism training in preparation for the Sydney Olympics. (3) What stress debrief and support programs will the Government make available to members of the SAS after the Sydney Olympics. Mr Moore--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) SAS will continue training in their ongoing role, however, they will also undertake special training for their security role for the Sydney Olympics. (3) SAS members will receive, on a needs basis, the same Critical Incident counselling which other members of the Australian Defence Force receive. (Question No. 256) Mr Edwards asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 2 December 1998: What was the cost of (a) production and (b) distribution of his Department's publication entitled Vetaffairs and how many persons were employed in its production in each year from 1993. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follQws: Background Since 1998, considerable changes have been made to Vetaffairs. Previously it was published 11 times a year but distributed to only approximately 40,000 veterans per issue, largely through intermediary organisations such as ex-service organisations and nursing homes, with just a few thousand delivered to individuals who had asked to go on the mailing list. In 1998, it was decided the number of issues of Vetaffairs would be reduced to four per year. This allowed the distribution for each issue to be increased to over 400,000 veterans and war widows and widowers in receipt of a. payment and/or a health benefit through my Department. The much larger printing runs of Vetaffairs mean some economies of scale have been achieved regarding printing costs, but because the distribution method now has become more sophisticated with direct mailings to over 400,000 households, overall costs are not easily compared to previous arrangements. In the recent Veteran Satisfaction Survey, 93% of respondents indicated that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the most recent issue of Vetaffairs. The majority of respondents said they read all or most of the paper (over 86%) and rated the various aspects of the paper as good or very good. (a) and (b) Complete itemised cost data dating back to 1993 is unavailable due to the joint recording and consolidation of Vetaffairs costs at various times with a range of other departmental printing and pUblication costs. However, analysis of 1996/97 information provides a reliable ""per issue"" cost expenditure estimate which would also provide a good indication of ""per issue"" production and distribution costs in earlier years. This analysis indicates that each monthly issue of Vetaffairs cost just under $24,000, amounting to $260,000 for 11 issues in a calendar year. Vetaffairs After the change to the new arrangements in 1998, three issues of Vetaffairs were published in March, June and November. Production costs for the first two expanded issues totalled about $144,000 and distribution costs were about $440,000 (plus a small amount of postage incurred by my Department's State Offices sending copies on request to individuals/organisations). This equates to a total of about $292,000 per issue, or around 73 cents per veteran household including postage. Invoices on hand for the third issue in November 1998 indicate that production and distribution costs will again be of this magnitude for this and future issues. A full-time editor at the Public Affairs Officer Grade 3 level works on the publication and there is some input (about three days per issue) from my Department's graphic designer together with some general administrative support. Similar arrangements have applied in earlier years. Printing and distribution are carried out under contract by a printing firm and a mail house. Department of Veteran's Affairs: Western Australian Staff (Question No. 257) Mr Edwards asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 2 December 1998: How many officers were employed by his Department in Western Australia in each financial year since 1992-93. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Th- following number of officers (in terms of full-time and part-time operative officers) were employed in Western Australia: 1992-93-1,321 *; 1993-94-292; 1994-95-268; 1995-96-278; 1996-97-205; 1997-98-185. (These figures include all Veterans' Affairsrelated functions in Western Australia, including the Western Australian State Office, the Repatriation General Hospital Hollywood, Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service, Veterans' Review Board and Office of Australian War Graves.) * NB: RGH Hollywood was sold to the private sector on 24 February 1994. Consequently, staff employed at the hospital ceased to be employees of my Department from that date.

Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination (Question No. 289) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 3 December 1998: (I) What progress has been made in (a) withdrawing or (b) modifying the declaration that Australia made on 30 September 1975 in ratifying the 1966 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. (2) What other countries have made a similar Trust Committee declaration. (3) On what dates and in what terms did they in accordance make their declarations Mr Downer-The answer to the honourand able member's question is as follows: (1) On ratification of the International ConvenAct tion on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination on 30 September 1975, Australia made the following declaration: ""The Government of Australia ....... declares that Australia is not at present in a position specifically to treat as offences all the matters covered by article 4(a) of the Convention. Acts of the kind there mentioned are punishable only to the extent provided by the existing criminal law dealing with such matters as the maintenance of public order, mischief, assault, riot, criminal libel, conspiracy and attempts. It is the intention of the Australian Government, at the first suitable moment, to seek from Parliament legislation specificalof ly implementing the terms of article 4 (a)."" The declaration was last considered in 1995. Withdrawal of the declaration is not possible at this stage. Article 4 (a) of the Convention contemplates enactment of criminal offences for racial hatred and incitement to racial discrimination. As the of Racial Hatred Act 1995 contains only a civil prohibition on such conduct it does not fulfil Australia's obligations under Article 4 (a) and is not sufficient to allow Australia to withdraw its declaration. At this point only the ACT Discrimination Act 1991 makes serious racial and Herivilification a criminal offence. (2) I refer you to the UN Publication ""Multilateral Treaties Deposited with the Secretary-General: status as at 31 December 1997"". An updated of this publication is available on the internet: http://www.un.org/depts/treaty (3) See (2) above Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Question No. 290) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 3 December 1998: (1) What progress has been made in (a) withdrawing or (b) modifying the reservations and declarations that Australia made on 13 August 1980 in ratifying the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. (2) What other countries have made similar reservations or declarations. (3) On what dates and in what terms did they make their reservations or declarations Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) When Australia lodged its instrument of ratification on 13 August, 1980, a number of declarations and reservations were lodged. On 6 November 1984 Australia withdrew the reservations and declarations made upon ratification with regard to Articles 2 and 50, 10, 14, 17, 19, 20 and 5 Australia has maintained the following reservations: Article 10 ""In relation to paragraph 2 (a) the principle of segregation is accepted as an objective to be achieved progressively. In relation to paragraph 2(b) and 3 (second sentence) the obligation to segregate is accepted only to the extent that such segregation is considered by the responsible authorities to be beneficial to the juveniles or adults concerned."" Article 14 ""Australia makes the reservation that the provision of compensation for miscarriage of justice in the circumstances contemplated in paragraph 6 of article 14 may be by administrative procedures rather than pursuant to specific legal provision."" Article 20 ""Australia interprets the rights provided for by article 19, 21 and 22 as consistent with article 20; accordingly, the Commonwealth and the constituent States, having legislated with respect to the subject matter of the article in matters of practical concern in the interest of public order (ordre public), the right is reserved not to duce any further legislative provision on these matters."" Declaration ""Australia has a federal constitutional system in which legislative, executive and judicial powers are shared or distributed between the Commonwealth and the constituent States. The implementation of the treaty throughout Australia will be effected by the Commonwealth, State and Territory authorities having regard to their respective constitutional powers and arrangements concerning their exercise."" The question of withdrawing or modifying the reservations made when Australia ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is considered every year when Australia's National Action Plan on human rights is updated. Paragraph (c) of the National Action Plan requires Australia to indicate human rights treaty reservations we intend to remove. In relation to the reservation to Articles 10 (2) and (3) of the Covenant, due to Australia's demographic and geographical features it is difficult to achieve the total segregration of accused and convicted prisoners, and children or juvenile prisoners from adult prisoners. Furthermore the Australian Government remains convinced that it is appropriate to allow the responsible authorities discretion to determine whether it is beneficial for a child or juvenile to be imprisoned with adults. However the Government is committed to achieving the goal of separation of accused and convicted prisoners and has taken some steps in this direction. For example, under the Standard Guidelines for Corrections in Australia, accused persons awaiting trial are separated from convicted persons as far as practicable and remandees are accorded different treatment from convicted persons. There are no present intentions to withdraw or modify Australia's reservations. In relation to the reservation to Article 14 of the Covenant, there are administrative procedures available in all Australian jurisdictions to provide compensation for miscarriages of justice in the circumstances envisaged in paragraph 6 of this Article. The reason for maintaining Australia's reservation to Article 14 was the requirement in paragraph 6 of that article for statutory compensation in cases of miscarriage of justice, whereas in Australia the procedures for granting compensation do not necessarily have a statutory basis. Accordingly, the reservation to Article 14 is still considered appropriate. The reservation to Article 20 retlects Australia's strong tradition of freedom of expression. Where there is a clear necessity to restrict that right in the public interest or for foreign policy reasons, the Federal Government will take the necessary introlegislative action. The Government has acted to prohibit or suppress propaganda in the past and has passed the Racial Hatred Act 1995. The Racial Hatred Act 1995 strikes a balance between the right to freedom of expression and rights of all persons to live free from fear of violence and racial hatred. Accordingly, there are no present intentions to withdraw Australia's reservation to Article 20. (2) I refer you to the UN Publication ""Multilateral Treaties Deposited with the Secretary-General: status as at 31 December 1997"". An updated version of this publication is available on the internet: http://www.un.org/depts/treaty (3) See (2) above. Convention on the Rights of the Child (Question No. 291) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 3 December 1998: (1) What progress has been made in (a) withdrawing or (b) modifying the reservation that Australia made on 17 December 1990 in ratifying the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child. (2) What other countries have made similar declarations. (3) On what dates and in what terms did they make their declarations. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Upon ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 17 December 1990, Australia made the following reservation: ""Australia accepts the general principles of article 37. In relation to the second sentence of paragraph (c), the obligation to separate children from adults in prison is accepted only to the extent that such imprisonment is considered by the responsible authorities to be feasible and consistent with the obligation that children be able to maintain contact with their families, having regard to the geography and demography of Australia. Australia therefore ratifies the Convention to the extent that it is unable to comply with the obligation imposed by article 37 (c)."" The question of withdrawing or modifying the reservation made when Australia ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child is considered every year when Australia's National Action Plan on human rights is updated. In relation to the reservation to Article 37 (1) of the Convention, Australia's demographic and geographical features often make it difficult to achieve the total segregration of children or juvenile prisoners from adult prisoners. However, the Government is considering the recommendation made by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, in its 1998 Report on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, that the Government withdraw the reservation to Article 37 (3) of the Convention. A Government response is currently being formulated. (2) I refer you to the UN Publication ""Multilateral Treaties Deposited with the Secretary-General: status as at 31 December 1997"". An updated version of this publication is available on the internet: http://www.un.orgldepts/treaty (3) See (2) above. Convention for the Protection of Civilian Persons in Times of War (Question No. 292) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 3 December 1998: (1) What progress has been made in (a) withdrawing or (b) modifying the declarations that Australia made (i) on 14 October 1958 in ratifying the 1949 Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Times of War and (ii) on 21 December 1991 in ratifying the 1977 Protocol I Additional to the 1949 Conventions and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflict. (2) What other countries have made similar declarations. (3) On what dates and in what terms did they make their declarations. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The declaration made when Australia ratified the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Times of War has not since been considered. No progress has been made on withdrawing or modifying this declaration, and there is no present intention to withdraw or modify it. The declarations made when Australia ratified Protocol 1 Additional to the Geneva Conventions were last considered prior to ratification on 21 June 1991. No progress has been made in withdrawing or modifying these declarations. The declarations were considered appropriate at the time of ratification, and are still considered appropriate, as the circumstances ruling at that time have not materially altered. Accordingly there is no present intention to withdraw or modify them. (2) The parameters of this question are too broad to be answered in this forum. I refer you to the ICRC web site which has the full text of all State Party reservations and declarations in its international humanitarian law database: www.ICRC.org/UNICC/ICRCnews.NSFlDoclnde xISite_Tree?OpenDocument (3) See 2 above. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Environmental Strategy (Question No. 295) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 3 December 1998: (1) Do parts 5 and 6 of the Airports Act 1996 require (a) aircraft noise, (b) air quality of emissions from aircraft in flight and (c) associated health issues to be included in the factors considered when developing an environmental strategy for an airport. (2) Did he advise the Sydney Airport Corporation (SAC) through their recently appointed consultants, Sinclair Knight Mutch Pty Ltd, to exclude (a) aircraft noise, (b) air quality of emissions from aircraft in flight and (c) associated health issues when preparing an environmental strategy for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport; if so (i) will he provide details of correspondence between the SAC, the consultants and other persons relating to the advice and (ii) does he have the power to have the factors excluded from consideration; if so, under what authority. (3) If he did not provide the advice referred to in part (2), which of the factors referred to in part (1) will be included in the environmental strategy for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. (4) If a factor referred to in part (I) is not at present included in the environmental strategy, will he ensure that it is included. (5) Will the environmental strategy be more effective if it includes the factors referred to in part (1 ). (6) Is he able to say what obligations parts 5 and 6 of the Airports Act 1996 impose on the preparation of the environmental strategy. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Part 5 of the Airports Act 1996 regulates land use, planning and building control at leased Federal airports. It requires the preparation of an airport master plan, major development plans for significant airport developments and regulates building activities at airport sites. Part 6 of the Airports Act 1996 requires each airport lessee company to prepare a final environment strategy for an airport. A final environment strategy is a draft environment strategy that has been approved by the Minister. The matters which must be set out in a final environment strategy are set out in Division 2 of Part 6 of the Airports Act 1996. None of these relate specifically to aircraft noise, air quality of emissions from aircraft in flight and associated health issues (see (6) below). (2) My Department has provided advice to Sydney Airport Corporation Ltd (SACL) indicating that issues such as the noise and emissions generated by aircraft in flight fall outside the scope of the Draft Environment Strategy (DES). These matters are canvassed separately in The Long Term Operating Plan for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and Associated Airspace and the Proponent's Statement for the Sydney Airport Long Term Operating Plan, and currently fall within the responsibilities of other agencies including the Department of Transport and Regional Services and Airservices Australia. A copy of the correspondence can be made available to the member. (3) See (2). (4) No. See (2). (5) No. See (2). (6) Division 2 of Part 6 of the Airports Act 1996 specifies the matters that must be set out in a draft or final environment strategy. Part 3 of the Airports (Environment Protection) Regulations sets out additional matters which must be spccified in the strategy. The airport lessee company is obliged to specify its objectives for the environmental management of the airport. rn particular, it must address impacts of on-site airport operations and include specific measures, and time frames for completion of those measures, which it proposes to adopt to prevent, control or reduce environmental impacts. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Long Tern Operating Plan (Question No. 297) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 3 December 1998: (1) Is it a fact that modes 6A and 8 outlined in the Long Term Operating Plan for Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport have not been implemented; if not, why not. (2) Will the combination of increased aircraft noise and north easterly winds during summer greatly exacerbate noise to the north of the airport, especially over the electoral division of Lowe, if the modes are not implemented before 1999. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Mode 6A was not outlined in the Long Term Operating Plan. Neither mode 6A nor mode 8 have been implemented because relevant safety and operational clearances are not yet available. (2) Seasonal variations in prevailing winds suggest an increased likelihood of northerly winds dUling summer in the Sydney area. These conditions result in the use of runway modes that involve departing jet aircraft passing over the electoral division of Lowe. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Instrument Landing Systems (Question No. 298) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 3 December 1998: Is it a fact that implementation of the instrument landing system for the east-west runway of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport would greatly improve the operation and use of the runway thus ensuring compliance with the Long Term Operating Plan; if so, has he expedited implementation of the system; if not why not. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Airservices Australia has recently provided me with a report on a study conducted by an independent consultant on the benefits and costs of installing an instrument landing system on runway 25 at Sydney Airport. The consultant's report concludes that the installation of the ILS together with a runway threshold relocation "" ... could provide a significant increase in relative terms of the Mode [Mode 5] ... "". Mode 5 is an important noise sharing mode. The report will be placed on the agenda for the next meeting of the Sydney Airport Community Forum to allow community representatives to discuss the merits of the proposal before a final decision is made. Sydney Airport Community Forum: Chairperson (Question No. 301) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 3 December 1998: Following his announcement of a new chairperson for the Sydney Airport Community Forum, will the Forum meet before Christmas 1998 to urgently address the concerns of those Sydney residents who are being unfairly exposed to aircraft noise. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am pleased that Dr Brendan Nelson MP has agreed to chair the Sydney Airport Community Forum (SACF). Dr Nelson hosted an informal meeting of the SACF on 16 December 1998. All members of the Forum were invited to attend. I am advised that Mr Murphy discussed issues of concern with Dr Nelson. The next formal meeting of the Forum is due to be held on 26 February 1999. Job Network: Contract Variations (Question No. 304) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 7 December 1998: Did the Government offer contract variations to members of Job Network in August 1998; if so, (a) how many members decided not to pursue the variations, (b) were they from the not-for-profit community sector or the private sector, (c) what reasons did they givc for not pursuing variations and (d) in which States, TelTitories and regions were they located. Mr Abbott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (a) Two. (b) The two organisations describe themselves as: (i) an incorporated association. (ii) an incorporated association/registered charity. (c) Reasons for the decisions were not provided. (d) The two organisations were located in: (i) Western Australia (Southern WA and balance of WA Regions). (ii) NSW (Inner Sydney, Western Sydney and North Sydney and Central Coast Regions). Prion Disease (Question No. 309) Ms Hall asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 8 December 1998: (1) Have adequate steps been taken to monitor the appearance of prion-based diseases in meat products fed to poultry in Australia. (2) Does regular testing for the spontaneous appearance of prion-based diseases in meat fed to poultry occur in Australia; if so, what are the details. (3) What assurances can be given that prionbased diseases will not occur in Australia. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) There is no evidence of clinical prion diseases of animals (including poultry) in Australia. This status is monitored through a national surveillance program that has been implemented to meet international requirements for countries claiming to be free of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy diseases in their cattle and sheep. Strict quarantine protocols are in place to protect Australia from prion diseases of animals. (2) As indicated, a national surveillance program is in place involving the examination of a set number of sheep and cattle brains, collected from animals with suspect clinical signs. As part of the program, general awareness activities as well as specialist training were instituted. Because Australia is free of clinical prion disease of animals, no specific testing is undertaken for such diseases in meat fed to poultry. (3) Existing strict quarantine provisions are designed to prevent the introduction of prion diseases to Australia through imported products. In the event of a spontaneous case occurring the national surveillance program and routine diagnostic sampling of Australia's animal populations should ensure the early detection and elimination, by implementation of an agreed national plan (AUSVETPLAN) of any individual animals that might be affected. Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme: Contributors (Question No. 312) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 8 December 1998: (1) How many contributors to the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme exited from the scheme (a) between 28 September and 26 October 1998 and (b) since 27 October 1998.

(3) What was the (a) actual investment performance of the scheme from 1 July to 30 September 1998 and (b) applicable exit rate for each month since 1 July 1998. (4) Before the Opposition raised the matter in Parliament, what measures did the scheme's Board of Trustees put in place to inform members that a negative exit rate had been adopted and to advise them of their options. (5) What measures has he put in place to ensure that recent problems do not recur. Exit rate + 8.3% per annum + 4.7% per annum + 7.3% per annum - 0.059% daily compound - 0.012% daily compound + 0.002% daily compound + 0.02% daily compound (4) Through the Board's communications advisory group, a number of different approaches were adopted to inform members of the new exit rate policy adopted from 1 July 1998 and the MSB Board's decision on 30 October 1998 to amend the calculation program for preserved benefits. The approaches taken were: details of the MSB Board's exit rate policy placed on the ComSuper website; Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) 411 contributors exited from the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme (MSBS) between 28 September 1998 and 26 October 1998. (b) 559 contributors exited from 27 October 1998 to 14 December 1998. (2) (a) 17 members who exited between 28 September 1998 and 26 October 1998 preserved their member benefit; and 38 members who exited between 27 October 1998 and 14 December 1998 preserved their member benefIt. 23 members who exited between 28 September 1998 and 26 October 1998 and 30 members who exited between 27 October 1998 and 14 December 1998 have not yet submitted a benefit application. If an application is not received within 3 months of discharge the benefits will automatically be preserved. (b) 371 members who exited between 28 September 1998 and 26 October 1998 withdrew their member benefit as a lump sum; and 491 members who exited between 27 October 1998 and 14 Deccmber 1998 withdrew their member benefit as a lump sum. (c) 2 members withdrew their member benefit and subsequently repaid it into the scheme. (3) (a) The investment performance of the scheme from 1 July 1998 to 30 September 1998 was-l.1%. (b) Applicable exit rates since 1 July 1998 were: Period of effect 21 May 98 to 20 Aug 98 21 Aug 98 to 30 Aug 98 31 Aug 98 to 27 Sept 98 28 Sept 98 to 26 Oct 98 27 Oct 98 to 29 Nov 98 30 Nov 98 to 20 Dec 98 21 Dec 98 to next declaration members advised of changes to the exit rate policy and the possibiiity of negative returns in the annual report to members, which was enclosed with each member's information package despatched in October. This package also included a booklet on the MSB Fund investment policy; on 15 October 1998 an article appeared in the Army News and in November 1998 a similar article appeared in the Air Force News. The article was also submitted for inclusion in the summer edition of Sea Talk; from 30 October 1998 members who contacted the ComSuper advisory unit were advised of the implications of a negative exit rate and option to preserve their benefit until a more favourable exit rate was declared; on 16 November 1998 letters were prepared to all members who had discharged on and after 28 September 1998 and before 30 October 1998 who had been affected by the negative exit rate to inform them that they had an option of preserving their benefit until a more favourable rate applied. Members who discharged from 30 October 1998 and were affected by the negative exit rate were contacted by ComSuper prior to payment being made to make sure they were fully informed of the implications of withdrawing their benefit; and in early November an article was submitted for inclusion in the next issue of Tpe Key, a publication of the Defence Personnel Executive. It appeared in the December issue. (5) I have asked the Department of Defence to look at ways of enhancing direct communication with members on superannuation issues. The Board and the Department have advised me that at the December meeting a communications strategy for 1999 was endorsed. The strategy is aimed at improving communications with members on superannuation matters of both immediate and longer term effects. It will be put in place in consultation with the Department of Defence and will include such new initiatives as: a regular chat column in the Service newspapers; having a team of suitably experienced people who can visit work locations to discuss issues with members on a face-to-face basis; and developing a new interactive website with the ability to interrogate and develop options to suit a member's retirement needs. I have also been advised that a notice has been distributed to all Defence locations that deal with discharging members stressing the importance of members obtaining advice on their superannuation entitlements immediately before discharge. Job Network: Evaluation Measures (Question No. 317) Mr Wilkie asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 9 December 1998: Has he introduced evaluation measures to ensure that funds allocated under tender documents and business plans for Job Network providers are being spent in line with the providers' commitments; if so, (a) what measures, (b) when will the measures commence and finish and (c) will the results be the made public; if so, when; if not, what accountability measures are in place to safeguard the spending of public funds. Mr Abbott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) As Job Network members are primarily contracted to place job seekers into jobs, the ultimate measure of their success is the extent to which they place job seekers into jobs. The performance of Job Network members in the current contract period will be a consideration in assessing tenders for the next contract period, should those members choose to tender. The Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business has in place a Job Network monitoring strategy which has a number of components. It includes the assessment of the performance of each Job Network member against their allocated level of business, as well as monitoring of client complaints and compliance with statutory legal requirements. Job Network members are required, through the Employment Services Contract 1998-99 to provide the Department with access to their premises, financial accounts and records, employees and job seekers' records. This is obviously necessary as part of the Department's evaluation and monitoring of providers. The Contract is the legal agreement between the Commonwealth and Job Network members which protects the interests of the Commonwealth. A complaint mechanism also exists under the Contract. Job seekers, employers, apprentices and trainees are able to raise any concerns with Job Network members. or with the Department if there is no resolution of the concern. The Contract requires Job Network members to maintain a register of complaints which must be accessible by the Department. In August 1998 the then Minister announced the provision of Market Development Funding for Job Network members providing Job Matching services. Provision of this funding was dependent on the Commonwealth's acceptance of an appropriate Market Development Business Plan from the Job Network member. Departmental contract managers monitor progress by Job Network members against these business plans and funding must be acquitted at the end of the contract period. (b) Job Network contract monitoring measures are in operation for the duration of the Contract. Market Development Funding was available from 1 October 1998, with the final payment to be made in March 1999. Recipients of Market Development Funding are to provide the Department with an acquittal of expenditure by 31 March 1999. (c) The results of Departmental monitoring activities for individual Job Network members are commercial in confidence and as such will not be made public. The Job Network monitoring strategy, as outlined above, addresses the Department's obligations under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, which provides a framework for the proper management of public money. The Department meets its obligations under the Act through the Employment Services Contract 1998-99.",209
