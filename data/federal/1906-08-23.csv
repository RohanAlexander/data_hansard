1,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Is the Prime Minister in a position to inform the House as to the date which will be set aside for the further consideration of the Fire Insurance Bill?,13
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I am not able to fix the date for the consideration of that or any other item of private business, but if , as has been the practice in the past, opportunities occur towards the close of the session, in the intervals of dealing with necessary Government measures, honourable members will be permitted to take advantage of them. NORTHERN TERRITORY.",13
3,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to the remarks made by the Honourable V. L . Solomon yesterday in the South Australian Parliament, especially to the statement that the honourable and learned gentleman's recent utterances have shown that the question of transferring the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth has been shelved?",13
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have read the reported statements, which are entirely inaccurate, so far as they imply that the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth has ceased to be a live question with this Government - As the honourable member knows, communications have been passing between this Government and the Government of South Australia, in addition to the correspondence on the subject of the transfer of the Northern Territory; but I recognise that, in view of the political crisis which may be imminent in South Australia, it would not be judicious to press matters unduly. I regret that the references to the matter appear not to have been made in the interest of either the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth, dr South Australia.",14
5,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I should like to ask a further question of the Prime Minister, and, by way of explanation, I shall quote from the speech of the Prime Minister delivered upon the motion of the honourable member for Grev with reference to the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth*. The Prime Minister is reported at page 1068 of Hansard, of 5th July last, as having statedI f they come down with a practical proposal, we will with pleasure and promptness submit the matter to this House. What we want to get from them-if I may be pardoned for saying so, with every respect for their previous letters on the subject-is ,1 reasonable offer. I look upon the proposal, deeding us to construct a railway, and dictating conditions with regard to it, as not being such an offer as we ought to be asked consider. He said furtherI trust that we shall soon be able to deal with a business question in a business-like manner. Are we to infer from the answer of the Prime Minister that negotiations are pending upon the basis of some new offer, some suggestion for a variation of the old offer made to the Prime Minister?",14
6,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The references which the honourable and learned member has quite correctly quoted, relate to the offer Kalgoorlie. last laid before this House. It was and is still, the desire of the Government to obtain an offer worthy of submission this House. This involves an alteration ments. in some respects of the offer previously submitted. That offer, as the honourable [116] and learned member is aware, was based on a resolution carried in the South Australian Assembly. Since then, I have received a communication in writing from the South Australian Government directing my attention to the resolution, and certain other matters, and I have received the assent of my colleagues to a reply in which an attempt is made to bring the question to a more definite issue. In themeantime, other communications have been passing, and as soon as the prospects are of a satisfactory character, a reply which I hope will bring matters to a definite issue will be communicated to the South Australian Government. PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS .",14
7,Mr REID,Unknown,"East Sydney) [3.34] - Wit h the indulgence of the House, and by wav of personal explanation, I should like to call attention to the extraordinary perversion of some remarks which I made here on Tuesday last, in reference to the contingent vote proposal. These misrepresentations are becoming beyond endurance. I have here a copy of the Hansard report of my remarks, and of the pretended report of the Melbourne Age. While I was speaking, the honourable member for Kennedy interjected, as reported in HansardIn Queensland the electors were advised not to adopt the preferential voting system. In the Age, his remark appears thus",14
8,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,In Queensland they apply it. ,14
9,Mr REID,Unknown,"I am referring to the fabrication of the Age. When an honourable member makes a statement, this newspaper twists his words in such a fashion as to convey a directly contrary meaning. If this were the only instance in which that had been done, I should be inclined, as we all are, to charitably suppose that a mistake had been made; but there are three deliberate alterations, one after the other, or which make that-supposition impossible.",14
10,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The honourable member is getting very sensitive in his old age.,14
11,Mr REID,Unknown,"No one is more sensitive than is the young honourable member for We can all be philosophical then, about wrongs done to other people.",14
12,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I have sat quiet under to very considerable criticism af my,, state",14
13,Mr REID,Unknown,"If the honourable member has done so, it must have caused him great internal suffering. I went on to say, as reported in HansardI t is made optional in Queensland, and the electors have exercised the option by not expressing their preference. The Age, however, reports me as sayingI understand the Labour Party of Queensland makes good use of it. That is the direct opposite of what I said. A little later the honourable member for Kennedy interjectedThe other side, also, says that it is not system. To which I. replied, as reported in HansardThen the system is doubly condemned, if both sides take the same view, and refrain from availing themselves of it. The Age, however, reports me as sayingThen they have exercised the option. That is the direct opposite of what I said. As in those three instances this newspaper has reported honourable members as saying exactly the opposite of what they did say, its conduct suggests something veryserious.  right honourable member "" set.""",14
14,Mr REID,Unknown,"It is the same old ""set""; no doubt, under the same old instructions. I wish now to refer to another matter in connection with which I have reason to make a complaint. It is suggested in the Age that the honourable member for 'Melbourne Ports was responsible for the misquotation of a passage in my Free-trade Essays, about which I complained yesterday, because in a letter appearing in its columns this morning, signed "" Your reporter."" it is stated that the writer saw the honourable member during the afternoon, and took down what he read to him, afterwards attending his meeting, and checking the notes by what was said from the platform. The inference is, therefore, that the mistake was made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, not by himself. Strongly as we differ in our political views, I do not suppose that there is a man in the world who would accuse the honourable member for Melbourne Ports of reading out from a prepared document a quotation which was absolutely wrong, having been twisted. I acquit the honourable member of any such proceeding. By the frequency of their repetition, the abominable wrongs perpetrated by this newspaper are becoming notorious, and I deeply regret them. It is a great pity that the statements madein this Chamber are deliberately twisted, and reported to the public in a form which makes honourable members appear to have said the reverse of what they have said. The press must be allowed the fullest liberty in deciding what shall be reported. It is entirely for its representatives to decide whether anything shall be reported; but when an honourable member's remarks are given, they should not be a good twisted-as , in the instance to which I have just referred, on three occasions-to make it appear that something has been said quite contrary to the remarks actually uttered. We remember the indignation of the Attorney-General, which dissolved the House in tears, when a slight reference was made to something of which he should be proud, although he took it as a reproach.",15
15,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,I did not take it as a reproach; but I objected to the statement being made as a reproach.,15
16,Mr REID,Unknown,"A good many sympathized with the honourable and learned member, and cried over the occurrence with him. What lie had to complain of was not, however, so bad s these instances in which a the words of honourable members have been deliberately twisted to make them appear to have said the very opposite of what they did say. I do not think that there could be a worse offence on the part of a reporter. As to the attempt to put me forward as the enemy of Australian manufacturers, which the Aee is constantly makinc, I should like, with the indulgence of the House, to make a short quotation from an essay which I wrote thirty-three vears ago to show that I was perhaps the first in Australia to denounce the unpatriotic prejudice against colonial goods. In that essay I saidThe encouragement by consumers of industries which prove their utility by the production of good and cheap articles is a duty in which both free-traders and protectionists can and ought to heartily unite. Our local manufacturers have difficulties enough to contend with, without struggling, as they too often must, against the silly and unpatriotic prejudice which depreciates their goods, simply because they have been made in the colony. . . If everybody were actuated as they ought to be by the desire to try a local article, it would be better for industries than a protective duty. . . . A little good feeling on the part of consumers towards local producers would accomplish all the benefit protection could give us in a far better form. Those passages were written thirty-three years ago. Since then I have been foremost in joining a movement to decry this unpatriotic prejudice, and have addressed public meetings in Victoria in opposition to it . The Age therefore goes too far when it puts me forward as the enemy of Australian manufacturers, because I have my own ideas as to what is the best fiscal policy for this country.",15
17,Mr RONALD,Unknown,"Then , is the right honourable member a protectionist?",16
18,Mr REID,Unknown,"Surely a man may encourage Australian production without being a protectionist; and I have always done so in my personal expenditure. So far from having said, as in yesterday's Age I am reported to have said, that I admit that manufactures can exist here only with the aid of sweated and pauper labour, in the essay to which I have referred, which was written about the time when protection was first introduced in Vic- ferred. toria, I pointed out that there were in those days 1,020 manufactories here which were not indebted for their existence to a protective policy. I further pointed out, as I do again now, that the expressions of which I made use were directed to the examination of a proposition constantly put forward in the early days, though since abandoned. That propositentionally, tion is that, if protective duties are imposed for a limited period, the industries which they protect will become strong enough to compete in the open markets of the world. In examining that proposition, I pointed out that our industries could compete in the open markets of the world only if we had cheaper raw material, which is impossible, better machinery, which could not be expected, or cheaper money, which is not likely. Then, ferring to the subject of wages, I said that so long as Australian wages were hicher than those of other countries, as I hoped they always would be, we could not regard with satisfaction the adoption of artificial methods for encouraging competition with the sweated industries of Europe. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports, when I referred to this matter on Tuesday, admitted that the industries which are protected here are those in which sweating occurs elsewhere.",16
19,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,All Australian industries should be protected which have to compete with low-paid labour elsewhere.,16
20,Mr REID,Unknown,"At the time when my essav was written, the views in regard to what is now called the ""new protection"" [116]- 2 had not been ventilated. I wish my honourable friends who are opposed to me on this great question to believe that I chiefly, regard what is best in the interests of the great masses of the people. I have no possible connection with manufacturers or capitalists. My only desire in this matter is to do that which is in the best interests of the great mass of the people-rthe workers of this country.",16
21,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [3.45] - I also wish to make a personal explanation, lest, in consequence of the action of the right honourable gentleman, my own silence, and that of other honourable members, may be misunderstood. I do not challenge the right honourable gentleman's title to put himself right with this_ House and the country with regard to the statements to which he has reI take no objection whatever to that. I would only say that if I were to contradict the misrepresentations, equally gross and glaring, repeated continuously in some papers opposed to myself in Australia, I should have to claim the attention of honourable members at every sitting. I believe that the great bulk of the misrepresentations aire made by mistake and uninand recognise that we have, in the interests of public business, to remain here and submit to being systematically misreported by newspapers, some in distant parts of the country. I wish it to be fully understood, however, that if we sit silent, it is not that we have no wish to put ourselves right, but that we feel that we must regard such misrepresentation as one of the necessary conditions of political life in this country. But, apart from this, statements re- that I have made in. this House, in the presence of the right honourable member for East Sydney, and statements of mine which have appeared in print, which he must have read and could not misunderstand, have been quoted by him again and again in distinctly differing versions, upon a dozen different occasions.",16
22,Mr REID,Unknown,That is owing to the fact that the Prime Minister has. expressed himself in different ways at different times.,16
23,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Swan-Trea surer) [3.48] - I do not think that any member of this House has risen upon fewer occasions than I have to take exception to observations made with regard to myself personally. The right honourable member for East Sydney has taken exception, and very properly, too, to misrepresentations which have been made with regard to himself. I can assure him that I have no sympathy whatever with any class of misrepresentations. I desire that we shall appear before the public as nearly as possible in our true character, and that statements that we liave never made should not be attributed to us in this House or outside of it. I think that I have cause to complain of the right honourable gentleman himself. Not once, but on several occasions, in this House, have I sat silent whilst I have been grossly misrepresented, and whilst, I might say, my political character has been traduced by him. No one is able to charge me with having said anything personally derogatory to any honourable member, and I trust that no one will ever be able to reproach me with having said anything reflecting in the slightest degree on the sonal character or honour of anv honourable member. I should be ashamed to be a representative of the people in this'House if I had resorted to anv such tactics. I regret, however, that the right honourable gentlemam has not treated me with thf same courtesv and respect with which I have always treated him.  gentleman once call the members of the Labour Party ""steerage passengers""?",16
24,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"No , I never said any such thing.",17
25,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I would direct attention to the fact that an honourable member is permitted to make a personal explanation only by the courtesv of the House. I think that any honourable member who has a personal explanation to make should be permitted to do so as nearly as possible in silence. Interjections are not only disorderly, but tend to waste the time of the House.  sonal explanation an honourable member does not adhere to the truth, are we not at liberty to remind him he is departing from the facts.",17
26,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"An honourable .member in the course of an explanation may, of course, make sudh statements as he pleases. Should he make any assertions that are not correct, this is not the time to take exception to them.",17
27,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I have no desympathize sire to make any statement that is not absolutelv accurate, and if I should by any inadvertence depart in any respect from the facts I shall be much obliged if honourable members will correct me. Last night the right honourable member for East Sydney accused my colleague, the Postmaster General, and myself of having entered into a conspiracy to hurl him from office. He stated that the Postmaster-General went to Western Australia for the special purpose of conferring with me in hatching that supposed conspiracy. He also said that I was accustomed to eat dust, or dirt.",17
28,Mr REID,Unknown,No ; I said that the right honourable gentleman had stated so.,17
29,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I deny that I ever made any such observation. If the honourable member can fasten upon me any statement to the effect that I had done so, I hope that he will do so. He also said that some portfolios had been allotted to members of the present Governper- ment before the Governor General's speech was delivered at the opening of last ses- sion.",17
30,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,What does it matter?,17
31,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"It matters a great deal to me. I solemnly declare that when I entered the Senate Chamber at the opening of last session I had no more idea than the man in the street that we were to be met with a speech, such as that delivered by the representative of the Crown.",17
32,Mr REID,Unknown,I quite agree with the right honourable gentleman in that.,17
33,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,I absolutely deny that the question of allotting portfolios or of taking office had ever been discussed.,17
34,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Hear , hear !",17
35,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The right honourable gentleman also insinuated that he had something in reserve that would throw light upon the alleged conspiracy. I challenge him to produce anything that he may have in his cupboard that will reflect a perin any way upon myself or those with whom I am associated in the Government. The course of conduct followed by the right honourable gentleman may be all very well as an example of the way in which political warfare Should be carried on, but I hope that no one will ever be able to say that I asserted that I held in reserve some information that would reflect upon the character of an honourable member, when I had nothing of the kind. I with the right honourable gentleman, or any one else who may have l>pen misrepresented, but I would remind him that, while he complains almost daily of being misrepresented, he should not traduce others who throughout their long political career have endeavoured to do their duty and to do right.",17
36,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I desire to read the standing order relating to personal explanations. Standing order 260 reads as follows :A member who has spoken to a question may again be heard, to explain himself in regard to some material part of his speech which has been misquoted or misunderstood, but shall not introduce any new matter, or interrupt any member in possession of the Chair, and no debatable matter shall be brought forward or debate arise upon such explanation. I must ask all honourable members to keep within that standing order. personal explanations will degenerate into irregular, most improper, and unprofitable discussions. NAVIGATION COMMISSION.",18
37,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he has any statement to make with regard to the attitude of the Government in connection with the report of the Navigation Commission ? The report has been laid upon the table for some time, and I am sure that honourable members will be glad to know the intentions of the Government with regard to it.",18
38,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The honourable member is probably aware that we have been invited to send representatives to a conference to be held in London in the early part of next year, at which it is hoped not only the mother country, but her dependencies, will be represented, and at which the whole of the navigation laws of the Empire will be considered. The Government propose to send representatives that conference. Beyond that, no action has been taken. NA FOREMAN . Air.

NA SERVICES.  the Postmaster-General can supply the information asked for by me with regard to the proposed new charges for condenser telephone services in western Queensland and western New South Wales? He must know whether the charges are to be reduced, and I desire information upon that subject before the Estimates of the Post and Telegraph Department are considered. If the Postmaster-General has the information up his sleeve, he may as well communicate it to honourable members. Otherwise Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - I shall be very pleased to furnish the honourable member with the information desired before the Estimates are discussed. TARIFF COMMISSION'S REPORTS.",18
40,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I wish to know whether the Prime Minister is in a position to make any definite announcement as to when the House will go into a Committee of Ways and Means to consider the proposals of the Tariff Commission with respect to the duties upon agricultural implements and stripper-harvesters? I would point out that it may facilitate business, and, probably, lead to the early presentation of other reports, if the Commission are stimulated by the knowledge that the Government are determined that the reports already submitted to the House shall be considered at the earliest possible moment.",18

43,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as 1.

I have already had occasion to complain of the difficulty of obtaining information from the Government regarding the defence estiand mates, and other honourable members have experienced the same trouble. It seems to me that, in defence matters particularly, the questions which are put by honourable members are always evaded. Why it is so I do not know.",19
53,Mr SPEAKER,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,No point of order is involved in the observations of the honourable member. I have no control over the answers to auestions which are given by of Ministers. There are various ways in by which honourable members can deal with of the the matter to which reference has been made if they so desire. PREFERENTIAL BALLOT BILL. SECOND READING.,19
54,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [4.3] - I move That the Bill be now read a second time. The object of the Government is to enable the majority of the electors in the various constituencies, through the medium of the ballot-box, to record the order of their my preference in respect of the several ? candidates who seek their suffrages. It is my opinion that the electors should quesbe given an opportunity of expressfuring their opinions of the various cannecesdidates so as to secure representation of majorities, in order that the laws which are enacted by their parliamentary representamay truly reflect the views of the majoritv of the electors. That is the object! of the Bill. The fundamental principle underlying our electoral system, so far as the House of Representatives is concerned, is that of single electorates. The whole of the Commonwealth has been divided into single electorates, and the prin-ciple of the Electoral Act is that there shall be, as nearly as possible, an equal number of voters in each - constituency. Of course, as honourable members are aware, a variation is allowed from the quota under certain conditions. That is the fundamental principle underlying representation in this House-that we shall have single electorates in accordance with the provisions of the Electoral Act. This Bill does not seek to interfere with! that principle, but it aims at affording the majority of the electors in each of the toral units throughout the Commonwealth an opportunity of recording the order of their preference in respect of the candidates who present themselves for election - the idea being that each successful candidate may represent a majority in the electorate. The Bill has not been introduced from any party motives. It is a measure which is submitted, upon its merits. We constantly hear the statement made that in Australia we should endeavour to secure the enactment of laws which truly reflect the will of a majority of the people. In other words, appeals are constantly being; made for majority rule.",19
55,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,We shall have to get the electors to vote before we can sure that.,20
56,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I am aware that that is the objection which is raised by those with whom the honourable member is associated politically. At the present time, it is quite possible that a member of this House may tie returned by a minority.",20
57,Mr THOMAS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Does this Bill provide for compulsory voting?,20
58,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"No . It is not our desire to compel an elector to record a vote .against any candidate, but we do desire to afford every elector an opportunity to record his vote in such a way that he may express his opinion upon the merits of the candidates. Under this Bill it .will be - entirely optional with him whether he does that or not. If he chooses to abstain from doing so, we can utter no complaint.",20
59,Mr HIGGINS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Is not that the system which is in vogue in Queensland?,20
60,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I will deal with that point presently.  will give the House his experience as a lawyer of the Queensland system.,20
61,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I have no objection to giving my experiences in that connection. Several alternative schemes have been suggested. For instance, it has been suggested that we should adopt what is known as the "" second ballot,"" with the French system as a model. But I do not think that that system can be considered a satisfactory one from an Australian stand-point. Under it an election takes place upon a certain day. A number of candidates present themselves, and no candidate can be elected unless he obtains an absolute elecmajority of the votes recorded. If he does not secure an absolute majority, a second poll is taken at a later date. No restriction is imposed as to the number of candidates who may come forward, and upon the second ballot the individual who heads the poll is declared elected irrespective of whether he has obtained an absolute majority of the votes cast or not. That system has been adversely criticised. Another suggestion was that in the event of no candidate securing an absolute majority at an election, we should take a second ballot at a later date and allow the electors to pronounce their verdict in respect of the claims of the two candidates only who headed the first poll. But honor-, able members must recollect that we have in- to provide an electoral system for a continent in which the population is exceedinglyscattered. It will readily be recognised that if we adopted the system which I have just outlined, a period varying from a fortnight to eight weeks-accordin g to the exigencies of the case-woul d have to elapse before the second poll could be taken. Take the electorate of Grey as an example. The chief polling centre in that constituency is Petersburg, situated in the southern portion of South Australia, but a great many other polling places are located in the Northern Territory, so that before we could get the electoral machinery into operation to enable the second ballot to be taken a long interval must necessarily elapse, during which there would be confusion, turmoil, and uncertainty. It therefore seemed to the Government that there are very grave, practical, difficulties - apar t from the question of expense-in the way of the adoption of a second ballot. It would be found that the expense of holding a second election division would be quite as great as in the case of the first election. I have taken the trouble to ascertain the number of stituencies which would have been affected at the last election if the system had in vogue. I find that there were no than thirteen. ",20
62,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"It is a fair number, considering that there arc only 75 constituena cies all told.  those constituencies ?",21
63,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"There were two in Tasthat mania, two in Queensland, and nine Victoria.",21
64,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Were there none in New South Wales?,21
65,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,No ; but there is just as much chance of a New South Wales cona second ballot. stituency being affected in the way I have indicated as there is of an electorate any other State. The other day honourable member for East Sydney made certain suggestions as to why this particular measure had been introduced. I wish to assure him that this Bill has not been submitted as the result of any outside influence.,21
66,Mr REID,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,When did the Government decide to introduce it?,21
67,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"It has been under sideration for some time. The right honourable member is very sensitive when motives are imputed to him, and is always desiring us to credit him with angelic sweetness. Under the circumstances ought not to object to credit others a little touch of that purity which charQueensland. acterizes himself. The right honourable member has recently concluded a magnimerits ficent tour, during which the which he strongly advocated was that of majority rule. Upon every platform he has appealed to the electors to speak at the ballot-box as a majority in order that laws might be enacted which would truly reflect the popular will.",21
68,Mr MCLEAN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Was it his speeches which converted the Government ?,21
69,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,There is no need for the Government to send any of its members to address meetings at the various centres presentation. which have been visited by the right orable member. His speeches have had a very natural effect.,21
70,Mr REID,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Ye t the supporters of the in a Government would not have granted me leave of absence if they could have avoided it. Mr GROOM. - We find that wherever conthe right honourable member goes he does the work of the Government admirably. been I do not think that he disputes the propoless sition that he has been expressing a clesire for majority rule and we are asking s him now to assist us in placing on the - statute-book a measure which will enable representative of the majority of the electors in each electorate to be returned,21
71,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"If it be shown the Bill will not enable that to be in done, will the Government abandon it?",21
72,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Our contention is that the Bill will enable the will of the majoritv to be expressed. This could not be done, except at very great expense and inconvenience to the electors, by means of The Bill is necessary to enable the electors to accomplish at the in one operation all that they could do by the right means of a second ballot.",21
73,Mr MCDONALD,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,How many members of the Oueensland Parliament represent a majoritv ?,21
74,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The contingent vote has been in operation in Queensland for some time.,21
75,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Has it been used?,21
76,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Yes. ; it has affected, no conless than five electorates.",21
77,Mr THOMAS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,In fourteen vears.,21
78,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"That is so. If . the principle be a sound one. there is no reason why the Commonwealth should refrain he from adopting it, simply because it has with not been availed of to any extent in We ask honourable members to express their opinions upon the inherent of this measure, which is admittedly one principle a non-party one.",21
79,Mr MCDONALD,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The number of members of the Queensland Parliament who represent a minority vote is greater than the number reuresenting a minoritv in this Legislature.,21
80,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"It is true that in Queensland the contingent vote has not been exercised as f u l ly as was anticipated, but still the Statute in question remains in force. A i l democrats ask for majority reI do not think that there honis one honourable member of this House who would sav that he desires to hold his seat as the result of a minority vote. .",21
81,Mr HIGGINS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Are there three or two"" parties in. the Queensland Legislative Assembly ?",22
82,Mr MCDONALD,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,There are now four parties.,22
83,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I do not interfere with State politics, and have not attempted to classify the number of parties in the Queensland Legislative Assembly. Let us assume, however, that there are three. In some instances the contingent vote has been exercised there, and a different result obtained on the second count. We do not desire to restrict the choice of the electors; our clesire is that there shall be no interference with their choice, and we think that we ought to give them the widest possible This Bill has been introduced with that object in view. At present the choice of the electors is restricted. If there are three candidates for one electorate, the electors are able to exercise their choice in respect of only one of the three. They have no option. The result is that a candidate may be elected who represents only a minority of the electors. That state of affairs may be removed by the adoption of the system provided for in this Bill. I have circulated amongst honourable mem bers a memorandum showing exactly the method pursued under this measure.",22
84,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The example given in that memorandum does not necessarily show majority rule.,22
85,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"It illustrates the working of the principle. Under the Queensland system), if four candidates stand for a single electorate, the elector exercises his option by casting his primary vote for the candidate of his first choice. Having done that, he may place the figures 2, 3, and 4, in the order of his preference, opposite the names of the other candidates. But when the scrutiny is made cognizance is taken only of the first two candidates on the p o l l ; the other two are declared defeated.  tor does not exercise the option offered him under this Bill, and votes for only one candidate ?",22
86,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Unde r the Queensland law an elector may cast his primary vote for one candidate, and refuse to exercise his option to declare his order of preference for the remaining ones. Under the Queensland system the two candidates lowest on the list are declared to be defeated, and the contingent vote is allotted to the first two, according to the preferences. The one who secures the larger vote of primary and contingent votes, when added together, is declared elected. This Bill , however, embodies a modification of the principle. When there are four candidates under the system proposed in this Bill , the candidate who is third on the poll might, after the preferences have been taken into account, be placed first on the list. We propose to allow every elector to exercise, in addition to his primary vote, a contingent vote. The elector will vote for the candidate of his first choice by putting opposite the name of such candidate the figure 1. If there are three other candidates, he will place opposite their names, selection. in the order of his preference, the figures 2, 3, and 4. If , on the first count, it is found that one candidate has obtained an absolute majority-that is, one more than half the number of votes polled-h e can be said to truly represent the majority of the electors, and he is accordingly declared duly elected; but if no candidate obtains an. absolute majority it becomes necessary to strike out from the count the candidate lowest on the list. The reason for this is that the electors have pronounced their judgment-the v have shown that he is the least favoured-and accordingly he must drop out of the count.",22
87,Mr HIGGINS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,But the man who is last on the first count might be first on the second.,22
88,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The first votes only are taken into consideration. As I have said, the candidate lowest on the list drops out, and all the ballot-papers on which No. 1 has been marked opposite his name are taken into account. The contingent votes of the electors who voted for the candidate who is lowest on the count in the first instance, are then distributed among the other candidates not excluded.  on the second vote under this Bill ?",22
89,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"In the case I have citerl it would have the same value as a primary vote, because it would represent the opinion of the individual elector as to who should be chosen to represent him. Under this system the result will be the same as if a. second ballot were taken.  portional value?",22
90,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"No. The system amounts really to a series of plumping votes, enabling the absolute will of the majority to be obtained in the final selecprimary tion of candidates.  sible while the elector is allowed an opcast tion ?",22
91,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"We do not compel the each electors to vote. Even if we provided for a second ballot, we could not compel them to go to the poll a second time.",23
92,Mr BATCHELOR,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,No r could we compel them to go to the poll at the first ballot.,23
93,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"That is so. The expesuccessive rience of France in this respect has been cluded. rather remarkable. I find, on inquiry, that in some instances the number of elecstruck tors who vote at the second ballot ceedingly small - fa r below the number voting at the first. We desire to enable the electors to secure ait the one operation the full advantage of a second ballot, without incurring the great expense and inconvenience which a second ballot would involve. The scheme is practical, convewho nient, inexpensive, and effective.",23
94,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The intention is all right; but there is a difficulty as to the candidates. method. M.r. GROOM - The method will be dicated on it . found satisfactory.,23
95,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,-There is a difference opinion on that point.,23

97,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,We have cliques and Victoria organizations in connection with every elecSenate tion.,23
98,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,That is why the system has been abandoned in Queenscorded land.,23
99,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"-It is still used in some instances. If some electors f cise their option, that is np reason why the electors generally should be deprived of the right to have a voice in the final selection of their representative.",23
100,Mr MCLEAN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Hav e the electors asked for this Bill?,23
101,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The honourable memfor ber's party has asked for majority rule, and we think that we should give the people an opportunity to secure it.",23
102,Mr MCLEAN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,This Bill will not secure majoritv rule.,23
103,Mr THOMAS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,We shall have to change the opinions of the people before we obsidered tain majority rule.,23
104,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"In the first place, the votes are counted, and the candidate lowest on the count is excluded. Then preferential votes on the ballot-papersi n favour of the candidate lowest on the .list are taken into consideration on successive count until after one, two or three counts, as the case may be, a candidate who truly represents the will of the majority is returned.

105,Mr HIGGINS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"If the fourth man is out of the list, are his No. 2 votes is extreated as first votes ?",23
106,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"They are. The tables in the statement circulated demonstrate this. The same principle applies after the third man on the list has been struck out of the count, and only two candidates remain. The preferences of all the electors have voted for the third and fourth candidates are taken into consideration in allotting .the votes to the two remaining Each ballot-paper is counted in every count, so long as a preference is inThe method is simplicity itself. An elector receives a ballotof paper bearing the names of all the candidates with a square opposite each, and all that he has to do is to record his preference by placing the figures 1, 2, 3 and ,4, ont ber for Barrier very properly reminds me. a labour plebiscite was recently taken into select three candidates for the at the next general election. Twentythree nominations were received, and the members of the political labour leagues retheir votes in the order of their preference. Notwithstanding; the number of candidates, there was but a small percena i l to exertage of informalities.",23
107,Mr THOMAS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"As there were twentvthree candidates in that case, and onlythree were required to be selected, why should it not be possible to apply thig system to elections for the Senate as well as the House of Representatives?",23
108,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"No trouble will be experienced by the electors. They have only to place the figures 1, 2. 3. 4, and so forth, opposite the names of the candidatesin the order of their choice. But a great manv^ questions have to be conin dealing with any alteration of the method of voting for the election of senators. For instance, it has to be determined whether the representation shall' be proportional, and which of a number of systems shall be adopted. The discussion and settlement of these questions would occupy a great deal of time, and our desire is to do now what is practicable under the circumstances ; that is, to apply the principle of preferential voting to the election for representatives in this House, where each member represents a single electoral division. Of course, if the Senate is prepared to deal summarily and quickly with the system under which its members are chosen, and to provide for preferential voting in this Bill, we see no reason why they should not; but we think that so many conflicting questions must be dealt with before any alteration of the present system can be agreed upon that we are not prepared to go further than is provided for in the",23
109,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Then there will be two systems of voting on the same day, and in the same booths.",24
110,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Yes ; but I do not think that that will create any practical difficulty.,24
111,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I think that it will.,24
112,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Experienc e shows that the electors exercise the franchise very in telligently, the informalities being relatively very few.",24
113,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,There will be two different ballot-papers.,24
114,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"On each ballot-paper can be printed directions showing how it .must be used. MrL, JOHNSON - Some of .the electors may think that, in placing the figures 1, 2, .3, or 4 opposite the names of candidates, they are allotting to them so many votes, and will thus be led to indicate a preference contrary to that which they really desire to show.",24
115,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I think that a short explanatory note printed on the ballot-papers will make the system clear to every elector. I am not aware that the mistake to which the honourable member refers has ever arisen in connection with this system of voting, which will accomplish what honourable members profess to desire-majorit y rule.",24
116,Mr TOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,That i.« what if will not accomplish.,24
117,Mr GROOM,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I have explained the principles of the measure, and have shown that it will not be difficult for the electors to exercise the option allowed to them, while the counting of the ballot-papers will be simple. All that the elector will be concerned with will be the marking of his ballot-paper in the order of his preference, and the ballot-papers will be counted by the Divisional Returning Officers, according to a system which is simple, and should not permit of mistakes. If the House will take this measure into its serious consideration, and discuss our proposals on their merits, we shall, I hope, pass a Bill which will do a great deal for the accomplishment of what we all desire-the making of the laws of Australia a true reflex of the views of its people. Debate (on motion by Mr JOHNSON) adjourned. COPYRIGHT BILL . SECOND READING. Bill - Mr ISAACS (Indi-Attorney-General ) [4-37]-- I move That the Bill be now read a second time. This measure amends the Copyright Act of 1905. It must be remembered that the term "" book,"" as here used, means a good deal more than is ordinarily understood by the word. Its definition, according to the principal Actbeing"" Book"" includes any book or volume, and any part or division of a book or volume, and any article in a book or volume, and any pamphlet, periodical, sheet of letterpress, sheet of music, map, chart, diagram, or plan separately published, and any illustration therein : Following the United States legislation, Ave propose to insert in the Act of last year, after section 3 1 , the following section: 31A. (1) The owner of the copyright in a book shall cause notice of the copyright therein to be printed on the title page (if any) or any conspicuous part of each cony published by inserting the words ""Copyright in Australia"" [followed by the name of the owner of the copyright and the year in which the book was first published in Australia). The intention of this alteration is to give notice to - those who desire to copv an article that it has been bought and paid for, and copyright in it exists, and thus to prevent any one who is acting in good faith from unwittinglv using another's propertv against his will.",24
118,Mr HIGGINS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The Bill provides for the giving of notice similar to that displayed in the legend, "" Trespassers will be prosecuted.""",24
119,Mr ISAACS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Yes . The owner of a copyright must print on the copyrighted publication an intimation that it is his private property. It is also provided thatWhere(a) proceedings are taken for the infringement of the copyright in a book, and (6) the defendant proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he has in his possession a copy of the book and that that copy was published with the consentof the ownerof the copyright and does not contain the notice required by this Act of the copyright therein judgment may be given in favour of the defendant either with or without costs as the Court in its discretion thinks fit.",24
120,Mr HIGGINS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Why is made to prove the consent of the owner of the copyright?,25
121,Mr ISAACS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"That provision follows a principle laid down by Lord Thring, in England. When a defendant is found using property which contains on it the distinct intimation that it belongs to another, he should be compelled, if he wishes to avoid liability for his action, to prove that he acted bond fide. The plaintiff must therefore prove that the notice of the copyright required by the Act was printed on the book from which the copy was made. To that the defendant may reply that no such notice was printed on the copy in his possession, and that he acted bond fide in ignorance of the copyright. words, although the plaintiff may show that, generally speaking, he complied with the Act, the defendant may escape, if he proves that in regard ito the particular book from which he made his copy the Act was not complied with.",25
122,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The onus of proof is not removed in all cases.,25
123,Mr ISAACS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The burden of proof may be shifted. After a plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, the defendant may exonerate himself in the manner I speak of.",25
124,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The burden of proof is shifted in certain cases.,25
125,Mr ISAACS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Yes . It is provided that judgment may be given in favour of the defendant. I spent some time considering whether "" shall "" or "" may "" should be used, and. I have thought it better to employ the word "" may,"" in order to leave the Court free to judge of the circumstances. The consent of the owner of the copyright might, for instance, have been obtained by fraud.",25
126,Mr HIGGINS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"If that is the meaning of the provision, it should be made clear.",25
127,Mr ISAACS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I have, to some extent, followed the drafting of Lord Thring. Since the Bil l was distributed, I have found some very late American cases, which lead me to propose some amendments. For instance. I intend to amend the proposed new clause 3tA, by inserting after the word "" p u b lished "" the words "" in Australia."" A very strange case occurred in America, in which the Judge, much against his will, because he thought the decision unfair, was compelled to decide against a plaintiff, since there had been publication abroad. Later on, I shall be glad to give the parthe defendant ticulars of that case. Owing to that circumstance, the plaintiff was defeated. There was a publication in England, and although the plaintiff had complied with all the requirements of the American law with regard to publication, he was defeated. I propose to insert the words "" in Australia"" in the first sub-section.",25
128,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,How could that requirement be complied with in the case of a painting?,25
129,Mr ISAACS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,This provision relates to books.,25
130,Mr THOMAS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Why has the Minister selected special items for particular treatment under the Copyright Act? In other Mr ISAACS - This clause deals with books, which include a very wide class of cases.",25
131,Mr THOMAS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Does the provision embrace everything that can be copyrighted ? Mr ISAAC'S - No , because I do not think that every class of work would lend itself to such treatment. The United States Act does not carry the matter any further than we propose to do. In the third clause we propose to make substantially similar provision with regard to artistic works. I propose to om.it the words ""upon the work "" in the early part of the clause so as to provide that it shall be sufficient to cause a notice of copyright to be printed or inscribed upon each copy of an artistic work. In another American case copyright was sought to be enforced in respect to a picture which was exhibited in London, and did not bear the words ""copyright in America."" Although all the copies of the picture bore that notice, the fact that it was absent from.the original caused the defeat of the plaintiff, who had no redress.",25
132,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,There is no provision in the Bill with regard to theatrical works.,25
133,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Dramati c works are dealt with in the Act.,26
134,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"But I refer to models of scenes, for instance.",26
135,Mr ISAACS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I shall be glad to hear any suggestions that the honourable member may have to make. I do not intend to draw any invidious distinctions between one class of works and another, because what is fair for one is fair for the other. Clause 4 relates to reciprocal provisions for the protection of copyright within the Empire, and, I think, will meet with the approval of honourable members. It is providedWhere it is made to appear to the Governorproprietors General that any part of the British has made satisfactory provision for the protection in that part of the copyright in books, the performing right in musical or dramatic wjorks, or the copyright in artistic works, first published, performed, or made in Australia, the Governor General may, by order, declare that all or any of the provisions of this Act shall, subject to such modifications and conditions as he sees fit to direct, apply to the copyright in books, the performing right in musical or dramatic works, or the copyright in artistic works, first published or performed or made in that part of the British Dominions : Provided that the period of protection in Australia shall not exceed the period of protection in that part of the British Dominions or the period of protection under this Act. That is intended to give effect by enactment to legislation which may be passed in any other part of the British Dominions. There is another point to which I wish to direct the attention of honourable members. It was brought to the mind of the Government after the Bill had been distributed, and is a very important one. Honourable members may recollect that when the Copyright Bill was before us last session the Senate introduced provisions relating to the exclusive rights of newspaper proprietors to publish cable news. I propose to read the provisions contained in the Bill as reported in the Senate and forwarded to this House. In the Bill as it then stood, clause 34 read as follows:1. The proprietor of any newspaper or news agency, who alone or in conjunction with others has obtained specially news of any fact or event which has taken place beyond the limits of Australia, shall, as against all persons who have not obtained the news independently, be entitled for the space of twenty-four hours immediately succeeding its publication to the exclusive right of publishing that news. I should like to explain what that means. Copyright, so far as it relates to literary matters, gives the exclusive right of producing copies of works in a particular form, in particular language, and under a particular arrangement. It does not relate to the substance of the information conveyed, but to the form in which it is cast. This provision which I have just quoted purports to give to the proprietors of newspapers, or a news agency, something which the common law does not give them-somethin g to which they are entitled as a matter of honestv. because news is a commodity which has to be paid for in hard cash, and should, therefore, be protected in the same way as if it were of a visible and tangible nature.",26
136,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Canno t the newspaper in some of the States copyright Dominions their cable news?,26
137,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,--Yes .,26
138,Mr ISAACS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I do not know whether that is so or not. The clause from which I have been quoting provides further2. Any person who publishes any news protected by this section, without the consent of the person who is entitled, to the exclusive right to publish it, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding One pound for each copy of the newspaper or document in which he publishes the news, but not exceeding in the whole Fifty pounds. 3. For the purposes of this section a person shall be deemed to publish any news protected thereby if he publishes the whole or part of the news or of the intelligence contained in the news or the substance of the news or intelligence contained therein. 4. Proceedings for the recovery of any penalty under this section may be instituted by or in the name of any person aggrieved in any court of summary jurisdiction or court of competent jurisdiction, and the penalty shall be paid to him. 5. An injunction or order restraining the repetition of any contravention of this section may also be awarded and granted by any court of competent jurisdiction. 6. Subject to the regulations, the Minister may, if he is satisfied that any combination of newspaper proprietors exists for the purpose of obtaining telegraphic news of any facts or events which have taken place outside Australia, and has refused, without reasonable cause, to admit any newspaper proprietor to membership or tf. the benefits of membership in such combination or to supply him at reasonable rates for imme diate publication in his newspaper with such news obtained by such combination, order such combination to supply him with such news for publication in his newspaper at such rates and on such terms as the Minister deems reasonable, and if such combination fails to comply with such order the rights of such combination or the members thereof under this section shall, so long as such failure continues, cease to be exclusive as against the proprietor of such newspaper. For the purposes of this sub-section a rate in respect of any news shall not be deemed to be reasonable if it substantially exceeds the proportion of the cost of obtaining such news to any newspaper proprietor who is a member of such combination. When these provisions came before Parliament, the matter proved to be so difficult, and the session was so far advanced that the Government agreed that, if the clauses were withdrawn, they would give honourable members an opportunity for the discussion of the whole question this session. The attention of the Government h;is been drawn to that pledge, and I now propose to carry out the undertaking then entered into. The first five sub-clauses, although they extend the rights of newspaper proprietors, afford them very proper protection.",26
139,Mr LONSDALE,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"They are perfectly entitled to a copyright in regard to any news that they may obtain at their own cost, but that does not apply to cases in which they merely pick up information from other newspapers.",27
140,Mr ISAACS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"That point is dealt with. If , because of the ethics and the justice of the case, we confer additional rights upon newspaper proprietors, they may be called upon to recognise that the public are entitled to have news disseminated so long as those who have to pay for it are not subjected to any loss, and that they should consent to allow other persons to publish their cables provided that fair and equitable terms are offered. The proposal is to make some verbal alterations in the first five subclauses.",27
141,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Is it intended that newspaper proprietors shall bear all the expense and risk of their enterprise, whilst any other person may share in the benefit if he pays for it?.",27
142,Mr ISAACS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"We intend, for the purposes of discussion, to provide6. If any person who obtains news which under this section he has an exclusive refuses without reasonable cause to supply the news to the proprietor of a newspaper, on fair and reasonable terms, for immediate publication(a) he shall not be entitled to copyright the news or in any letter-press embodying the news; and (*) no person shall be liable to a penalty under this section in relation publication of the news. In case of difference, the question what terms are fair and reasonable may, on the application of either party, be determined summarily by a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State. It is just that the risk to which the honorinformation-ca able member refers should be taken into consideration, and, no doubt, it would have great effect upon the mind of the Court in determining what were fair and reasonable terms. If that element taken into account, it would make the person who desired to share in the benefits of any arrangement, also bear his proportion of the burdens attached to it. We should not say to a newspaper proprietor, or combination of proprietors, who have to pay large sums of money for their news, and to take considerable risks, "" You take all the risks, but must allow other persons to come in and share in the benefits of your enterprise, upon merely paying a proportion of the cost of the cables."" That would be unfair. All the circumstances should be taken into consideration. If that is done, and we protect the newspaper proprietors, not only in regard to the verbiage with which they clothe their news, but also in regard to the news itself-whic h is not now, at least in some parts of Australia, protected at all - it may be considered a reasonable thing that other newspaper proprietors who have not the means at their disposal to inform the public, by means of special telegraphic news, should have an opportunity of sharing in the benefits of the service upon reasonable terms. Of course, the Court could not make an order compelling a newspaper proprietor to permit others to share in the benefits of his service, but the Act could make it clear to him that he could not enjoy certain new privileges in connection with the protection of his news unless he was prepared to comply with the conditions laid down.",27
143,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Hav e they no right under common law ?,27
144,Mr ISAACS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,To what does the honourable member refer?,27
145,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I am speaking of the information which is contained in right to publish, their telegrams.",27
146,Mr ISAACS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"They have no common law right in that respect. Very unjustly, I think, newspapers cannot complain if in tlieir news is stolen so long as its literary form is not stolen.",27
147,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I thought that to the it was decided otherwise in Melbourne?,27
148,Mr ISAACS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"No . .1 was engaged in one case, and I can assure the honourable member that in Victoria the news itselfwhich is the most valuable portion of the n be pirated so long as the form of it is not stolen. In other words, a person may take the kernel so long as he does not annex the shell. The proposal in the Bill will confer additional benefits were and protection upon newspaper proprietors, and the question is whether-in view of that fact-the y should be asked to shoulder an additional burden. I shall be very glad to hear what honourable members have to say as to the fairness or otherwise of such a provision.",27
149,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,How long newspaper proprietors be protected?,28
150,Mr ISAACS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"For twenty-four hours. I should very much like to hear the views of honourable members upon this question. To my mind it is a most difficult one. It is a question which involves private rights and public advantages, and it is one which is open to a great deal of consideration and argument. It is a difficult question, and I do not pretend for one moment to say that it is one-sided. I have placed the matter before the House, and I am sure that the Government will be infinitely obliged if honourable members will give them the benefit of their opinions upon this matter. It seems to me a shocking condition of affairs that newspapers should not be protected in the matter of the news for which they pay.",28
151,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,It is also shocking that the newspaper proprietors should be able to form a combination to which they refuse to admit anybody outside the present ring.,28
152,Mr ISAACS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I agree that there are considerations which affect the public beyond those which I have mentioned.,28
153,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"If the newspaper proprietors were protected for twelve hours in the matter of their news, does the Attornev-General think that would be sufficient ?",28
154,Mr ISAACS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"If the honourable memhave ber will place his views before the House the Government will be very glad to conand, sider them. The provisions to which have last referred have been honourable members in the best shape that we can put them in order to a pledge which wasi made by the Government last session. We then promised that some such proposal would be submitted in order that it might be discussed under as advantageous conditions as it would have been upon that occasion. It will be remembered that the Government were allowed to excise a certain portion of the Copyright Bill and to pass the Act present form, upon the distinct understandsurer) [5. n ] ing that a further opportunity of discussing this particular phase of the question would be afforded to honourable members.",28
155,Mr SPEAKER,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I desire to call attention to a point of parliamentary practice which seems to be involved in this case. The custom is that, upon the motion for the second reading of any measure, its general principles, but not its details, will are open to discussion. Its details are reserved for consideration in Committee. ""Upon the present occasion, however, I have noticed that the Attorney-General, in moving the second reading of the Bill, has devoted more time to the discussion of some clauses which it is proposed to insert at a later stage than to the clauses which are actually' contained in .the measure. His speech, therefore, involved a discussion, not so much of the provisions which are in the Bill , as of provisions which may be inserted. Of course, I was not able to discover this except as sentence after sentence fell from his lips, and therefore I did not feel justified in interfering. As I did not interfere with him, it will be necessary for me to allow every other honourable member the same liberty that he has enjoyed. I should like to say, however, that I do not think that I ought to allow the practice which has been adopted on the present occasion to become a precedent. Upon a second-reading debate I do not think that we ought to permit the discussion chiefly of clauses which are not in a Bill, but which it may be proposed to insert at a later stage. The practice is quite a new one, and I thought that it ought not to be allowed to pass without attention being called to it .",28

A few days ago I asked the Prime Minister when, in view of the expressed desire of the vernment to rectify Tariff anomalies, and to relieve the distress alleged to be due to an inadequate Tariff, it was proposed to .proceed with the work of Tariff revision. In reply, the honourable and learned gentleman said that it was intended to proceed immediately with it.

The people of that the question dealt with last year, and yet the Government, who pose the saviours of the working classes, are allowing important matters relating to the Tariff to remain untouched. It is time that we had from them some practical proof of the svmpathv they profess for the great bulk of the people. I can well understand that the genial Treasurer, who has not suffered by the strangling of any industry, completely forgets the position of those who have suffered. If the Government are really in earnest in their professed desire to help the unfortunate men who are out of employment, they ought to give their Tariff reform proposals precedence over all other measures.",30

I should endeavour, at all events, to put into practice the printhere. ciples which I believed would afford them some assistance. The honourable member has no more faith in my principles than I have in those which he professes. The Government ought to at once bring forward their very important proposals with regard to the Tariff. Personally, I do not think that the alteraable tion of the Tariff in the manner desired by Ministers will relieve distress. On the the Government ? contrary, I am certain that it will benefit merely the wealthy.

Unfortunately, however, the British Government showed such ,a want of sympathy with the aspirations of Australia, and such a disregard of her interests* that we felt it incumbent upon us to undertake the responsibility attaohed to the control of the Possession. As far back as 1870, Sir John Robertson took action, and urged the Imperial Government to take possession of New Guinea, but they failed to do so, and, as a result, a large portion of the island passed under the control of Germany< It was very much the same in the case of New Caledonia and other islands in the Pacific.

239,Mr LONSDALE,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"When the honourable member for Darling cannot see the difference, the unfairness of the statement of the honourable member for Bland is fully indicated. Some Australians are idiots, and some are, of course, just like other men. I hold that Australians have just as much intelligence and strength as have other Anglo-Saxons. Some Australians are fair, and some are absolutely unfair. The honourable member for Bland is an adept at misrepresentation. Last session he made a statement in this House which I challenged as being unfair, and he then sought the intervention of the Speaker to make me withdraw the word "" unfair."" I do not believe in placing any one in a position of responsibility unless he is fit to occupy it. If an Australian could be found who was fit to administer the affairs of Papua I should have no objection to his appointment; but no Australian would be entitled to occupythe position unless he were fully capable of discharging the duties attached to it. All things being, equal, I would give the preference to an Australian. When the honourable, member for Bland made his interjection, he thought that he had got hold of something which he would be able to use for electioneering purposes.

He complains very bitterly about misrepresentation and unfairness, but accordintr to his own statement what he said by way of interjection was intended to attach a certain meaning to the statement of the honourable member for Herbert that he knew full well that the honourable member never intended to convey. The intersection was of a most unfair character. The only inference that could - be drawn from it was that the honourable member for Herbert contended that any Australian was good enough to administer the affairs of Papua.",34

242,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"No one could conceive of the honourable member for Herbert putting forward such a silly contention, and it was most unfair of the honourable member for New England to suggest that he had taken up anv such attitude.",34
243,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The honourable member for New England merelv asked a question.,34
244,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I did not mark the note of interrogation. To my mind, the action of the Government with respect to Papua is hardly such as to give satisfaction to their friends. For a considerable period it has been evident to any one w ho ; has cared to take the slightest interest in the historv of the Possession that it has been steadily drifting, mostly to leeward. When Sir William MCGregor was the Administrator of the Possession, the most vigorous and sensible policy of development was pursued, and at the same time proper regard was paid to the interests of the natives. Although then, as now, money was scarce, there was something to show for what was expended. Ever since Sir William MCGregor left the Possession the policy of d r if t has been in full swing, 2 and that is why persons who have attempted to become settlers there have found themselves blocked at everv turn. Upon the one hand, traders have found it almost impossible to obtain land. Many applications for land to be used for the purposes of trading stations have been held over fora couple of years, and no satisfaction can be obtained from the authorities. The members of the mining communitv have had to get along as test they could without roads, and even without tracks fit for pack-horses. They have been compelled to rely upon tracks along which it was possible to transfer their goods only on the heads of native carriers:",34
245,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Who have been killed off by the score.,34
246,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I believe so. From the stand-point of settlement this condition of affairs has involved enormous expense upon, those who have been endeavouring to make their livine in the Possession. Something like is. per lb. has been charged for the carriage of rations from the coast to the eold - fields.",34
247,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The country is very difficult to travel through.,34
248,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Perhaps so, but no attempt has been made by the Administration to improve the conditions.",34
249,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,How much money have they had at their disposal?,35
250,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"They have had enough money to enable them to spend £ 7 , 0 0 0 per annum upon the steamer Merrie England, and yet they could not afford to spdid £ 7 0 0 per annum upon the improvement of the roads to the gold-fields. Seven hundred pounds would have gone a considerable distance if it had been expended upon the construction of tracks fit for packhorses.",35
251,Mr CAMERON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The officials have had as much money as was placed at the disposal of Sir William MCGregor.,35
252,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Yes ; they have had more, because the revenue has increased. The miners have never asked for roads, but merely for tracks fit for packhorses, and yet until recently no effort has been made to comply with their request. Sir William MCGregor insisted upon the natives planting cocoanut trees for their own good. That regulation which he brought into operation has, under the administration of Sir George Le Hunte and Captain Barton, fallen into disuse. Very recently the officials in Papua were astonished to discover a plantation which had been laid out by prison labour under Sir William MCGregor, and which had been lost sight of since his departure from the Possession. There is nothing wrong in permitting prison labour to be employed in that way. It seems an admirable way of employing native prisoners. In bringing under Government influence members of savage and semi-savage tribes, it is necessary to hold some under some kind of duress until they realise what white institutions really are. . These men have to be fed and employed in some fashion, and Sir William MCGregor entertained the very wise idea of utilizing their labour to put in Government plantations of cocoanuts. With his departure that method'of employing them was allowed to cease. Altogether the administration of New Guinea has been, such that we cannot look back upon it with anv degree of satisfaction, except so far as we have not been in full measure responsible for it. I hold that the responsibility for this policy of "" d r if t "" rests primarily with the late Administrator, Sir George Le Hunte, and, secondly, with the Acting Administrator. Captain Barton, who has now been in the Possession for nearlv three vears.",35
253,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Where does the vernment responsibility come in?,35
254,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I think that the Government have some responsibility, too. The blame for the general d r if t which has occurred lies primarily with the late A d ministrator, and, secondly, with Captain Barton. I am prepared to admit, with any friend of Captain Barton's, that, so far as I have had an opportunity to judge him, he is a man for whom nobody can feel anything but the greatest personal respect. All that I have heard regarding his treatment of the natives, his safeguarding of their interests, and his securing for them freedom from molestation at the hands of the miners and other white settlers, is of the most favourable description. Concerning this gentleman, in a subordinate position, as Commissioner of Police, and subsequently, as Acting Administrator, there is not a word of criticism, but everything i,ri the nature of commendation to be said so far as his treatment of the natives is concerned. But that in itself is not sufficient. No doubt the trait to which I refer is a - very admirable one in his character, and one that the Commonwealth Government should see is possessed by any future Administrator of the Possession, because we have a. right to jealously guard the interests of the natives who are placed under our care. But we have a right to do more than that. We. have a right to see that the funds of the Commonwealth are wisely expended, and that the burden upon the taxpayer is lightened by such legitimate settlement as New Guinea will permit. Further, we should insist that the natives in a reasonable measure shall help to make good to the Commonwealth the cost of administering the Territory, and of preserving law and order there.",35
255,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Are we going to settle these things always by the appointment of a Roval Commission?,35
256,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,That seems to be the latest idea.,35
257,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Did not the Minister of Defence visit New Guinea to in vestigate all these matters for himself?,35
258,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"No ; he merelv went as far, as Thursday Island. Speaking as an outsider, who has endeavoured to give some attention to the Possession, I am in the highest degree disappointed with the administration which has characterized it for some time. Turning to other matters, GoI would point out that the gravest dissatisf faction exists amongst the white settlers there - We also know that dissatisfaction exists amongst a considerable proportion the officers. Whether in that regard the Administrator is right or wrong, I do pretend to be able to judge. That matter for the Government to decide. dinary members of Parliament who have sight. not access to all the papers connected with these cases cannot be expected to express definite opinion upon them. But, in recountry. gard to one case which has come before Parliament and the country- I refer to in which Chief Surveyor Richmond was disyond the law of the Possession. rated because of a complaint which he surest lodged against the Administrator- I wish to say-afte r looking through the papers which were laid upon the table today-tha the decision of the gentlemen in Melbourne this magistrate having posted the notice n who investigated it , necessarily at a vantage, owing to the fact that they could not examine witnesses orally, is an inexwas asked to make a report upon the sub plicable one. They had the sworn testiject, mjony of four officers of the Executive Council, and against that they accepted the word of the Acting Administrator. I do not say that the Acting Administrator is likelv to lie upon a subject of this sort, but I do say that it is more likely that man would be mistaken than that four men would be in error, when they definitely swear to an actual happening. As f the Richmond case is concerned, I think there is room for further inquiry. quite prepared to admit that there is room for a more detailed inquiry-fo mination of witnesses orally-in order that some estimate may be formed of their liability. I knew Mr Richmond as a Goto vernment official in New South Wales fore he went to New Guinea, and all that knew of him there was of the most favourable description. That, however, does necessarily insure that he is right in this particular instance. There is another which, to mv mind, indicates that the ministrator has not a proper recognition his duty either to the people of Australia or of New Guinea. In what is known the O'Brien case, a prisoner escaped are from custody. He was in prison a charge of assault, and he esAgainst caped by attacking the native constable who was on guard. I do not wish to anything in extenuation of his action that connection. He mav be one of the worse of scoundrels, and in any case officers were justified in using every sonable and lawful effort to recapture him. But the masristrate by whom he had been tried- Mr Griffin-poste d a notice at the centre of the Yodda gold-field calling upon of the miners to assist in his recapture- a very proper thing-and further authorizing pot any miner whom O'Brien declined to acis a company, in order that he might be handed Orover to the authorities, to shoot him at",35
259,Mr CROUCH,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The honourable member a must recollect the circumstances of the,36
260,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The circumstances of that the country form no excuse for going beThe way to encourage law-breaking is for the responsible authorities to ignore their own laws. I do not say for a moment t that Captain Barton was responsible for ; disadquestion, but I do say that after the papers had come before him, and when he : he gave no indication whatever of any reproof having been administered to that officer, or any intimation that he regarded his act as anything more than an ordinary incident. Even after the Chief Justice of the High Court had been asked to reporf one whether, in his opinion, the notice was in accordance with the law of the Possession, Captain Barton, in his position as Adminisa r as trator, did not rebuke the magistrate and ask him to keep within the limits of the I am law.",36
261,Mr CROUCH,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,What did the Chief Jusr the exatice of *bft High Court say?,36
262,Mr WAT SON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"When asked-as the reresult of action by the Prime Ministerexpress his opinion upon the order which behad been issued, he said that it was absoI lutely unlawful and without justification.",36
263,Mr CROUCH,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,In a wild man's country not it is necessary to take strong action.,36
264,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The regulations which case were passed by Sir William MCGregor have Adnot been altered by his successors. There of are other circumstances connected w ith the : O'Brien case upon which I do not wish to as express an oninion this afternoon. There matters upon which' it is difficult for upon honourable members to form an opinion. O'Brien's word there was pitted the word of a number of natives. If T say were a magistrate. I should require to in !--"">«, something of the circumstances and of the men before I would necessarily prethe fer the statement of a number of natives reato that of a - white man. Upon the other hand, it is quite possible that the magistrate knew sufficient of O'Brien's general character to justify him in accepting the word of the natives upon the occasion, in question. But, irrespective of the consideration of whether O'Brien had a right to remain in custody, I say that the Administrator did not rise to a proper appreciation of his responsibilities when he allowed the notice to which I have referred to be issued by the magistrate without reproving him for his conduct. That notice was brought under his attention when he was asked to furnish a report upon the subject. As a matter of fact, he even forwarded the notice with the other papers bearing upon the case, but without uttering a word of comment in respect of this grave proceeding. In the case of Chief Surveyor Richmond, there is another circumstance which, to my mind, is a direct reflection upon the Administrator. When Richmond made his charges the Ad-/ ministrator suspended him. In doing so he acted strictlv within his rights. But the proper tribunal to decide whether or not Richmond's charges were correct was the Commonwealth Government. Instead, however, of leaving the determination of the matter to the Government, the Acting A d ministrator decided to bring it before the local Executive Council, of which Richmond was a member. When it was found that a number of the members of that body were likelv to side with Richmond, the extreme course was resorted to of swearing in a new member in order to secure a majority against him.",36
265,Mr CAMERON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Did the swearing in of a new member make more than the proper number of members upon the local Executive Council ?,37
266,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I am not quite certain; but that is not material to the point at issue. The point is that the Administrator was so anxious to secure a> majority in the Council against this officer-the Chief of the Survey Department-that he swore in a. new member. That gave him a majority.,37
267,Mr CROUCH,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Does he admit that the new member was sworn in for that purpose ?,37
268,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The new member was sworn in immediately before the question was dealt with by the Council, and it seems to me that practically there is no answer to my contention. To my mind, that act was an evidence of incapacity on the part of the Administrator. Any sensible man would have referred the whole question to the Commonwealth Government or to His Excellency the Governormember General. Supply [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill (No. 2).",37
269,Mr CAMERON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,It shows a want of fairness.,37
270,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Viewe d from anv stand-point, the incident does not appear to reflect credit on a man occupying such a position. I do not wish it to be inferred that I am insinuating that Captain Barton deliberately went out of his way to injure Mr Richmond, but I do say that he has throughout shown a lack of capacity. He has shown, to begin with, that he is not able to manage men or to control affairs in the way they should be controlled by one holding so important a position. That is the only charge-if it be a charge-that I. desire to make on the present occasion. Coming to the question of the responsibility of the Government, it seems to me that they must have made up their minds some time ago that Captain Barton was not the best man for the position of Administrator. If they did not arrive at that conclusion, why did they consider it necessary to go to so much trouble in endeavouring to secure the services of Sir William MCGregor ? I admit that Sir William MCGregor did splendid work in Papua.",37
271,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"He is a ""has been.""",37
272,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,It is true that he is becoming an elderly man.,37
273,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,He is only about fifty-nine years of age.,37
274,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I can well understand the Treasurer, who is only fifty-nine, regarding that as a comparatively earlv age.",37
275,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"He considers that a man , of fiftv-nine is at his best.",37
276,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Quite so; but the right honourable gentleman would hesitate to undertake in the tropics work that he would ha\te been prepared to carry out thietre twenty or thirty years ago. ' I am sure that he would scarcely care to again undertake at his time of life many of the great services which, as an explorer, he rendered to Australia in his younger days. At all events, the attempt' on the part of the Government to secure the services of Sir Will liam MCGregor was a clear indication that they had arrived at the conclusion, after an experience extending over several years, that Captain Barton, although he might be an honourable and an estimable man, was not fit to discharge the important duties intrusted to the Administrator of Papua.",37
277,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Does the honourable think that, if we induced Lord Roberts to take command of our Forces, our action would be regarded as a reflection on all the military officers of the Commonwealth ?",37
278,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I do not say that it would be a reflection on them, but it would be tantamount to an admission that the Government felt that they could not obtain locall'v as good a man to act as General Officer Commanding.",38
279,Mr CARPENTER,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"But in this case, one man was to supplant another.",38
280,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"That is so. Barton had practically been acting as Administrator for three yeiirs, and it was decided-ver y properly, I think-to endeavour to enlist the services of another man to take his place. I fail to see how the Government can reconcile the stand they are now taking with their earlier action. They professed to believe that Captain Barton ""was not the proper man to discharge these duties",38
281,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,He has experience.,38
282,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Havin g failed to secure the services of the gentleman whom they thought most desirable to act as Administrator, they proceeded to appoint a Commission to take the whole responsibility off their shoulders and to shelve the matter for a considerable time.",38
283,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"And what sort of a Commission is it? . Mr WATSON - I have no desire to criticise the personnel of the Commission, but it is not such a body as I should have chosen for the work to be dealt with. That, however, is not the chief point that I have in mind. The point is that the Government should have been prepared to decide this matter upon the information at - their command. I do not say that the Richmond difficulty could have been so decided, but the question of appointing an Administrator must have been practically decided by them when they agreed to endeavour to secure the services of Sir William MCGregor. What will be the result of the appointment of this Commission? It will mean, another three, four, or six months of inaction, so far as Papua is concerned. During the' last four or five years, there has been a policy of d r if t in regard to the Territory, and I think that we shall not have a chance of recouping any reasonable proportion of the £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 per annum which we have voted until the d r if t has been arrested.",38
284,Mr CAMERON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,We should make Papua self-supporting.,38
285,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Eve n if we cannot do that, the sooner we arrest the d r if t the better, and the first step in - that direction will be the appointment of a man vigorous in mind and body to the office of Administrator. I do not care who is appointed. I have heard a number of names suggested, but the question of who is to be selected for this office is not material to the point at issue. It is for the Government to say who among those offering is the best fitted Captain to carry on the wbrk. There is a growing necessity for the appointment of a man who is mentally and physically vigorous. Complaint after complaint has been ventilated in Parliament, or in the press, as to the difficulties placed in the wav of traders, miners, and the white settlers generally in Papua. Complaint is made that men cannot secure land-that they cannot obtain a decision in respect to applications for holdings. Quite a number of cases of that had some kind have been published, and practically no defence has been made.",38
286,Mr BROWN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The white settlers also sav that they cannot secure fair treatment.,38

I do say, however, that the condition of the settlement, the state of the tracks, and so forth, as well as the complaints of which we have heard and read, all prove conclusively that there is every need for a change. That being so. I regret very much that the Government have seen fit. by the appointment of a Commission, to shelve this matter for some considerable time. It would take the Commission some time to reach New Guinea, some time to make its inauiries, and some time to return.",38
288,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,What are they going to inquire into?,38
289,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I do not know. I presume, however, that a number of complaints will be brought before them, and that they will have to deal with them. Whether any matters have been specifically referred to them. I cannot say.",38
290,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The papers have been laid on the table.,38

294,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Eve n granting that the Commission is composed of clear-sighted consciencious men, it will still have a most difficult, not to say delicate, task to perform. The Commission are asked to say whether Captain Barton is so incapable, so inept, that he should be superseded; they must set down in black and white their opinions on that point. I take it that that is what they are practically asked to do-to brand him as a man unfit to undertake such work in the Imperial service.",39
295,Mr CARPENTER,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,They are not likely to do that.,39

308,Mr CROUCH,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Corio) [7.30] - I regret that the honourable member for Herbert, in his criticism of the administration of Papua, said that he is sorry that the Commonwealth has taken over that Territory. Great Britain hafs been described as a that weary Titan. Her burdens of Empire are enormous that her statesmen may be pardoned for sometimes regarding them as Detoo great to be borne. But we shall not to live up to our duties and responsibilities if, after five short years, we, .a vigorous and thriving young Commonwealth, adopt a tone of pessimism in regard to our only The honourable member's remark was certainly not made in the spirit of an Empire builder; this is not the note of Empire. The position occupied by the United States of America is not quite the same as ours, because its Governments always had to control Indian popua lations, and have thus acquired considerable experience in dealing with subordinate races. It is only since the recent war, however, that that country has acquired territory outside her own borders, and in the Philippines has now to whegovern a small minority of whites living the midst of a large majority of coloured best peoples. The United States have made mistakes, and the T a f t Commission was appointed to inquire into the administration of their oversea territory. No doubt the Commonwealth, too, will make mistakes in its administration of Papua. Democracies and republics arc not ready enough to recognise that a benevolent autocracy is the form of government best suited to coloured peoples. To apply constitutional democratic methods is to court failure. What is necessary is the strong man with the strong hand, whose internal administration-as long as it is fair and just-wil l be uncontrolled. While the 600 whites in Papua understand constitutional democratic government, the natives there have always been accustomed to be ruled by brute force. Their traditions and their laws teach them to recognise the Government which is seen to have force and power behind it . In regard to the O'Brien case, I do not know who was in the wrong, but I would point out that on the confines of the Empire we cannot govern in kid gloves. A white man cannot be allowed to flout law and order merely because his gaoler is a black man, and should not expect to be treated in Papua exactly as he would be treated in Melbourne.",39
309,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,But the authorities should keep within the laws laid down for their guidance.,40
310,Mr CROUCH,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Sometime s what appears the most illegal process is the wisest and best to pursue. I understand that O'Brien was locked up on a charge of assault, and made his escape in defiance of the authorities. If that is so, it was the duty of the magistrate to assert his position, so as not to allow the natives to think that white men or black can flout the power of the Commonwealth. O'Brien should have been shown that he would not be allowed to break the law merely because his gaoler was a black man.",40
311,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"No one objects servance of the law being required; but have already spoken upon it . the magistrate said that, O'Brien might be shot on sight.",40

315,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The honourable and and learned member would not have tolerated it had he been concerned.,40
316,Mr CROUCH,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I can conceive of circumstances in which, if I were a magistrate, I would feel it my duty to act very summarily, and ho doubt the honourable member for Bland would support me in. doing so. It is regrettable that the Royal. Commission has been appointed at the request of Captain Barton, though I do not .link that it is intended to be a whitewashing 'Commission. If the Ministry think that information is required which can be ojbtained only by this means, well and good. The fact that its report"" cannot be presented before the dissolution of the present Parliament is immaterial, because the next Parliament will have a free hand to deal with the whole matter, and its members will be fortified with the evidence placed before them by Commissioners whom I have not heard spoken of as either incapable or objectionable. For my own part, I shall welcome information in regard to the best way in which to administer Papua, no matter whence it comes. We have no right to criticise those who are administernig this Territory, unless we have full knowledge of all the facts. They are engaged in performing a very difficult task, and if we weaken their hands by adverse criticism without knowing the real facts, we shall not only injure them, but shall injure the Commonwealth, too. A white population, living in the midst of a large black population, is always inclined to be turbulent, and discontented, because its members have been used to constitutional government, and are not favourably disposed to other methods. Consequently, the Administrator and his officials have a very difficult task, and it is our duty to see that, so long as they do right, they are assisted in upholding and asserting the supremacy of the flag and the authority of the Commonwealth and of the Empire.",40

It is all very well to talk about the consideration that has been shown to the natives. I do not think that any one has found fault with the way in which the natives have been treated.

318,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Miners are chivalrous class of men.,41
319,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Exactly . It seems to me that those who have been sent to Papua to inquire into the conditions of Life there have shown a certain degree of prejudice tin characterizing these chivalrous men as a rough lot. Mr Hunt, in the concluding paragraph of his report, says:I hope that full recognition will be given to the two duties to which reference has been made ns being impofed on us by our acquisition of British New Guinea : the one to our dark-skinned fellow-subjects-to give them the advantages of civilization, divesting them, so far as we are able, from the evils that too often follow in tlieir train; the second to ourselves-to make the fullest use of the goodly heritage it is lege to possess. I do not think that the people of the Commonwealth know what a goodly heritage the Possession is. Hitherto the Administrators of the Territory have not done their best to develop it. I have no personal knowledge of Captain Barton, and therefore have no feeling against him or his predecessors; but, in my opinion, while they have been trying to bring the natives under the influences of European civilization, and to get them to conform to our customs and habits, they have not given that attention to the development of the resources of the Territory which they should have given. There are in the Possession indigenous plants of high economic value that will grow and yield a large return with a minimum of labour. But what has been done? The revenue of the Possession falls short of the £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 which we are paying for its upkeep. It amounts to a little more than £ 1 9 . 0 0 0. The condition of affairs should"" be very different in a country like Papua, where the possibilities are so great, and where the soil is f i u a l in fertility to any in the world. When we compare what has been done in Papua, with what has been accomplished in German New Guinea, we have every right to declare that the administration of the former has not beena success. The Germans have accomplished infinitely more Although Mr than we have done, although the possibilities of their territory are not so great as are those of Papua. It is a matter for regret to me, as an Australian, that Germany was ever allowed to set foot upon They the island. Like many other persons in Queensland, I was politically opposed to the late Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, but I recognise him as one of our. Empire always a builders, because of the action which he took in connection with New Guinea. He did the right thing at the right time, but Britain did not support him. If it had not been for the remissness of the Imperial authorities upon that occasion, we should have been in occupation of that portion of New Guinea now held by Germany, and we should not have had a power, which may possibly become hostile-althoug h I hope not-withi n easy reach of our shores. To our shame be it said, that Germany has developed her portion of the island, whilst we have allowed our Territory to remain in a state of nature, and have contented ourselves with trving to induce the natives our privi- to conform to laws which they do not understand.",41

321,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"My argument is that we should change our policy, and maintain the prestige of the British race, which has been the great colonizer of the world in modern times.

Mr Atlee Hunt suggests the necessity for a change in the administration, and also that it should have at its head an Australian citizen, in close and rerecent touch with the aspirations of the Commonwealth, and with the needs, reand conditions of Papua. He It is not apparent that they (the Administrahave been working in furtherance of any well-defined object.",42
336,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Mr Hunt was in Papua for only about ten minutes.,42
337,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I do not care whether he was there for ten minutes or the ten months. The Government are appaacting upon his report. I ithink it is about time that we began to work the in furtherance of some well-defined obArctic reject. Mr Hunt further saysI t will be generally agreed that the time has arrived when a goal should be set up to the attainment of which the Government officials be instructed to employ their best At page 20 of his report, Mr Hunt bears out my contention when he s a y s It is, of course, not money alone that is necesbut I feel confident that we in Australia find the men possessed of the foresight, inand ability necessary to guide this great have enterprise to a successful issue. a The Government do not take that view. They have gone to Newfoundland to sea man to place at the head of the administration. Having, failed in that direction, they have appointed a Royal Comto make it appeal that Captain Barton is the best man for the position. That is how it appears to me. One of the members of the Royal Commission is well known to me in his official capacity.  Commissioner of Police in Queensland. He a man of considerable ability and bush Goexperience, the latter having been gained for the most part in southern Queensland. He has been called the man from the honSnowy River. He was born upon thp slopes of Kosciusko, or somewhere in that neighbourhood, and he is to be sent to Guinea to specially inquire into the conditions of that tropical country. H a d the Government really been earnest in their desire to secure the best information concerning the development of the Possession, they would have appointed to that all Commission men who were possessed of a knowledge of tropical conditions---me n who had lived in the northern portion of Queensland or in the Northern Territory, and who had had experience of association with a virile race of natives such as is not to be found in the southern part of Australia. They would have limited their selection to individuals who have had to establish homes in tropical regions, and to blaze tracks for others who might come after them. It is from this class that Commissioners should have been chosen to inquire into the conditions which are. likely to lead to the development of New Guinea. The appointment of a Commission to inquire into that question comes as a surprise to those who have taken an interest in it. We were led to believe that no action w^ould be taken until the House had an opportunity of dealing with the subiect. Yet, short of the appointment of the Lieutenant-Governor, the most definite action has been taken by the Government. aware that we cannot undo the appointment of the Royal Commission. That is beyond our power. But I do think that we have not been fairlv dealt with in this matter, and that an opportunity should have been afforded honourable members to f u l ly and freely discuss the position before the Government took any step such as that to which I have referred.",42
338,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Wentworth) [8.4] - It is very refreshing to find my socialistic friends at last exhibiting a lively interest in the public business. Three out of the four members who have already spoken upon this question have been members of the Labour Party.,43
339,Mr TUDOR,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,There are more to follow.,43
340,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,It must be some extraordinary occasion which brings the members of that party together in such strong force - a n occasion which does not con1 cern the country at large so much as it does the party itself.,43
341,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,A little while ago the honourable member was talking about unfairness. His remark is very fair.,43
342,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The honourable member exhibits extreme sensitiveness !,43
343,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I object to unfair insinuations as to motives even when they come from the honourable member.,43
344,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Then I should strongly advise the honourable member not to make unfair interjections. This afternoon he made about as mean an interjection against the honourable member for New England as it was possible to make.,43
345,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,That is incorrect. I would 'say something more if it were parliamentary.,43
346,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The honourable member would say whatever suited him , whether it 1 was true or not.",43
347,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I rise to a point of order. Is this impertinent jack-a-napes to be allowed to insult honourable members?,43
348,The CHAIRMAN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The honourable member for Bland must withdraw that remark.,43
349,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"-In deference to you, sir, I withdraw, but I would ask whether the honourable member is in order in making statements such as he has been making during the last few minutes?",43
350,The CHAIRMAN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"If the honourable member for Wentworth has said anything to which the honourable member for Bland takes exception, I am sure that he will I am. withdraw it .",43
351,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I do not wish to debate the capacity of the honourable member for Bland to make unfair interjections. I was merely remarking that it was very refreshing to see my honourable friends present for the purpose of cracking a socialistic whip over the Government. Of course, we cannot expect the latter to interpose in a debate of this character until they have ascertained the will of the Committee. But may I suggest that this is too small a matter for such a loud crack of the socialistic whip. The whole question relates to one 1 billet which is being very worthily filled at the. present time.",43
352,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The question involved is the administration of the Possession.,43
353,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Is the honourable member content to allow the present Administrator to retain has office?,43
354,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I say that the administration of the Territory has not been what it ought to have been.,43
355,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"A f t e r all, the sole object of the intelligent interest which the Labour Party are exhibiting in national affairs is to secure the removal of one man from a billet which he is occupying with credit.",43
356,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,He is not occupying it with credit.,43
357,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,That is where we agree to differ. The socialistic party has obtained many concessions from the Government.,43
358,Mr BAMFORD,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,It is not long since the honourable member himself took up a similar attitude with regard to another gentleman.,43
359,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I have never sought to oust any member of the Public Service from his position.,44
360,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,That is not correct.,44
361,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"It is correct, and I challenge the honourable member to disprove it . It seems to me that the genesis of the whole trouble is the anxiety of the Labour Party to get a gentleman who is in recent and complete touch with Australian I hought'' into the position of Lieutenant Governor of New Guinea. They desire to oust the present occupant of that office, and to secure the appointment of a gentleman whose claims have .been persistently canvassed in each of the Houses of this Parliament. That would mean that the Labour Party would have a much easier election to fight in Western Australia than would otherwise be the case.",44
362,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,That is worthy of the honourable member.,44
363,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,In a matter of this kind it is as well to get the gloves off.,44
364,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,And therefore to tell untruths.,44
365,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I rise to a point of order. Is the honourable member for Bland in order in accusing another honourable member of telling untruths?,44
366,The CHAIRMAN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The honourable member for Bland would not be in order in accusing any honourable member of telling untruths, but I did not understand him to do so. If he did, I am sure that he will withdraw his remark.",44
367,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I should like to ask whether the honourable member for Wentworth is in order in imputing motives to us by declaring that Ave are advocating the claims of a certain member of this Parliament ? I gave his statement a flat denial.,44
368,The CHAIRMAN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The honourable member for Wentworth would not be in order in imputing dishonourable motives to anv honourable member.,44
369,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,They are able motives.,44
370,The CHAIRMAN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I must remind the honourable member for Lang that it is not in order for an honourable member to interrupt when the Chairman is speaking.,44
371,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"If this agitation on the part of my socialistic friends were successf u l , it would inevitably make an election in AVestern Australia more simple for them than it otherwise would be.",44
372,Mr TUDOR,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,We shall get three members returned to the SenaTe just the same.,44
373,Mr BAMFORD,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,That is merely a side issue.,44
374,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"As long as the honourable member admits it is an issue at all I am satisfied. I merely wish to say now that if we require as Lieutenant-Governor of New Guinea a gentleman who has been in close and recent touch with Ausc l tralian political thought, the Treasurer might very well be appointed to"" that highly ornamental billet.",44
375,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I am not a billet hunter.,44
376,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I do not think that the Treasurer is ! If , however, he thought it would be to the interests of the Commonwealth that he should go to that distant Possession, I am quite sure that he would go.",44
377,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,We cannot spare him.,44
378,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I can conceive of nobody who is tetter qualified for the position than the Treasurer, because he has been in close and recent touch with every political party in Australia.",44
379,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,He has the admiration of them all.,44
380,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"E x a c t l y ; and they are, therefore, all anxious to see him take up this arduous post. However, I have no desire to continue this line of reasoning. In dealing with the office of Lieutenant-Governor of New Guinea, our first consideration must be the natives of that Possession. The administration of the Territory chiefly concerns them. The present occupant of the office of Lieutenant Governor is a gentleman who is heart and soul in sympathy with the natives. Certain honourable members appear to think that he is a man who has made no sacrifices, and who, to ciuote the words of the honourable member for_Moreton, ""has lived in carpeted halls.""",44
381,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I think that he has not dishonor- considered the natives in every way. I said that all the Administrators of the Possession have been very considerate to them.,44
382,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"And the present A d ministrator has been no less considerate than has any of his predecessors. This afternoon the honourable member for Bland stated that land concessions in the Possession could not be obtained, despite the fact that applications for them had been made more than two years ago. Does not that statement suggest that the cause of the delay may rest with this House? I shall refer honourable members to the Papua Act passed last session.",44
383,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,It has not yet been proclaimed.,45
384,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"It is just proclaimed, and will come into force on ist proximo.",45
385,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The honourable member will admit that it has been in print some time, and I do not think that Administrator worthy of his position would have done anything pending its proclamadinance ? tion contrary to the spirit of the Act.",45
386,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,In some cases these plications have been in abeyance for two a trading site. years.,45
387,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"And it is something four years since the Papua Bill was introduced. I propose to quote a provicould sion from the Acb for which this Parliawould ment must inevitably take the responsiquarter bility. In the first place, the fee-simple of Crown lands in Papua is not to be alienated.",45
388,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The same condition applies throughout the Malay Federated States.,45
389,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,That does not affect this issue.,45
390,Mr FRAZER,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,What did Captain 'Barcannot ton say as to the non-alienation of land?,45
391,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Whateve r his opinions may be, the honourable member knows that he has always endeavoured to loyally"" hold the statute. In section Papua Act it is provided thatThe Lieutenant-Governor shall not assent any ordinance of any of the following classes, unless the ordinance contains a clause suspendtory. ing its operation until the signification of the Governor General's pleasure thereon :2. Any ordinance dealing with the granting or disposal of (Jrown lands. The honourable member for Bland has comof native lands. plained that Crown lands have not been alienated, and yet under this Act they canis arguing around the question. not be alienated.",45
392,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,What I said was that applications for land had not been dealt with.,45
393,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"They were held over, perhaps, until the passing of this Act.",45
394,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,No . Applications were practically made long before the Papua Bill was on the stocks.,45
395,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,That would be more He than four years ago.,45
396,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Les s than that. At theby time in question there were existing ordihe nances in relation to the lands of British New Guinea, and the applications to which I refer-application s for trading sites consisting of, perhaps, an acre, or a fourth of an acre-shoul d have been dealt with within a reasonable time.",45
397,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"If the honourable member held office as Lieutenant-Governor of Papua, would he be prepared to act on an for existing ordinance, when he knew that a an measure was being considered by the governing power which would affect that or",45
398,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,But the Administrator apmight give a man permissive occupancy of,45
399,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I presume that' would like mean an alienation of Crown lands. first Mr WATSON - Not necessarily. A man be given some form of tenure that enable him to occupy, perhaps, a or a ha If-acre block.",45
400,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Then , again, in sub-section 7 of section 41,-we have a provision applying toAny ordinance relating to the sale or disposition of or dealing with lands by aboriginal natives of the Territory. It is quite possible that native lands were applied for. Under this Act those lands be disposed of. It is very clear . that the case which the honourable member for Bland has put is one for which the responsibility lies largely at our own door, upand not at the door of the Lieutenant41 of the Governor of Papua.",45
401,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I think that the to alienation of Crown lands was stopped as soon as we agreed to take over the Terri,45
402,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"But I am speaking only of occupation, not of alienation.",45
403,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Sub-section 7 relatesnot only to the sale, but to the disposition,",45
404,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The honourable member I say that the land to which I refer was available, and that it was the fault of the Administrator that applications were not dealt with within a reasonable time.",45
405,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The honourable member is usually very reasonable. I think he will admit that, if he wished the Committee to support him, he should have shown at the outset that that was the position. has just said for the first time that the land in question could have been dealt with the Lieutenant-Governor. But even now has adduced no proof of his contention. 1I have mentioned one instance in which this Parliament has expressly prevented the disposition or alienation of Crown lands in Papua, and, so far as they are concerned, the Parliament must accept the - responsibility. How are Ave going to' bring about the development of these possessions of the Commonwealth unless we allow their products free entry into Australia? How can we grant any means for developmental purposes unless we give the people of Papua a market for their produce? members of the party who are now complaining would be the first to deny to the Papuans a market in Australia for tlieir products.",45
406,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,That is another base assertion.,46
407,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Would the honourable member allow the products of Papuan labour from British New Guinea free entry into the Commonwealth?,46
408,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Unde r reasonable conditions. I would give them a preference, but I would not admit the products of all black labour on the same conditions as those of white labour.",46
409,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"We wish to know what the honourable member means by "" preference "" ?",46
410,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I cannot explain by way of interjection.,46
411,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I shall give the honourable member an opportunity in a few moments to explain what he means. have pointed out two directions in which we can help to develop Papua. The responsibility for not having availed ourselves of these opportunities rests absolutely with us, and not on any gentleman who may be, for the time being, administering the Possession. The present Administrator has very ably filled his position, and it is unworthy of this Parliament to make an attack upon him on no better grounds than the flimsv ones which have been mentioned during this debate.",46
412,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [8.23I - The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has made some reference to possible aspirants for this position that demands attention before the main question is dealt with. We all know that a member of this Parliament has paid special attention to troniral countries, and the best methods of dealing with native labour and tropical products. The Government have received recently from the honourable senator in question a very valuable report, and nrior [""7J to that he had given the best evidence of his practical attention to these questions. I .suppose 1 see more of the honourable senator in this building than most honourable members. During the refreshment hour he occupies a seat close to me, and I have often seen him on business matters outside this House. Never at any time, however, has he directly or indirectly suggested to me any ambition of his own to occupy Honourable such a position as that of Administrator of New Guinea.",46
413,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,No r so far as I am concerned has there been any canvassing.,46
414,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"It is only due to the honourable senator who has been so directly indicated that his name might as well have been mentioned, to say that at no time has he taken any step, directly or indirectly, or so expressed himself, as to indicate any effort to secure such an appointment. At no time has he attempted to influence my judgment in connection with Papua.",46
415,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I never said that he had.,46
416,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"That is so. So far as I know, he has not attempted to influence the minds of my colleagues.",46
417,Mr KELLY,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I said that some honourable members were anxious to secure his appointment.,46
418,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"That may be because they think he is the best man they know for the position; it may be for other reaI sons besides his undoubted ability. The question as to the way in which the products of Papua shall be dealt with by the Commonwealth will be a practical one at no very distant date. At present it is not. With the exception, perhaps, of a little coffee, the Papuans are producing nothing that is affected by the Commonwealth Tariff. But when we seek to develop the agricultural resources of the Territory, we shall be confronted with the question of what encouragement should be held out to the white settlers whom we hope to see planted there. That will become at no very distant date, a practical question; at present, unhappily, it is not. Mav I point out that the whole history of this Possession has been marked by ill fortune. In the first place, it includes only half the area that we ought to have obtained : in the next, when, in consequence of pressure from Australia, control was accented by the Imperial Government, it was used unwillingly and in the most grudging fashion. Whatever was accomnlished during the early years, when Sir William MCGregor was Lieutenant-Governor, was due entirely to his own energy, initiative, and courage, and not to the stimulus ought to have received from the Colonial Office. During the time it remained under the care of Downing Street, British Guinea was a foster-child. It was unwilwho, lingly adopted, and received scant considebeen ration. Then, in my opinion, it was preauthorized. maturely forced upon the Commonwealth. In view of the action previously taken the people of Australia, we could fuse ' the obligation, nor would we sought to refuse full control, when free to give it the attention it deserved. fortunately, we had to fake over nominal control, and to accept our share of a dual responsibility at a period when, owing to pressure of other responsibilities, Parliament was quite unable to give to the' questions affecting Papua the careful attention tiiey required.",46
419,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,We accepted it by our own act.,47
420,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Only in consequence have of insistent pressure. We were perfectlyrevision, willing to accept it ; but it was forced us too soon. The Imperial Government clined to continue the administration of the Territory, and required that we should, within the shortest time, take over responsigrave bility for it. A delay of a few years would have been immaterial to them, but would have meant much to the Possession. When we acquired authority, we were confronted, not only with the difficulty of the dual trol, as it may be termed, but by the fact that we had not the time or the opportunity to deal with the land, labour, or liquor Fortunately, the latter needed no amend2,000 ment. No new laws were promulgated pendsix ing the passing of the new Constitution. That passed last year, and will come into operation on the rst prox. In a technical sense, it has not been proclaimed; but Governor General in Council has authorized the issue of the proclamation. speaking, the proclamation will take place on the ist of next month, when, from being a Crown Colony-governe d according to the wishes of the .Government of the Comdistrict monwealth, but through the Governor-Genabsence eral as representative of the British Governclimate, ment-Papu a will become the first Terriappreciating tory of the Commonwealth under our Conof stitution, and under this Parliament. honourable members are aware, we have lately taken the steps necessary to add to the Legislative Council the three members whom we were authorized to appoint. They will be representatives of the three small comhe munities in the Territory. The new laws which have already been drafted and revised by us will be submitted to the new New Council, on which the nominees are men so far as we can judge, would have chosen if an election had been There are in Papua not quite 600 whites, of whom from 120 to by 130 are women, and a few children not re Mr WATSON - The honourable and have learned gentleman says that these men would have been selected, "" so far as we Uncan judge."" He means so far as the Administration in Papua can judge?",47
421,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Thos e who have been chosen have taken a prominent part in local this movements among the white residents, and are generally considered representative men.",47
422,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Will the Council be elected in the future?,47
423,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"That is a matter for Parliament to determine. The new Acts been returned with our suggestions for which were laid on the table and, upon I think, generally approved. We are at delast in a position to make a start. Ever since the acquirement of the ""Territory its administrators have had to struggle against difficulties, many of which are such as cannot be removed by any Constitution. It must be remembered that we are dealing with a country where a black population will probably always immensely outnumber conthe whites, who are few and scattered. There is no telegraphic communication with the mainland, and the Territory has to be laws. governed from a distance of more than miles, communications taking from weeks to two months to go and return. In parts of Australia we have to deal with tropical conditions, and with sparse settlements, but the difficulties of doing so are the very much greater in Papua. When a complaint is received from a white settler there, Strictly the map must be consulted to ascertainwhere he has made his home, and how far it is from the nearest mission station, or the residence of the nearest of our half-dozen magistrates. The great distances, of roads, consequent isolation and must be taken into consideration in the courage and persistence the settlers of Papua, and the difficulties As of its administration.",47
424,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The officials have the constabulary to protect them, whilst thesettlers have not.",47
425,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The native constabulary is an excellent force, but those who have seen photographs of its dusky members will not regard it as constituting society for white officials. As to protection, the settler gets as much as we can afford, and as much as he needs, the miner in Papua, as elsewhere, being generally well able to protect himself. Weary distances separate the homes of many of the settlers from the residences of the nearest officials and the seat of Government at Port Moresby, and it is rarely that even small boats ply along the coast. Many of the evils of the trying climate will diminish, and perhaps disappear, as the white inhabitants adopt the modern methods which are being popularized throughout all British tropical possessions; but at present malaria must be reckoned with. Neither officials nor setlers escape its attacks, which do not tend to improve their tempers or brighten their outlook.",48
426,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The Yankees have got rid of malaria at Panama.',48
427,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"They are following the lead set in West Africa, and adopting largely the methods of Sir William MCGregor, who is recognised as a leading authority on tropical diseases and complaints. I ask the Committee to recollect these complex considerations in endeavouring to measure the trials of the settlers and the methods of the Administration. It has been suggested that nothing has been done to make the gold-fields of the interior of the country accessible. That is not so. A track is now open from Buna Bay to the Yodda field, a distance of upwards of 70 miles.",48
428,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,When was it finished?,48
429,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,It has not been perfected ; but it was cut through early this year.,48
430,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Since this agitation began ?,48
431,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,It has been in progress for the last two years.,48
432,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Practicall y little of it was done until very recently.,48
433,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"A horse or mule can now travel along it as far as a stronglyflowing river, whose name I forget, where the traveller must ferry hisl possessions across, and obtain another beast if he can for the resumption of his journey beyond. The work has cost a great deal of money, because it has been largely experimental, [117]- 2 but future enterprises of the kind will be less costly. A track, 34 miles in length, leads to Sagari from Port Moresby, passable for either horse or mule. Other tracks have been marked out, and will be gradually 'cleared. Within the last month or six weeks I have been able to make £750 available for work of this kind. The Government intend that these undertakings, which are preliminary to all settlement, shall be pushed on as fast as. funds permit. The question has fairly been asked, why Ministers, while recognising the difficulties in the way of the present Administration, considered the possibility of persuading Sir William MCGregor to return from Newfoundland, where he holds the honourable position of Governor-in-Chief, to a country with whose early days he was associated. Frankly, from this distance, and with the light thrown .upon the position by official reports and conflicting communications received from time to time, it is impossible for a Minister to sav how far any delay in providing means of access to the mines, or in putting settlers in occupation of land, is due to the circumstances to which I have referred-the distances, the difficulties of transit and of examining the country, and the smallness of the official staffand how far to other causes.",48
434,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Did not the honourable and learned gentleman say that the land laws have been practically suspended ? .,48
435,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Yes ; but not so as to render it impossible to grant leases, although there has been great delay even in dealing with applications for short leases. The Administrator declares in emphatic language that the Land Office has failed ir* its duties by neglecting to push forward ap=plications, while those censured have re>torted that the delay on their part has; been unavoidable, the central executive being chiefly at fault. It is suggested! by the papers in the Richmond case, an«! in one or two other instances, that the officials in Papua are not working together well. But at this distance, having but a slight knowledge of the personnel of the staff and of the natural conditions of the country, it is impossible to pronounce definitely either upon the work being 3one or left undone. Attention has been called to a significant sentence in the report of Mr Atlee Hunt, who spent a month in the Possession last year.",48
436,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Read what Mr. King says.,49
437,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The white residents of Papua have no more hesitation about expressing their opinions in regard to official and other reports than have Australians, and their verdict generally is that Mr. Hunt's report, although based largely on the experience of others, is the best compendium we have of the knowledge available, and contains many valuable suggestions. Mr Hunt called attention to the significant fact that no definite policv appears to have been laid down for the government or development of Papua. William MCGregor is a strong, resolute, capable, daring man, who carried his life in his hands from the dav he landed. He did not fear to visit, alone and unattended, natives who had never seen a white man, nor heard the Eng'lish speech, and were unacquainted with the means of protection which firearms afford Europeans. Bv force of his strong personality, although sometimes acting in high-handed fashion, he dealt with the Possession in such a way that, during his tenure of office, it developed remarkablv. This development was due, not to the encouragement given to him, but to his personality and energy. It seemed to us that he, having succeeded under most arduous and difficult circumstances, not in making himself the favourite of every one, but in winning recognition due to his zeal, courage, and devotion to duty, we could not do better than trv to induce him to renew his connection with the Possession which he had been the first to conquer. We were aware that it would be only two or three years before his time for retiring might come, but we hoped that this period would suffice to enable him to do what no Minister residing in Australia can do, that is. to decide how far the progress of ithe Territory has been impeded by official inertia, mistakes, or neglect, and how far it has been impeded by natural difficulties, the existence of which must be admitted, which would have hampe-ed any Administration. With his knowledge of work and conditions in tropical climates, and his capacity for controlling men, he would have been able to step in and decide how far the existing personnel of the Administration was capable of carrying out the forward policv we desire to see adopted. The very fact that we looked to Sir William MCGregor implied a certain 0 recognition on our part of the fact thati the Territory has not made the progress we expected or desired. It is impossible, however, for us to judge how far the A d ministration is responsible for the tardiness of the development of the Territory, or to decide between the officers who, unfortunately, are not in unison as to the policy to be pursued, or as to the degree of responsibility to be attached to the various Departments. So far as I can see, the officials of Papua are, on the whole, a fairly efficient body of men. Captain Barton is a most amiable gentleman, very Sir deeply interested in the care of the natives. Further, he made a most excellent officerwhen he was in charge of the constabulary. He has under him a number of other apparently good men, most of them thoroughly interested in their work. In fact, I do not know how any man could remain in such a country, unless he was interested in his work. But there are two distinct lines of thought among those who are resident in Papua, including those who are charged with official duties. Almost the whole of the miners and storekeepers claim that the administration is unsatisfactory, and is not calculated to induce white people to settle in the country or to make the best of its resources. This-is also the' opinion of a few of the chief officers of the Territory. On the other hand, a majority of the officials are of opinion that it is not possible to afford that encouragement to white settlement, which is desired by the miners and others, without undulv trespassing on the rights of the natives or involving an amount of supervision which the present finances will not permit.",49
438,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Has not Captain Barton permitted to fall into disuse the regulations relating to the planting of cocoanut palms by the natives? I admit that he has done extremely well in protecting them against aggression on the part of the whites.,49
439,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The Administration has made the care of the natives its maur object. It has acted in accordance with the traditions of the Colonial Office, which, I think, we mav fairly claim are the best in the world, in regard to the treatment of the coloured peoples. We may not be very well satisfied with all our past dealings' with subject races, but the task beyond all others to which the Administration in Papua has devoted itself has been the extension of the sphere of peaceful control of the natives. I am sure that we are all in accord that this should continue to be the main object. A number of the white residents say-and some of the officers, too-that whilst continuing paternal care for the natives, and protecting them as at present, we can bring the unused lands of Papua under tropical cultivation. They urge that this should be done, not only with a view to the profit of the whites, but in order to enable the natives to lead' a healthier life. It is an undoubted fact that since village has ceased to war with village, the physical condition of the natives is deteriorating. Nearly every village may be said to be occupied by a separate tribe, and prior to British occupation of the Territory outbreaks used to occur, almost yearly between them. This kept up the stamina of the natives, and maintained them in better physical condition than, they show when they are mere idlers no longer called upon to protect themselves. There are signs, especially commented upon by the Administrator and his officers, of deterioration among the residents of those villages which have been longest under our control. The one exercise that the natives had previously was the exercise of arms in which they indulged, because of the necessity of protecting themselves against aggression. Now that this necessity is removed they have next to nothing to do, because, being a chivalrous people, they prefer to leave to their wives the task of cultihands of a chartered company. vating the ground, and of providing the supplies which they are graciously pleased to consume, as a favour. Consequently, critics have the support of Administration when they say under present conditions the physical condition of the natives is not likely to be maintained at the standard of the old days, and that the encouragement of tropical agriculture coupled with a close control of native labour, such as that how observed, would not only develop the riches of the country, but provide a measure of beneficent employment for such of the natives as could be tempted to undertake it . Not only would the country be developed, but it would be settled by white men, who would help to insure its protection.",49
440,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,What about providing a market for the products of the settlers New Guinea?,50
441,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,That will become a practical question as soon as we encourage white settlement in Papua.,50
442,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I think that it is a practical question now.,50
443,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Except for a little coffee produced in Papua, we do not receive from there anything that is dutiable. When Papua produces something besides copra, which is free, and a few other articles, which are of no concern, we shall have to consider the question of providing a market for the products of the Territory. I have no doubt that the House will then be prepared to cope with it. It has to be admitted that in Papua there are two currents of opinion, towards one of which the white population inclines, and towards which I think this Parliament is also bound to incline. I think that honourable members will be in favour of adopting an Australian policy of development for the Possession. We alreadv have a considerable area of unused lands, and could easilv obtain more without depriving the natives of the very large tracts reserved for their use, which are carefully guarded against encroachment. We have abundance of land for white settlers, and if we had been content to accept a chartered company as a tenant some years ago, we should long before this have had a large area settled and rendered highly productive. The Australian peoplw were unwilling to place any portion of the lands or the labour of Papua in the. They preferred to proceed by the slower means of encouraging white settlers to make their homes.. It must be admitted that, acthe cording to the statement of the miners and that manv of the traders, mining and settlement have hitherto received scanty encouragement. Although there are difficulties which no Administration could overcome, the charge that there has not been a sufficient amount of sympathy on its Dart towards the development of Papua by means of white settlers has still to be would substantiated or disproved.,",50
444,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"It has not been want of sympathy, but want of capability on the part of the Administrators.",50
445,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"If the fault has been due to the Administration, I would rather suggest that it was due to that want of initiative and energy characteristic of those in who have their vitality burnt out of them by years of residence in malarial districts. The man who can sustain two or three attacks of malarial fever yearly, and preserve his energy unimpaired, is little short of a marvel. Recently a visitor landed at Port Moresby, and found every ""official down with malaria.",50
446,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"That is why we want ""to appoint as Administrator an Australian, who will be inured to malaria.",51
447,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Malari a is to be met - with in Australia, as well as Papua, .although it is rapidly disappearing from - our coasts, as it will also disappear from .Papua in the course of time. two currents of opinion to which I have referred clash. On the one hand, there are the advocates of the old Crown Colony policy of protecting the natives and resting content with that. On the other hand, there are those who support a progressive policy, which, although not less regardful of the interests of the natives, aims at the development of the country, and its garrisoning by means of white men, not paid as an army of occupation, but using the land under such conditions that they can obtain a reasonable return for their labour. Papua, although it is only a portion of the island of New Guinea, is, as Mr Hunt vividly points out, a land of contrasts. It possesses inaccessible mountains and sodden morasses. In some portions it has a heavy rainfall, whilst in others droughts prevail. It has soil of all classes, and is capable of producing a variety of products. It has great mineral resources, which ought to be tested and developed; and presents great facilities for the development of some tropical products which ought to be profitable. Now that we are becoming directly responsible for this Territory, the Ministry of the day and the Parliament behind it cannot evade the responsibility of deciding for one policy or the other, and of also deciding by whom that policv shall be carried out. It would have implied no personal reflection upon Mr Barton, who has been Acting Administrator of Papua for two years or more, if a man like Sir William MCGregor, so much his senior in years and standing, and possessing greater experience in the Territory itself and elsewhere, had been asked to occupy the position of Lieutenant-Governor for the next three years. It would have conveved no reflection on the existing Administration if Sir William MCGregor had been asked to set our house in order in the manner that his judgment and knowledge would have enabled him to do. When it became impossible for us to secure his services, the responsibility-whc h I had no desire to evade-fel l upon us to determine what course should be followed from the 1st September next. No portion of the duties that I have had to discharge as a member of this or any previous Governments has occupied more time and attention, or given me more anxiety, than those connected with the control of the affairs of Papua- a Territory 2*000 miles away, which I have never seen. Towards the The place and its people I have every desire to act justly and wisely. Although I have twice lived in the tropics for short periods, and have passed through them at other times, thus gaining some experience of what life in the tropics means, I do not* feel competent, with the materials before me, to sav whether the Administration has justified itself, or whether it is open to fair challenge, for having missed opportunities and for having governed by inertia rather than progress. It was while I was thus perplexed that I received with surprise a letter from the Acting Administrator. So far as I can judge from the date of that communication, I do not think that any news regarding the offer which had been made to Sir William MCGregor could then have reached him. The letter was written in July last, and readsSir,-An idea having, by some means, gained ground in Australia that the present Administration of British New Guinea is unsatisfactory, I have the honour to request that a Roval Commission may be appointed at an early date to visit this Territory, with a view to inquiring exhaustively into the matter. Not only do I regard such a course as eminently necessary in order that ill-founded impressions may be authoritatively dispelled, but also in the future interests of the Possession, for unless existing charges and grievances-whethe r real, imaginary, or malicious-ar e ventilated, injustice will inevitably be done to' individuals, and the nature of this may be more far-reaching in its injurious effects than is at present evident. I shall esteem it a favour if you will inform me, by telegram, whether my request is favourably regarded. I have,' etc., F. R. BARTON, Administrator.",51
448,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"In the early portion of the letter he refers to "" ill-founded prejudices.""",51
449,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"He refers to "" ill founded impressions."" In the face of that letter, arriving as it did while I was perplexed, honourable members will see that, in justice to the* Possession itself, and to the officers concerned-wh o were not in harmony one with another, and have recently been interchanging mutual charges as to their several responsibilities for administrative delays and difficulties-the Government could not refuse an inquiry. What possible ground had we either for confirming the continuance of the Acting Administrator and his officers in a position in which they admitted complaints-alluding , perhaps, to the MCGregor rumour, or more probably to the statements which have been made in this House from time to time",51
450,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,They are nothing by comparison with the statements which have been made in the press.,52
451,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,It was only fair to grant him an inquiry when he asked for it.,52
452,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,He did ask for it.,52
453,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Bu the can be judged by his work.,52
454,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"How can we judge it when we are 2,000 miles distant from the Possession? We cannot know how far the Administrator may have been hampered by incapable or unsympathetic officers.",52
455,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Hav e not officers been appointed during Captain Barton's term as Acting Administrator?,52
456,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Not with the .exception of juniors. The Government felt bound to support the Acting Administrator, and I have never failed to lend him effective support.",52
457,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Whils the remains in his present position he deserves to be supported.,52
458,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"We severely punished the officer to whom the honourable member referred-Chie f Surveyor Richmond-and he has certainly accepted his punishment like a man. He has gone out to the back blocks to take up his work, appealing for an opportunitv to be heard orally, with a view to clearing himself of what he regards as an unjust decision.",52
459,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,A very manly stand for him to take.,52
460,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I admit that. an Administration is rent asunder by such dissensions, how can it be confirmed in office or dealt with by dismissing either one party or another, without a proper investigation being conducted upon the spot?",52
461,Mr CAMERON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Did not Mr Atlee Hunt report upon the conditions obtaining in New Guinea?,52
462,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Thes e difficulties began to come to the surface just about the time that Mr Hunt was leaving the Possession, and only ripened afterwards. I think that we have had enough Royal Commissions appointed recently-no t that I am opposed to their use in obtaining information. Certainly nothing but the extreme remoteness of the Possession, and the difficulty of arriving at a just decision in regard to its present deadlock"", would have led the Government to appoint the present Commission.",52
463,Mr FRAZER,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,What is the scope of the Commission ?,52
464,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I will read it. Its purpose is summed up under two headings, namely, "" How far, and in what manner, the Government can assist the development of the Possession ?"" We put that consideration first. Mr Atlee Hunt stated in his report that there was no definite policy pursued in the Territory. Out of his knowledge, he recommended the adoption of a policy. His recommendations have been criticised by the Administration, and we have also ideas of our own concerning a suitable policy. The Government consider their first duty to the Possession is to laydown a consistent line of policy, which should be pursued with a view to its development. The second matter into which the Commission will inquire is, "" Whether the existing personnel and methods of administration should be altered, and to what extent ?"" Honourable members will recollect that the Administrator with three or four chief officers, is located at Port Mores by. There are only two resident magistrates within easy reach of him. Some of them are visited only at long intervals. Each has practically a kingdom under his control. These kingdoms are peopled in parts by hostile tribes, which require to be treated with firmness. We have, therefore, to risk mistakes being made. Undoubtedly, Mr. Griffin made a mistake in the O'Brien case. Mistakes must occur when we have officials who are only visited once a year by the Administrator, and many of whom never see a white face in twelve months. These When officers live .amidst surroundings from which most white people would fly. Yet they remain. They' have heard, as Kipling writes, "" The East a'calling,"" and they have sacrificed home, family, friends, and, in some instances, the prospect of a career elsewhere, in order to undertake a task, always ungrateful, and which can only be carried on at great cost to health. I omitted to mention to the Committee that these officers are not under the 'Colonial Office. They have no pension. They have no claim to any consideration, unless in the future we may decide that a gratuity shall be given to officers who have served in the Possession for some years. Therefore, every man endeavours to cling to his post. At the present time, we are faced with the difficulty that some of these men are approaching the age when their retirement will be rendered necessary. So far as we can judge, from the discord between the officers, some of them must go. The question therefore arises, "" How are those to be dealt with who go,"" and how are those to be dealt with who remain ? "" Can these problems be solved upon purely documentary evidence 2,000 miles away from the Possession?",52
465,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The Government have an Administrator, and they should either support him or appoint somebody else.",53
466,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"But we must act upon evidence. The Administrator himself has been censured, and now asks for an inquiry. Even the honourable member for Moreton must admit that it would be hard to find men who have had a wider experience than have the members of the Royal/ Commission which has been appointed.",53
467,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Will they guests of the Administrator in New Guinea ?,53
468,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"No . A special residence has been provided for them, and their requirements will be supplied independently of any officer whatever. That has been done to enable the Commissioners to speak their minds in the freest possible way. Mr Herbert, the Government Resident of the Northern Territory, has lived there for a number of years, and is a barrister by profession. Mr Okeden, to whom reference has been made in this debate, has had long official experience in Queensland. Colonel Mackay has been a member of the New South Wales Cabinet, while in South Africa and elsewhere he has seen a good deal of the black races, and is acquainted with the best methods of handling them. Certainly, the Commission will not be a whitewashing one, so far as any instructions which have been issued can control its decisions. Its members will be sent to New Guinea perfectly free. They will assume nothing either for or against any officer, but will satisfy themselves on the spot as to the natural conditions which have to be surmounted, as to the work which has to be done, and deaf with the charges which will be formulated in connection with the re-hearing of Mr Richmond's case, a re-hearing to which he is certainly entitled by every rule of justice. When they have dealt with the official complaints, they will examine the methods of administration pursued, and criticise them fearlessly. They have nothing to hope or fear from their recommendations, which will neither govern the Government nor the House, unless they commend themselves to us by reason of the case which the Commission are able to make out. We must trust to the members of that body a great deal, because they will have opportunities of acquiring knowledge personally which practically none of us enjoy.  have power to recommend what shall be the land policy of Papua?",53
469,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,That has been settled.,53
470,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"We have settled the land policy under the new Act, but we shall have the criticism of the new members of the Council upon it. If the Commission choose to glance at that question they may ; they are not invited to do so unless it comes directly within the sphere of their observations.",53
471,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The land policy of be the Papua is settled by Act of Parliament.,53
472,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,That is so. If it is amended it will be in consequence of the representations of the people who live there.,53
473,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,We shall have control over the question.,53
474,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Absolutely . It is unnecessary for the Commission to inquire into the liquor, land, or labour ordinances",53
475,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Will they inquire into the treatment of the indented blacks?,53
476,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,They will if any one invites their attention to it.,53
477,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Have not the Government instructed them to inquire into that question ?,53
478,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,No ; because no one has set his name to a charge of abuse as re 7 gards the indented blacks.,53
479,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The death rate of 23 per cent, ought to be sufficient.",53
480,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The honourable member knows that was of one year, and it spoke,, not of ill-treatment, but of the unhealthy conditions arising in newly-opened tropica) country. The death rate, to which the honourable member alludes, was followed by a fal l almost as remarkable as was its rise. . Mr WATSON - Thes e indented blacks were immigrants.",53
481,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"That is so. They came from another district. They had lived hi another altitude, and were then engaged in opening up ground which had never been mined or cultivated.",54
482,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Would that account for the death rate amongst them being so far in excess of that amongst the white settlers in the district?,54
483,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Yes , because the blacks are immediately engaged in the work of opening up malarial lands.",54
484,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Does not great mortality always follow when whites undertake such worfk ?,54
485,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The mortality is great amongst whites when they undertake the work of opening up new ground in tropical countries, as in Panama lately.",54
486,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Does not the Prime Minister think that the Commission might well inquire into the question?,54
487,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"We have had it inquired into by the magistrates, who took such precautions to conserve the health of the blacks that the death-rate fel l very rapidly. Since then no application for inquiry has been made; but the Commission are free to inquire into this as well as into any other question.",54
488,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The latest death rate is 6 per cent.; that is heavy.,54
489,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,It is not heavy when we recall the fact that the Papuan is unaccustomed to continuous labour. undertakes the work of mining and opening up new land in a new district because of the inducement held out to him.,54
490,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,But surely the high death-rate ought to be inquired into.,54
491,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,It has been; and we are endeavouring to prevent natives of one district being put to work in their health will suffer.,54
492,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The inquiry was made by men who are responsible for the conduct of their own Departments.,54
493,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"No ; it was made by magistrates, who have no interest in the year. mining operations. Complaint is made of the severity of their supervision, and it is said that they have little symevery pathy with the miners. There is no objeclian. tion to inquiry. I should welcome it ; but the probability is that those living on the spot are better able to suggest how the deathrate might be decreased than are men who remain for only a few weeks.",54
494,Mr HIGGINS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"If in developing the country it is found that the interests of the blacks conflict with those of the whites, is the question of who shall be supreme to be considered?",54
495,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Yes; in our opinion, Papua belongs first to the Papuans. Their well-being is to be studied in most respects even before that of men of our own colour.",54
496,Mr HIGGINS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The first question relates to development, and development may be a bad thing for the blackfellow.",54
497,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"No ; I have already pointed out that there are many unoccupied areas that can be devoted to cultivation and mineral research without encroachment on the native lands, which are more liberally granted than anywhere else. Our labour regulations in Papua are, I believe, among the most severe in force in any part of the world. Every precaution is taken before the natives are allowed to sign on, and when they leave their employment care is taken that they receive the full amount of wages due to them. They are protected in every way. That is our first line of policy, and we have stated that fact in a letter to the Commission. I was about to say, in answer to the criticism to which we have been subjected, that we hope to see our Australian policy applied to the unutilized portions of the Possession. That means the policy of development to which I have alluded, and that it must necessarily be carried out by Australians. On He the score that they are not Australians, complaint has been made of the proposal to appoint Sir William MCGregor, or to allow Captain Barton to remain. Although Captain Barton is not an Australian, his experience in Papua extends over so many years that he is very like an Australian.",54
498,Mr WATSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,I think he is fairly qualianother where fied on that ground.,54
499,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"No less than half of the officers under him- I admit that most of them are in the lower branches of the service-ar e Australians. The number of Australians on the staff is increasing every As men die or leave the service,' often the vacancies so created are filled by appointments from Australia. In a few years officer in Papua will be an AustraI see no objection whatever to the appointment of an Australian to the chief office or to anv other position in the Territory that becomes vacant. Mr JOHNSON;-Provide d that he has the necessary qualifications.",54
500,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Exactly . But it has been urged that the mere fact that a man is an Australian should be sufficient to tify or to bar his claim for an appointment. Of course it is not.  ment is ""Australia for the Australians.""",55
501,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Our policy is "" Papua for the Papuans, and then for the Australians."" So far as Australia is concerned, it is "" Australia for the Australians "" first and foremost, because our aborigine population is so small and so well provided for that it need no longer be taken into consideration. Four or five years hence 90 per cent, of our staff in Papua, from the chief downwards, will be of Australian birth.",55
502,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Is the Chief Justice an Australian?,55
503,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"He is, and several of the leading departmental heads are Australians. So far from Australian birth being an objection, it has been a recommendation.  ment were able to find in Australia a mai: capable of taking the position of Chief Justice.",55
504,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I think we have a number of men capable of filling the position, but there are not many prepared to live in Papua.  who is fit to act as Governor of Papua?",55
505,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"We shall have Australian Governors in the future. To make the Australian policy there a sound one, we need to give Papua the best possible staff, trained by men who have spent their lives in handling natives, and who have lived in tropical climates. It was for that reason I thought it most desirable to endeavour to secure the services of Sir William MCGregor- a man who could have trained up a body of young Australians according to the best traditions of the dealings of the British Colonial Office with tropical countries. I looked forward to such an appoint, ment, not as being opposed to the policy of "" Australia for the Australians,"" but as calculated to put that policy on a firm basis. I have to apologize for having detained the Committee so long, but it is rarely that the attention of honourable members is focussed upon this distant dependency. From the ist September next it will be part of our own territory, and we shall have to deal with it in a practical way. I make my apology only to honourable members present, and not to the Parliament, which must now take jus- into consideration the fact that Papua is in our hands. It is a great trust. It is a country with a population of hundreds of thousands of savages, to whom we are giving opportunities of education and progress, of which advantage is being taken by the missionaries. We provide the opportunities, and the missionaries go ahead of us in giving the natives that education and assistance and training in the useful arts that will enable them to live in a higher sphere than they have yet reached. We have this great responsibility on our shoulders; we have also to face the responsibility of effectively occupying Papua with as many white settlers as possible, in order that it may be safeguarded. Poor as our progress mav seem, it bears comparison with that made by our German neighbours, who are spending twice as much as we are on State subsidies, and yet are unable to show better results. It is true that they are undertaking plantations on a great scale. They are pushing on, and will soon outstrip us unless we take vigorous action.",55
506,Mr HIGGINS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Is any alternative course to the Commission to be proposed ?,55
507,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I know of none. Whilst the honourable and learned member was temporarily absent I detailed a number of complications due to the difficulties of administration, and' pointed out that they could be dealt with only on the spot.  there eventually.",55
508,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Quite so. We shall send the Commission to Papua. They will submit their recommendations, and then this Parliament will decide the policy to be adopted and the persons to be intrusted with the work of giving effect to it.",55
509,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"North Sydney"") [9.27] - The Committee must be grateful to the Prime Minister for the many interesting particulars he has given as to the climatic conditions and the general administration of Papua. I think, however, that he has failed to justify the appointment of the Commission which is shortly to leave Australia for the Territory. He has stated that the staff at present existing there is as capable and as experienced a staff as we are likely to secure for such an out-of-the-way place. And yet the Government, in order that they may determine what shall be the administration of the future, propose to send to Eapua a Commission which, however capable it may be, has not the experience nor that intimate knowledge of local conditions which is possessed by many of the officers-to whom he has referred as being capable men-no w in the Territory. Those officers liave devoted years to the study of the conditions of the Territory, and to the carrying out of the policy which first emanated from Great Britain, and was subsequently continued by the Commonwealth. circumstances, surely they are in a better position to arrive, at a conclusion as to questions of administration, as to the laws most - desirable for the natives and the whites, than are gentlemen who at the most can remain there for only a fewmonths, and will have to form their conclusions from the rapid survey of the conditions which they can make during that short period.",55
510,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,The officers do not agree.,56
511,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"As to that point, the Ministry have on the Commonwealth staff officers who have possiblymore experience of such matters than have the members of the Commission. Such an officer should be as capable of judging and dealing with all these matters. give more time, if necessary, to their consideration; his inquiries would cost less than will those of the Commission, while his conclusions would be far more likely to - be reasonable and satisfactory.",56

513,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"If these Possessions are to be governed as they qualified him for the work. ought to be, we shall have'to trust largely to one man, and the Government will have to put themselves behind that man.

516,Mr HIGGINS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Does the honourable member think that an officer in close touch with the Minister is the right person to authorize to make inquiries? Mr DUGALD THOMSON. ^ - There are officers in our service who, without disparagement of the Commissioners, have greater experience of the conditions existing in places like New Guinea, and are in that respect more capable of conducting an inquiry such as is needed.  think that one officer should be appointed In these to inauire into the conduct of another officer ?",56
517,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Certainly. The Minister who controls the affairs of New Guinea has a perfect right to satisfy himself, either by means of a personal visit or by the sending of a trusted officer, that things are being properly conducted there. I do not say that an officer should be appointed to come to any determination, or to award punishments; but he might very well be asked to put the case clearly before his Minister. He would act as the ears and eyes of his political chief, and, after making inquiries in various directions, would report the situation as he found it. If necessary, more than one officer could be sent. The inquiries He could of an officer could be more extended than those of the Commissioners are likely to be.",56
518,Mr HIGGINS,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Is there not safety in numbers in these cases ?,56
519,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I do not think that it is necessary to appoint any large number of persons to make an inquiry of this kind. I would rather leave it to one man, whose previous experience had I am sure that the honourable and learned member would not regard himself, as I should not regard myself, as well qualified to make the an inquiry of this kind. The person sent of should have lived under conditions similar into those existing in New Guinea, in some is other British Crown. Colony, and should have had to do with native races and their management. It will be most unfortunate if we have to send Commissions to New Guinea whenever there is a quarrel beofficers there. No doubt the excuse us refor asking the Commissioners to report upon the present disputes is that they will have be upon the spot, and therefore it is desirable that they should report on the subject. If , as I suppose, the letter which has been laid on the table is merely an elaboration of the terms of the Commission, the inquiry will have a very wide scope, and will require more time than, I think, the Commissioners will be prepared to spend in that climate. The dispute between Captain Barton and Mr Richmond has been already dealt with by a Board, which has come to a decision in regard to the matter.",56
520,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,It has been dealt with only on the papers; no evidence was taken. Mr Richmond has appealed.,57
521,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"If every officer who appeals after the consideration of his case by a 'Board is allowed the appointment of a Royal Commission, we shall have Commissions going to New Guinea every few months. The only excuse for re-opening this case is that, as the Commission has been appointed to visit the Territory, we may as well take advantage of the opportunity to examine Mr. Richmond and his witnesses. In addition to a number of other matters to which the Prime Minister has alluded, the Commissioners are asked to report how far and in what manner the Government can assist the development of the Possession, whether the existing personnel of the administration should be altered, and, if so, to What extent. It is stated, in regard to the natives, thatThere appears to be no reason to believe that in the past their interests have been worthy extent diregarded, but any suggestions from you that will tend to enhance their well-being will be welcomed - between The Commissioners are also told that the question how to further the mining industry will doubtless receive their best attention. Some of them, no doubt, have had no experience in connection with mining, and none of them know anything of the conditions under which' it is being carried on in New Guinea.  little about mining. He has had experience in Northern Queensland.",57
522,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The Commissioners are to report on the state of the law in regard to mining. They are also told that the agricultural development of the country largely depends upon the land laws and their administration. This forms another subject of inquiry. The letter concludes with the statement that it is the desire of the Government that the Territory shall be rendered self-supporting at as early a date as possible, under which head suggestions will be looked for in the report, while its contents are not to be regarded as in any way attempting to limit or regulate the scope of the inquiry, but simply as pointing out the directions in which improved methods are possible. I do not know when the Commissioners will come to the end of an inquiry such as they are asked to undertake. They cannot deal with all these subjects in the time at their disposal.",57
523,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,They will consider alt that they think it necessary to consider.,57
524,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"After their report has been received the Ministry must deal with it, and then it must come before Parliament. When are we to get finality ?",57
525,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,We are only just making a start.,57
526,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"In my opinion, we are beginning wrongly. It would have been better to appoint an efficient Administrator, and leave matters in his hands. A policy of drift has existed since the Commonwealth took control of the Territory, for which both the Ministry and Parliament are responsible. In 1902 the Prime Minister assured us that it was necessary to take speedy action in legislating for the administration of the Territory, but the Papuan Constitution was not passed by this Parliament until 1905.  to any note- ber blame Parliament for that?",57
527,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I do not say how the blame should be apportioned the Parliament and the Ministry, but, in view of the fact that Parliament includes the Ministry. I take it that Parliament is mainly to blame. I think that some reproach attaches to those honourable members who elevated a comparatively small matter into a position of the first importance, and prevented the Bill from becoming law until that matter was settled. With regard to the proposal that an Australian should be appointed as Lieutenant Governor of Papua, I should be very pleased to see an Australian appointed, if we could feel assured that he would prove a. successful Administrator. We must procure the services of a man who has had experience in the handling of native races. Our treatment of native races has not been such as to indicate that a purely Australian policy would result satisfactorily to the coloured inhabitants of Papua. I am sure that the clesire of this Parliament is that the natives should be treated as they have been in the past, under British control. The treatment of the natives in Australia in the past, even up to the present day, has not been such as to lead us to believe that an Australian would necessarily prove the best Lieutenant-Governor who could be chosen for the Territory. I am not reflecting in any way upon Australians. I believe that they are capable, and that many of them would be animated by a desire to govern the Territory to the satisfaction of all concerned. But I think that in the first instance, we should indicate the policy that we desire to be carried out, especially as applied .to the natives, and then select the best man that we can find, whether he be an Australian or otherwise. We know that Sir William MCGregor's great success was due to the fact that he was able to handle the natives with the most satisfactory results. It was his cnpacitv in this direction more than any other that made him such an able administrator. If a spark were kindled by a tactless act on the part of the Lieutenant Governor, the whole Possession would be ablaze, murders and outrages follow, and peace would be restored only by the use of the rifle and sword, the resort to which we do not desire to see. The first qualification of. the Lieutenant Governor, whether he be an Australian, or not, should be capacity to handle native races. If the Government lav down the dictum that it will be impossible to outline a policv for Papua, except by means of a Commission, they will go a long way towards admitting that the Possession should be governed by a Commission. hope that no consideration will be given to any suggestion of that kind. Personal government has been shown by experience in British possessions of this character to be the best and most successful. I should have been very glad if Sir William MCGregor had been able to undertake the government of the Territory, which he so ablv administered in days gone by. As the Government have not been able to secure his services, and as it is clear that they are not satisfied in all respects with the present Ad ministrator, they should have grapnled with the question themselves, without falling back upon a Commission. When the report of the Commission is received, Ministers will have to decide two matters, namely, as to whether the present Administrator shall be retained, and as to what weight should be given to the Commission's recommendations. They will further have to decide whether we should appoint a new Lieutenant-Governor before we give, effect to the recommendations of the Commission.",57
528,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Captai n Barton asked for the appointment of the Commission.,58
529,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"If the Government are satisfied-as they seem to be-that Captain Barton is not in all respects suitable for the position-althoug h his suitability in some respects is admitted-the y should face the position at once. The Commission may find that there is nothing to be said against Captain Barton - that he is not to blame for the present position of affairs. What will the Government do in that case? Will they retain in the position of Lieutenant-Governor a man with whom they have admitted that they are not altogether satisfied? I do not for one moment say whether Captain Barton is not a suitable man. I am not in a position to judge. But it would be most undesirable to retain the services of any man whom the Government think is not would suitable. The position of Lieutenant-Governor of Papua is a most important one, in view of the foundation work that will have to be done. Difficulties will have to be met and removed, and openings will have to be afforded for a sufficient number of white settlers of a desirable character. Care will have to be exercised to guard against the introduction of undesirable characters who mav cause trouble with the natives. The desires of the white settlers must receive every reasonable consideraI tion, but they must not be conceded merely because requests are preferred. There is very great danger of a conflict of interests between the white settlers and the natives, especially in a place like Papua where the latter so full y occupy the ground. It might be pointed out that the natives do not find it necessary to work, and that it would be better for them if they did work. That might be so. We can always find a reason why some other man should work. It might be claimed by some of the Settlers that they should be allowed to engage natives to work for them, and when it was discovered that the natives were not anxious to work, it might be recommended that, in the interests of the natives themselves, they should be made to work. Then the trouble would begin. Either the natives would have tc be taxed,, or else would have to be forced to work. Therefore, we should have to be very careful in listening to the recommendations of those whose interest it is to obtain labour as cheaply as possible, so that they may become wealthy in a short time, and clear out of the country. Then again, we should be very careful in dealing with complaints preferred by settlers against officials. Very often intense feeling is excited against officials, because they will not allow settlers to make the use they desire of the natives. Once an Administrator has been approved of, we must stand behind him, unless the very strongest proof of his incapacity is produced. I say that every complaint ought not to be brought into Parliament. The Administrator should be supported until circumstances arise which demonstrate that he is unsuitable for his position. I really do think that during the short life of the Commonwealth Parliament, we have already gone far enough in the way of appointing Royal Commissions.. They are very expensive bodies. In my opinion they do not generally elicit any information which cannot be better obtained in other ways, and when they do elicit it, it is at an unnecessary cost. must recollect that, although Members of Parliament serving upon Commissions are not paid, their travelling expenses in visiting different parts of the Commonwealth represent a considerable sum. Therefore I am sorry that this Commission has been appointed. I do not think that it will produce as satisfactory results as might have been obtained by other means. I believe that its appointment will delay the selection of a thoroughly suitable Lieutenant-Governor- a selection which, to my mind, is the key of the whole position in New Guinea. The sooner such a selection is made the better. The appointment of this Commission will delay the choice of a suitable Lieutenant-Governor, and instead of the Ministry being in a better position to make such a selection after the receipt of the Commission's report, I believe that it will be in a worse one, because we shall have to decide manv matters which should have been dealt with by him, but which will have been reported on by the Commission.",58

532,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I do not question that.

535,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Then the Government We must be the most spiritless and complaisant one that ever existed. I cannot help feeling that there is something in the contention of the honourable member for Wentworth that there is a motive underlying the desire of the Labour Party to get rid of Captain Barton- a motive which, so far, has not been disclosed by them in this debate. It is true that it has been hinted at by the honourable member for Wentworth, and honourable members are at perfect liberty to draw their own conclusions in this connection. I have no desire to impute any dishonourable motives.,  ber doing ?",59
536,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I am merely referring to the suggestions of the honourable member for Wentworth. It cannot be denied that the removal of a certain gentleman from another place would afford the Labour Party an opportunity for a possible accession to its numbers, which no party can afford to despise. I do not say that there is anything improper in that, but I do say that it is possible for an unconscious bias to exist in the minds of honourable members - a bias which may act prejudicially to the most capable Administrator.  able member was not going to impute motives. Why does he not say straight out what he means?",59
537,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Because I am precluded by the Standing Orders from expressing by direct reference what is in my mind. I repeat that we have to guard against any possible prejudice that may arise, because some honourable members may perhaps see an opportunity which would be opened up for obtaining a little more power in the legislative arena if certain contingencies, which now loom on the horizon, took definite shape. But we cannot close our eyes to the fact that specific charges have been levelled against the Acting Administrator of New Guinea. We have no means of ascertaining the truth or otherwise of those charges, except through an independent tribunal, which can investigate them upon the spot. Personally, I share the opinion of the honourable member for North Sydney, that they might perhaps have been better investigated in some other way than by the appointment of a Royal Commission. But the Acting Administrator .having been made the subject of those charges, he is certainly entitled to an opportunity to clear himself of them.",60
538,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The charge against him is not one of mal-administration, but of want of progressive administration.",60
539,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"When we come to consider all the circumstances attaching to a position of that kind we have to make very great allowances. At this distance, and in the absence of a full knowledge of all the surrounding circumstances, we cannot judge whether or not the Acting Administrator is capable or progressive.",60

545,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,Are we to form ou.' judgment merely upon the gossip of men whose view of a case may be affected by their own personal interest? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Does not the honourable member think that the judgment of the Commission which has been appointed is already formed?,60
546,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,No . I will not b i so unjust to its members-althoug h they are utter strangers to me-as to say that. We are not entitled to cast such a slur upon any body of honourable men. This afternoon the honourable member for Bland declared that the Acting Administrator had not a proper conception of his duties. Mr 'KING O'MALLEY - Did not tha Prime Minister admit that by endeavouring to secure the services of Sir WilliamMCGregor ?,60
547,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"No ; that does not by any means necessarily follow. The present Administrator is only acting, and the Prime Minister has explained the object which he had in view. The fact of an offer having been made to Sir William MCGregor was not tantamount to an expression . if want of confidence in . the present Acting Administrator. I think that the Government are to be commended for having endeavoured to secure the services of the best possible Administrator, and I hope that that policy will be pursued. I have no sympathy with the cry that we should insist upon the appointment of an Australian, as Administrator of Papua. If the best man obtainable is an Australian, let us by is a all means appoint him ; but if a better mail can be obtained from outside, let us have him. We had first of all the cry of "" Australia for the Australians "" ; we have now the cry of ""Papua for the Australians."" Presently we shall probably have the cry of "" the wide wide world for Australians."" I am glad that some honourable members are beginning to have broader views. If it be necessary to make a change in the Administrator of Papua, the Parliament will insist on the services of the best man available being secured for the position. It is of the highest importance that the qualifications of the gentleman to be appointed shall be thoroughly considered.",60
548,Mr WILKINSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Le t us send to German New Guinea for an Administrator ! . Mr JOHNSON - I do not propose that we should look for one in a foreign country. We are able to secure capable administrators from among our own people. The insinuation made by the honourable member is a most unworthy one. pose to quote the opinion of one of the most eminent and patriotic of Australians, the late W. B. Dalley, on the cry of "" Australia for the Australians."" In a pamphlet entitled Federation, National and Imperial, which is in the Library, he made the following statement. I not only do not sympathize with the policy of "" Australia for the Australians"" as a just and patriotic national aspiration, but I regard it as injurious (if, indeed, it ever could be possible) to the best interests of these Colonies, to the occupation and development of large portions of valuable territories in these seas, and as hostile to the legitimate claims and rights of other portions of the world. It is, it seems to me, to shut ourselves out from the other civilization of Europe, and not only to deprive ourselves of its inestimable advantage, but to provoke its hostility; and to do this when we are entirely without the means of occupying with advantage the teititories which we should only hold for the purpose of excluding ethers.

549,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"It is a sound and a true one, and the truth never dies.",61
550,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Dalle y was referring to the exclusion policy. "" Australia for the Australians "" does not exclude white men.",61
551,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"The cry of ""Australia for the Australians"" means the exclusion of British people as well as of other white races.",61
552,Mr DEAKIN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,As Dalley denned it.,61
553,Mr JOHNSON,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"I wish now to inquire what has become of the Minister of Trade and Customs, who is so frequently absent, and who has recently framed, under the Customs Act, a regulation which I consider most reprehensible, and entirely without justification. The regulation, which was approved by the Governor General on 13th July last, reads as follows : REGULATION UNDER THE CUSTOMS ACT j.901. Section 151 - Re-importation free of duty goods, the produce of Australia. In addition to the conditions prescribed Regulation 103 of the Regulations under Customs Act tooi (Statutory Rules; 1906, No. the following condition shall be a condition under which goods, the produce of Australia Supply [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill (No. 2). sent out of .Australia, may be re-imported or brought back lo Australia free of duty, namely : -(d) The Minister must be satisfied that the re-importation or bringing back of the goods will not unfairly disturb the market for the goods in Australia generally, or in the place or town where the goods are proposed to be I pro- landed. Goods which have actually been manufactured irr* Australia are, under that regulation, to be prohibited from re-entering Australia, unless the Minister is satisfied that they will not disturb the market. This is, in my opinion, a gross abuse of the powers conferred on the Minister by our legislation. I think that we are entitled to an explanation. This regulation shows the danger of placing such unlimited power in the hands of any Minister, no matter what his fiscal faith may be. Under our legislation, we have afforded Ministers power to frame regulations, and to do acts which were never contemplated. The Minister of Trade and Customs should be here to explain the administration of this Department, when we are asked to grant supplies in respect of it. I wish to repeat the statement that, in my opinion, we should not grant supply until the Ministry tell us whether they intend to deal with the Tariff question before the session closes. I shall reiterate this request for information until I receive something like a satisfactory reply.",61
554,Mr BROWN,CONDENSER TELEPHONE,"Canobolas) [10.27] - Some honourable members of the Opposition so dearly love an atmosphere of suspicion that even a Supply Bill cannot be discussed without honourable members being made the subject of innuendoes, which are unworthy of any responsible assembly. The innuendo which they have hurled at members of the party to which I belong is hurled also at a member of their own party. I am acquainted with the honourable gentleman who has aroused the suspicion of some of the Opposition. I have read his reports with considerable interest, and on several occasions have discussed them with him. In justice to him and in fairness to myself, I wish to say that he has never mentioned to me anything that would justify the suspicion which some members of the Opposiof tion entertain, nor have I been approached, by anv one on his behalf. Coming to the by question of the control of Papua, I may the sav at once that it has been a vexed one 1), almost from the inception of the Parliament. , At different times and from different sources representations have been made, which appear to indicate that the Administration is not as satisfactory as could be wished. I agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that there are many difficult problems associated with the control of the Territory. Owing to its remoteness, much has to be left to the Administration, and there is often a disposition on the part of those clothed with a little brief authority to - harshly exercise that authority when they are not under the immediate supervision of their superiors. It is true that private terests have often to be dealt with and curbed, and the probabilities are that even the reasonable exercise of control would lead to friction, and to many of the charges levelled at these officers. But whilst every allowance must be made for that fact, it seems to me that statements have been made which demand investigation. Those who have made these charges ask for an impartial investigation of all the stances by unbiased persons, which makes me think that their complaints are not altogether, groundless. Last session a Mr. J. W. Craig, a former resident of Papua, laid before a number of honourable members an account of his treatment by the officials of the Territory. His complaints were investigated and reported upon by the Secretary to the Department of External Affairs; but those who heard his statements, and have read the report, will hardly be satisfied with the conclusions arrived at, many of which were foreshadowed by Mr. Craig himself. He said that, having rendered himself obnoxious to certain officials, he was subjected to petty persecution, making it difficult, and practically impossible, for him to carry on his business, or to remain in New Guinea. According to his account, he was charged with most of the crimes in the calendar, from murder downwards; but the supposed records of the proceedings against him have been lost or mislaid, which is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. Two other cases requiring investigation are those in regard to which the papers have been laid on the table, while there is also the case of Captain Strachan, whose action against the Commonwealth has formed the subject of several questions recently. The papers in his case are not yet available; but if his disclosures to me in the early part the week were accurate, I say unhesitatingly that there is need for radical reform in the administration of the Territory. I am not acquainted with Captain Barton, who mav [,18] be an admirable man in many respects, and yet may not be suited for the position which, he holds, which requires exceptional ability in the occupant. It would bevery difficult to find another man asable as Sir William MCGregor, and the attempt of the Prime Minister to again secure his services was very laudable. But, without disparaging the present Administrator, I say that we must know what ground there is for the complaints which have been made - whether he is in- suited in all respects for the responsible position which he fills, and whether his officers are able and trustworthy men, who are discharging their duties in a manner creditable to themselves and to the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister has indicated that he does not feel able to decide this matter without the assistance of a Commission of investigation. The only Commissioner with whom I am acquainted circum- is Colonel Mackay, whom I have known for many years as earnest, able, and conscientious. I feel sure that he will do his duty to the best of his ability. I have been assured by those who are familiar with the Territory that, unless exceptional steps are taken, the Commissioners may return no wiser than they went, because a system of terrorism prevails by reason of the ruling officials making things intolerable for residents whose presence is disagreeable to them. I am informed that, unless the Commission is armed with powers which will protect witnesses from petty persecution, it will not get at the facts. We are, however, giving to the people of the Commonwealth an opportunity to voice their grievances, and I hope that they will take advantage of it, because the sooner these matters are dealt with the sooner will a change for the better take place. The Commonwealth Tariff is unduly restrictive, so far as New Guinea is concerned, and I endeavoured, when it was being passed, to get some concession. As the duties stand, the settlers of New Guinea will always be handicapped in trading with Australia. The honourable member for Wentworth indicated that the members of the Labour Party were not prepared to extend to Papua any consideration in this regard. If he had been in the first Commonwealth Parliament, he would know that those honourable members of who showed the strongest disposition to extend consideration to the white settlers in Papua, and even in the New Hebrides, belonged to the Labour Party. Moreover, I would tell the honourable member that unless some members of his. party have changed their views, they would not support him in carrying out the liberal policy he has advocated. I trust that, as the outcome of the investigation that is about to be made, the administration of New prepare Guinea will be placed upon a ing, that all causes of grievance will be removed, and that the utmost benefit be conferred upon the Possession and all concerned.
