1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA Keating Government",11
2,Mr CADMAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to speak about the shambles and chaos in this current government; a government which has said, 'If you can't manage yourselves, you can't manage the country.' Those opposite ought to leave this place today and never come back as the government. What you have done to the battlers and the forest workers of Australia criminal. Five of your own members do not know whether they want to continue to be members of the Australian Labor Party. Five of your members understand what you have done to families with mortgages and commitments. You have closed down whole towns around Australia because you have paid attention to those nicely attired, smart-talking greenies who are supposed to represent the environmentalists of Australia. Let me tell you that they do not. Decent Australians and decent environmentalists have no concept of putting people out of work. They want a properly managed system. You cannot deliver anything. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been forcing his way through and abusing decent Australian workers-workers whom you claim you represent. These are people whom you say you understand, yet the Prime Minister has stirred them up and wants them arrested or the army brought in. He wants those people out of the way. He is absolutely intolerant of the needs of average Australians. He does not stand for the average family-the average battler or the person who is in need in Australia. He is prepared to see them lose their jobs, lose their livelihood, lose their income and see their families suffer. This Prime Minister does not stand for the average Australian. (Time expired) Liberal Party",11
3,Mr HAVILAND,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Here we are back again after Christmas arid New Year for another year. We are much the same in many ways in that we are over here and they are over there. Of course, the opposition has a new leader-the third new Leader of the Opposition in 12 months. I guess it must feel pretty strange for some honourable members on this side of the House, such as the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) and the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham): they have been here for less than 12 months and they are into their third opposition leader. Who would have thought that after being in the House of Representatives for less than 12 is months the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) would haye served under three different leaders of the opposition, none of whom was her. We heard the honourable member for Mackellar say on ABC radio that she would not stand for the leadership of the opposition because the Liberal Party is not ready for a woman to be leader. The electorate is ready, but the Liberal Party is not ready for a woman leader. What does that say about the Liberal Party? As usual, the Liberal Party is miles behind the electorate. Speaking of leaders of the opposition and Christmas, in her Christmas stocking this year my five-year-old daughter received a rather interesting present. It was a little book called Howard the Horrible Gets Even. I thought that was a strange present to give a five-year-old. Perhaps it was a mistake and it should have been in the Christmas stocking of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). It is quite a good little book. It is the story of an obstreperous ostrich. When we look at the heads in the sand policies of those in the opposition it is probably a good title for a book about them as well. (Time expired) Nomad Aircraft",11
4,Mr TAYLOR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Replying to a question during question time in this place on 19 October last year, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) informed the House that he would respond at the earliest date to the CAA review that he implemented on 19 July last year into operations of the Australian designed and built Nomad aircraft. Bearing mind that three months have elapsed since gave those assurances, that Nomad aircraft the civilian register in Australia or operated by the Australian Defence Force-about 50 total-are either grounded or operationally constrained as the result of marks about their airworthiness and persistent in-flight incidents here and overseas, that another 50 or so Nomads are being operated overseas in many countries and that a Senate inquiry is shortly to get under way into a specific fatal crash involving catastrophic airframe failure of a Nomad in South Australtourism, is nearly five years ago, can the minister assure the House that these aircraft ationally safe? If not, what steps is the minister taking to redress a scandalous situation which has been allowed to drag on for too long? As the Seaview and Young crashes have demonstrated with tragic results, when will the minister finally realise that in the aviation field near enough is not good enoughdebate something which the minister disregards at air traveller's peril? Coastal Development",11
5,Mr KNOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Gilmore}-I rise to talk something which is of great concern to majority of Australians, and that is the ment and care of our coast. There is a need for substantial initiatives to be taken along coastal strips. As Australians who have lived on, urbanised and colonised the coast to great extent-somewhere in the vicinity of 80 per cent of Australians live in an urbanised strip around the coast-and because it has history. been such a very special place in our lifestyle, to an extent we have loved it to death. We have done that through our activities and through rampant development, which see a lot of on the north coast with the volvement of a number of people from the New South Wales government. In factthere is a funnier side to this. One of myÂ· state colleagues said recently, 'The back bench Fahey's Liberal government is starting to look like a police line-up.' As I said, over 80 per cent of our populain tion lives on the coast. The economic and he recreational activities reSUlting from that on development have caused great destruction to our coast. We need to have the federal, state in and local governments getting together to do something about providing positive initiatives serious question along our coast. The coastal zone, including the estuarine environments, the near-shore marine environments, the rocky platforms and intertidal zones, is an area of great concern. It generates a great deal of wealth in the economy through fishing and a range of other activities which take place there. We need to be attenare opertive to its care-(Time expired) Monarchy",12
6,Mr CLEARY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"There are certainly some opportunistic things said in this parliament but it is hard to find something to compare with the speech of the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) in the ANZAC Day Bill yesterday. The failed shadow health the spokesperson chose to chastise John Curtin for an anti-war speech he made in the federal parliament in 1938. John Curtin was a Brunswick boy, who about went to St Ambrose school-myoid man the went to St Ambrose-and he,Curtin, was a treatfair dinkum, decent, anti-war person. The member implied in her speech that because our Curtin took an anti-war position he was somehow a passive observer of the Holocaust. a That is virtually what she was saying in her speech. Just as she knows little about health, the member showed she knows nothing about Of course, she chose not to advise the House that the Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII, and his wife the Duchess we travelled to Germany in October 1937 and inwere feted by the Nazis and interviewed by Hitler. This is the very monarchy that she loves, over there in Nazi Germany. And when they went back to England what did they say: of 'A grand system, Nazism; very clean, orderly.' They are the' sorts of people that the member for Mackellar supports. The Nazis even offered to restore the Duke to the throneMrs Bishop-- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.",12
7,Mr CLEARY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Here we go, you whinger.",13
8,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,Order! The member for Wills will resume his seat. The member for Mackellar has the call. Mrs Bishop--I will not tolerate those aspersions being cast and I demand that that rather unprincipled fellow over there withdraw.,13
9,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,Order! The honourable member for Wills from time to time believes very passionately in issues but he must be careful in what he says.,13
10,Mr CLEARY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,What is there to withdraw?,13
11,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,Order! Let me finish what I am saying. Everyone has an opportunity in this place to express a point of view. The honourable member for MACKellar believes that the last sentence ofyour contribution was offensive to her. I think a couple of others in this place are expressing a similar view,13
12,Mr CLEARY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,I withdraw that. What I will say is that we ought to study history and we ought to study the history of the monarchy because if we did we would find a lot of skeletons-(Time expired) Leader of the Opposition,13
13,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In recent days we have seen much discussion as to whether the new Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the old man of the opposition, can become new again. We have seen articles such as the one in the Sydney Morning Herald on 21 January under the headline 'Can this man reinvent himself?' That is a matter in respect of which the community will make a judgment. In making this judgment it will be very helpful to see the views of his colleagues on the member for Bennelong, the new old Leader of the Opposition. In the Weekend Australian of 8 and 9 October 1994 Chris Puplick, a former Liberal senator and opposition frontbencher, said of the Leader of the Opposition: But his ideas were tossed like a dead cat on the table, causing people to panic and scream ... We find in the Weekend Australian of 1 and 2 October 1994 another view of one of his former colleagues, Peter Shack, a Western Australian MP and a former shadow frontbencher. Mr Shack is quoted as saying that Mr Howard will be remembered also as a 'wrecker in terms of Liberal Party politics' and 'hopeless as a leader'. This goes on and on. In the Weekend Australian of 21 and 22 January 1995 in an article entitled 'Howard's second coming', we find the following: Even those who supported him at the time were critical of Howard's weaknesses as a manager. "". His office was total management chaos. You could not ever get an answer on anything except from him. He become catatonic. II So the new old Leader of the Opposition, in terms of managing his office, is catatonic. The public will consider that judgment when they decide how he might be able to manage the country.

14,Mr NEHL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Cowper}-I take this very brief opportunity to voice my very strong support for the men and women of the Australian logging and forest industries because they are doing a great job for Australia It is absolutely ridiculous that they should be subjected to the pressures and strains that they have now. Senator Faulkner has done your party, Mr Speaker, a great disservice because he has taken action to put thousands of Australian workers out of jobs on the basis of shonky and flawed research. In the north-east forest areas of New South Wales, covering my electorate, Senator Faulkner spent $44,000 of taxpayers' money to commission the New South Wales Conservation Council to prepare a report. It sublet the contract to people associated with the north-east forest alliance. This is like setting the jewel thieves to guard the jewels. How can you expect some form of objective or bipartisan, independent approach from people who are committed to locking up the forests? They have an agenda and the report they provided merely goes ahead with that agenda. Two hundred and forty-five compartments are recommended as having high conservation value; 203 of them have already been logged, some as many as nine times; 20 of them plantations put in for harvesting. They say these have to be locked up. Just in the northeast area of New South Wales up to 2,500 jobs can be destroyed. (Time expired) Forest Industry",13
15,Mr CAMPBELL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The paper today points out that we have a $2.4 billion deficit. It is a very dangerous and worrying situation. In the light of this we ought to have dressed. very grave concern about what is happening in the forest industry. The forest is entirely renewable. The industry is capable of doubling its capacity, therefore addressing this deficit that is plaguing this country and will be the millstone which drags us all down. The people of Australia should realise some simple things. Australia has the best forest management in the world. There is no doubt about that. There is no country in the world which can claim better forest management than Australia can. In that excellent forest management, Western Australia and Tasmania undoubtedly are at the very peak. Several years ago Dr Syd Shay from the Department of Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia, together with the Australian Heritage Commission, worked out a regime for what was hailed at the time by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the then minister as world leading, the pattern for the world-a green strategy. That has been thrown out the window. The people of Australia should realise that we have the best forest management in world, and when the greens stop forestry Australia they drive it offshore where there no control. When the Solomon Islands get flattened, this will be laid at the feet of greenies. If they believe in their philosophy of thinking globally and acting locally, should have another think about their despicable actions. (Time expired) Prime Minister",14
16,Mr ATKINSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"A number of issues raised today are of interest. The ber for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) came in here and talked about leadership and performobstruct ance. I would just like to ask him and other members opposite what leadership there has been from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) over the last few days. When we have got so many people around this building concerned about their jobs and opportunities of going out and working, one would have to ask: where is the Prime Minister? Where is the leadership from this government? The fact of the matter is that he does not want to come in here, because he is frightened to come in here and address the issues that need to be adWe have a deficit in this country that is blowing out of all proportions. Where is the Prime Minister? He is not in here. He wants to go out and do interviews on Australian radio, but he does not want to come in and address the issues in this Australian parliament.

18,Mr MCARTHUR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Australia's current account deficit for 1994-95 is expected to be a record $26 billion, the highest current account deficit in Australia's history, and climbing to well over five per cent of GOP. This current account crisis is rapidly becoming common knowledge the in the community. What is less commonly in known is that around $1.5 billion of that is figure is directly attributable to Australia's deficit on timber products. That figure is the comprised of a $2 billion import bill, partly offset by $450 million worth of exports they generated by our own timber industry. Two stark questions quickly emerge: firstly, why is Australia with our relatively small population and rich forest areas a net importer of wood products? Secondly, why would a memgovernment supposedly committed to improving our disastrous trade position seek to the ability of our timber industry to export wood products to the rest of the world, providing jobs in Australia and helping to offset our spiralling import bill? These are important questions, important enough for 2,000 timber workers and their families to make the trip to Canberra to ask the federal government for these answers. We have timber workers here in the gallery and we have timber workers all around the parliament who want to know the answers to these very important questions. There has been much discussion about the validity of the woodchip export licences, the questionable conduct of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, for stalling the national forest policy statement, and the ALP's clear betrayal of working-class Australians, those it purports to represent. But these issues should not be allowed to overshadow the question at the heart of this debate which is, above all, about woodchips. That is why we are here, and that is the issue that has caused so much widespread controversy in the electorate. That controversy has been fuelled by misunderstanding and misinformation, and that misinformation has been put about by a number of environmentalists following the government's decision to renew 11 woodchip export licences late last year. Any sane and reasonable assessment of the facts would reveal that that outcome was always the outcome that would eventuate, no matter how much Senator Faulkner raised greenie expectations. There is simply no reasonable argument to justify the end to exporting woodchips from Australia. The Greens are simply using an emotive, high profile approach to attack the timber industry and actively work towards its demise. The facts about woodchips are these: fIrstly, wood is a renewable resource; secondly, woodchips come from waste timber; and thirdly, waste timber comes from three sources, sawmill residue, silvicultural thinning and integrated logging. Sawmill residue is wood left on the sawmill floor after logs have been cut. Silvicultural thinning is an effIcient and necessary forestry practice whereby quality trees are removed to allow other trees a better chance to grow into higher quality saw logs. Integrated logging involves the removal of saw logs and pulpwood as part of the same harvesting operation. This allows the good quality logs to be used for sawlogs and the residue to be chipped or used for some other economic use. This is no different from cattle and other livestock. The main purpose of keeping cattle might be the prime cuts of meat and other by-products which can result from hide, hoofs and other parts of the animal. The Greens like to suggest thatÂ· the timber industry is a bit confused as to what is residue timber and what isa good sawlog. They like to claim that the industry chips indiscriminately both the waste and prime logs. They must think that everyone is as irrational as they are. The price of a good quality sawlog is approximately $400 per cubic metre, the price of wood chips is approximately $70 per cubic metre; so obviously the timber people would rather harvest sawlogs than woodchips. This is not even fIrst-year economics. Even the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) might understand those fIgures. He might, but he might not. But, of course, the greenies do not want to look at the facts. Nor is it suffIcient for our resident caucus motion mover, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), who is over therehe sometimes comes into this House--to think that, by swanning around the trendy Fitzroy coffee shops, one becomes an expert overnight on the economic realities of rural Australia. But having failed on the matter of woodchips the Greens should admit defeat, come clean and reveal that their true agenda has nothing to do with woodchips but with the timber industry as a whole. Every crackpot environmental group in the country--or, more accurately, in the cities---:is in the habit of putting on a bit of a sideshow from time to time at public rallies held in half-empty community halls. At everyone of these occasions, you can bet you will see a picture of a logging coupe after being clearfelled, along with an emotive caption about Australian heritage being chipped and shipped to Japan. My fIrst point is that only 30 per cent of our publicly owned forests are available for logging. I repeat: only 30 per cent of our publicly owned forest lands are available for logging in the first place. My second point is that, in many areas in Australia's south-east, clear-felling is the most environmentally sound harvesting practice. In wet, high quality forest areas, new trees need plenty of sunlight and bare earth, just as one gets after a bushfire. It would be foolhardy and irresponsible to try to plant new trees amongst others because they would be overtaken by other species which can thrive in these dark conditions. In those areas, clear-felling is the only sound practice. We do not seem to hear much protesting from greenies when farmers clear-fell their wheat crop or when suburban dads clear-fell the back lawn and use the grass clippings for compost. Yet the principle of clear-felling regrowth forest is the same-renewable resources are being sustainably managed for maximum gain. Once the area has been clearfelled in accordance with sound forestry practice, what would our green friends do with the residue timber which cannot be used for saw logs? Should we burn it, creating yet more greenhouse gases, or should we leave the waste behind so the greenies can contrive an indignant rage at the mess left behind by the loggers? The best policy is to find some way of using the residue for economic gain, and woodchips offer that opportunity. Some of the woodchips are processed in Australia. Several workers here from Australian Paper Mills' Maryvale mill are represented in this chamber by the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Cunningham), who, I think, has threatened to resign from the government because he is so upset about the whole project. Other woodchips are sold overseas. Many go to Japan to make fine computer paper. I am sure that we have all heard the green propaganda line that bits of Australian heritage are going off to Japan. This line tries to stereotype developed Asian economies as cold, ruthless, environmental rapists. The issue of where woodchips go should not matter to the radical Greens. They do not even care whether a tree gets chipped or becomes a sawlog. For them, as long as the tree is cut down, we have an environmental catastrophe on our hands. The woodchip issue is a complete red herring. But the Greens find it relevant because it is the only area over which the Commonwealth has any powers. Land management is controlled by the states but, of course, the Commonwealth controls the woodchip export licences and can get into this argument. It is only by placing conditions on the woodchip export licences that the federal government can buy into the argument and placate the green movement. However, that does not affect the question of whether logging can go ahead in these areas. The government's pretence that it can actually protect areas-as the Prime Minister claims from time to time-is just vain posturing. Only state governments can close off areas to logging, as they have done to good effect in Victoria, Tasmania and New South Wales under world-class logging practices. Seventy per cent of Australia's publicly owned native forests are in some sort of reserve system. Nevertheless, the annual licence renewal circus is dominated by the radical Greens pleading with the government to effectively outlaw the export of woodchips which come from areas they deem worthy of protection. However, these restrictions usually do not affect the woodchip exporters, who make up their tonnage elsewhere. At the end of the market, it really affects the sawmillers and the contractors, who have to sell their residue timber from the 511 coupes that the Prime Minister has designated as totally sacred and not to be interfered with. So it is that end sale of residue material that makes the whole harvest operation viable. For all the monotonous moanings of the green movement about the multinational corporations, the sawmilling industry-the industry most affected by the decisions of the present government and Prime Minister-is dominated by Australian family businessmen. We have members here in the gallery, not overseas multinational corporations. The industry is labour intensive and is providing many rural jobs. The Commonwealth cannot protect the logging coupe, regardless of the vain pleadings of the Prime Minister. All the federal government can do is inflict economic hardship on local sawmillers by removing their ability to export and sell their residue material to make woodchips. That is not protection of the forests; it is economic vandalism and is plundering an industry that is viable. The recent decisions of the government make it very difficult for all those Australian families represented here in the gallery. (Time expired) World Summit for Social Development",14
19,Mr LANGMORE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," incomes Despite the importance of the issue raised the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur), I have an equally important, if not change rate. more important, issue to raise with the House.",17
20,Mr CADMAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Sydney airport.,17
21,Mr LANGMORE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"No, not Sydney aireconomy-in port. I want to discuss the World Summit for Social Development. The world summit is on three core themes which are of concern everyone in every country: the reduction of poverty, the reduction of unemployment and the strengthening of social integration. Australia, the central economic and social issue with which we have to be concerned is the growth of employment. The world summit is on one of the central themes that dominate our political life and our economic and social concerns. The Third Preparatory Committee for the World Summit for Social Development has just finished its meeting in New York. I privileged to be part of the Australian delegnot ation at that conference. The conference for two weeks. We negotiated a declaration and a program of action which heads government and heads of state will discuss the summit in Copenhagen on 11 March and 12 March. There has been very little publicity about this summit, which is a pity, but it understandable because so far it has been in the planning stage. There will be a great deal of publicity about it during the first two alone. weeks of March as it is prepared and then actually held. The central theme of the summit concerns the interrelationship of economic and social questions. A particularly good example of that interrelationship occurred over the holiday period-that is, the effects on Mexico of collapse of the peso. Honourable members will be aware that the peso collapsed by about 45 per cent over a two-week period around Christmas and the New Year. That has had a shattering impact on the Mexican economy. In order to cope with that decline in its exchange rate, the Mexican government has increased interest rates so that mortgage rates are now around 48 per cent and credit card interest rates are around 75 per cent. There is talk of a major reduction in wages. So real of both wage earners and the middle by class are going to be massively reduced in order to cope with this collapse in the exThat situation demonstrates vividly the interrelationship of a very narrow part of the that case, the financial markets-with the whole of society. It is becoming clear to lots of people that a relatively to narrow approach to economic policy during the last couple of decades in lots of countries and in the major international financial instiIn tutions has caused a growth of social problems. It is quite clear, for example, that the number of people living in absolute poverty, principally in the developing world but also to some extent in the richer industrialised world, has increased over those two decades. The proportions in some countries have fallen, but the absolute number of people living in extreme poverty has increased. This suggests was that the economic policies being used were effective in achieving improvements in the ran well-being of everyone in those societies. It is true that in Australia we have a serious of problem of unemployment and therefore at poverty. Therefore, the themes being addressed by the summit are of great importance to us. One of the points of recognition which is has led to the holding of the summit is that only many of these serious social and economic problems cannot be addressed by countries If Australia, for example, wants to move steadily towards full employment, as is the government's goal, we will have to adopt the kinds of polices that are now being put in place and we will be assisted if other countries do the same. It is very difficult for one the country alone to achieve full employment unless the same kinds of policies are adopted in many other countries at the same time. the central themes of the summit are of great importance to us as well as to other countries where social problems are even more severe. The summit preparations are now well (Mr advanced. The third prepcom, which has just finished, was attended by around 150 countachievement ries. It lasted for two weeks. Quite commonly we negotiated from about 8 o'clock in the morning till midnight. Agreement has been reached on most of the issues. The summit leaders will be asked to address and to sign declaration and a program of action. The Copenhagen summit. declaration includes 10 commitments. Many of those commitments are of great importa ance. For example, the first relates to commitment to steadily reduce extreme poverty. One of Australia's suggestions to prepcom was that countries should commit themselves to preparing, by the end of next year, national strategies for poverty reduction. Many countries already have such strategies and in those countries the summit is urging that those strategies be strengthened. We, the Australian delegation, got accepttake ance for the idea that the very ambitious tions. target of the end of next year should be set for the preparation of comprehensive national strategies for poverty reduction. Another the proposals that we advocated, and which many other countries advocated as well, was reiteration of the UN charter commitment full employment. There was debate at the first and second preparatory committees about whether it was realistic to reiterate a goal full employment but Australia, because it is our government's policy, advocated that the goal of full employment should be given a central place in the declaration from the summit. That has been agreed and is somement thing of which we can all be proud. It conand tinues the Australian tradition of involvement in that issue. Members will perhaps remember Australia. that Australia made a big issue of full employment in 1945 when the charter was being prepared and when Dr Evatt was our foreign minister. We were instrumental in ensuring a very fine wording of that part of the charter. Australia and a number of other countries also joined forces in strengthening the mitment within the declaration and So gram of action to improve employment opportunities, income, well-being and services for indigenous peoples. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Tickner), who is at the table, has a strong commitment to and a very strong record of in this area. He will be glad to know that Australia, together with Canada and New Zealand, advocated quite strong commitments to improvements in the well-being of indigenous peoples. That was accepted by the a conference and it is likely to be agreed at the There was also debate about how to express commitment to equity and equality for a women. Australia was very active in that debate as well. We were also active in the the debate relating to disabled people. In other words, all the groups that one can imagineand there are others, of course, such as recent migrants-which have a tendency to be less well served, to be marginalised and to have fewer income earning opportunities were discussed, their concerns addressed and programs of action suggested for countries to up so as to rapidly improve their condiOf course, such programs require revenue of and there was also discussion at the summit about how to ensure an adequate revenue base for the services that marginalised groups and to the whole community require. After some debate, there was a commitment by all countries to an efficient and progressive national of tax system. There was a debate about what the word 'progressive' really means. It means that those with the capacity to pay, pay a larger proportion of their income than those on low incomes. So there was a clear committo equity within the summit discussions, it is impressive that that was true of the United States, Japan and Europe, as well as Many other issues are to be addressed at the summit. It is going to be a very important meeting. I hope there will be more discussion in this House of this event as itdraws closer and that members are able to see the debates that occur. This will be a very significant step comtowards improved economic and social prothe programs in the post-Cold War world. Parliamentary Conduct",17
22,Mrs SULLIVAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I grieve for this parliament. As a consequence, I grieve for the people of Australia. I want to say a few words today about the depth to which parliamentary conduct in Australia has sunk under the Keating government. Time is very brief in this debate and, whilst there are many things I could say and many issues I could raise I will have to confine myself on the number - f issues on which I speak. Time permitting, I shall speak in particular about question time ministerial statements and the handling of legislation in this parliament. Yesterday morning we opened the day with a debate about the conduct of parliament. The Special Minister of State, the member for Petrie (Mr Johns), fell into the cracked record mode that government members fall into on this subject. He said that there had been a report by the Procedure Committee, of which I am deputy chairman-which he pointed out in his speech-in which certain reforms were recommended. I shall now put on record and - estate for the benefit of members just what It was that the Procedure Committee recommended in relation to question time. I point out that the Procedure Committee is made up of both government and opposition members. The government holds the position of chairman and has a very clear majority on the committee. The committee's recommendation in Abo-t time.: bills, quest-ons and working hours m relatIon to questIon time was the unanimous recommendation of all members of that committee, including Labor Party members. . In relation to sitting patterns and sitting tImes, we recommended that parliament should sit one extra day per fortnight, that !he first Monday of a sitting fortnight. We mcluded a trade-off for the government in that by saying that we would recommend a limited roster system for question time. For so-e time, the government had been wanting to mtroduce a roster system, and it was no secret that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in particular wanted to introduce a roster system. The committee's recommendation was a limited roster only on Mondays of sitting weeks and that the opposition would have a right of veto over that roster, except in the case of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was not to be on Monday's rosterhe was to be excused from parliament that day-but there would be a roster of other ministers, including junior ministers, on Mond-:ys only. It was to be the right of the oppOSItIon to say that if a minister not on that roster was required by the opposition to be prese-t for ques-ion time on that Monday, then It had the nght to veto that minister's absence. That was the committee's recommendation. What did we get instead? The Prime Minister took to cabinet a recommendation on a roster in which he would have appeared in parliament only on one day a week; he would not have been excused on one day a week, he would appear on only one day a week. Even his own caucus revolted at that recommendation; it insisted on two days a week. His response to that was to roster himself to appear in question time on Mondays also. Of course, we do not sit every Monday of a sitting week, for example, the first week of the commencement of a sitting pattern. We do not sit on at least three Mondays of the year. In those weeks the Prime Minister comes in only once a week. So they split the difference on that one. This is one such week-a week of great moment to the Australian people. Parliament House is blockaded, a major industry is under threat, many Australians have deep concerns about the direction of environmental policy and the future of this nation, and the Prime Minister has not yet this week set foot in this chamber . We had the Treasurer (Mr Willis) announcing tax increases in Tuesday's question is, timepolicy, if ever there were policy. It should never be announced at question time. When we have issues like that, because of the roster we do not have the right to call the Treasurer the next day to ask him more questions so that we can find out more about them. Let there be no misunderstanding. The Procedure Committee is in no way responsible for the depth to which question time is falling at present. In addition to that recommendation of a limited roster, the committee recommended supplementary questions. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has never addressed the issue of the committee's recommendation for supplementary questions in this chamber. He will refer to the Procedure Committee report when he chooses, but he has never uttered a word on the subject of the committee's recommendation for supplementary questions. The Leader of the House likes to refer to the House of Commons as some sort of justification for rosters. I place on the record that in 1992-the last year for which I have figures-whilst this chamber sat for 60 days the House of Commons sat for 143 days, between two and three times more. The Canadian House of Commons sat for 111 debate days-twice as many. Even dear little old New Zealand sat for 98 days and put us in disgrace. We are sitting a few more days but we are getting less access to certain ministers at question time. By that, I believe the government stands condemm!d. I have spoken before on the subject of ministerial statements. I have here a table the number of ministerial statements from 1970 to 1993. The table shows the decline in the percentage of its time that the House referred to. spends on ministerial statements from 2.1 per cent in 1970 to 0.4 in 1993. The figures for last year would probably be even lower. They Year No. of statements 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 have been higher than 1970 on occasion. But, effectively, ministerial statements have gone from this chamber, which is one of the reasons we get policy statements and pronouncements in question time. On a previous occasion, the Leader of the House said that the reason for the government not giving ministerial statements was that ministerial statements made in here also had to go to the Senate and-goodness mel-the Senate insists on debating them. The House of Representatives has a second chamber which is supposed to extend members' debating opportunities. I welcome the fact that the government picked up the recommendation that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and I made in on the About time: bills, questions and working hours report to include reports as well as legislation in the Main Committee's now, business. But we also need to debate ministerial statements in there. We need ministerial statements. The people, whose interests the parliament is supposed to safeguard, should have the opportunity to have statements from the government in here of which government and opposition members can debate. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the table that I have Leave granted.

23,Mrs SULLIVAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I will finish on the matter of ministers' attitudes towards this parliament. They have caught the Prime Minister's disease of contempt. I said yesterday, and I reiterate, that I have seen this before in my own state. When members of the government believe that parliament is only a formality and not a reality of their lives, you get declining government and you get corruption. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) made a reference to one such instance of corruption in debate here yesterday. It is no secret that this Prime Minister says to corporations, 'If you upset us publicly, you won't get government work.' And that is exactly what happened in Queensland. That was the beginning of the rot in Queensland. I know the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner)-the minister at the table-is an honourable man and I know he cares about parliament and freedom, but as long as he does not raise his voice he is party to the Prime Minister's tactics. I point out to the minister that ministers now no longer introduce their bills, they no longer carry their bills. I understand they are busy people, but we cannot get, most importantly, a reply to a second reading debate out of ministers in this chamber. They clearly are not listening. Once upon a time, ministers still had their appointments and someone advised them of what was said, so at least they came back here to reply. You knew that they knew at last a thing or two about what had been said in debate. These days they do not even bother to reply.

24,Mr OCONNOR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I take the opportunity to congratulate the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on the positive set of economic statistics that he recently published in the government's mid-term review. The overall state of the economy represents a very positive position which augurs well for economic growth and job creation in regions such as Geelong, which I represent in this parliament. The opposition has some fetishes and obsessions in this place and, of course, budget deficits and current account deficits are but two of those. I will certainly address those issues. But let me look at the real underlying parameters in this economic system at this point in time. The Treasurer announced that the budget projections of 4.5 per cent growth for the Australian economy have been revised upwards to 5.5 per cent. Australia is one of the fastest growing western economies on this planet. That is something that the opposition does not seem to comprehend. The inflation rate is projected to rise from 2.25 to 3.25. That is an economic performance that rivals any western economy on the face of the earth, and it contrasts sharply with inflation rates that existed at the time this government came to power in 1983. Business investment is projected to increase from 14.5 per cent up to 24 per cent. The important thing about business investment is that it is an investment in our productive capacity and our future. I can recall the then Leader of the Opposition and the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the shadow minister for finance, getting up in this parliament at the time that brought the budget down and saying that 14.5 per cent was an umeasonable target; it could not be achieved. The great coalition projecsaid tionists said that 14.5 per cent could not be year. achieved by the Australian economy and, of course, we have a projection now that it to something like 24 per cent. The unemployment rate, which was project1994. ed at the time of the budget to be in region of nine per cent, is now projected to come down to 8.5 per cent. Employment growth is projected to go up from three per cent to 3.75 per cent. The opposition does mention that Australia's competitiveness improved some 40 per cent since this governGreater ment came to power. We took on the hard tasks of restructuring industries. The electorup ate that I represent lost a small provincial city in employment terms because of your neglect, when the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer, to get down to the task of looking down the tunnel and restructuring Australian industry to take its place with the best of the world. You do not have to tell me anything about restructuring industry which you neglected when you were in power. Do you know what? I went to demonstrations and rallies by dairy farmers at that time, and restructuring hard pill for a lot of dairy farmers to swallow. But look at the dairy industry now: it has been restructured, is export orientated and best practice on the farms and in the factories and is slaying the world's international maring kets. It is not the policies of this government that will really impede the growth of that industry but policies of governments like United States that preach free trade and do Western world. nothing about it-like an opposition that preached about restructuring the Australian economy and did nothing about it. Look at what is happening in the Geelong region at this point of time: the region poised for growth and will participate in growing economy of some 5.5 per cent. The great manufacturing firms in Geelong will ite benefit from: an underlying inflation rate some 2.5 per cent; an industrial relations climate that has brought industrial peace; unemployment rate that is coming down and we more people in employment generating demand in Geelong businesses; and increased investment levels-investment levels that you this government could not achieve this Let me tell you about some of those investis up ments. Incitiec Fertilisers opened a $2.2 million fertiliser plant in Lara in December One of the top 150 companies in the Australia, it will employ 22 people and indirectly many others and is poised to grow. HiFert has invested $2.3 million installing robotics equipment and its total local investnot ment now is $10 million. Austanners has has lodged a planning permit with the City of Geelong for a multimillion dollar tannery in Lara. The company plans to spend to $12 million and create 130 jobs. Pivot is investigating a $15 million upgrade of its Geelong plant. If this proceeds, Pivot will have invested some $22 million in Geelong since October 1994. GATIC holdings recently shifted its operations to Geelong from Melbourne and is exporting steel products and will employ some hundreds of people there. Hoechst has invested $10 million in a new plant in Lara, creating 100 construction jobs. The finishing date is June 1995. Last week, I spoke with Senator MCMullan, the Minister was a for Trade, about further investments in Geelong's wool processing facilities. Korean and Turkish firms are poised to invest, which has could create over 1,000 jobs in the region. Why are these firms expanding and choosto invest in this region in that state and in this country? I will tell you why: because we have political stability. We have an economic the set of parameters that are the envy of the Opposition members get up in this place and talk about current account deficits and budget deficits. Let me tell them something about their leader. In the whole time that he is held the Treasury portfolio, the honourable a member for Bennelong could not bring the federal budget into surplus. And those opposget up in this place and lecture the governof ment about putting the budget into surplus! They seem to forget that after their deficits, an we put it into surplus in the mid-1980s. We went into deficit to stimulate economic activity in regions such as mine, and we have a program to bring the budget back into surplus. Let us look at the external account. The honourable member for Higgins is out there bleating about this being the worse current account deficit on record. Do you know anything about economics? The only real measure of a current account deficit is to measure it against the value of the production of the economy of this nation. When the current Leader of the Opposition had the Treasury portfolio in 1982, the current account deficit was 5.5 per cent of GDP. What is it now? It is 5.6 per cent. What are the reasons for that figure? There are two reasons. It may have missed the observation of members of the National Party that we have had a drought. If farmers do not produce, they do not sell on international markets and they do not get the best price for their commodities. It may have escaped the attention of the opposition that we have this level of investment and a lot of that equipment is imported. That is an investment in our future productive capacity. The current account will come back into balance over time for these reasons-(Time expired) Economy",21
25,Mr ANDREW,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Wakefield) (10.26 am.}-I was originally prompted to participate in this grievance debate by a letter that arrived my desk yesterday and by the comments of the member for Wills (Mr Cleary) in this place yesterday. But now I am prompted by a third force-the remarks just made by member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). Does the member for Corio seriously imagine that his party were in opposition and we were in government, and we were to hand down a current account deficit at record levels and overseas borrowings of this nation under stewardship were to go from $30 billion to $160 billion, he would sit on this side of the House and be silent? Of course he does not. He would be the first to be critical of what would see as very poor stewardship---poor stewardship because, clearly, we had been importing more than we were exporting and it. had gone on doing that for the whole period in government and blown out our overseas borrowings. The member for Corio simply cannot be critical of the opposition for focusing the nation's attention on what is in fact a disastrous trading figure. I did not rise to be critical of the government. I rose because I happen to be very concerned about the way we go about trading reform. I am also irritated because the member for Corio has the barefaced effrontery to accuse me and, by implication, my party of being a part of what he sees as the present economic difficulties. The reality is that the very structural reform that the member for Corio has claimed credit for-and I agree with him-has occurred as a result of changes in this parliament that have been endorsed by the opposition. What does the member for Corio or, for that matter, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) think it is like sitting here in opposition while there are proposals to reform the dairy industry, proposals to lower the tariff walls in the citrus industry, with which I am as familiar as the member for Corio is with the dairy industry, and proposals to allow tariffs to fall in the car industry? While the government made all these proposals, we were here in opposition agreeing with it. Any record will show that the opposition agreed with the government when it would have been a lot easier for \Is-as the member for Wills is currently doing and the Australian Demoon crats did-to disagree with. the government. What was I doing when I had to face citrus growers in my electorate who were being the swamped by imported Brazilian juice? As recently as December last year, I was defendif ing the actions of the government under GA TT. Did I get any thanks from the government? Of course not, because that would be the much too easy, wouldn't it? That would be our conceding that the parliament works. That would be agreeing that sometimes the opposition takes tough decisions that are unpopular ones. The reality is that the opposition has he actually been prepared to agree that the sorts of reforms the member for Corio outlined were necessary but has received no credit for It still hurts like hell in the community that the tariff walls have come down. The remarks made by the honourable member for Wills yesterday prompted me to frame these words today. Not surprisingly and not unreasonably, the honourable member for Wills would have the rest of us in the parliament believe that what we should do is protect Australian industries. We know that that is popular. Members opposite know that that is popular. The simple fact is that the opposition has resisted that popular call. I could create work in Australia, and so could members opposite. I could create work in agriculture by simply forbidding anyone from using a tractor that generated more than 75 horsepower so that there would be more tractors and more people driving them, and thus the cost of our production would go up. The honourable member for Corio knows that he could generate all sorts of work by making it harder for his tanneries, obliging them to employ more people. The cost of all tanned goods would go up. The sort of expansion that the honourable member for Corio has ,illustrated is occurring in his electorate would not be achieved. To its credit, the opposition has avoided being populous and has supported the honourmirrors able member for Corio and the government these tough reforms. We are critical that these reforms have simply not gone far enough. The government has frustrated our calls for reform in order to make this a more producindustrial tive country. A classic illustration of that the industrial relations area. I said that I in here because I received a letter yesterday from a constituent of mine who is the chairperson of the Angaston Branch of the Australaware Ian Dried Fruits Association. I wish to read this letter into the Hansard. Dear Neil, I write on behalf of the above branch of our deep concern for our local tree fruits industry and course the whole industry re imports of dried apricots into Aust. The position now is quite clear. If the status quo is maintained regarding tariffs current policy there will be no industry left in couple of years. Here is the very disturbing In 1982-83 season imports were less than 200 tonne and now (1994-1995) the anticipated figure will top 4,000 tonne with last year's figure 2,989 tonne. While an increase in the tariff similar to other competing nations would be a great help it will solve the problem altogether. Our cost of production is far too high. This letter then is firstly to inform you of the desperate position of the industry and ask you if anything can be done in assistance and what adjustment schemes etc are available. I think in some cases diversification is too late as it takes a mountain of capital to do so. To change to wine grapes is probably not an alternative as the danger signs are already present. Sorry to be a little negative about dried fruit but that is how I see it. Yours sincerely Bill Plush Chairperson Angaston Branch ADF A  industry facing real competition from Turkish   Australia is awash with opportunity if we produce quality product. The dried fruit industry is a labour intensive industry. It is an industry which I know well and in which I  opportunity for real industrial relations reform, not so that his cost of production that of the Turks-no-one is proposin ing that Australians should be asked to work for less-but to mirror the experience of the New Zealanders who have found themselves competitive across the globe because of their relations reforms. Furthermore, the is changes that the government has proposedcame and which the opposition has supported-give us all sorts of new opportunities. I rang Austrade to discover whether it was of expanding export industries and I was given examples of some industries that are agriculturally based. I was told, for example, that the hay industry in my own electorate will increase from 50,000 tonnes a year of exported to 200,000 tonnes a year targeted export-thanks to the coordination of hay producers into Japan through Austrade; thanks and to some smart marketing; thanks to ensuring a that the quality of our hay is better than that picture. of American hay; and recognising that our competition is not the neighbour across the fence but the Americans across the water. Austrade mentioned that the racehorse indusnot try has a similar sort of expansion program. ), This will interest the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). Yearling sales are expected to increase from $30 million to $100 million thanks to some of the reforms that I concede the government has introduced and the opposition has supported, although the support of the opposition has been rarely recognised. The same thing applies to the seed industry. And for the interest of those who are currently encircling Parliament House, the same thing applies in the timber industry. I am not pretending to be an authority on the woodchip industry, which is not represented in my electorate anyway, but while Austrade's particular focus was not woodchips, it is true to say that in the area of quality timber-I am not in any sense suggesting that there is no opportunity in the wood chip industryAustrade sees a major movement in the opportunity for exports as we take quality timber and encourage the Japanese to see what can be done, not only in flooring but in furniture and cabinets, with quality timber exports from Australia. The same thing applies with fishing. We could go on and on. The same thing applies in my own industry, the citrus industry, where right now more money is being generated exporting navel oranges into America-if you please-than is being generated in any other market. Why? Because, while GATT hurts, GATT gives us the opportunity to eyeball Americans across the table. I do not pretend it is easy. I do not that they play fair. But if I do not have a table over which to eyeball them, I cannot front them with the sorts of trading difficulties they provide for me. That is what GATT has done. That is what the government's involvement in GATT has allowed us to do. And it has happened with the support of the opposition, although it was politically unpopular. This would be a more honourable place if that were recognised by members such as the member for Corio. New South Wales Government",23
26,Mrs CROSIO,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (10.36 a.m.)-I too wish to rise on the grievance debate today but before I go on to the subject that most concerns me about the state of New South Wales I would like to make a few comments on what the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) has offered in this debate. I believe in what he is saying: sure the opposition, through our democratic system, will agree with us some of the time but it obviously disagrees with us nearly all of the time. For a recent example of that we only have to look at the level of debate that occurred yesterday on both sides of this House on the ANZAC Day Bill. And yet one of the member's colleagues, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), got up in this House and played to the timber and woodchipping industry in the gallery during that debate. Personally, I found that to be appalling. That is why I put on record here my feelings, because the member for Wakefield has given me the opportunity to do so. I do say that democracy says that we must agree some of the time but, obviously, in opposition you do disagree with us most of the time. What I want to grieve on today relates to my state of New South Wales where, in 51 days, the people of our state will have the chance to pass judgment on what was the Greiner and is nQw the Fahey Liberal government, which has administered that state now for some seven years. In my grievance I wish to raise three issues on which the Fahey pretend government, in its relations with our Commonwealth government, has shown nothing but contempt for the people of New South Wales-three examples of the type of arrogance in the New South Wales government which I know will lead the people of New South Wales to elect a Carr Labor government on 25 March. A federalist system like Australia's depends on cooperation between the states and the federal government over a wide range of issues. While the Liberal Party ferociously defends the symbolic shibboleths of the constitution, the Liberal government in New South Wales, with the support of the National Party which has joined with it in coalition, has abandoned completely the cooperation essential to federalism and has shamefully abrogated its responsibilities under a whole range of agreements and protocols ranging from child care to assistance for homeless youths. The longest running dispute between our Commonwealth and the state of New South Wales is about the provision of child-care places. Of course, child care is an issue of great importance throughout all of Australia, but particularly within my electorate of Prospect. In my area we have a relatively young age structure compared with many other electorates. According to the 1991 census, out of seats in New South Wa1es, only 11 have more residents aged under five than my electorate of Prospect, and 24.9 per cent of the residents of Fairfield City are aged between zero 14 years compared to the state average 21.1 per cent. So I was outraged when I learnt that two years after an offer from the Commonwealth government the Fahey Libera1 government has of disgraceful. still failed to sign the national child-care strategy. Under the 1992-96 national childcare strategy the Commonwealth mad- availprotocol able to New South Wales almost 2,000 new community based long care child-care places. This allocation, along with the funding for outside school hour places, was subject to cost sharing agreement with the New South Wales government. Now, more than two years after this offer to create those 2,000 new child-care places New South Wales, the Fahey Liberal governperson ment has still refused to sign the national time. child-care strategy. Every time the negotiating parties are close to an agreement, the New South Wales government comes up with another excuse for not signing. Not only the Fahey government, as of November last year, had failed to meet its obligations under the 1988 national child-care strategy. Four years after the strategy reached its conclumine-'when sions, the New South Wales government still not fulfilled its obligations. The people New South Wales deserve better than to be the pawns in the state government's political games. Thankfully, our federal government has bypassed that state government to provide some Commonwealth funded places in partnership with community groups and local governments. Our federal government is providing some 460 such places in New South Wales, so as of this day the New South Wales government in reality has deprived its constituents of up to 1,500 child-care places. Another area where that state government has been grossly incompetent is the implementation of the youth protocol which clarifies the responsibilities of the two levels of government with respect to our youth in New 50 South Wales under 15 years of age. The New South Wales government agreed to the protocol coming into effect in October of 1994. Compared with the national child-care stratand egy, which the New South Wales government of did not even bother to sign, we should be grateful for small mercies. However, I am not exaggerating, because facts will bear it out, when I say that the government's implementation of this agreement has been nothing short By way of background, I point out that the states that the Department of Social Security will refer the young person in the first instance to emergency food and accommodation services. The state Department of a Community Services will, after a period of no longer than five days, assume responsibility for the young person, meeting all the income, accommodation and other support needs. The Department of Social Security retains the in discretion to pay special benefit to any young in exceptional circumstances at any However, under an agreement between Minister Longley and the Public Service that; Association, the Department of Community Services within the New South Wa1es government responds to cases referred under the protocol only-and I quote its words, not all other work demands have had been met'. I am simply astounded that a of government could treat a group in our society as vulnerable as our homeless youths under 15 in such a cavalier fashion. To target such a group as optional extras in government policy is a damning indictment of the heartless nature of that government. The protocol has been working weII in every state except New South Wales and Western Australia. I understand it has even been working relatively weII under the Kennett government in Victoria. It is a sad day indeed for the people of New South Wales when John Fahey as their Premier outKennetts Kennett. What I mean by that is that I did not think there was much worse a Premier. The final issue I raise is the failure of Fahey government to match the Commonwealth's funding to improve the training and support of workers under the supported accommodation assistance program. SAAP, as it is commonly known, has always been a program which depends on cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states. SAAP provides safe and secure shelter, counselling and crisis resolution, referral and advocacy services, outreach support to the homeless and those at risk of becoming homeless, and living skills programs. I give an example of the types of outcomes achieved under this program. The Cornerstone youth accommodation program in my electorate at Fairfield accommodates residents between the ages of 15 and 18 for a period of six to 12 months. Each resident at Cornerstone has an individual contract which states that that person must agree to partake in the centre's activities - such as education skills and house meetings-and to contribute to the program through doing chores, such as shopping, when required. Honourable members in this House would appreciate the enormous stress placed upon workers in this scheme, who are usualIy employed by charitable institutions and who frequently suffer burnout. That is why in the last Commonwealth budget $19 million was alIocated to improve training and support services for workers in the supported accommodation assistance program. Of that, $3 million was allocated to the state of New South Wales for this specific purposes. However, when we investigate further as to what has happened to that $3 million, we find that the state government again has failed to meet its obligation and match this funding. When John Fahey, as Premier of that state until March 25 only, waltzes around New South Wales pretending to be the nice guy of New South Wales politics, it will be very clear to the voters on March 25 that he has been anything but nice to the working families and to the homeless in New South Wales. I grieve particularly today because I am concerned at the lack of child-care facilities in an electorate such as mine. I think it is important that it is being brought to the notice the of this House because it concerns all caring people in this country. It is of the utmost concern to the voters of New South Wales so they can make sure they vote correctly when they go to the polIs on 25 March. They are the people who need to know about what has not taken place when money has been alIocated at a Commonwealth level and when protocols have been agreed to by the state governments, particularly by the New South Wales government, and about how remiss it has been in not fulfilling its obligations. When we talk about cooperation, as the opposition has often done in this House, as did the honourable member for Wakefield in his speech earlier, we also talk about coming to an agreementthat has money behind it, that has people benefiting from it but, most particularly, that requires implementation through cooperation, and that cooperation has been sadly lacking in New South Wales. It is about time the people of New South Wales are made aware of it. I sincerely hope that they will become aware of what they are in for if that government is to be returned. As I said, I am confident a Carr Labor government will come into New South Wales. (Time expired) Racial Hatred Employment",25
27,Dr KEMP,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I want to refer to two matters this morning. The first matter concerns some remarks made by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) in a debate in this chamber last year, and then I propose to turn to comments made by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in this House on Tuesday on employment growth. The honourable member for Wills, in a speech on the Racial Hatred Bill on 16 November last year, referred to Dr Colin Rubenstein, who is well-known to me, as 'an anti-Arab Gulf War protagonist' and also referred to 'the racial and religious vilification inherent in the media's gluttonous approach to the Gulf War, including statements such as those by Rubenstein'. These references to Dr Rubenstein as being 'anti-Arab' and perpetrating 'racial and religious vilification' are totally unwarranted,unsubstantiated; untrue and defamatory accusations which should be completely repudiated by the honourable member for Wills. The honourable member for Wills is unable to differentiate between criticism of Saddam Hussein's terrorism and his actions, including his annexation of Kuwait, his cruel repression of Iraqi Shi'ites and Kurds, his subsequent scorched earth policy in Kuwait on the one hand, for example, from hostility to Arabs in general on the other. The latter has never , characterised any of Dr Rubenstein's positions or attitudes in any shape or form whatsoever. The statements quoted by the honourable member for Wills as the sole basis for his allegation in fact show that he has accused Dr Rubenstein without any substantial basis whatsoever. The statement on which the honourable member for Wills relied occurred in the lead-into an article in the Melbourne Herald on 31 August 1990 on Saddam Hussein's long record of using state sponsored terrorism after his annexation of Kuwait and while Australians were being held hostage in Baghdad. The lead-into the article stated: Australia may be the target of a large force of terrorists assembled by Saddam Hussein. That is an innocuous statement, but one of course written by the leader writer and not by Dr Rubenstein. The honourable member for Wills, we remember, opposed the Gulf War, unlike 80 per cent of Australians, most of the Arab world and the international community. If being anti-Saddam Hussein makes one antiArab, the Kuwaitis, Saudi Arabians, Egyptians, Syrians and most of the Arab world, and indeed the international community in terms of its hostility to, Saddam Hussein, can also be regarded as anti-Arab. The absurdity of this position is self-evident to everyone except, apparently, the honourable member for Wills and any individuals who may have pressed this malicious allegation upon him. If he has a shred of integrity, I ask the honourable member for Wills to withdraw his obnoxious and cowardly statement about Dr Rubenstein unreservedly. In the remaining time. I want to comment on the employment, trends about which the Treasurer spoke in question time on Tuesday. The Treasurer told the House that the government was revising its projection for employment growth from 3 per cent up to 3%per cent and for unemployment downwards from 9- per cent to 8- per cent. The Treasurer claimed that 300,000 additional jobs had been created in the course of the year 1994-95 and that 477,000 jobs had been created since the election. The government would like everyone to believe that these trends are evidence of the success of its economic policies. The coalition believes that there is nothing more important for the well-being of Australians than getting rid of the shortage of paid employment which has plagued Australia for over a decadeindeed, which goes back to the Whitlam era. The creation of new jobs is something that we support and regard as being of fundamental importance. The demand for more paid work than is currently available in the community is enormous. If we consider unemployment as measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics alone, the number of unemployed people on the government's own statistics is still higher than at the peak of the recession of the early 1980s. If we add to those formally recorded as being unemployed the more than half a million people who are underemployed, the over 700,000 people who would like to get work but are currently in training, education or other activities, and the almost 150,000 discouraged job seekers, we find that there are some two million people in this community who cannot get the work they want under the government's policies. I wish to look specifically at the figures referred to by the Treasurer, because they ;, simply do not carry with them the message that the government would like the Australian people to accept. A very large proportion of the jobs about which the government speaks are part-time jobs. In fact, in the year to December last-the latest figures---over half of all new jobs were part-time. This is despite the fact that the demand in the community is overwhelmingly for full-time work. In assessing the employment figures, it is quality as well as quantity that counts. It is plain that many people are being frustrated in their search for full-time employment by the fear of many employers-especially in small business-of the government's industrial relations legislation and its unfair dismissal provisions. Many employers will do anything but take on a full-time employee because of the rigidities with which the government is now surrounding full-time employment. The government is engaged in a massive effort to hide the unemployed in short-term training and subsidised employment programs.",27

35,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,The honourable member for Calwell!,29
36,Dr KEMP,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"In 1994-95 the aim is to have almost 600,000 unemployed people in labour market programs, and more than 300,000 of these are in programs which remove them from the standard JSAINSA statistics. Some 98,000 will be on new benefits, such as the mature age allowance, the widow allowance and the youth training allowance. Over 250,000 will be in short-term training programs or subsidised employment, which again removes them from the allowances. As members will be aware, by far the most important of these programs in terms of numbers is the jobstart program, into which the government aims to place 195,000 unemployed people this year. That is an increase of 47,000 over the previous year in this one program alone. There is no doubt that a great many of these people will respond to the ABS survey with the information that they are in employment, although the reality is that many of them-as the participants know only too well-will be back on the unemployment queues again at the end of their period of subsidised employment. I am sure that every member of this House has met constituents who are very bitter about the lack of real job opportunities arising from these programs. These figures quoted by the Treasurer are yet another reflection of the government's efforts since One Nation to artificially pump up the economy with a massive spending binge; to accelerate the economy in the hope that the government will be able to rush to an early election before the fraud at the heart of these policies becomes apparent. Well, it has failed. The early election now appears to be off the agenda, and the fraud has been exposed by the largest current account deficit in Australia's history. As the inevitable crunch comes, the artificially rapid job creation will also slow down. The simple fact is that the employment growth is no more sustainable than the general economic growth the econto omy has been experiencing over the last year.",29

38,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,The honourable member for Calwell will remain silent. He has been warned three times; this is the last.,29
39,Dr KEMP,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"These are the reasons why the Treasurer's employment figures have to be greeted with the greatest reservation. They are not a reflection of a strong and healthy economy. The recovery that we have been experiencing is a low quality recovery, and this employment growth is low quality employment growth. The growth reflects the irresponsible pump priming and the massive efforts to subsidise short-term jobs. Even then, these have been disproportionately part-time jobs. Labor has failed to do the job properly and is about to inflict more pain on Australia's unemployed and low income families. Workfor all",29
40,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I congratulate our colleague John Langmore and his co-author, John Quiggan, for the production of their recent book Wark for all. I commend the book to the attention of all honourable members and senators and those in the wider community who are interested in the development of public policy in the area of economic management. Indeed, I go further and suggest that it should be compulsory reading for all who are involved in providing advice to governments about the nature and direction of economic policy measures. Among other things which attract me to their work is the fact that they have adopted the term 'economic fundamentalism' to replace the misnomer 'economic rationalism' to describe our more recent dry economics which spawned the nonsense of monetarismso eloquently expressed by its chief sorcerer Milton Friedman-and applied under such banners as Reaganomics, Thatcherism and Rogernomics. We also experimented with it in our domestic policy making. Economic fundamentalism is a much more appropriate label, especially because of its interesting suggestion of gious fundamentalism and other flat earth sciences. In an objective and academic way, Work for all represents an effective response to much of the free market supply side trickle down nonsense of the last 20 years. No-one needs to accept every claim, premise, or conclusion of Work for all to impressed with its coherent and disciplined analysis of much of the recent economic voodooism. It explores, exposes and explodes many of the economic myths which have, explicitly or implicitly, been core elements of the policy makers. These extend from such crude obscenities as the premise that the unemployed are themselves responsible for their own economic circumstances to other more sophisticated but no less objectionable economic premises. Langmore and Quiggan present a creative approach to the development of economic policy within a framework of social responsibility. They illustrate that social responsibility and sensible economic policies are not mutually exclusive. They have provided many good examples of the intelligent application of lateral thinking in devising innovative solutions and new policy options to deal with some of the more persistent contemporary economic problems. It is a scholarly and socially responsible effort. Its publication is also timely because, at last, the momentum is building up towards the abandonment of some of the more nonsensical manifestations of dry free market economics, especially our experimental adventures with level playing fields, small governments, deregulation, crowding out, the twin deficit theory, monetary growth targets of the 1970s and early 1980s, the public sector borrowing requirement, the alleged relationship between profit rates and private sector investment, the alleged direct relationship between the federal deficit and interest rates, the claim that supply creates its own demand, and the voodoo belief that the interests of the poor and disadvantaged are best pursued by increasing the incomes and privileges of the wealthy because the benefits will trickle down to those underneath. The best analogy for the trickle down theory is that it is best illustrated when the reli- rich and powerful urinate on the poor. Langmore and Quiggan would be perfectly justified in being angry. However, that is not apparent in their book. They have calmly and dispassionately developed their case. They have illustrated in a succinct way that the or development of appropriate and effective be policy responses need not be at the expense of those qualities which should be central to any policy framework-human welfare, equity, security and opportunity. They should not simply be some kind of incidental side effect but primary and essential policy objectives. To progress the effectiveness of economic management, we simply must face up to the fact that our prescriptions have not provided satisfactory solutions for our two primary continuing problems: unemployment and the current account deficit. Both Quiggan and Langmore should be congratulated on their effort to humanise the whole process of economic policy development. I congratulate both of them.",30
41,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Mr Rocber)Order! It being 11.00 a.m., in accordance with the resolution agreed to on 1 February 1995 the debate is interrupted. Question resolved in the affirmative. HEALTH LEGISLATION (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Cognate bill: NA COMPLAINTS LEVY BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 7 December. Second Reading",31
42,Dr LAWRENCE,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill proposes to amend the National Health Act 1953, the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973. The amendments will give effect to the government's package of reforms to private health insurance. These reforms focus on consumer rights and provide: Value for money in private health insurance; A wider choice of products achieved by enabling health funds to make contracts with hospitals and doctors; and The reforms also provide for efficiency measures and equitable access. Medicare is the centrepiece of the government's health policy and enjoys strong community support. The latest market survey shows that over 87 per cent of the population support the Medicare program. Medicare provides an accessible, high quality public health system for all Australians. Private health insurance offers a choice for those who want it, but it needs to be seen for what it is-a supplement to the public health system. However, those persons who choose this product are entitled to high quality and good value in the same way as buyers of any other product. I think it is fair to say consumers are not getting that now and that is why participation rates for private health insurance are continuing to decline, with consumers suffering ever increasing premiums and high and unanticipated costs when they use the private system. The reforms will place the health insurance industry in a position to achieve efficiency gains and pass on the benefit of those gains to their members in the form of lower premiums and better controlled costs. I will now outline the main elements of the reform package. Health funds have traditionally been seen simply as 'bill payers'. These reforms will encourage them to be purchasers of health services and representatives of their members. Under the arrangements proposed by this bill, from 1 April 1995, funds may enter into hospital purchaser-provider agreements with hospitals. The primary aims of requiring contracts between funds and hospitals are: - to generate competition between health funds and hospitals, resulting in improved efficiency leading to better value for money, quality and access for patients; - to link hospital funding to appropriate quality assurance and accreditation procedures; and - to reduce restrictions on products offered, thereby allowing funds to operate according to market demand for different products. The bill also attaches conditions to any such contract with hospitals requiring them to submit a single account covering all service and facility components and provide data for modelling, evaluation and research purposes. In the first instance, contracts between funds and hospitals can be on the current basis of per diem payments, including the structure of basic and supplementary tables or on a casemix payment basis. The current basic table of insurance will continue to be available up to 1 July 1997 to hospitals which enter into a contract. On 1 July 1997, the basic and supplementary tables will cease and contracts will be structured on the basis of a casemix payment system. There is a national commitment to replace the current private health insurance per diem payment system with casemix payments. Casemix is the most significant Commonwealth health financing initiative developed in Australia. It sometimes sounds arcane and technical-but basically it is a simple idea which enables the measurement of what happens in hospitals; that is, the episodes of care. The term 'casemix' means the types or mix of patients which a hospital treats, but can refer to any scientific approach to the classificontracted cation of patient care episodes and ideas on how to use those classifications to help make decisions about health care. The implementation of casemix payments will improve efficiency within hospitals and improve the quality and quantity of the information available on what takes place in hospitals, and hence improve quality and outcome of health care. The Commonwealth developed systemAustralian national diagnosis related groupswould normally be used for acute in-hospital care under casemix payments. Other payment mechanisms-for example, per diem payments-would need to continue for longer term/non-acute patients, such as chronic psychiatric patients. and nursing home type patients, until more precise episodic classificasimilar tion becomes viable. Where hospitals and funds do not enter a contract arrangement, there will be a transition period during which the fund will be required to provide a benefit payment at a level determined by the fund. This will be an incentive for hospitals to enter into contracts, while providing protection for patients. There have been suggestions that these provisions give too much power to the funds and that they may misuse this power in an anti-competitive way, say to advantage hospitals that they may own. The government is satisfied that the Trade Practices Act provides protection against anti-competitive action by any funds-and, in any case, the number of health fund owned hospitals, only about six per cent of private hospital beds, makes such anti-competitive action unlikely to be attractive. Funds will be encouraged to contract with high quality, cost efficient hospitals. A fund with a large market share may be able to negotiate a lower price, and this is what competition is all about. However, the exercise of their market power must be consistent with the Trade Practices Act, which prohibits the use of such power to reduce competition. The result of the introduction of this new approach is that consumers will be able to choose packages with lower premiums if they are happy to use the hospitals and doctors by their fund. They will also be able to choose packages that cover them for the total cost of hospital treatment, eliminating the gap that often exists at the moment between the amount of the bill and the level of their benefits. While it is likely that most funds will cover most hospitals, there will be a range of products that vary according to the range of services and number of hospitals covered. For example, a product might cover all hospitals, or most of the major public and private hospitals, or a few small private hospitals according to the level of access consumers wish to have. In addition, consumers could choose between full coverage, an agreed level of co-payment for lower premiums, or products with known out-of-pocket payments to the current front-end deductible arrangements. Consumers will be able to purchase a product that best suits their need, at a price that best suits their budget. There will be more choice-not less-and, for the first time, consumers will have information and power to exercise those choices. Funds and hospitals will implement arrangements to avoid insured consumers unknowingly being admitted to hospitals not specifically covered by their health insurance product, and doctors will also need to playa role in referring patients to hospitals covered by the patient's health insurance product. However, for cases such as emergency admissions to non-contracted hospitals, funds will be obliged to make a payment based on average payments to contracted hospitals. The bill requires health funds to offer a product which covers the full range of treatments and services in hospitals. This will ensure that people with high health needs have access to appropriate private insurance. The second part of paragraph 29 of schedule 1 to the bill will enable funds and doctors to enter into contracts for the provision of medical services rendered in hospital. The contract may exclude out-of-pocket costs or allow for a predetermined amount to be borne by the patient. This reform addresses one of the greatest concerns of private health fund members. Unlike the current arrangements, patients will know in advance of admission to hospital what medical expenses, if any, they will have to meet. Contracted doctors will not be permitted to raise bills outside of the contract, but these contracts will not be compulsory and contract payments may be made on whatever basis funds and doctors choose-for example, a percentage of the MBS fee, a retainer, or some other agreed payment. Members may purchase this type of coverage for contracted doctors on an add-on basis. Clearly, therefore, this is not introducing American style managed care system. Doctors will still be able to receive fee for service the structure of our private hospital system will not change. This legislation does not introduce 'openended' gap insurance either. Although funds may negotiate whatever fees they wish with a doctor, if their contracts are too generous higher premiums would result. Since higher premiums would lead to a decrease in market share, there is a strong incentive for funds to negotiate reasonable contract prices. Paragraph 69 of schedule 1 of the bill provides for an amendment to the Health Insurance Act 1973 to enable the 75 per cent Medicare benefit to be paid direct to the health fund for services rendered by contracted doctors. In-hospital services rendered by doctors who do not enter into a contract with a fund will continue to attract overall payments equal to 100 per cent of the MBS fee. May I repeat, the focus of this legislation is on strengthening consumer rights and on making private health insurance better value for money. The bill provides for the establishment of an independent complaints commissioner from 1 July 1995. The establishment of the commissioner will provide insured persons with access to an effective complaints handling mechanism which can investigate, conciliate and make recommendations in response to complaints about private health insurance products. A 008 telephone network will be put in place to provide insured persons with easy access to the commissioner no matter where they live. One of the tasks of the commissioner will be to provide input to a private patient charter which will be designed to assist consumers in obtaining specific information from funds, doctors, hospitals, my department and the complaints unit itself. The charter will also encourage doctors to inform patients of an estimate of their fees and of the fees of other doctors involved in a prospective episode of treatment. A separate bill, titled the Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill 1994, provides for health funds to pay a levy to finance the administration expenses of the complaints an commission. Paragraph 70 of schedule 2 to the bill provides the Private Health Insurance and Administration Council with the additional function of publishing information in relation to health funds' premiums, benefits and products to assist persons in making an informed choice about the product which best suits their needs. The final group of amendments are to improve the operation of some elements of the current environment. Paragraphs 12 to 23 of schedule 2 of the bill remove the requirement for open membership organisations to conduct a separate health fund in each state. This measure will increase administrative efficiency and allow organisations to react quickly to changing circumstances. It will also reduce competitive differences between open and restricted membership organisations. Section 67 of the National Health Act 1953 requires organisations conducting health insurance business to be registered under the act and operate in conformity with community rating. This provision was introduced from 1 September 1985 in response to the growth in health insurance by general insurers which, by imposing restrictions on certain benefits and on age, had the capacity to offer lower premiums and hence attract the young and healthy members away from registered insurers. Subsequently, there has been an increase in the incidence of health plans being operated in respect of employee groups. These plans are not caught by the National Health Act because either no underwriting of the liability or premiums are involved or such plans are conducted under a discretionary trust deed arrangement. The government remains committed to the principle of community rating. Paragraphs 9 to 11 of schedule 2 of the bill propose amendments to section 67 of the act which will require employers conducting such plans to register them under the act or cease to conduct the plans with effect from 1 July 1995. This will bring such plans into line with registered funds and, for example, require them to participate in the reinsurance arrangements. The amendments would not prevent employers continuing to meet employees' premiums to a registered health fund. Paragraph 10 of schedule 2 of the bill contains a ministerial power to exempt certain schemes, for example where an employer meets health expenses not covered by employees who maintain appropriate registered health insurance cover. Currently, funds are required to notify the secretary within seven days after they change their rules, constitution or articles and such changes may be disallowed on a retrospective basis. As a means to further safeguard community rating, paragraph 43 of schedule 1 of the bill provides for changes to be notified prospectively. Advice about changes in premiums will need to be provided seven days before the day on which they are to apply while other changes to rules will need to be notified 60 days before the effective date. However, a ministerial discretion will be available to accept notifications for a lesser period where the changes provide for the introduction of new products in response to consumer demands. The opportunity has also been taken under paragraph 61 of schedule 1 of the bill to modify the pre-existing ailment rule to reduce administrative difficulties for funds. This change is not expected to have any significant impact on members. The decline in participation rates for private health insurance has attracted cries from the opposition parties, the AMA and industry groups for the government to subsidise the cost of private insurance by way of tax rebates. Persons on low incomes, such as pensioners, would gain no benefit from tax subsidies. Furthermore, such proposals ignore the fact that Medicare already provides funding for private patients. Any additional subsidy large enough to increase private insurance participation would cost more than treating the newly insured in the public system. Or, put another way, the massive budget cuts to public hospitals required to fund tax rebates would have a far greater impact than any increase in demand from former fund members. This bill will place the health insurance industry in a position to work with hospitals, doctors and contributors to ensure the future of efficient and affordable private health insurance packages that offer both protection and value for money for consumers. I commend the bill to the House. NA COMPLAINTS LEVY BILL 1994 The bill provides for a levy to be imposed on health insurance businesses of registered health funds to finance the administration expenses of the complaints commission. It is proposed that the rate of the levy, which will be prescribed by regulations, will be a maximum of 25c per quarter for single contributors and 50c per quarter for family contribu tors. The levy is not expected to exceed about 6c single and 12c family per quarter during the first year. I commend this bill to the House.",31
43,Mrs BISHOP,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I could say right at the outset, 'Welcome Miss America.' This is the first appearance of the Minister for Human ServiCes and Health (Dr Lawrence) to introduce legislation into the House since she has held the portfolio. She normally sends her parliamentary secretary, the honourable member .for Calwell (Dr Theophanous)-who I must say does the job rather well. I must say that the minister read her bureaucratic speech quite nicely. I say 'Welcome Miss America' for the very good reason that the minister is taking us down the American track of managed care. The reasons for that will become apparent as we deal with the bill that she has introduced today. Let me say at the outset that thcpackage she announced in August 1994, which these bills are meant to implement, in fact is different. These bills do not do what she said they would do back in 1994, either in outcome or in content. We can only expect that there will be need for further legislation to introduce the things which are simply not here. The second thing is that the minister said her second reading speech, she said in August 1994 and she says again and again that these packages will bring down the cost of premiums and therefore make it more attractive to people to insure, because it is certainly the cost of private health insurance premiums that has caused the rate of fund membership to plummet. However, the evidence from both people in the industry and people who were being denied consultation with the minister or her department-and that has certainly been a constant factor in all the submissions that I have received; and here are but some of them-is that there has been no adequate consultation, and these people want to .have their point of view heard. . Within the health insurance funds those who are allegedly the beneficiaries of this legislathe tion get more power. In the words of the minister, they get greater power to negotiate with hospitals and then doctors to screw down the price so that the funds can then charge a cheaper premium. The only thing is that, with the manner in which the bills will operate, premiums will not come down-and health fund afterherilth fund has said that they will not come down; they will in fact go up. For that reason, we are moving a second reading amendment to the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill. If it is carried, the opposition will not decline the bill a second reading. The amendments require certain changes to be made to the bill which will make it fair and equitable. I will explain how that is to be done. It also provides that there be at least three questions which need to be examined by a Senate committee to see whether or not the bill will serve the ends which it is meant to serve. The first of those is a constitutional point: whether or not the legislation as introduced in fact amounts to a civil conscription as outlawed by our constitution under section 51(xxiiiA). Let us go right to the heart of it. The minister said she wants more competition. I am all for competition. She is going to introduce casemix funding as a basis of episode of in care funding. We do not oppose that concept. But what we do oppose is the concept that the health funds in this country will be given unprecedented power that no other system of health funds has anywhere else in the world. It works this way: the minister told us that this legislation would enable health funds to enter into contracts to provide care for contributors. There is nothing to prevent health funds doing that at this very minute, as we speak-and, indeed, many have done precisely that, in Victoria in particular. In Victoria the evidence was that the premiums went up, and a small piece of logic will tell you why. Under a provider agreementthere is a form of gap insurance-you can insure for the whole cost of an episode of care. But of course that means the funds have to actually pay more money out when the claims are made, and if funds have to pay more money out it is logical to conclude that the premiums will go up. As well as that, we will have a whole system of complaints bureaucracy under this bill which enables the minister to: choose the complaints commissioner; tell him or her how much they will get by way of salary; what people employed by the commissioner can be chosen by the commissioner; choose the terms and conditions of employment; and second people from the department to back up the commissioner. Might I say, Minister, there would be nothing to prevent you from appointing your very good friend Mr Eastson, the man who presented the petition to the Western Australian parliament when you were the Premier, which was found to be untrue and yet it went in with your concurrence. You could appoint anyone you like. You could perhaps even give him another $200,000 like you gave him previously. In other words, Minister, I think we are entitled to take a good look at just what sort of person you might choose to appoint. But then you want the contributors to pay for the cost of this bureaucracy, and it can expand. We will be opposing the levy bill because it is a new tax and it is in a separate bill because it is a new tax. The constitution requires that all new taxes must be in a separate bill. So what is new in this bill to make it more attractive for private health insurance funds negotiate preferred provider agreements with hospitals and/or doctors? I will tell you. They have the power not to pay any money to hospitals they do not in fact have a contract with. Let us look at the impact of that. It means if I want to have my appendix out my choice of doctor might be Dr Bloggs over there. But Dr Bloggs only operates in a hospital owned by Dr Lawrence. However, my health fund, to which I have been paying my premiums of over $1,000 a year, does not have a contract with Dr Lawrence's hospital; it has one with Dr Theophanous' s hospital and a range of others. My Dr Bloggs does not operate anywhere else, so I cannot choose the doctor I want, and I cannot choose the hospital I want. My choice becomes more limited. Unlike the minister, I actually have private health insurance. I have always had private health insurance because I believe I have an obligation to look after myself. Senator Richardson, when he was the minister, said that for Medicare to work-and I support Medicare-it was necessary that 40 per cent of the population be covered by private health insurance. Otherwise the strain on the public sector would be too great. The result of the strain being too great is that we have 112,000 Australians on a waiting list because they cannot get into the public hospitals because people who can afford to take out private health insurance have not. The estimate is that for everyone per cent of people who leave private health insurance-and we are now down to 36.6 per cent-it costs the government, or rather the taxpayer because governments do not have any money, another $100 million in services that have to be provided in the public sector. The minister even admits to a figure of $60 million-that is, per year. I have asked the good minister, when she has come into the parliament twice a week, what she believes the critical mass is. Does she agree with her former colleague Senator Richardson? Is it 40 per cent? But she will not tell me. So all we have to go on is the caucus-ACTU working party paper that looked at private health insurance. It says that a worse case scenario is that it could fall to 20 per cent. If it falls to to 20 per cent, if you accept the industry figure of $100 million per one per cent drop, then the minister has to find $1.6 billion per annum to make up the shortfall. On her own admitted figures, it is $1 billion a year. Where are we going to find that? The minister said yesterday that the Medicare levy is outdated. Well she should say that, because it only raises less than 10 per cent of the health care bill. In this country it costs us $34 billion annually-$34,000 million. Of that, $15 billion comes from the federal coffers, $8 billion from the state coffers and $11 billion from the private sector, the pockets of private individuals. That of course includes health funds. Let us go back to these agreements. There is nothing wrong with the agreements. They are a good idea. As I said, they can have them now. But, if we have such an agreement, the health fund is obliged under the existing National Health Act-good name for legislation that: National Health Act-to make a payment regardless of whatever hospital you go into. We do that by having something called the basic table. The minister prescribes how much has to be paid. It is a schedule to that act. The health funds know the basic table is not enough to give people adequate care when they want to use a private hospital, so they have come up with something called supplementary tables. That enables them to pay more. But under this bill the minister gives the power to the health funds. If I-going back to my example of having my appendix out-go to the hospital of my choice and have the doctor of my choice, which are not covered by the provider agreement, then so far as the hospital cost is concerned my health fund can determine to pay as little as 50c and I have to pay the entire bill. What use is my health insurance? I intend to move a second reading amendment here and then when the bill goes to the Senate have it immediately referred to a standing committee to investigate whether or not, among other things, the bills are constitucould tional-because they may not be legal. Secondly, it should decide whether the starting date, when the funds and the hospitals are supposed to have concluded their deals, can really be 1 July 1995-the experience in Victoria was that when the funds went to negotiate their agreements it took 12 months-or whether it finds another date is reasonable and recommends that. Thirdly, it should decide whether or not the structure of the payments under casemix is going to be adequate and also whether or not the question of privacy is adequately dealt with. One thing Australians do not know is that every time we go to the doctor and he prescribes something for us and we use Medicare-whetherit is bulk-billed or whether we pay a bit extra the Medicare component is there-all the details about us go onto the database of the Health Insurance Commission, which is owned by the department, here in Canberra. It is a database which contains all the details of our illness. If you go to a private hospital and you are not using Medicare your details remain private to you. To me, privacy is a most important issue, and one that I am quite passionate about. The HIC and something called a council are nvo groups that are entitled to get information under this legislation. Those two organisations are to have access to this information for the purpose of evaluation and modelling. There is no definition of evaluation and that information is not protected. My suggestion is-and I am foreshadowing the amendment-that the Privacy Commissioner who has been appointed to look after our privacy should bring down the guidelines on how that sensitive information is dealt with, not the minister. That would mean that for the first time the Privacy Commissioner is answerable to the parliament and not just to the executive government. That is a very important thing. We need the Privacy Commissioner to look after us. Others have come up with a different suggestion and have said, 'Well, perhaps it is better if we have an independent agency'not government and not Big Brother having the information. This independent agency supply the information when required by the department and the council for evaluation so that they can work better on casemix information. It would be a protection. It is important that the Senate looks at that question as well. There is no reason why these amendments cannot be moved and the bill be passed into law because the amendments do not stop the bill; they make it fairer and better. Health funds own their own hospitals. There is a good incentive in this legislation for health funds to do a deal with their own hospitals and leave others out. It might be useful to put on the record the problem as it is known and perceived by a smallish rural, regional hospital. This hospital sees the situation as perhaps forcing it out of business. This is an example of the power that this bill, unless amended, gives to the funds. I have a letter signed by the chief executive officer of the Berwick hospital and it states: Berwick Hospital: * is located 40 kilometres south east ofMelboume within the most explosive 'Growth Corridor' in Victoria. * is affiliated with the Victorian Bush Nursing Association. * differs from the usual V.B.N.A. agency because of the large amount of surgery (advanced and minor) performed and obstetric admissions accepted. It is a hospital that can serve the local community. The letter continues: * is an acute 38 bed hospital which has, to date, held its occupancy at between 60-70%. * has two major private competitors within a 20 kilometre radius. Both are large private for profit hospitals and are owned by corporate entities (one with a health fund connection). There is nothing wrong with having hospitals that are for profit. Our private hospitals basically come in as for profit, and that is why they are operated. We have not-for-profit hospitals which are conducted by charities such as St John of God, St Vincent's and others. Finally, we have the public structure. The letter goes on: The Hospital presently has provider agreementsThey are the ones that we have now and which are not dependent upon this legislation. The letter continues: The Hospital presently has provider agreements with most health funds. however there is no guarantee that these arrangements will continue at the same level when the reforms are implemented by legislation. It is of concern that it would be of financial benefit to both our competitors if the agreements were not renewed ... I will read that again: . . . it would be of financial benefit to both our competitors if the agreements were not renewed as it would give the opportunity for one of the Iarger groups to take over the hospital or for the hospital to close due to reduced financial returns. The hospital sees that it can go out of business. The letter continues: As a smailÂ·operator, Berwick Hospital will not have the negotiating powers or be in a position to counteractthe influence over the Health Funds that the larger Hospital groups (such as Healthscope) may have, particularly when negotiating the provider agreement. In other words, they are saying that the power is all on one side. They have nothing to fall back on. It goes on: The Lawrence reforms will give the health fund this power to determine (through rebate) which Hospitals will survive or be financially ""starved"". The deletion of the basic tableI will come back to this in a minute(the safety net for ""all"" hospitals) that is, the one in the present actmay assist the Health Funds in this process. In other words, the provisions in this bill, getting rid of the safety net provided for in the current legislation, will assist the funds to put people out of business. The letter continues: The Reforms outline an appeal mechanism, however, when a Hospital accomplishes a small surplus for the year, say equivalent to approximately one month's expenditure, it would have little reserves to survive the twelve month appeal delay! Good point: no cheap justice here. I go on: The process of Medical Practitioners contracting will have similar effects on small independent Hospitals (such as Berwick) as described above regarding the financial arrangements. The public will .attend facilities without ""out of pocket"" expenses. The larger ""for profit"" Hospitals will be able to offer Practitioners incentives to enter contracts and service only those Hospitals. Power to saY,as in the American system, 'You've got to go to that hospital and you've got to have that doctor.' The chief executive officer continues: Overall, this package put forward by Dr Lawrence will give the health funds unprecedented powers over small independent Hospitals, increase the funds profitability through reduced rebates to those Hospitals and add to the decline of people with health insurance due to the loss of the small ""not for profit"" institutions within their communities. I am aware of your discussionswith the private health associationsand thank you for the opportunity to put forward my views as Chief Executive Officer of a small acute hospital. I am deeply concerned for the survival of this community's Hospital given Dr Lawrence's program and would be pleased to provide any further information that you may require. A plea from the heart from a man who cares for his community. . I have said it before: health is not a market; health is about pain and suffering. The reason there are 112,000 Australians on a waiting list is because they are adjudged to be wanting elective surgery. What does that mean? It means you are not about to die tomorrow, but it takes no account of pain or agony or suffering. On my desk I have a legion of letters from people saying, 'We can't get in.' Dr Lawrence has said that this will make health insurance more attractive. The bottom line is: is she going to join up? She does not have any private health insurance but when she wanted to go to hospital, and when Mr Keating, who does not have private health insurance either, wanted to go to hospital, they get in a queue? No, never; they slipped between the floral sheets of a private hospital. And they did it because they could afford it. Mr Keating can afford a $2.2 million house. Dr Lawrence over here had $5,000 of taxpayers' money in her account for 15 months which she forgot about. You have to be pretty rich to forget 5,000 bucks. She gave it back when she was reminded. It came out of the same account that Mr Burke went to gaol for. I ask the minister: is she going to join Is this package of hers so attractive that she is going to join up? Tell us. Is Mr Keating going to join up? After you paid for your private health stint, both of you could claim, after your first $1,000 of expenditure-at about 500 bucks a day it does not take long to get that u-a 20c in the dollar tax rebate. But do the struggling mums and dads paying private health insurance get any help? Never, and yet it is their premiums that kept that hospital bed available for you. Eighty per cent of the revenue that keeps private hospitals open comes from the private health insurance funds. Twelve per cent comes from people who have workers' comp, or like arrangements. Eight per cent of funds comes from the likes of Dr Lawrence and Mr Keating. They cannot survive unless mums and dads are willing to pay their private health insurance. I am paying mine. I have always paid it. But, when this bill takes away my freedom to choose, is it going to be worth my while to keep private health insurance? How many other Australians are going to ask the same question? When the price goes up more and we get less, we can thank 'Miss America'. The points which are outlined in the amendment to be moved by me-the drafting instructions for which are to be done subsequent to the Senate having an investigation to look at those points-will provide that the funds would have to pay a hospital that is not covered by a provider agreement 50 per cent of what they would have to pay to one that is. That would not cease in 1997 when the safety net goes, because up till 1997 a fund can elect to operate as it does now on the basic table did and with its supplementary tables. Schedule 4 of this bill says that in 1997 that arrangement ceases. Our amendments would mean that the funds would have to go on paying at least 50 per cent. The Senate may decide it should be more-I do not know-but this would give protection to hospitals like Berwick. It is fair, because even in the bill the minister has chosen to allow choice to exist with regard to medical services. If a doctor chooses not to sign up and to remain independent so that the relationship remains up? between the doctor and the patient and not between the doctor and the health fund, with the patient as the commodity, then the payment in perpetuity will remain as it is. That means that in a private hospital the Medicare payment will be 75 per cent of the MBS fee and the fund will provide 25 per cent. I require-and I think it is fair-that doctors inform patients of just how much any additional costs should be. I think financial consent is an important ingredient. It is not in the bill, but it should be. This bill attacks community rating, because it allows people to enter into agreements which say, 'We will cover you for this amount of illness, but we won't include psychiatric treatment and hip replacement.' So the principle of community rating, which is basically that the young and the healthy subsidise the old and the sick, will be defeated because people will be able to elect to insure only for the things they might incur. That is called risk rating. That is the American system.We say in our amendment that community ratings shall stay. The proposals foreshadowed in the second reading amendment allow the bills to proceed but make them fairer. They take away some powers of the minister. Under this bill, once we have gone through this protracted process of the health funds having done deals with the hospitals and/or doctors, the minister can intervene. She can say, 'I don't really like your agreements. I will have a bit of intervention here. I will change things.' We take that power away. We want the Privacy Commissioner to have the say about privacy, not the minister. We do not think it is fair that the contributors have to pay for the complaints commissioner, because basically the complaints will be about the government's own policy. We think the government ought to wear the cost. We think that there should be an appeal against this commissioner, who has the power to refer things to other people and has the power to take documents about anyone. We think there should be quick and speedy justice and appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Everything we are proposing will make the bills fairer and more equitable. Should the minister accept this assertion of principle, then we are happy to give this bill a second reading. But should the minister refuse to accept those very fair principles, then we will decline to give the bill a second reading. We oppose the levy bill because it is a new tax, and we do not think it is warranted. Once again I say that this is the minister's debut, that this is the first time she has come into this chamber to debate legislation. Perhaps she did not expect me to be here today. I now formally move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House will not decline to give the Bill a second reading if the following assertions of principle are agreed to, being of the opinion that: (1) there is no evidence that the Bill will objective of reducing private health insurance premiums so as to stem the flow from health fund membership; in fact the evidence contrary; (2) freedom of choice of doctor and hospital is effectively denied; (3) there is no adequate default payment provision for patients treated in hospitals other than under hospital purchase-provider agreements; (4) the community rating principle is undermined by allowing contracts between health funds and contributors to exclude coverage for the treatment of certain illnesses and conditions; (5) there is no specific appeal mechanism from the Complaints Commissioner; (6) the Bill grants the Minister excessive power, specifically: (a) the ability to intervene in contracts, applicable benefits arrangements, complaints, and mergers of health funds; (b) power to intrude upon the privacy of individual patients, without adequate guidelines and safeguards being provided, and (c) to avoid competition policy and the provisions of the Trade Practices Act. (7) many in the industry have not been able to have their view heard, and accordingly, the Bill should be referred to the Senate Committee on Community Affairs to examine inter alia: (a) the question as to whether the amendments to the Principal Act made by this Bill may be construed as an authorisation of any form of civil conscription in relation to medical and dental services as prohibited by section 51 (xxiiiA) of the Constitution; (b) the submission made by the Australian Private Hospital Association that the date of the implementation of the mandatory contractual agreements be delayed until 1 July 1996 with the agreements remaining in place till then, and the apparent inflexibility of Casemix based payment systems; (c) the provision of an independent agency to receive information under the Hospital Casemix Protocol; (8) should this second reading amendment not be agreed to, the Bill's second reading should be declined. I sincerely hope that the government has the good sense to accept the assertion of principle and allow the bills to become fair and workable so that the Australian people will not have to continue to suffer as this government meet the has made them suffer in the past.",35

45,Mr GIBSON,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Moreton) (11.46 a.m.)Today is a very interesting day. The contrast in the two performances that we have had this morning emphasises the interesting nature of today. As my colleague the honourable th'ember for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has already commented, the speech we heard from the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) is her farewell speech as shadow spokesperson for health. The contrast in the delivery between the speeches of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and the former shadow minister for health emphasises why the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has taken the action that he has. The contrast is very stark. The delivery of the two speeches, one by the minister and one by the shadow minister, emphasises the very clear fact, the fact that is clear to all Australians, that whilst the minister's star continues to shine brightly and will continue to parliament and in this nation, the shadow minister's star continues to decline. That is not surprising when we hear delivered a speech such as the one we have just heard. There is a very sharp contrast between the minister's balanced, factual, rational and sensible explanation of these proposed reforms to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of private health insurance and the shadow minister's speech, which was rambling and disjointed, full of hyperbole, falsehoods and myths and, unfortunately, also full of personal abuse and attack-abuse which was not found in the minister's address. Unfortunately we have one more shadow minister's star disappearing down that incredible black hole of opposition health policy. We have lost many shadow health ministers over the years. I think the minister said the other day that there have been eight shadow health ministers in six years. If the performance we have just had today is any indication of the quality of performance we will continue to get from the opposition, it is no wonder we are continuing to have this long list of failures by the opposition. There has been no sensible, reasonable, rational argument about what are the issues we need to address with private health insurance-or with health and health policy generally in this country-or as to what are some positive solutions to them. As I said, we had a rambling, disjointed speech which made no real, powerful points and which in fact had no real substance to it. It will come as no surprise to the shadow minister-and I have not had the chance personally to ask the Minister for Human Services and Health about it but I think I am standing on pretty firm ground when I say this to the House-that the government will not be supporting the proposed amendment because it is a ridiculous set of words which continues to emphasise the complete failure of the opposition to come up with any sort of health policy for Australians. For that the opposition should be condemned. If it is supposed to be an effective opposition, it is supposed to put up alternative policy formulae, but we are continuing to have a dismal rise in this performance on its part. The problem has been that the ex-shadow minister for health has not been prepared to engage in the detailed research, analysis and discussion across the whole industry that the government was involved in-and that I personally was involved with-when formu;,. lating these proposals; She just gets a few letters here and there or goes and talks to her mates in the AMA or in a couple of other particular sectors. That is the basis upon which she tries to develop her arguments rather than doing what the government has done; that is, engage in very broad consultation across the whole industry. I was the co-convenor of the caucus-ACTU working group on health, which the shadow minister mentioned. That group engaged in detailed analysis of private health insurance. It dealt with the decline in membership in private health insurance, the impact of that on the general health sector in this country and what we needed to do about that, the importance of the issue, and whether we needed government intervention to prop up the private health insurance industry. In that process, we wrote to every sector of the health industry and we talked to every industry group. We talked to doctors, surgeons, general practitioners; private hospitals, private insurance companies, public hospitals, administrators, consumers and pensioners. We talked to groups across the whole sector. The very clear message we got was that government money-the public's money-does not need to be taken out of the public system to prop up our private health insurance system. The needs of the public hospital system are not addressed by taking money out of the public system and putting it into the private system. The continuing problem for opposition members-it has not just beef!. the problem of the current shadow minister for health or the most recent ex-shadow minister for health; the opposition's health policy has been a problem for the last 10 years-is that they do not understand the facts and the interrelationships within the health industry. They grab hold of a couple of myths and they base their whole policy on those couple of myths. The government does not do that. The legislation we are debating here today is based on a sound, factual analysis of what the real issues are in private health insurance, and it deals with how we can address the needs of private health insurance without attacking the fundamental basis of the public health system. By strengthening the competitiveness and the efficiency of the private health insurance sector, we will make that sector more able to deal with the needs of its consumers and provide a much better product for its consumers without having to impact negatively on the quality of care provided by both the public hospital system and the private health system. I think we need to look at some of the myths which are the basis of the opposition's attack on this legislation and which were the basis of the contribution of the ex-shadow minister for health in this debate on the legislation morning. The ex-shadow minister for health draws a direct connection between the decline in membership of private health insurance companies and the numbers of people in the public hospital system on waiting lists for various surgeries. She says, 'Well, because private health insurance is declining, they are automatically going on to these public hospital lists.' Unfortunately, the facts do not bear that out. That is not what is happening. The people who are leaving private health insurance are those who are not using their private health insurance because, in large measure, they are not utilising health services. They are finding that spending $1,500 Ii year on private health insurance is a waste of money because they are not using medical services. It is largely the younger and healthier people who are not continuing with private health insurance or who are not taking it out in the first place. They see no need for it because they are well served by Medicare. During this significant decline in membership of private health insurance, there has been a significant increase in the use of private hospitals. So there is no evidence that all of these people leaving private health insurance are suddenly going on to the public hospital waiting lists. There has been a continual growth in the utilisation of private hospitals all through this period. The problem for opposition members and for those who argue for things like tax rebates, government subsidies and public subsidies for private health insurance is that they keep confusing the issues of the financing and funding of the health system, and the provision of services. They are two separate issues. The other argument those opposite continue to expound is that there are two totally separate systems: a private health system that operates totally independently-people take out private health insurance and that is how they access the system-and a public health system. They argue that they are two separate systems. Wrong, wrong, wrong! They are totally intermeshed. Medicare is based on the private delivery of health services. People can go to their private doctor of choice. If the this doctor bulk-bills, then the government pays the doctor directly. That Medicare service is publicly funded through the tax system. If the doctor does not bulk-bill, people can go to Medicare and claim a rebate on the fee. You automatically have, just with that delivery of ordinary GP services, a mixture of public and private systems in financing and in delivering. Within our public hospitals, we have private beds and public beds. We have private doctors who deliver services in public hospitals. It is a totally intertwined system. Private hospitals do not offer the complete broad array of all medical services. The public hospital system does, but the private hospital system, in large measure, offers very narrow, very specific services. You cannot go to a private hospital to get absolutely everything carried out that you might need. In large measure, it is the public hospital system that leads the way in medical research and the most expensive cardiac and cancer medicine-all of those very expensive medical and hospital services. They are all largely done in the public sector, not the private sector. So that is another myth that we constantly hear in this argument; that they are two separate independent systems. They are not, never have been and never will be. They are very much intertwined and intermixed. The third myth concerns the shadow minister trotting out statements about the minister or the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) taking out health insurance and bludging on the system. All of these are ridiculous ments, and we hear them all the time. She believes the myth that there are hoards of people bludging on the system and not taking out private health insurance. Let us look at the facts instead of the myths that are stantly perpetuated in this argument. Only 19.5 per cent of people whose incomes are over $1,000 a week do not have private health insurance. More than 80 per cent of those people who are on incomes of $50,000 or more have private health insurance. Out of those 19.5 per cent, the vast bulk of people continue to use private health services. Mrs Bishop--Do you have insurance?",40
46,Mr GIBSON,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"They utilise private hospimuch tals, and they are continuing to utilise private hospital services. Mrs Bishop--Do Â·you have health insurUnfortunately ance?",43
47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE, now Order! The member for Mackellar is provokcoming on deck. ing the chair. The member for Moreton has the call.,43
48,Mr GIBSON,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy been four in four years. Speaker. The higher income earners who are not members of private health insurance funds choose to continue to use private hospital services. There is no evidence at all that higher income earners are clogging up the public health system. When they use the public health system-as is their right because, as higher income earners, they are paying a much higher contribution to the tax wealth of this country through our progressive tax system and, therefore, to the support of the health system-it is because the private system does not provide the services. This is in regard to major health areas involving heart problems and cancer where the private system does not operate. So there is no evidence at all that there is a hoard of wealthy people out there bludging on the system. The shadow minister mentioned that the Prime Minister goes to a private hospital and pays the fee. So she admits that he is not clogging up the health system; he is doing what a lot of people are doing: self-insuring. These people are not prepared to cough up the $1,500 a year because they did not believe the compackage of private health insurance we had was worthwhile. What we are doing in this rich legislation will make that private health insurance package a much better and more attractive product, a product that people will conbe willing to stay with and think is worthwhile. That is what these reforms are all about-and they will succeed. There are lots of people who are choosing not to be in the private system, but that does not mean they are clogging up the public health system. The final myth is about providing tax subsidies, tax rebates or tax credits-all these little terms that are bandied about with not much explanation of what they mean, how they will cost or where they will cut in. We have been waiting for 12 months or so for the shadow minister to outline what she would do if she became minister for health. we are not going to experience that-should I say fortunately-because we have the ninth shadow health minister Mrs Bishop--You can be the fifth minister in four years for the government. There have",43
49,Mr GIBSON,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"But we have had a continuous and very successful health system all through that period. We have not had the constant chops and changes in health policy that you have had on the opposition side. We hear the argument that somehow if we. introduce tax credits, benefits or something like that, hundreds of thousands of people will start flocking back into private health insurance. They will suddenly say, 'Yes, this is a great deal.' The problem is that tax credits tax rebates do not operate for low income earners. The vast majority of pensioners pay very little tax and there is no detail given about how these tax credits will cut in. There is absolutely no evidence-it is another myth-in this country or internationally that introducing some form of very expensive tax credit system will cause a massive increase in private health insurance. The associated myth is that somehow that fixes the demands occurring on the public health system. We recognise that there are demands and stresses and strains from time to time in public health system; and it is unacceptable that people have to wait some time for surare gery. We accept that and we are working deal with it. But you do not fix the demands on the public health system and its ability to cope by taking $2 billion to $3 billion out it and putting it into the private system. You else.' do not fix the public system by cutting its funds and reducing the amount of money available. That is the other fundamental flaw in the opposition argument. It does not up. I have yet to hear an explanation from anyone that taking $1 billion, $2 billion or billion-I cannot be more specific because do not know exactly what the opposition intends with its tax credit policy-out of the public system suddenly fixes all the problems there. I do not know how the opposition can talk in this place and outside about this great matters. tax credit system that will fix all the woes of the public health system. If anybody can health explain how cutting $1 billion to $3 billion from the public health system is going to fix the demands on it, that person should be Rhodes scholar and must have some very nation great creative logic. The legislation that we are debating here today has a very strong emphasis on the rights and needs of the contributors to the private health funds. What we are about in this legislation is giving them, as members of September 1993: those health funds, more say in the way health services are delivered. The former shadow minister keeps talking about the power of the health funds and what or dreadful power the health funds will have. Health funds are not private companies; they are organisations made up of contributors. They are not profitable organisations. Nobody gets a profit statement at the end of each year, with profits being distributed to shareholders. Health funds are owned by the contributors. We are about giving those contributors more say on the costs of medicine, the way in which medical services are provided, what they are charged for, what types of services they are able to get, and what they are covered for. We are giving them more right to the raise concerns about the method of charging for those services and about the prices they charged. We are going to give contributo tors more information about what doctors charge and more power to say, 'No, I don't want that fee at that level. If you are going to of charge that, I am going to go somewhere This is a very positive package of reforms. It reasserts the rights of consumers and contributors in this process. This package of add legislation should be strongly supported because it is a reasonable, rational set of proposals which will address the fundamental issues within private health insurance and $3 allow the government to deal with the main I issues that we face in health today: primary health care, medical services and hospital services across the country. They are the real first order issues. By passing this legislation, we will address the private health insurance",43
50,Ms WORTH,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Adelaide) (12.06 p.m.}--Our system is something that all Australians have a stake in and, as such, it is an area for potential bipartisanship. So, in a perfect a world, planning the best of health for the would be an exercise free of politics. While Labor remains straitjacketed by ideology, the need for reform to stop the exit from private health insurance has had quite some build-up. The former minister and then senator, Graham Richardson, said on 10 I think my primary role is to administer Medicare, and that means public access in public hospitals. That has to be the thrust of all that I do, but you can't do it properly unless there's a vibrant private sector and I think that's what has been missed over the course of the last few years . . . The former minister had the courage to recognise the real situation in the public health system and in public hospitals, when he went on to say: One reason why those waiting lists are long, why it is such a difficulty, is that we've just let private health insurance numbers get too low ... the drift into the public system, which we've heralded as such a great system, has I think gotten to the stage now where we can't take it any more. Graham Richardson was concerned, as is the coalition, at the dramatic fall-off in those who have private health insurance. In round figures, the fall has been about 20 per cent in the last 10 years. Of great concern but of no real surprise is the increase in the number of those aged 65 and over who are taking out private health insurance. For the year 1992-93 the figure is up by 12,000 to 844,000, while the number for those aged 64 or less fell by 208,000 to 6,124,000. We all know that we have an ageing population. Statistics tell us that every day. We know that this ageing population will require additional health care, but this government does not give one hint that it is planning for that-in fact, quite the opposite. It says whatever is necessary in the weeks before an election to hang on to power and then, once elected, it is back to all talk and no real action or reform. Graham Richardson, in reflecting on the years of Labor's rule, stated: There ought not to be a rule in Australian politics against thinking ahead. We have operated in a fog for a number of years in which that rule has I think been observed, by and large by too many of us. We think three years between elections-we can do something in the first, try and wrap it up in the second, and in the thirdwhich we are in nowspend the time talking about what we will do next time. That's a pretty pathetic way to run Government. Free of the constraints of being a Labor senator, Graham Richardson has had even more to say. In the Bulletin on 13 September 1994, he wrote: Convincing the Labor Party that the rapid decline in the number of Australians who take out private health insurance is any sort of problem is a very difficult task. Contemplating any change to the arrangements for Medicare can be downright hazardous for an ambitious health minister. The final unveiling of Carmen Lawrence's new reforms for private health insurance provided a predictable outcome ... they also stop short of addressing the problem. He continues: Labor health ministers are not allowed to believe that the decline in private health insurance (the percentage of Australians covered is down to 37.2% and the economic recovery appears to have done little to stop the exodus) is anything other than a vote of confidence in Medicare. They are also not allowed to believe that the public hospital system will ever find itself unable to cope with the influx of formerly insured citizens, which one day will create one hell of a problem. Having identified Labor's inability to look beyond ideology to reality, Mr Richardson continues: The dropouts from private health insurance are mostly younger and healthier people. They present no problem now because, apart from incidents of trauma, they are unlikely to need the services of public hospitals. Eventually of course they will age, get sick more often and the nation will face a very serious problem. Sadly, the current Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) will not face up to this very serious problem. Today I have quite deliberately quoted someone from the Labor side of politics because all too often, and including the last speaker, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), those opposite dismiss arguments from this side of the House as being political. This legislation is supposedly about reforms but it is full of problems. The minister claims that this legislation will reverse the trend of declining numbers with private health insurance. I argue the direct opposite. People are opting out because of the increasing cost of premiums. Dr John Loy, the First Assistant Secretary of the Department of Human Services and Health, told the AMA-convened forum last October that this legislation was not intended to reduce the cost of premiums. It is importantthat this legislation is properly scrutinised by a Senate committee. There has been little community debate and no consumer consultation. Those working in the system have expressed their reservations and fears. This legislation has the potential to change the way private health care is delivered in the future. Mindful of the responsibilities and obligations I have being a member in this place, I have done some consulting in my own electorate. The President of the Australian Private Hospitals Association and Chief Executive of Adelaide's Ashford Community Hospital, and also a constituent of mine, Mr Geoff Sam says: ... this legislation will result in private hospitals facing a bureaucratic nightmare and big rises in administrative costs of at least 15%. Mr Sam claims: ... the costs would inevitably result in higher costs to consumers. This is the American style health system and in America, administrative costs ballooned. As Mr Sam puts it: An army of administrators and bureaucrats will send costs up leading to premiums going up with the result that more people will opt out putting additional pressure on the public system. It seems that he and the former Senator Richardson have something to agree about. neglect Mr Sam is also concerned for the chronically and mentally ill 'as hospitals will be attracted to only take fast turnover patients'. I have also discussed this legislation with Mr Craig Hall, who is the President of the Private Hospitals Association of South Auspatients tralia and Chief Executive of St Andrew's Hospital in Adelaide. Mr Hall supports the before patients. claim made by Mr Sam that this legislation will result in further administrative costs the resulting increase in premiums. He further claims that consumers may not be able to legislation choose their hospital and their doctor-the very reason that people take out private health insurance. To be honest, I must say that I have had a letter from Mutual Community-a large health insurer from South Australia-seeking an assurance that I would not reject this legislation. I have also received ence from the Australian Health Insurance Association Ltd along similar lines. The letter claims: The legislation will allow health funds an opportunity to halt that dramatic escalation in the unit cost of hospitalisation. In other words, they recognise the power they are going to have with the purse strings. But the funds are not united in favour of this legislation. MBF has written to me expressing concerns, saying: The reform proposals do nothing to address the fundamental problem of funding in the private sector and little or no genuine consultation with the users of the health system has occurred or is envisaged. Research commissioned by MBF and conducted by the Roy Morgan Research Centre shows that the community is largely unaware of the proposals and their likely effects. Mr Greg Gardiner, the Chairman of the Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia, HCF, in the 1994 HCF general report, stated: . . . if increasing competition is based solely on cost containment this may lead to consumers being worse off. There is a danger that quality may be sacrificed to control costs. Should this legislation pass without amendment in the Senate, doctors will have greater incentives to look after the finanCial interests of the health funds than the health interests of their patients. I would not expect doctors to the interests of their patients, but it is worrying that such incentives are being quite deliberately put into the health system for the future. This legislation dramatically increases the power of the health insurance funds in a way which is contrary to the interests of and takes Australia perilously close to US-style managed care where profits come This government has a lot to answer for in and the problems facing the private health sector and now pretends so dishonestly that this is necessary for reform and change. This government has directly contributed to increases in the costs of private health insurance by shifting the cost of 25 per cent of the medical fee for in-patient care to the privately insured. This amounts to at least $200 million. It has also withdrawn the bed day subsidies to private hospitals at a cost of correspondabout $100 million. A further amount of $100 million has been taken out of the private health sector by withdrawing the federal government's contribution to the reinsurance pool. Claims have been made about out-of-pocket expenses and the need for legislation to fix it. Legislation is not necessary to fix it. I cannot make that point more clearly. Checks made with private hospitals in Adelaide provide an accurate picture rather than a bureaucratic or government story. Because of arrangements already in existence-and these are arrangements between those funds and those private hospitals; and I understand the same occurs in other statesthere are no out-of-pocket expenses for bed fees or theatre fees. There are in fact no outof-pocket expenses for pathology, because that is being provided with the schedule fee being charged. But there are gap expenses for physiotherapy, radiology and some doctors' fees. I have learnt that there can be out-of-pocket expenses of up to $900 for a patient having a hip replacement should that patient be allergic to stainless steel and need a titanium prosthesis. I understand this may be necessary for one in 50 patients requiring hip replacement surgery. Again, the government has something to answer for. It has allowed the medical benefit schedule to be eroded. One effect of this legislation is to shift further costs, those that arise because of the inadequate Medicare rebates, on to Australians who purchase private health insurance. These people are being hit on all sides. The government should do as its own ACTU-caucus working party has recommended and establish an independent review mechanism for setting medical benefits schedule fees. Contracts between health insurers and medical practitioners are not in the best interests of consumers. The arrangements pit individual medical practitioners against multimillion dollar corporations with enormous resources to deploy to achieve their objectives. Consumers only need to ask themselves whether they would be happy to have the insurance company through which their car is insured decide where and by whom their car would be serviced and repaired. I suggest they would not. They should then be prompted to think of how they should have some control over their own destiny when it comes to their health care. This legislation does provide for billing reform. However, only in circumstances where a doctor has a contract with the fund to charge at a particular level can there be access to the Medicare billing-HIC-ystem. Only a fund can direct bill the HIC billing system. The government is using this as an artificial device to force people into preferred insurance packages. Those who do not attend contracted doctors or who do not take out Commonwealth preferred packages are forced to claim their medical rebates at two locations. It should be remembered that many of these consumers are old, sick and frail and find such negotiations and claims difficult to manage. On the subject of billing arrangements, it is high time that this was made less complicated for consumers. Most people have come to grips with the 85 per cent of schedule fee rebate for a visit to the doctor for those out of hospital and with responsibility for the additional costs. But the billing system and paying of accounts for patients in hospital causes confusion and concern. The claim for the 75 per cent Medicare rebate for medical services while in hospital, to be followed by the claim to the health insurer for 25 per cent of the schedule fee and then making up the gap or difference, can be very complicated for consumers--often at a time when they are least able to cope. All too often doctors have not discussed financial arrangements with their patients nor thought it necessary to explain this minefield. Those involved in providing health care are familiar with the system--consumers are infrequently patients and while ill and frail are least able to handle these complicated billing arrangements. I would therefore encourage doctors and, in some instances, hospitals to not only give verbal advice to their patients and ensure informed financial consent for procedures and treatment but also enclose a simple explanation of this minefield with accounts. To do so would not require legislation but g06d common sense. There are no true reforms in this legislation. It is ironic that in the campaign before the last federal election, Labor scurrilously claimed that the coalition would introduce US-style health care. That was never going to happen. Now the minister through these so-called reforms is pushing US-style health care down the throats of Australians. It was good to see the minister here today speaking on the first piece of health legislation for which she has come into this chamber. As the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) said, she normally leaves it to her parliamentary secretary who, as I have said in the past, has really tried pretty hard. But it was good to see her front up. I am sorry she was not here to learn from what consumers and those working in the industry have had personally to say to me. When checking her appearances in this House, I actually discovered that this is only the fourth time she has spoken in this chamber. The first was her maiden speech, the second was on a health issue, the third was on an MPI, and now she has fronted today. In her speech, the minister claims no change in structure to the private hospitals. Again, my own consultations reveal otherwise. As I have already mentioned, there will be administrative changes and costs. But what of those hospitals-and this has all been put to me in the last 24 hours-that will suffer from the ever empowered and over-empowered health funds which will be given the opportunity and the power to decide, should this legislation pass, those hospitals that are no longer useful to them? It has been claimed by the industry in South Australia that community hospitals-and I stress community hospitals, which are not for profit hospitals-like Blackwood community, Glenelg community and Northern community will be under real threat. These hospitals may not be important to the government or to health funds but they are important to their local communities and are sacred sites because they have been there for a long time. The minister has failed to consult adequately. I trust that a Senate committee will not only thoroughly examine this legislation and give it close scrutiny but also listen carefully to all the players in the field, including consumers. The good health of all Australians is too important to just have legislation like this rushed through without proper consideration and amendment. When bureaucrats look at health and how it is funded and managed they see statistics. For those who work in the industry and those of us who represent our electorates, we know it is not just statistics. It is people. It is ageing people who are going to require greater assistance and greater care. It is people, as the member for Mackellar has said, who are suffering and who are in pain. It is people on waiting lists. It is people who are afraid of becoming sick. It is people who are just scared of the future. All of us know of those older people, even pensioners, who, I would argue, do without what many of us would consider the necessities of life so that they can have private health insurance, because they are scared of not having their choice of doctor and hospital. I support the member for Mackellar's second reading amendment and trust that this place and the Senate will give the matter due consideration. Debate (on motion by Mr Latham) adjourned.

NA Postponement Motion (by Mr Elliott) agreed to: That order of the day No.3, government business, be postponed until the next sitting. AUDIT (TRANSITIONAL AND MISCELLANEOUS) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 8 December. Second Reading",49
56,Mr ELLIOTT,BUSINESS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill proposes the repeal of the Audit Act 1901 and deals with the transitional and consequential matters arising from the repeal of that act and the enactment of proposed replacement legislation: namely, the Auditor-General Act 1994, the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1994 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1994. The Audit Act 1901 is a pervading, operational act that gives flesh to certain basic constitutional requirements for the raising spending of money by the Commonwealth and, to that end, provides a procedural framework for day-today financial administration and audit across the whole spectrum of Commonwealth activities. Its repeal and replacement, therefore, have an extensive impact. This bill is intended to permit an orderly transition to the new framework. In particular, this bill provides for the formal transfer, as appropriations, of balances from the Audit Act's existing fund accounting structure to the new structure established by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act 1994; the continuation in office of the person who may be the Auditor General as at 1 July 1995; the continuation of the existing arrangements for the position of independent auditor as auditor of the AustralPAIRS Ian National Audit Office; the continuation for the time being, until regulations under the replacement legislation come into operation, of the current safeguards, as agreed by parliament, under section 70D of the Audit Act 1901, in relation to the nature of audit and financial reporting disclosures for the security and intelligence agencies; and the making of regulations to cover a range of situations, at a procedural level, should it be needed, to demonstrate legal certainty to other parties so as to support a smooth transition to the new legislative framework-for example, for the continuation of the myriad contractual and other arrangements entered into under the authority of the repealed act, such as operating bank accounts, contract audits in progress, debtors' repayments by instalments, et cetera. The bill's extensive impact, however, can be seen in the schedule to the bill-in the proposed consequential amendments to the relevant provisions of the more than 100 other acts which refer in specific ways to the current Audit Act. The proposed amendments will replace those acts' Audit Act references with provisions that appropriately link them to the framework of the new financiallegislation. In relation to those Commonwealth authorities for which the schedule specifies consequential amendments to their enabling legislation so as to link those authorities to the and proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1994, it should be noted that the list is not exhaustive. The authorities are only those whose enabling legislation reflects part XI of the Audit Act 1901. A further transitional bill will be necessary to create the necessary linkages to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1994 for the 40 or so bodies whose enabling legislation does not reflect part XI. At the time of this bill's introduction into the House last sitting, there was no reason to expect that the then incumbent Auditor-General would not be the person in place at the proposed transition date of 1 July 1995. Consequently, the relevant transitional clause was drafted accordingly-that is, having regard to the proximity of the incumbent's age to 65, it was not considered necessary to also specify a fixed term for the continued appointment. However, with the office of Auditor-General now vacant, and on the reasonable expectation that someone will be appointed to that office before 30 June, there is now a need to be somewhat more circumspect in the transitional provision, to ensure that the intention reflected in the Auditor General Bill for a maximum seven-year appointment term is honoured. I therefore foreshadow that the government will be proposing an amendment to clause 8 to that effect. The introduction of a bill to replace the Audit Act should be marked as an event of particular significance in the history of the Commonwealth parliament. Apart from the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, the Audit Act is the oldest law passed by parliament that is still in operation. The long title of the Audit Act describes its purpose to be: An Act to make provision for the Collection and Payment of the Public Moneys and the Audit of Public Accounts and the Protection and Recovery of Public Property ... It has, for 93 years, done the job. This country has been well served by the financial principles established through its provisions, because it has indeed kept every Commonwealth government since Federation financially honest in more than just a rhetorical sense. Over nine decades, there have been countless departmental officials and auditors, and not a few parliamentarians, who have confidently looked to the Audit Act as both the shield and the sword of Commonwealth fmancial integrity. I am sure that none of them, were they here today, could have any doubt that the framework to be created by the legislation that is replacing the Audit Act will not only preserve that financial integrity but strengthen it. In that spirit I am very pleased to commend this bill to the House.  Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1994 is a further instalment in the updating of the Commonwealth government's accountability and auditing framework. This bill proposes to repeal the Audit Act 1901 and deals with the transitional and consequential matters arising from the repeal of that act and the enactment of replacement legislation. The coalition was pleased to see that the position of John Taylor was secured by the transitional bill. Given the effectiveness of Mr Taylor in exposing the government's waste and ineptness-in itself a full-time job, I might add-it was to be expected that the government would take the opportunity to install one of its lackeys. Sadly for the cause of balanced scrutiny, Mr Taylor has now left the office of Auditor-General. It is vital for good government that his replacement will insist on the same high standards as shown by Mr Taylor and will carry out the function of Commonwealth auditor in the same balanced and professional manner. I can assure the government that a professional, unbiased auditor is the only thing the coalition will settle for. We will not settle for any political hack. There is a way, of course, that the govern the ment can ensure that the next Auditor-General is free of any claim of bias and is acceptable to the parliament as opposed to just the ALP. The solution is to seek the approval of the Leader of the Opposition in the selection. I do not just mean to consult with him; I mean to seek his approval. We will not stand in the way of a fair and reasonable appointment. So I throw this challenge down to the government: let us not politicise this vital appointment; rather, let us seek a bipartisan consensus and join together in selecting the right person for the job. I await the government's response with eager anticipation. This transitional bill is part of a package of bills designed to improve accountability and financial management for the Commonwealth. This government has already failed the test of accountability and financial management. On the financial management side we have numerous examples of waste. Let me just refresh the memory of honourable members with a few examples. We have the financial disaster associated with Casselden Place at a cost to the taxpayer of some $71 million; we have $35 million wasted by the Defence Housing Authority through holding over 2,000 vacant houses and also paying rent for properties which it did not occupy; we have the lost savings of some $37 million through poor cash management practices; and we have the $170 million spent on consultancies so that ex-public servants can tell current public servants how to do their jobs. There are, of course, other examples but I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, you get the idea from the over $300 million worth of stupidity I have just given you examples of. On the issue of accountability we also have a failed government. Again, let me refresh the House's memory: we have that great example of the sports rorts where the government blatantly used taxpayers' funds for political purposes and, rather than face the issue, it fought against the findings until the bitter end when the former member for Canberra finally resigned from the ministry; and we have the credit card disaster with rampant fraud and abuse, including misplaced sunglasses, wristwatches and the acquisition of other matters on the government credit card. We now have the notorious example of the National Media Liaison Service. This example deserves special attention and special mention. This government employs a media unit ostensibly to spread the word on government policy. In reality it is a propaganda unit made up of political hacks dedicated to the return of the ALP to government. It does this by emphasising government strengths-which is not a big job, I might add, in its own rightand gathering dirt on anyone else, including the coalition. And who pays for this? It is not the Australian Labor Party; it is not the affiliated unions; it is not from donations-it is paid for by the taxpayer, by the Australian people. This is not money that goes to education, to preventing people suffering on hospital waiting lists or to building roads; in other words, the hard-earned money of ordinary Australians is not being used for the benefit of Australia or them, as it should be. Taxpayers' money is being used purely for the benefit of this government, and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) deserves the condemnation of this House for that. Then the Auditor-General wants to audit the National Media Liaison Service--or aNiMaLS, as it is more appropriately known. He wants to do this after the government has introduced new bills for greater accountability and talked a lot in this House about the need for greater accountability. What happens? The government blocks it. It stops it dead in its tracks, the excuse being that there is no legislative basis. Who blocks it-the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), who is the junior minister to the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley). Where was the Minister for Finance-the person who drew up the audit bills and spoke so much about the need for greater accountability? If the Minister for Finance cares so much about accountability-and if aNiMaLS was a legitimate use of taxpayers' money, providing clear benefits for Australians-why did he not instruct his junior minister to allow the audit? Why did he not follow through with the spirit of the new bills rather than hide behind the technical details of the existing legislation? The answer is simple. The Minister for Finance is not in the least bit interested in taxpayer value for money and accountability. He is more than happy being part of a selfserving government for mates, which will use whatever means necessary, say whatever is necessary and waste whatever money is needed to stay in power. The aNiMaLS case simply reinforces what we saw when the Auditor-General Bill 1994 was debated in this House. In that instance, the coalition parties sought to amend the bills to give the Auditor-General greater independence and access. In blind panic at the thought of a truly independent Auditor-General, the government voted it down. How ironic that aNiMaLS came up just after this grubby little incident on the need for greater accountability. The Minister for Finance and the government showed their true colours. It is a government which fears accountability for the simple reason that it would fail the test time and again. It is a government which knows that waste of taxpayers' money is rampant. New paintings for the cabinet room spring to mind as one example. It is a government which knows that large sums of money are wasted for blatant political purposes rather than spent in the national interest. It is a government which uses taxpayers' money to appease various interest groups. It knows that the Australian people would not tolerate it were it to be exposed, so it inhibits accountability and runs from scrutiny like Dracula from sunlight. This government is a failure when it to accountability and financial management. The failed record of accountability fits the government's failings across a range issues. On economic policy, it has singularly failed the Australian people. This country needs sustained growth to repair the damage caused by the Keating-developed recession, which was the worse recession in 60 years. From our economically illiterate Prime Minister, we get another boom-bust cycle. At a time when we still have 790,000 unemthink ployed people and are desperately in need sustained growth in investment, we have government putting up interest rates. At a time when the current account deficit has blown out of manageable proportions when the nation desperately needs savings, have a government maintaining a huge borat rowing program and draining national savings. Despite the rampant growth in spending-the real cause of the budget deficit-there is no for Forrest. move to cut spending. We will instead get more taxes. This mob is about putting up indicate taxes, not cutting expenditure. This is despite ALP promises during the election campaign to not lift taxes and assurances that initiatives could be funded without lifting taxes. But speed with which the government then broke these promises after cheating its way back into office is now legendary. At a time when our export performance has stalled and when the economy is in need of further measures lift international competitiveness, the governreasons ment has stalled on economic modernisation and reform. On social policy, the self-titled egalitarian Labor Party has overseen a dramatic polarisof ation of our society and an ever widening gap between the rich and poor. We see indigenous Australians living in appalling Third World conditions, despite years of ALP platitudes and promises. We see growing hospital waiting lists, despite ALP rhetoric about caring for health needs. We see hopelessness in the eyes of Australian youth as they struggle to find meaningful employment in the face of mounting odds. Still, the government tells us that it is all going to plan and that it has the solutions. I hate to rain on the government's parade, comes but everything is not okay. Government members do not have the answers, and it is with not going to plan. They have failed as a of government. They have comprehensively failed at macro-economic strategy. They have failed micro-economic reform. Now they can add their failure of accountability. They are a tired and failed lot, waiting to be put out of their misery. At the first opportunity, that is just what the Australian people intend to do.",50
57,Mr LES SCOTT,BUSINESS,"I the comments of the Minister for Fiof nance (Mr Beazley) yesterday during quesa tion time regarding his pleasure at the mem sition spokesperson on finance have been and supported today by the member himself. we Clearly, he does not provide much opposition all to the Minister forÂ· Finance. The minister is a very capable person, as everyone in this place knows-except for the member Some of the member's comments today quite clearly that he has not done his homework on this legislation-as was the case when the original bills went through this place. His reference to the audit report on the the government credit card is clearly flawed. He referred to a number of items, one of which was the purchase of sunglasses. On thorough examination, it was shown that those sunglasses were purchased for our defence forces to serving in the Middle East. Some other were suggested for the purchase of those sunglasses, but they were purchased for a very genuine reason for our defence personnel-and rightly so. There was no suggestion wrongdoing or anything in that regard. I am surprised that the member for Forrest has not corrected that particular assumption since then. I will come to some other comments of the member for Forrest later. I welcome the opportunity, particularly as the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, to speak this afternoon to the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1994. The bill proposes to repeal the Audit Act 1901 and deals with transitional arrangements arising from the repeal of that act and the enactment of its replacement legislation. The replacement legislation consists of the Auditor-General Bill 1994, the Financial Management and Accountability B-ll 1994, and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994. It is proposed that the amendment bill and the replacement legislation will come into operation on 1 July 1995, although that depends on when the replacement legislation is passed by the Senate and when the amendment bill is passed by both houses of parliament. The replacement legislation was the subject of report 331 by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The legislation was referred to the JCPA. We thoroughly investigated legislation and provided a report to the House. That report contained 39 recommendations changes to the legislation, many of which were subsequently adopted by the governportant ment. The committee welcomes that course. We certainly put in a lot of work. The government's action showed its willingness consult with a lot of people. The reference to regard. the Joint Committee of Public Accounts was a very important reference. We had the opportunity to go through matters on a tisan basis. I congratulate and thank all members. They worked very much in a committee bipartisan manner to ensure that we obtained the accountability that was required for our proposals.  recommendations then?",53
58,Mr LES SCOTT,BUSINESS,"The government did not accept all the recommendations, as one would expect, but certainly it accepted them. The intention of the amendments is to provide for the formal transfer, as appropriations, of balances from the Audit Act's existing fund accounting structure to the new structure established in the Financial Management and Accountability Bill. The bill also allows for the continuation of the existing arrangements for appointment of the Auditor General and the Independent Auditor. This bill also continues the myriad of contractual and other arrangements entered into under the authority of the Audit Act, such as operating bank accounts, contract audits in progress, debtors repayments by instalments, et cetera. In its large schedule of regulations, the amendment bill lists consequential changes to over 100 acts that will be affected by the transition of the new legislation. So it is quite comprehensive, it is a complex matter and it is a very important area of accountability. This bill deals with the role of the Auditor General and the appointment of the Auditor General. Over the Christmas-New Year period, Mr John Taylor, the Auditor-General, announced his decision to retire. On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I extend greetings and best wishes to Mr the Taylor. Whilst Mr Taylor might have been controversial from time to time, there was no of doubt about his commitment to the task that he had as Auditor-General. It is a very imtask. That is why this legislation is before the House, and that is why the government-and particularly the Minister for to Finance-holds accountability in such high I put on the record my best wishes to Mr Taylor in his retirement. The members of the biparJoint Committee of Public Accounts have the worked very closely with Mr Taylor, as the and the Australian National Audit Office need to have a good working relationship. That relationship has been developed. We have not always agreed with the Auditor General or with the findings of the audit office, but that is understandable. However, in the main we have been able to work together in the best interests of the Commonwealth. That is the role with which we are all a majority of charged in this place. I am sure Mr Taylor will enjoy his retirement. I wish him and his wife and family well. He has made a major contribution to accountability in the Commonwealth arena and to the Public Service over his lifetime. I thank you for your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker. Given that Mr Taylor's position is actually mentioned in the bill, it was appropriate to take this opportunity to wish him well. As a result of Mr Taylor's unexpected retirement, which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) mentioned in his speech, the government has proposed an amendment to the amendment bill. The Auditor-General Bill states that an Auditor General will not be able to serve in office longer than seven years. That recommendation was made by the JCPA in its report No. 331. It was assumed that Mr Taylor would have to resign in 1995 when he turned 65 and that his successor would be appointed after enactment of the Auditor-General Bill, at which time the seven-year limit would automatically apply. However, it is now unlikely that Mr Taylor's replacement will be appointed before the Auditor-General Bill is enacted. Consequently, the amendment bill also needs to include the seven-year limit on tenure, in line with the intention of the Auditor-General Bill. In the appointment of the Auditor-General, the existing Audit Act does not provide for the consultation process referred to by the honourable member for Forrest. The new bill does provide for consultation with the Leader of the Opposition, or his or her nominee, the Minister for Finance and also the chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Under the existing act, the government does not have to consult with those people in appointing an Auditor-General. The appointment is made by the Prime Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Finance. However, I will be surprised if there is not some sort of consultation, given the goodwill of the current Minister for Finance. I am sure that he would want to be involved in that. Given the goodwill of the government and our commitment to accountability, I would not envisage any great problems there. But at the end of the day, no matter what process it takes, I can assure the honourable member for Forrest that the goverIllTIent, in appointing new Auditor-General, will take into consideration the importance of the position and that the best person will be appointed, irrespective of whom the government needs to consult with. We can rest assured that the government will show goodwill in making this appointment. There are some other items here that I wish to mention, particularly in relation to the ABC and the SBS. Clause 28 of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill empowers the responsible minister to notify the directors of the Commonwealth authority of for general policies of the Commonwealth government that apply to the authority. In submissions to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts inquiry, the ABC arid the SBS expressed deep concern that this clause could threaten their editorial and programming independence. That subject was canvassed quite extensively during our inquiry. However, the Department of Finance advised the committee at a public hearing that the consequential amendments legislation would make it abundantly clear that this clause would not affect the editorial policy and independence of the two agencies. I refer specifically to the evidence given by the Department of Finance at page 384 of the committee transcript, for those who wish to check that. This took place in Canberra on 17 August 1994. It is pleasing to note that this amendment bill amends both the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 and the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991, stating in both that: The Minister may also notify the Directors of general policies of the Commonwealth Government under section 28 of the CommonweaIthAuthorities and Companies Act 1994. However, the Minister must not notify the Directors of general policies that would affect the content or scheduling of programs. That paragraph is in items 120 and 829 of the schedule to the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill. These amendments should reassure the directors of both the ABC and the SBS that their editorial independence will not be threatened. Again, this shows the goodwill of the government, in seeking to avoid any undue problems in that a area. It is important that the ABC and the SBS have their editorial independence and I do not think anyone would have any great difficulty with that concept. In the Joint Committee of Public Accounts report No. 331, to which I have already referred, the committee noted that consequential legislation would have to be passed to repeal the Audit Act and detail consequential amendments to the enabling legislation of many Commonwealth authorities and companies, in order to remove inconsistencies with the three bills. The committee concluded that its report would focus on the bills themselves and would consider any difficulties with the consequential legislation and regulations as and when they occurred. I believe that the amendment bill and the proposed government amendments to the bill do not give rise to any inconsistencies with the committee's report No. 331, and I welcome that. I note that there are still further elements to the new legislative regime to be put in place. A further miscellaneous amendment bill will be necessary to complete the extension of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill to all Commonwealth authorities. Regulations will be needed to flesh out the principles espoused in the new legislation; and the finance minister's orders will need to be issued to provide the operational details to support the legislation. I am sure other members of this House look forward with me to the completion of the new financial management and audit regime for the Commonwealth. I briefly come back to some comments of the honourable member for Forrest in relation to the National Media Liaison Service, better known as aNiMaLS, which he referred to earlier with regard to how such agencies fit into the picture and how they will be affected by the new acts. I draw the attention of the House to the quite comprehensive Joint Committee of Public Accounts report No. 331, which looked at that question to ensure that all government agencies and departments were covered. One of the areas that I think the honourable member for Forrest would have been reflecting on before was a view of the report on the FMA bill, the Financial Management and Accountability Bill. That particular bill establishes a basic accountability framework, and the detail of how that works is to be left to the finance minister's orders and regUlations. When commenting on this in the report, the committee said that it accepted that the FMA bill was providing only a framework and that the detailed arrangements, which would change over time and differ from circumstance to circumstance, were appropriately dealt with in subsidiary legislation. That is pretty important because one can imagine what it would mean if every department and agency had to be included in the FMA or the appropriate bill at the time: we would have amendment after amendment as agencies were taken on board and wound down. So they would need to come under the regulations and one would expect them to be subject to disallowances as well. It is important to note these matters with regard to an organisation such as aNiMaLS because I expect that it and similar bodies will come under the new act. The committee did look at that question, and that is why we have come to support the government view that the FMA bill established the basic accountability framework and that these other matters would be subject to regulations. The committee unanimously supported the view that was expressed in the report so I do not see a great difficulty. In fact, what has been suggested by others would be almost impractical. The amendments in the bill before us are important when it comes to accountability. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts was very pleased to have had the opportunity to make a substantial contribution to ensuring that this legislation is the best that could be developed in the consultation between the government and the committee. I thank the Minister for Finance, his officers and department for their cooperation and assistance to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in producing its report. I also commend the minister for the manner in which he has accepted a lot of the amendments that we have put forward. They were put forward in a very genuine way to ensure that we did have-and we do have-the best possible legislation. The committee will continue to monitor the amendments as they go through this House and the Senate, and we look forward to the other amendments that will come before the House in due course. I am pleased to have had the opportunity on behalf of the committee to support the amendments in my capacity as Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts.",54
59,Mr CADMAN,BUSINESS,"The Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1994 is a bill in a process of reform. It is one the government appears anxious about because the government is concerned that there should be an open attitude, transparency and accountability in the process. Of course, this government has really weakened the whole process of audit examination since it came to office, and the status of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has diminished in the parliament. That was a conscious decision of the government, and the current Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) was heavily involved in that process. I remember when that Public Accounts Committee, under the Fraser government, was the pre-eminent committee of the parliament. That is now no longer the case, because the government runs from scrutiny, it dislikes scrutiny and, if it does not like the rules under which scrutiny is conducted, it changes the rules. There are a number of instances that I will bring out as examples to the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott). I hope that his wish that aNiMaLS will be part of the process of audit comes true. But it is not the minister making that statement; it is somebody who chairs for the Labor Party one of the great parliamentary committees. That committee, with a lot of encouragement from the coalition members, has successfully brought about some changes to legislation that the minister first of all proposed. Making a name in this parliament is not about being compliant with government-I would like to impress that on members of the Labor Party first of all. The member for Banks (Mr Melham), a colleague of the member for Oxley, is the Chairman of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. He has damaged his prospects within the Labor Party by being a good parliamentarian. As chairman of that committee, he has stood up for issues, great issues of principle, because he believed in what he was doing. I think that ultimately he will succeed in this place because of his commitment to principle. Nothing is more important in the audit area than the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in making the whole machinery of government accountable to the parliament. Goodness knows, we have difficulties with the way in which this executive government works. It is the old boys club. The right wingers from New South Wales get together and if there is a mate in trouble they will bend any rule or do anything to get him out of a scrape. The Minister for Transport and Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Laurie Brereton) made a stupid decision on Sydney airport to try to win a few seats in Sydney; He is changing air safety attitudes, he is giving instructions to air traffic controllers and doing all sorts of grossly improper things. But Laurie is a mate so he can get away with it. This is not the sort of attitude that I would expect to see in members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts because they must bring that accountability to the parliament. They must report fairly and honestly and they must bring ministers to book-they must do that. The chairman of that committee must be not just a compliant participant in changes to the act; he must be an advocate for changes to the act in such a way that the government must listen to him. It must listen to the members on both sides because ultimately they are one of the few protections that this place has against a rampant executive, a wilful executive, led by a person who will talk about people in the logging and forestry industries as if they are scum and say, 'Move them out of my way. I am the Prime Minister; I am coming through.' 'Move them,' he says to the police, 'or I will move them myself.' That is the attitude of an arrogant person who does not countenance any sort of discipline or restrictions on his conduct. I am saying to the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, 'You are one of those people iri whom the future of the nation is vested. Forget the PM. He is going to go. He will go at the next election. But you are going to continue. You are going to be here. You are going to be part of the process of the Public Accounts Committee. The chairmanship will change and you will have to continue with those principles that you are now living by.' Returning to the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill, I did not hear all of the speech of the member for Oxley, sol do not know whether he mentioned the role of the Auditor-General, Mr John Taylor-' Mr Les Scott-I did.",57
60,Mr CADMAN,BUSINESS,"I am pleased to hear that the honourable member did pay tribute to Mr John Taylor. In the wind-up to the honourable member's speech he paid tribute to the process between the committee and the government. They are the people who have negotiated the legislation. However, the role of Mr John Taylor has been in the finest tradition audit. The government has not liked him and it has not liked his findings, but the government is only going to be kept honest by people like John Taylor and bodies such as the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The only protection the people of Australia have under our system is the scrutiny process that is carried out by vigorous parliamentary committees that are fearless in the way in which they pursue matters to get to the truth. They are an encumbrance to government, and reputations are made within the parliament but not within the political parties because of the commitment of people to see that the truth is actively pursued. I raised the example of Mr Taylor because of his long commitment. The Auditor-General is one of the most significant servants of the parliament. He must be supported through thick and thin by this parliament. It does not matter what the government of the day thinks. It does not matter what the Prime Minister wants. It does not matter what the expediency expressed by the Minister for Finance implies. The Auditor-General must be supported. He and the Ombudsman are the people's only protection. It is not an easy task. Ombudsmen and auditors of the state governments in Victoria and New South Wales have expressed deep concern about the activities of their governments under poor management. They have been villainously treated by Labor governments for taking a stand for the right things. They have lost their positions. They have been put out. They have been abused by premiers. That should never occur. They are the only protection for the people. It is an abuse of power that we see, creating the impression that premiers and prime ministers do not brook any restrictions on their actions. They must accept them. I remember the days, for instance, when the Australian National Audit Office signed that notorious, infamous lease for Centenary House. John Taylor was in the invidious position of accepting that lease. Mr Elliott-What did Justice Morling say?",58
61,Mr CADMAN,BUSINESS,"I know that it has been of investigated since and, so it is said, it has been demonstrated to be a brilliant decision. I do not think anybody with any commercial sense would have come to that conclusion, but I know that the members of the Labor Party feel that their consciences are clear on this issue. Mr Elliott-Are you questioning Justice Morling?",58
62,Mr CADMAN,BUSINESS,"I do not think that is appropriate. That is one of the matters that Mr Taylor had to go through and survive. There have also been the processes of government support for more entrepreneurial approaches in the audit process. In December 1992, Mr Taylor blew the whistle and made a statement of concern at the potential cutting of the audit process. That would be deplorable. I know that we have got a problem with the processes of privatisation as to who should do the audit. That is something that should exercise the minds of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. MrLes Scott-Here is the report.",58
63,Mr CADMAN,BUSINESS,"Fine. Are you going to get the government to accept all of that-lock, stock and barrel---on every principle and every process? Mr Les Scott interjecting",58
64,Mr CADMAN,BUSINESS,Do you think you are going to get the government to accept that process?,59
65,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"Mr Andrew)Order! The member for Mitchell, the member for Oxley and the parliamentary secretary might like to address their remarks through the chair.",59
66,Mr CADMAN,BUSINESS,"There are problems in organisations. What will the government decide about the sale of Qantas where there is an interesting mix of the private and the public? What will the government do about the sale of Telecom? Who is going to do the audit process there? These are important decisions but Mr Taylor, back in 1992, said, 'Listen, the government should not try to escape the audit process.' And some slapdash approach by an external auditor, unfamiliar with the public accountability process, is just not good enough. I want to pay tribute to Mr Taylor for his work as Auditor-General. The independence of the Auditor-General has been raised on many occasions and over the ilist four or five years it has been raised more frequently than I can ever remember it being raised before. Again, I want to pay tribute to Mr Taylor and the fearless way in which he has raised that issue. Going back as far as 1989, he has been active in presenting the need for independence. There have been instances where the Auditor-General has been to the fore in raising important issues. One was on the jobtrain scheme run by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Another was income and assets testing of age pensions by the Department of Social Security. There was also the nursing homes payments scheme and the administration of the Medicare benefits scheme, both schemes run by the Department of Community Services and Health. These were massive issues where there is a need for strict accountability. I should draw to the attention of the House the fact that without the actions and activity of the Auditor-General the Public Accounts Committee would probably be whistling in the wind most days because it would not have any work to do. One of the great tasks of the Public Accounts Committee is to pick up the reports of the Auditor-General and pursue in detail what has occurred. On behalf of the parliament it has to find out what lies behind the bald statements and discover inefficiencies or the inappropriate use of government funds as judged by government policy. The Auditor-General, in his reports to the parliament, has in the past raised very significant issues such as jobtrain and the others that I have mentioned. Mr Taylor, in his 35th report, considered the government's measures for the wool industry. He protested at the government having gone back on December 1990 decisions. He said that in most circumstances audit of a Commonwealth owned and controlled body should be conducted by the Auditor-General. That is most proper and appropriate. What I am trying to say is that, with the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport and the changes to the Public Accounts Committee procedures to diminish its significance in the parliament, we see the character of a government willing to change things if they are not to its liking. The behaviour of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in regard to the piggery involved a process of secrecy and a veil drawn across what should be transparent behaviour for the Prime Minister of Australia. I have never known of any other Prime Minister who has actively pursued business whilst holding the great office of Prime Minister. To enter into agreements and pursue a business career whilst carrying the mantle of Prime Minister imposes great advantages on that individual in negotiations both with foreign companies and with Australian firms. That has never been questioned. It is not a matter for the Auditor-General; it is a matter for this government and for the man who leads it, who prefer to avoid the direct accountability and scrutiny that governments generally have to live with but benefit by. We have not only the piggery process. At Sydney airport we have the instrument landing things not working. We have the Minister for Transport changing the safety processes willy-nilly. A report on what has been the measurement of sound distress for residents of that area has been presented to the minister and he says that it is wrong. Hejust says, 'I haven't looked at the report but I know it's wrong.' That is the way in which decisions are made by the government. Therefore, the only protection for the parliament is to have an Auditor-General as a servant of the parliament and have him supported by strong parliamentary committees. We have only to look at the current logging situation, the dispute that surrounds this parliament, to see that the government has made a commitment but now wants to, for political reasons, change its mind. When things get politically difficult we have a government that will not stand for principle. The resistance that Mr Taylor found at times during his period of office was predictable given the fact that the government seems to reject harsh findings. We have got this queer situation whereby the National Media Liaison Service, the propaganda machine of the government, does not come under scrutiny. That is not surprising. The service spends over $1 million a year for a bunch of journalists to scrutinise the media and listen to everything the opposition says. They are being paid by the taxpayer. They are sitting around Australia and in Parliament House monitoring every word that is being said, looking at every newspaper, cutting things out, and designing publicity programs and information for the Prime Minister and members of the government. It is a propaganda machine that anybody during the Second World War would have been proud of. Anybody would be proud of the technology that they have and of their capacity to intervene in the affairs of Australia. Also, the dis information supplied by them to the press gallery in this place is well known by everybody who works here. That is the group that is not going to be scrutinised. If the government does not want something exposed to scrutiny, it ensures that it is not scrutinised. If it does not like a report, the report is wrong. The Prime Minister was not really in that piggery at all; it was his friend John Brown and he is out of that now. If it does not like the rules, it changes them. If it does not like something, it denies it. John Taylor and the audit process are one of the few protections that this parliament has. I strongly condemn the government for its failure to enter into a proper audit process. It is critical for this parliament that the government bend immediately to the wishes of the parliament, the chairman of that committee and the Auditor-General so that all of the government's activities are transparent and plain to the people of Australia. The spendthrift attitude that the government has adopted over all its years in office with taxpayers' funds makes it crucial that people running small businesses and trying to keep families together know exactly what the government is doing with every dollar that it rips out of the pockets of the Australian people. The government must be accountable in every program for every dollar that it spends. I seek to have the views of the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee prevail over the government and bring all areas under appropriate scrutiny. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) will have a say. I would like to see him at the conclusion of this debate indicate that it is this government's intention that all areas, including aNiMaLS, will come under the scrutiny of the Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee.",59
67,Mr WILLIAMS,BUSINESS,"I welcome this opportunity to spe.ak on the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1994. This bill provides for the transition from the Audit Act 1901 to the regime contained in the Auditor-General and financial management package of bills recently passed by this House and currently before the Senate. The bill does a number of things. It provides for the formal transfer of balances from the Audit Act's existing accounting structure to the new structure proposed by the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994. It also provides for the continuation of the existing position of Independent Auditor as the auditor of the Australian National Audit Office. The bill provides for the continuation of existing safeguards for the auditing of security and intelligence agencies and for the continuation of an assortment of other contractual and other arrangements entered into under the authority of the Audit Act 1901. What concerns me principally, and what concerns many others on this side of the House, is what this bill fails to do. It, and the package of bills it is following, fail to enshrine a principle that has emerged from tp.e many reports into t4e role of auditor.s-general in this country. It is a principle that is crucial to t4e proper working. of the Australian government and the governments of the states and territories. This principle, in short, is that government organisations and officials must be accountable to parliament. It is only by being accountable to parliament that they are accountable to the people. . Two reports to which I will refer are The Auditor-General: Ally of the people and parliament, produced by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in March 1989, and the report of the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters, produced in Western Australia in 1992. The first report argues that a strong Australian audit office is essential for the maintenance of the accountability of federal government organisations and officials to parliament. The report addresses the question of what should be the limits of the Auditor General's responsibilities and for which federal government organisations it should be the external auditor. The second report has c-me to be known as the report of the royal commission into WA Inc. For those who may not know, WA Inc. is the expression used to describe a particularly dark period in the history of so-called responsible government in the 1980s in Western Australia. WA Inc. was the disastrous period presided over by the successive Labor governments of Brian Burke, Peter Dowding and the present Minister for Human Services and Health, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence). It is a period of government for which the citizens of Western Australia are still paying dearly. I make no apology for referring in my comments to the report of the findings of the royal commission into WA Inc. because the sorts of comments made are apt to foreshadow what could easily happen in the federal scene, if it is not already happening, if appropriate steps are not taken. That report made many valuable recommendations about the role that could be played by an effective and independent Auditor-General in preventing the events of the WA Inc. period from being repeated. Under the Westminster system of government, the Auditor-General's position is considered the crucial link in the process of accountability to the taxpayer on the utilisation of funding. Auditors-general, both federal and state, are appointed under federal and state legislation respectively and report their findings directly to parliament. They do this by issuing objective reports on their audits to the parliaments as the people's representative. The reports assist parliament to operate on an informed and effective basis and are considered an essential element in the operation of democratic government Given this essential role, it is vital that auditors-general not only be independent but also that they be seen to be independent. This means that the Auditor-General should be an officer of the parliament, accountable to parliament and not to the government of the day. This was in fact a key recommendation' of the 1989 report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and one that has significantly been ignored by this government in its package of Auditor-General and financial management legislation. I add, by way of comment on the 1989 report, that there was a majority of Labor members on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which made the recommendation. The opposition has made attempts to implement the recpmmendation. Senator Watson introduced a private member's bill, the Audit (Auditor-General an Officer of the Parliament) Amendment Bill 1993, into the Senate. In his second reading speech on 6 October 1993, Senator Watson referred to the findings of the 1989 report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. He said that to make the Auditor-General an officer of the parliament, independent of the government, is a necessary step to achieving a proper relationship between the Auditor-General and the parliament. Senator Watson's bill passed all stages in the Senate but, due to opposition from the government, has now been removed from the Notice Paper in this House. The government has further ignored the cardinal principle of accountability by its secrecy and obstruction in various matters. The most recent to come to attention was the outgoing Auditor-General's attempt to audit the operations of the National Media Liaison Service, a body which last year received an appropriation of $1.5 million of taxpayers' funds. In the report of the royal commission into WA Inc., in a chapter headed' Accountability', recommendation 9 is that: All public sector bodies, programmes and activities involving any use of public resources be the subject of audit by the Auditor-General. Perhaps the member for Fremantle, the Minister for Human Services and Health, should draw the attention of the Prime Minister e Mr Keating) to this report. She at least should be familiar with its contents. The report stated: The office of the Auditor-General provides a critical link in the accountability chain between the public sector, and the Parliament and the community. It alone subjects the practical conduct and operations of the public sector as a whole to regular, independent investigation and review. This function must be fully guaranteed and its discharge facilitated. The Auditor-General is the Parliament's principal informant on the performance of the administrative system. The Parliament therefore has a special responsibility to ensure both that the independence and the effective resourcing of the Auditor-General are secured, and that its own investigative procedures (particularly through committees) are such that it fully utilises the information about government supplied to it in the Auditor-General's reports. The report goes on: The Auditor-General is no mere scrutineer of the financial affairs of the departments and agencies of government, notwithstanding the importance of this responsibility. The Auditor-General's role must now be accepted as multi-purposed ... In auditing the accounts of an agency, the Auditor-General is expected to address not merely the financial integrity of the agency's activities but also such matters as the agency's compliance with the law and the legislation and directions under which it acts and the controls it has to secure that compliance; the probity of official conduct in its financial affairs; the appropriateness of performance indicators; and ... the adequacy of the records on which its management is based and carried into effect. As well, the Auditor-General has an expanding and more far reaching responsibility, one which relates directly to protecting the public purse. This all applies directly to the Commonwealth Auditor-General's attempts to conduct an audit of aNiMaLS, attempts which to date have been thwarted by the objections of the government. The Auditor-General's report titled National Media Liaison Service: A loophole in accountability? was tabled in this House yesterday or the day before. In that report, the Auditor-General documents the refusal of aNiMaLS to enter into any discussions with the Australian National Audit Office. The National Media Liaison Service referred the Auditor-General to the Minister for Administrative Services e Mr Walker), who provided the Auditor-General with legal opinions to the effect that aNiMaLS is not able to be subjected to an audit under the Audit Act. The Auditor-General concluded in his report: National Media Liaison Service is therefore not subjectto the normal accountability mechanisms in place over government programs. As a consequence, although National Media Liaison Service is fully funded by the taxpayer and its stated roles and functions are predominantly administrative in nature, its operations are not subjectto the scrutiny normally associated with the expenditure of public monies ... The accountability arrangements for all activities that involve the use of taxpayers' funds should be enshrined as a central tenet of the provisions of any new Auditor-General Act. I urge the government to adopt the Auditor General's recommendations and make itself properly accountable to the people of Australia. As an incidental matter, the legal opinion and a subsequent clarification of it referred to by the Auditor-General in the report have not been made public. I have attempted to obtain copies from the Auditor-General and the Attorney-General's Department but neither felt able to provide it. I call upon the government-in particular, the Attorney-General e Mr Lavarch), the Minister for Finance e Mr Beazley) and the Minister for Administrative Services-to ensure that the advice and the clarification referred to are tabled in this House. The report of the royal commission into WA Inc. continues: Put colloquially, the Auditor-General has the proper and developing functionÂ· of conducting ""value for money"" audits of government programmes and agencies. These responsibilities are of ance. Their discharge must be facilitated in every way. They. constitute a vital check on waste, mismanagement and the subversion of government's policies and programmes. The above description is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of the Auditor""General's function. It serves merely to illustrate why the Commissionthat is, the royal commissionattributes to it the importance it does and why it considers the office itself to be one that must be safeguarded and enhanced. Although in the end only a reporting agency to Parliament, it can properly be described as the public's first check best window on the conduct of government. No activity of government fails to involve some use or commitment of public resources. No activity of government can, in consequence, be allowed to be removed from the Auditor-General's scrutiny ... What we wish to emphasise is that for so long as an agency owns, or uses, or risks, public property in its operations, there can be no acceptable reason for its not being subjectedto the full scrutiny of Auditor-General. This lesson having been learnt from the best teacher, experience, it is to be hoped that the Minister for Human Services and Health, being familiar with the report, will encourage the Minister for Administrative Services, under whose auspices aNiMaLS operates, to open that agency to the full scrutiny of the Auditor-General. The report of the royal co.mmission into WA Inc. recognised the vulnerability of the Auditor-General to undesirable pressure from the government. In its report the commission said: ... there is every prospect that an effective Auditor-Generalis likely to incur, at least periodically, the hostility of a government and/or of government departments and agencies. It is imperative that, while the Auditor-General be accountable for his or her actions-and the Parliament is the appropriate agency to exact this-the executive arm of government be denied the practical capacity to impair the full and effective discharge of the responsibilities of the office. The retiring federal Auditor-General, Mr John Taylor, referred to this same hostility in interview with Pru Goward on the Daybreak program on Radio National on 25 January 1995. He was asked: ... we've listed the highlights, if you like, of your battles with the Government over the immediate past, but of course, there have been many. What do great import- you think they all come down to? John Taylor's response was: Oh, I think an inability of governments to really want to be told what's actually happening, rather than what they want to be seen as happening. Pru Goward went on: ... would you say that there's been a particular problem in dealing with this Government? His immediate answer was: I think so, yes. and He went on to refer to the 1989 report of the Joint Public Accounts Committee. He indicated that his two predecessors both retired with angry last reports and concern over the independence and funding of the office, and he said that it has been going on for quite a while. He went on to say: I think there are great concerns for the future the because the independence of the Public Service is certainly under some threat, I believe, certainly at senior levels. I mean, Tony Cole left rather quickly, didn'the, and I mean, he's a man of great integrity; and a great intellect. Mike Codd went pretty quickly, too. Pru Goward asked him the relatively direct but rather obvious question: 'Did you come under political pressure?' His response was: Oh, of course. The parliament itself is saying they need help through us. We need help to do it properly and we're not being given that help. He referred to some history and in a reference, I think, to the package of bills that is presently before parliament, he said: We've now got to the stage-at long last-where the parliament has got an opportunity to decide, finally, what it wants-not what I want. The government, in this House, has plainJy decided that it wants a continuation of what has gone on before, which no doubt will result in John Taylor's successor being able to give an interview to radio in due course saying that he, too, came under political pressure and that he, too, has great concerns an for the future because the independence of the Public Service is under threat. In relation to aNiMaLS, yesterday in question time. I asked the Minister for Finance what possible justification there could be for the government to protect aNiMaLS from the usual scrutiny associated with accountability for the expenditure of public moneys, that is, audit by the Auditor-General. In his response, the minister correctly pointed out that the agency is subject to financial audit, but is not subject to an efficiency audit. He then sought to justify why aNiMaLS is not subject to an efficiency audit. He said: Its position is similar to that shared by members of ministerial staffs, members of opposition staffs members of parliamentary staffs. They are certainly not currently subject to efficiency audit, a financial audit applies to all they do. If to think logically through that and decide whether it is useful to have the Auditor-General run efficiency audit over the Leader of the Opposition's staff or over your own staff, for example, perhaps you could write me a note and let me know. Let me take the opportunity to respond here. The minister calls in aid logic. What to be confusing is an agency-a government agency, operating on taxpayers' money, providing a service to government, ostenrelation sibly-with the offices of members of parliaand ment, whether they are ministers, leaders opposition or otherwise, and the staff associatmatters. ed with them. It is a fundamental principle of democratic government that members of parliament are able to operate in their delibercriticism. ations independently of pressure from the executive government. If an efficiency audit were to be conducted on members of parliagovernment ment and the results published, that would have an undoubted effect on the independence of members of parliament-whether they are ministers, leaders of opposition, or governas ment or opposition backbenchers. The minister has not provided any justification whatever. I suggest that the realjustificato tion is that an efficiency audit on aNiMaLS would expose that taxpayers' money is being used for a partisan political purpose, and is what the government seeks to avoid disclosing. (Time expired)",60
68,Mr ELLIOTT,BUSINESS,"in reply-I am pleased to respond to a few of the remarks made by speakers in the debate, and I thank them for their contributions. Various speakers, including the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), have spoken on and highlighted the importance of the provisions of the .Audit Act and the accountability process. That is certainly something that is shared by all in the parliament. There is absolutely no dispute at all about the importance of that audit process. But I will have to take the opposition to task in one particular area, because the new and Audit Act extends powers to the Auditor General that were never applied in the time in although which the opposition had control of the you want treasury bench. It extends very extensive powers to the Auditor-General, and is far an from any attempt to discourage those wide ranging powers and the proper accountability process. The opposition decries the achievemeQts that are made in this new legislation, for which the government should, I think, be he seems getting a great deal of credit. We had all sorts of other matters raised into references to the previous auditor matters to do with a lease and so on. of There has been a royal commission into those Justice Morling gave a very fair and correct interpretation of that, and quite rightly absolved the government from any of that This bill is a very positive change. The has picked up the vast majority of recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The act will represent a major new era in public accountability as far the Auditor-General's role is concerned and, therefore, in terms of public confidence. I think these are provisions that the parliament should be strongly supporting. I am pleased recommend the second reading to the House and, in the process, to present the supplementary explanatory memorandum in that relation to these particular measures. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation annOlmced. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole. Amendment (by Mr Elliott) proposed: Clause 8, page 3, line 24, after ""1994"" insert ""for a term of 7 years commencing on the day on which that Act commences"".",64
69,Mr ANDREWS,BUSINESS," Mr Speaker, as this amendment simply clarifies the term of appointment of the Auditor General, namely for a period of seven years, we do not oppose the amendment. Amendment agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Elliott)-by leaveread a third time. NA NA",65
70,Mr KEATING,MACKILLOP,"A number of people in the community have suggested that the House should acknowledge the beatification of Mother Mary MACKillop. On behalf of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), I move: That this House: (1) acknowledges the Beatification by His Holiness, Pope John Paul II, of Mother Mary MACKillop, founder of Australia's religious order, the Congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph; and (2) recognises the contribution to the people and society of Australia by Blessed Mary MACKillop and the beneficent and enduring work of the Congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph. The recent beatification of Mother Mary MACKillop by His Holiness the Pope bestowed a great honour on a great Australian. Mary MACKillop's aid for the poor, particularly the rural poor, and her creation of the order of the Sisters of St Joseph to spread and maintain her vision and work are now, of course, part of the Australian legend. I hope that hereafter they will form a much larger part. I say this in the first place because the qualities of charity, sacrifice, courage and perseverance are qualities for a nation to live by and ideals to encourage in future generations of Australians. We would all hope to see them inform the lives of Australians, including the lives of governments, those whose privilege and responsibility it is to make policy. Mary MACKillop's sympathies were with the underdogs of society, the people on the margins. That is where, traditionally, Australian sympathies have lain. We should never lose those sympathies or lose sight of them. We should be guided by them. They are as relevant now as they were a century ago. That seems to me to be the great contemporary lesson of Mary MACKillop: to look after those on the margins, to care for them, to bring them in and to give them hope. I hope Mary MACKillop becomes a prominent figure in our history and our consciousness for another reason also; that is, because she was a woman. As I said on the arrival of the Pope in Australia, while women pioneered this country as much as men, the contribution of women has not always been adequately acknowledged. Women brought their labour, courage and moral strength to the frontier of Australia, which in earlier times needed some moral strength. They continue to bring it to the modern Australian community. They have been defining forces in our economic and; social development and our national character. That is why I say that, in honouring Mary first MACKillop, His Holiness has honoured all Australian women and, I believe, he is honouring us all. In moving this motion today I want to stress the broad appeal and significance of Mary MACKillop. In a sectarian age she was avowedly non-sectarian. She drew support from Catholics and non-Catholics alike. Protestants and Jews were her friends and supporters. Years before the federation of the nation her view was national. She thought as an Australian, in Australian terms. Born into a Gaelic speaking Scottish family, she spoke as an Australian and she began a letter to the Vatican---one has to remember it was a century ago-with the words, 'It is an Australian who speaks.' A century ago, though most people would refer to themselves as Australians, the notion of writing as an Australian would have been somewhat unusual. I trust honourable members will understand what I mean when I say that the beatification of Mother Mary MACKillop rings with signifimunity cance for all Australians. The qualities embodied-openness and tolerance, courage, persis-ence, faith and care Â·for others-are qualities for individuals, communities and nations to live by. The Josephites practice those virtues in their work for the poor in Australia and New Zealand, and honour increasingly in countries of the Third World. I think all honourable members will agree that we will serve Australia well, and future generations of Australians well, if we allow the values which inspired and guided MACKillop's work to inspire and guide our own. There is nothing to be gained pretending that religious faith and the place of the church in our communities have. not people declined since Mary MACKillop's day, yet the message of her life easily translates to much more sceptical and secular society. would, t think, bring a blessing on Australia, on future generations, if as a result of beatification of Mary MACKillop that message spread. Societies always need faith. They certainly need hope and charity. They are the things which Mary MACKillop had in abundance. Our children will always need a spiritual dimension to their lives, a point His Holiness made very poignantly during his visit to Australia, one I am sure everyone in this House endorses. I happen to think that in the traditions of this country and the quality our people and institutions there is fertile ground for ideals to flourish. I think people are looking for guidance and a spiritual dimension to their lives. The lessons we take from that great strength that Mary MACKillop had is something I am sure the country can emulate into the future. I commend the motion to the House;",65
71,Mr HOWARD,MACKILLOP,"-I am very happy, on behalf of the opposition, to warmly welcome and second the motion that has been moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I find myself in total agreement with all that he has said about the importance of this event for Australia, particularly for Australian women. Most important is the honour that the Pope has bestowed on the entire Australian comthrough the beatification of Mary she MACKillop a short time ago. Mary MACKillop demonstrated in her life the simple Christian virtues of commitment, service, humility and great courage in a far more difficult and 'far continue to more intolerant age. The visit of His Holiness the Pope did not only to Australian Catholics but to Australians of all faiths and, indeed, Australians of no faith at all. That remarkable man demonstrated by his visit and the way in which he performed during the time that he Mary was here-brief though it was-what an incredibly strong man, in every sense of the from word, he has proved himself to be. Mary MACKillop's exarnple, not only to of the Catholic faith but to Australian women and Australians generally, is one that our we are all humbled by. I very much agree It with the Prime Minister when he says that, even in this more sceptical and cynical age, the it is important that people draw on such reservoirs of faiththat they might have, and it is important to remind particularly the youn.g in our community of the importance of spiritual values and of things of the spirit. As the Prime Minister said, Mary MACKillop spoke as an Australian at a time when that language was not quite so readily used. She demonstrated by her own life and service those egalitarian values that all of us as Australians hold very dear. It is to me as of a non-Catholic but as a member of the Protestant section of the Australian community very humbling and important that the head of the Catholic Church has seen fit to honour this which very distinguished Australian. I share the obvious enthusiasm of many in the Catholic community in Australia for this event that occurred in the sight of so many thousands of Australians of all ages and from parts of Australia who travelled, often in difficult circumstances, to the special mass at Randwick racecourse. That was a reminder to even the most profoundly cynical and sceptical in the Australian community that there is a very strong and deep Christian streak within our ranks. This is an occasion when I think all Australians can honour itand honour the contribution that it has made to the building of our nation.",66
72,Mr TIM FISCHER,MACKILLOP,"I support this motion on the beatification of Mother Mary MACKillop. I say at the outset that the importance and solemnity of the beatification last month and of the motion before the House of Representatives moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), is in no way lessened by referring to the extent to which Mary MACKillop has arrived in the psyche of all Australians and a particular grouping of Australians when at the most recent cricket test at the Adelaide oval a banner was unfurled which said 'Gatting's 100, Mary MACKillop's 2nd miracle'. That was a deserving accolade in all the circumstances. It was worthy to the extent to which the message of Mary MACKillop has penetrated. But, to be fair and to be more accurate, if she was really involved in that exercise, she would have been on the side of the Aussies, not on the side of the English. Mary MACKillop was a pioneer of her - time-not necessarily the pioneering we associate with explorers and those intrepid men and women that opened the way for the settlement of Australia. Hers was, rather, a contribution that was spiritual through improving the minds of country people, through her determination to see the education of children carried through and through the provision of opportunity to so many people. Mary MACKillop placed the dignity of humankind above wealth and ambition. As such, she was dedicated to all Australians, not just those of the Catholic faith. It is interesting that in her life she reached out to so many people. When she was turned out of the convent inÂ· Adelaide during the crisis of her excommunication, it was with the Jewish businessman Etnmanuel Solomon that she found refuge. She maintained a long friendship with the Barr-Smith family, philanthropists from Adelaide. She had special links with the Presbyterian Church, and I understand one of my colleagues will cover that in more detail later. She was an Australian of great importance to people other than just Catholics. I commend her understanding of the Australian community which was shaped by her own life, a life that saw her father frequently unemployed. Her large family was constantly on the move in search of work and had very little money for food and clothingconditions, in some places, reminiscent of today. Equally, having spent much of her life in rural Australia, Mary MACKillop was no stranger to the uncertainties facing farming communities and families being forced off their land by horrific droughts, floods and tough economic times-again, experiences that sadly are still valid today. I salute the Sisters of St Joseph and their founder, Blessed Mary MACKillop. In the same way, I salute the Reverend John Flynn, the famous 'Flynn of the Inland', and all religious leaders who over the years have helped Australia and the well-being of Australians. I welcome the presence in the gallery today of a wide cross-section of the community to listen to this motion, and perhaps to listen to question time later on. I am sure they will be peaceful. I hope they will be peaceful. I i would never urge otherwise. I wholeheartedly support this motion. I was very moved and privileged to have been at Mascot airport to welcome His Holiness Pope John Paul II and also to have attended, with a very large crowd, the beatification mass at Randwick. I wish the Sisters of St Joseph every onward success. They are deserving of their place in the sun, especially that which has emerged with the beatification of a wonderful Australian, Mary MACKillop.",67
73,Mrs CROSIO,MACKILLOP,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (2.13 p.m.)-It is with a great deal of pride and honour that I too rise to speak in support of the motion before the House on the beatification of the Blessed Mary MACKillop. If any person could serve as a role model for us all it is Mary MACKillop, a truly remarkable woman-and previous speakers and our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have acknowledged that. Her road to sainthood has been marked with setbacks and paved with obstructions. In Australia we tend to glorify our famous artists, sports people and television soap stars. Sometimes we overlook the quiet achievers, the hard sloggers, like Mary MACKillop. But the beatification of Mary is a defining moment for Australian culture. She deserves to take her place on the honour board with our greatest Australians. Whether Catholic or not, we should all be proud of this remarkable woman. Mary's beatification gives us hope. It vindicates the stand she took; that is, the stand for what is right. Her challenge to civil and religious authority, her defence of the poor and the underdog, her belief that she had to help alleviate suffering and her vision for a more compassionate society would give hope to those who struggle and suffer. Her beatification comes at a time when Australian history is reclaiming the lost voices of women. But her achievements took place in a society in which granting such a privilege to an Australian woman who was not yet 30 was never done. In that sense, Mary MACKillop stands as a model for Australian women. Australian born of Scottish parents, Mary grew up in the gold rush era. She had first-hand knowledge of poverty and hardships endured by the families of miners and other working-class settlers. Along with Father Julian Woods, Mary established a system of schools, hospitals and welfare centres crossing state lines. She refused to be put down by men wanting to control her work. Mary commenced teaching in an abandoned stable at Penola in South Australia. It is not difficult, even today, for us to glean that hardship featured in her life from the very outset. She experienced discrimination in Bathurst and Brisbane. She was accused by bishops of being young, sentimental, colonial, born in Australia, of non-Irish stock, femaleshamel-the daughter of a bankrupt colonial seminarian, a former excommunicate and a strong personality. She was accused of being obstinate and ambitious. Although a supporter, the one-time Bishop of Sydney, Patrick Moran, insisted that she stand down as the head of her order in 1885 and prevented her from resuming her position for more than a decade. In 1885 the Australasian hierarchy voted 14:3 that the Josephites be subjected to diocesan control, but the Vatican, under Pope Leo XIII overruled the Australian hierarchy, so MACKillop won in spite of opposition from most Australian bishops. Really, that was some feat. But she has left a legacy that will endure as an educator who created a structure which was in its heyday educating more than 100,000 boys and girls a year, from a time when their grandparents had no education. Mary MACKillop epitomises courage and conviction and, most importantly, a sense of justice. As our Prime Minister stated not only in the motion today before the House but particularly in his farewell speech to His Holiness Pope John Paul II on 20 January this year-and if the Prime Minister does not mind, I would like to take two lines out of that speech: In honouring this great Australian womanand he was referring to His Holinessyou have honoured all Australian women and all Australians. Regardless of one's race, colour or creed, every person in this country could not help but relate to that particular statement. Reading through biographical details about Blessed Mary MACKillop, one is immediately struck by the awesome difficulties she faced and the responsibilities that she carried on her shoulders at such a young age. Thoughts of Mary evoke words such as courageous, resilient, practical, spiritual, enduring, but most definitely compassionate. Today there are nearly 2,000 sisters of St Joseph in almost every diocese in Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, Peru and Ireland. In a very harsh, male dominated society of that time and particularly a different culture from what we experience today, Mary established through her church a need that she thought was there, and she wanted to be part of, to overcome poverty. I think we could all learn today from her courage. Poverty was very real for Mary MACKillop. She and the nuns in the order could identify with the poor. Yet she set out to educate the children of those poor families, gratis if necessary, without any financial assistance from governments or outside sources. To this end they decided that all Josephites should live among the poor whom they served. They had no houses, land or money in their own right and they subsisted solely on school fees and the gratuitous offerings of local people. I am pleased that it is the federal government of today that has recognised the importance of independent and innovative curriculums such as the one in the Mary MACKillop College in my electorate. An allocation of $2Y2 million has contributed enormously to the building of that college. We have had in my electorate for over 60 years a centre of excellence of education run by the Sisters of St Joseph, but it took that grant coming forward to enable them to build a college which is now called the Mary MACKillop College. It educates girls from year 7 to year 12, and some 900 girls from some 40 ethnic nationalities attend that college. That school of excellence came about because of the determination, because of assistance from our government, but particularly because of the assistance and support of the parishioners and the parents, and they need to be congratulated for it. I am proud that the dream of Mary MACKillop continues this day not only in my electorate but also throughout Australia. In co-founding that excellent order of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, and indeed overcoming all of the obstructions that she faced in a community of that time, despite her good works and intentions she always had an abundance of detractors which, I think, at times inspires many females today to fight on. Among her supporters, as has already been indicated, were many people who were not of her faith, but they saw that she was an enduring, compassionate woman who wanted, with that need of justice, to carryon those works. She was able, at all times, to achieve because she was tolerant and she did have compassion. In establishing 160 Josephite houses and 117 schools attended by more than 12,000 children, Mary's record is second to none. She fought for autonomy for the Josephites. Her followers in the order became known as the Brown Josephites. They are quite different today to what we had when I was educated as a very young girl, but I do not think that today I would be doing with my life what I am doing without the influence that they had on me at a very young age. Mary MACKillop was well before her time in insisting on the importance of a national structure in disparate Australia. Without question, this assisted her aim of educating large sections not only of the Catholic poor but of all who sought her aid. In all places that were marked with bitter disputes with one or more bishops, she always overcame those problems. Again, I commend the motion. I thank the movers of the motion for the support that they have. given to this wonderful woman. I am sure that she will continue to be a person we look up to for the rest of our lives.",67
74,Mr VAILE,MACKILLOP,"Not only as a member of the House of Representatives of the national parliament but also as a Catholic and as one who was educated by the Josephite sisters, it is certainly a great honour to be able to commend and support this motion before the House this afternoon. It is with much pleasure that I rise today to commend the beatification of Mother Mary MACKillop, now to be known as the Blessed Mary of the Cross. The beatification of Mother Mary MACKillop comes at a time when the pace of modern society seems hellbent on swamping the ideals and values of Christian life in Australia. It was therefore heart-warming to witness the widespread community support for the recent papal tour, along with the subsequent beatification of Mother Mary MACKillop. The interest that was shown in these events confirms the importance of faith within the Australian community, and this should not be forgotten to us in this place when making decisions on behalf of the Australian community. I believe Mary MACKillop' s greatest contribution to Australia has been the development of the teaching order of the Josephite sisters whose talents and skills now exist far beyond Australian shores. If it can ever be said that a person is born with a gift, teaching was the gift bestowed on Mary MACKillop. Her parents, who were migrants from Scotland, instilled in their eldest daughter the importance of an education. She was thankfully given opportunities to develop her intellectual skill-and I say thankfully because gender stereotypes at the time often neglected the intellectual abilities of many potentially brilliant women. Her first teaching job came as a governess to her aunt's children, who lived in a small country town called Penola in South Australia. It was here that she met Father Julian Woods, who inspired Mary MACKillop's passion for reaching the educational needs of outback children. It was with Father Woods that Mary MACKillop began the Josephite order. In 1867, Mary MACKillop took her religious vows in a response to what she knew was a clear call from God to carry out a mission of educating the poor of Australia. Mother Mary's mission never included emancipating the poor from poverty and she never believed that poverty could be eliminated through economic management. She did not believe this was possible. Rather, Mother Mary believed poverty would always exist and that for the sisters of St Joseph to serve the poor properly they must live the same reality. This commitment to radical poverty became the basis of the Josephite order. Mary MACKillop's achievements are more striking given the circumstances surrounding her role within the church of the time. As a somewhat independent woman in an age of men, she was often treated cruelly and harshly by her male hierarchs. For example, five years after starting the Josephiteorder she was excommunicated by the Bishop of Adelaide for insubordination. Again, a later Bishop of Adelaide believed the many malicious rumours circulating about her and tried to have a kangaroo court dismiss her once again. Yet despite these setbacks she continued to champion the cause of the poor, and it is this point that makes her a heroine to all Australians. These harsh times also say something for the strength of the Josephite sisters who never wavered from their belief in Mother Mary. Indeed, it was during her excommunication that the Josephite order strengthened in its resolve. Mary MACKillop is seen more than just an educator of the poor, the deprived and the underprivileged. She is seen as a visionary who stressed the Australian foundations of her faith. . .. Against the wishes of the bishops, who wanted her enterprise to be regionally based and influenced, she emphasised the necessity for an Australia-wide vision. She looked for an educational institution which could reach across physical and racial boundaries. Indeed, long before a federation of Australia was even thought of, she was thinking of a body which, in its mobility and homogeneity, would cover the whole continent, including New Zealand. One important example of this vision is the Mary MACKillop College in Port Macquarie. The previous speaker, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), talked about the Mary MACKillop College in her electorate, and there is also one in my electorate in Port Macquarie on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. It is considered one of the finest educational institutions in the region. The legacy of the 19th century Josephites continues. From hearing the fascinating history of Mary MACKillop, I am encouraged by her remarkable ability to extend friendship and kindness to those of different religious traditions. Her love and affection to all humans, regardless of faith or racial background, was reciprocated by non-Catholics who supported and encouraged her, particularly when members of her own church persecuted or rejected her. Throughout Mary MACKillop's life she befriended and was befriended by the entire spectrum of humankind, most being drawn to Mother Mary by her fierce determination. An important example of this is. the marble slab over her tomb, which was paid for by Scottish Presbyterians. In the eyes of many Australians, therefore, Mary MACKillop is a shining example of what life is all about. Her whole life was a miracle of determination and devotion to a set of principles which she never wavered from despite enormous challenges to this selfbelief. Mary MACKillop shows to us all today that the human spirit is alive in us all and it is up to each of us to hold on to what we believe. Mary MACKillop was, in many ways, a pioneer of the Australian character. She was an underdog, often the ultimate underdog, and as such can be considered one of the ultimate Australians. Her essence as an Australian drew love and affection from the Australian people. She set an example for Australians regardless of race or religious beliefs. She is indeed the epitome of everything Australia stands for. It is an honour to be able to speak in this the national parliament acknowledging the beatification by His Holiness Pope John Paul II of Mother Mary MACKillop, founder of Australia's first religious order, the Congregahave tion of the Sisters of St Joseph. Ms eRAWFORD (Forde-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development) (2.28 p.m.)-It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak on this motion and to also pay homage to the beatification of Blessed Mary MACKillop. I think all of us have heard a great deal about her life and the things that she did. But, when we look at her beatification, we need to look at what it is that sets her apart and makes her so special to Australians in general and Australian women in particular. We need to look at the way in which her life had a sense of purpose and a sense of vision. We know that she was poor, but she saw her vision and her purpose in life as bringing education to the poor and-something which is often overlooked-having her order care for women who were abandoned by men who went droving or to the gold rush for months at a time. Her understanding of the Australian society in which she moved and in which she was born gave her a basis on which to pursue her faith in a particularly Australian way. Despite the fact that the establishment of the order and the way in which the bishops at the time attacked her, she continued to pursue her vision and her goal. All of us have heard that Mary was not to be controlled. As well as that, she was to create an order which had a woman as its superior-not a male bishop, as was the norm at the time. In doing so, she challenged not only the people around her but also the hierarchy of the church at a time when the church and the church's control was seen as an integral part of society. We respect Blessed Mary for her tenacity and her belief in what was right. More importantly, we respect her for the kind of loyalty that we see exhibited in the sisters after she was excommunicated. It is that bond that makes Josephites special. That makes Mary MACKillop special and it is her legacy to us. At that time the sisters turned to each other and turned to Blessed Mary for support and to reassess and redetermine what they were doing. They knew that what they were doing was right. Whilst parish priests might railed at them from pulpits and called them ignorant servant girls, in their hearts they kept alive their sense of purpose, their sense of vision and their sense of Christian commitment. We see in Blessed Mary an inspiration because she was a battler. She remains to all of us a real person- She is someone with whom all of us can identify. She is someone who knew poverty intimately within her own family; someone who did not come from what is often perceived as the ideal family, but came from a family in which there were difficulties andÂ· where poverty was the order of the day. She was a woman who, though she had education, sought to expand that system of education and bring it to the poor. We recognise that. That was her legacy to the thousands and thousands of Australians to whom she has provided an education. In providing Australians with an education, she has created an opportunity for people to be part of the mainstream of Australian society and to be able to participate fully in our community. We also see her as an Australian who did hot recognise state boundaries. She was an Australian first and foremost. She did not see a need to operate within lines drawn on a map. She saw needs. She travelled. She was always conscious of the fact that Australia, with its heritage and its land, was wonderful andÂ· beautiful. But underlining this, and underlying the things that make her a saint, is her charity; her charity in the very real sense of the word; her love of her church and her love for her fellow human beings. This was charity at work. Hers was a life which was lived through love and caring for others in the community, including those who were abandoned by people who perhaps were in a position to operate and function in a better way. Blessed Mary and the sisters of St Joseph have shown us in a particularly Australian way that it is possible to live out a Christian commitment in a harsh land a long way away from Europe, and to move among the poor and disadvantaged people and live a life of love by example. If we Australians see nothing else in Mary MACKillop, and if we learn nothing else, we must learn about her charity and her care for the disadvantaged and women who have been abandoned in a society where excitement, distance and isolation are the norm. Her beatification is important for all of us. However, it is only important if we take up her challenge, her sense of vision and her sense of purpose to create a just Australian society.",69
75,Mr CAMERON,MACKILLOP,"I, too, am delighted to speak on this motion. Blessed Mary of the Cross, or Mother Mary MACKillop as she is better known to most Australians, has a lot to answer for. If it were not for the teachings of her sisters at a tiny school called Nangwarry in South Australia, I have absolutely no doubt that I would not be standing in this place today, because my education after primary school went completely downhill at the hands of the Marist brothers. I would like to tell the House a little bit about that school. It was just down the road towards Mount Gambier from the town of Penola, where Mary set up her first school. Our school was built by voluntary labour by the workers of the town of Nangwarry. To describe the town to you: it was set up after the war as a milling town, and the population consisted almost entirely of immigrants from Europe. A lot of the people there were impoverished refugees from the Second World War who went there in the late 1940s and in the 1950s. They came from many different countries. There was a total of 87 children at the school when I attended, and virtually the only English speakers were the Cameron kids. There were 10 of us all told-a good Catholic family-but not all of us were attending the school at that time. The rest of the children at the school were made up of those migrant families and refugee families and, of course, there were many different languages. In fact, 17 different languages were spoken at the school. And not one of those kids started at the school with English as a first language. The nuns divided the classes into two rooms. Sister Anthony taught grades 1, 2 and 3, and Sister Andrina taught grades 4, 5, 6 and 7. The classes were divided into those separate rows. It is a credit to those women that so many of those children left the school with scholarships. They were absolutely brilliant teachers, as other speakers have said today. There was something about the Brown Joeys that, somehow, the others just missed out on. They were superb women. Sister Andrina coached the football side, and this was in the days of the nuns being in full drag-the heavy brown habits that they wore in those days. She would tuck up her habit, as far as modesty would allow, which was not very far, and she was one of the best drop punts in the south-east of South Australia. Unfortunately, the side she coached never won, but I am sure that if she had actually been playing in the side instead of coaching she would have done far better. It was a remarkable feat for those women to teach children from so many different backgrounds, and from such impoverished backgrounds as those of the migrants and refugees from the war, and to turn out so many reasonably educated kids for the Marist brothers to mess up later on. Mary MACKillop devoted her life, as you know, to educating those in need. She faced the challenge of her times with a loving and open heart; her motivation, an unbounded trust in God and his providence. . . I am happy to be able to report that I am a distant relative of Mary MACKillop. I am quite sure that if she were here today she would say, 'That goes to prove the old adage that you can choose your friends but you can't choose your relatives.' Her legacy is a sisterhood following in her footsteps, caring for the young and the old, excluding no-one, but paying particular attention to the deprived, the needy and the suffering. I think most of you would know of the continuing marvellous work being done by the Brown Joeys all over Australia today. The Blessed Mary of the Cross has not been made a saint for any exclusive group but for all of us, especially all of us Australians. Mary's challenge is our challenge too. Each small act of kindness on our part is a reflection of her love and trust in her God. 'Be good,' she wrote. 'Be united, have courage and never see a need without trying to do something about it.' This truly was an 'Australian who speaks'.",72
76,Mrs EASSON,MACKILLOP,"-Blessed Mary MACKillop is an Australian of whom all Australians can be proud. Although she died to this life in 1909, her spirit and her good works are alive today, and through them she is alive and takes her rightful place in our Australian family. I was delighted to attend the recent papal mass for her beatification. I am also very pleased that in my electorate of Lowe we still have Josephite nuns who are doing wonderful community work today. As our country heads towards the centenary of our federation,it is good to look at the difficulties faced by women and people without power and resources 100 years ago. There were no women ministers or department heads, no women journalists and opinion makers, no women judges or business leaders. In this world a woman from South Australia decided to dedicate her life to God through service to the poor people, amongst the poorest of whom she lived. Her approach was very much in the mainstream of the Australian national character. Not for young Mary MACKillop was the life of the enclosed convent and formal prayer. Her Christianity was directed at action and a straightforward attack on what she identified as the single most damaging condition of the poor whom she saw around her-their lack of education. With education, all further improvements became possible. Without education, almost nothing could be built. Mary MACKillop saw this and, like the best of Australian types, she tackled the problem head on. Putting together her order of nuns, the Josephites, Mary was greatly helped by a wide range of people--Catholic, non-Catholic, Christian and Jewish. As you would be aware, Mary MACKillop was excommunicated by Archbishop Reynolds, the Catholic Archbishop of Adelaide, for disobedience. She was trying to keep her nuns independent of the bishops and properly directed towards her agenda of educating the poor. Women trying to do things out of the control of men have always encountered problems from men, who are themselves sometimes the real problem. During this painful time, before the Pope had her excommunication lifted, Mary was assisted by Mrs Barr-Smith, who was an ancestor of the current member for Mayo (Mr Downer). Mrs Barr-Smith was not a Catholic but nevertheless came forward to help another good woman trying to do a difficult job. This story of interdenominational help is very much part of the Australian characteristic of inclusiveness and being able to see matters clearly. During her troubles with the local Catholic bishops, who worked tirelessly to undermine and defeat her, Mary MACKillop relied on her supporters, her prayers, her faith in Christ and the practical common sense of the Vatican authorities, who ultimately ensured that the local bishops did not destroy what was obviously good and holy work being done by a great woman. The obstacles that presented themselves to the Josephite nuns in their very familiar brown habits were not only human. The .harshness of the land, the heat, the drought, the flood and the distance were monumental in their impact. Yet the nuns persisted and the Australian communities rallied to them. Education for all who presented-be they black or white, Catholic, Protestant, Jewish or pagan-was the bedrock principle from which this great Australian group has never resiled. As a woman who was herself educated by Catholic nuns, I have the highest regard for them. Their example of selfless devotion and tireless works for others is a magnificent example for our younger generation. The great benefit I received was the encouragement from my teachers, especially from the nuns. When I expressed an interest in public affairs, they always urged me on. All my education was directed at the belief that being a woman did not mean that you could not aspire to higher .learning, science, public life or the arts. This encouragement to girls has been vital to the development of Australia and is still needed today:' The benefit of Mary MACKillop was that she targeted the problem of education and was not dissuaded by the bishops, the droughts or slander, of which she had her fair share. In her appeal to Rome she wrote the famous letter that explained her case. In this letter used the sentence 'I write as an Australian'. Her identification in colonial times not with her colony but with our nation, not yet legally born, shows her suitability for our times. She saw that Australia's future was education and unity. In this vision she and her nuns were ahead of the times. In her pride of being an Australian, without any hyphen, she is still in advance of some people today. As we move towards our next century of federation, perhaps we should look to seeing Mary MACKillop as a paradigm of an Australian. Her ingenuity, determination, intelligence and plain stubborn courage are Australian values that are accessible to all Australians, whether Catholic or not. We are advised on the best authority that 'by their fruits you will know them'. The fruit of the life of the Blessed Mary MACKillop is all around us.Â· It is in the education of hundreds of thousands of Australian children over the last century of our national life. It is the unknown work of assistance given to families hit hard by death, disease, unemployment and poverty - talked As our nation moves towards its future as a republic-like Mary MACKillop, I speak as an Australian-I can think of no more fitting accolade for Mary MACKillop than for this government to make a decision to engrave her effigy on the coinage of this country. Let every contemporary Australian see a great Australian woman every day. Her work is with us every day. Let us be reminded of her every day.",73
77,Mr HICKS,MACKILLOP,"It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to support this motion moved in this House by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) regarding the beatification of Mother Mary MACKillop. I do not intend to speak for long, because I know a number of speakers wish to follow me. I want to say how pleased I was to see His Holiness Pope John Paul II come to Australia for the beatification ceremony. Every time. I see this man-whether on television or personally, which is on a very rare occasion-I am filled with admiration because I think His Holiness is one of the great giants of this century. Through his association with Solishe darity in Poland and the happenings in Eastern Europe, he was one of the major movers in bringing down the Iron Curtain. It would do a lot of us well to remember that, and I am sure most people do. I was thinking about the pomp and ceremony at Randwick and at other places where the church and everyone else gathered to celebrate the beatification. Then my thoughts went back to the Josephite sisters as they sat in bush huts teaching young students-to the heat, the flies and the dust. Some of us who have lived in the bush have been in that situation and know what it is like. In those days, a century ago, just imagine it: no clean water, very little breeze coming through the place and the sisters in their brown habits trying to teach the students. It must have been very difficult for them. If we go to some of the old convents in the more isolated areas and see some of the conditions under which they lived, we must marvel at their dedication. I first came into contact with the Josephite nuns in Adelaide when I had some Josephite teachers. I know many people here have about their love and devotion and about I, what wonderful teachers the sisters were. As I found out, they could also be very strict disciplinarians. I have certainly had my share of hidings, I suppose I could say, from the sisters, but all done with love and with worry about the future of the students they were teaching. I suppose this is an opportunity for me in the federal parliament to thank those sisters for the work they did in keeping me the straight and narrow. Now I represent the seat of Riverina, and the sisters are represented there. UnfortunateAustralia ly, as we are fmding right throughout Australthing is, the number of people who have a vocation is dropping. Nevertheless, with the diminishing numbers that they have, they do a tremendous job. I was thinking also about our Australian heritage and about the part the sisters played in that. When we go to some of our bush towns we find first of all the bush hall and the bush pub, and then the war memorial in the town square and the different churchesthe Uniting Church, the Presbyterian Church and, of course, the Catholic Church with its presbytery and convent alongside. Some of those now are of great significance to our heritage and a lot of them are being preserved. I cannot imagine Mother Mary MACKillop thinking in the old days, when sitting in some of the old iron shanties and wooden huts, that some of the buildings that her sisters built would later on be an important part of our heritage. Before I sit down I would like to pay tribute to all our clergy, ministers, priests, brothers and nuns in Australia for the work they have done and continue to do in educating young people and in caring for the poor and the sick. One thing that Mother Mary MACKillop taught us is that her work is of an ecumenical nature. The faith of the people who supported her or whom she supported did not matter; she was there to look after them, care for them and guide them. She was a truly great Australian, and I am sure that Mother Mary MACKillop is watching over the nation today and bringing her blessings to us.",74
78,Mr LEO MCLEAY,MACKILLOP,"I have great pleasure in joining with my colleagues and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in speaking to this motion. While I was listening to the earlier contributions, I was wondering to myself whether, if Mary MACKillop was around in Australia today, she would be all that comfortable with this motion. This is not the sort of thing that Mary MACKillop, from what one reads of her or from what one learns from nuns one talks on with, would have felt all that comfortable with-the Pope coming here for a specific beatification mass for her; all the bishops of lining up to say what a wonderful that was, and the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) standing up in the national parliament and eulogising her. I have no doubt she would never have thought that that would happen. There is no doubt that the life that Mary MACKillop led shows what a person she was. It seemed that she was meeting opposition every way she turned and yet she has been able to inspire people for so long to continue her work. Mary MACKillop, Blessed Mary of the Cross, was obviously a prayerful person and a person who dedicated her life to both God and the poor. She founded an order of nuns which had a rather different rule in those days from the rule of many other orders of nuns. Probably because her rule was different she ran into some difficulties with the bishops. Of course, one of those bishops was also a bishop of a monastic order from which some orders of nuns in those days had sprung. I remember my sister-who at one stage was in one of those orders-telling me she believed that nuns were the first feminists and that, in times when women had a particular place in society, nuns were the only people able to go outside of that mould of being seen and not heard. She said that convents and orders of nuns often gave women an amount of power that they did not have in the normal society of the day. People might have been a little concerned about the fact that Mary MACKillop said she wanted to change some of the structures of the time. The Catholic Church was pretty comfortable with state aid at the time. I suppose it is comfortable with state aid nowbut Mary MACKillop challenged that and said the Catholic Church should do something different. She said that it should teach in schools it did not own, that the order should not own buildings, and that those in the order should lead a life of poverty and service. She felt that the best way for her to serve God was by serving her fellow human beings. Mary MACKillop and Father Woods founded an order that has kept to that rule and has spread right throughout Australia and the world. As other members here have said, around Australia in particular the Josephite nuns have taught generations of people and .have given them the desire to go on and better serve their fellow Australians. Unfortunately, I am not able to say that I went to a Josephite school but my wife did, so the intelligent part of our family has obviously been affected by the Josephites. I think that Mary MACKillop is an inspiration to all Australians. She said in her lifeand showed by her life-that you had to serve people of all religious points of view and not just one in particular. She was dedicated to educating young people, whether they were Catholics, non-Catholics or people of no religion at all. The rule she gave the nunsthat they should have a particular visitation role with the poor and the sick-was something that obviously endeared the Josephite nuns to us. That rule endeared the Josephite nuns to those in rural communities in Australia in particular, as the nuns both served an educative role and did a lot to help keep towns together. In my electorate of Watson, Sydney, there are a large number of Josephite schools. The school at Campsie is one of the earlier schools, if not the first school, that the Josephite nuns started in New South Wales. As the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) mentioned, unfortunately, we are seeing fewer nuns in those schools than we saw in the past. But I think that all Australians can join together and take a lot of satisfaction from the beatification of Mother Mary MACKillop. In conclusion; I would like to place on record the work of a friend of mine, Martin Nesbitt, who was very much in the forefront of the movement to have Mother Mary beatified and who unfortunately died before that occurred. He would have been very satisfied a few weeks ago if he could have been at the beatification mass at Randwick racecourse. I am very pleased to join with my colleagues here today in paying tribute to a person who was a great Australian and who can be a good role model for all of us in the more secular times of the 1990s. She showed us that there is great merit in serving one's fellow human beings and that probably one of the best ways to serve God is to do that. I thank the House.",75
79,Mrs BISHOP,MACKILLOP,"I rise to support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I do so because I was done a singular honour. I came to know Father Gardiner, who wrote the official biography of Mary MACKillop, and was done the singular honour of being asked to launch that official biography. On that occasion, I spoke of the connection that Mary MACKillop afforded the Catholic and Protestant faiths of her time. She was unique in her tolerance. I am christened Church of England; I was confirmed Presbyterian. I recall well an episode that is detailed in the book written by Father Gardiner which tells of an occasion where Mary MACKillop was teaching on the lawn, which she did frequently. It rained and rained so she could not continue to teach. She went to the nearest house and knocked on the door. She said, 'I wbuld like to bring my class in. I would like to teach them.' It was a Presbyterian House. Mary MACKillop took her class in. She did not teach there on just one occasion; it was something that went on for .a.long time. Mary MACKillop was a woman who had the daring to confrontthe orthodoxies of the day. She was someone who was fought against by those who exercised power, but she had the courage of her own conviCtions plus her belief and her faith. She fought a long, hard fight. What is remarkable when reading about what she wrote is that she never railed against the bishops who fought her so hard. She was never vindictive. She was constrained in her language. She acknowledged their positions, but she basically said, 'Charige has to take place.' As I said, she was a woman who had tolerance and who exercised tolerance. I agree with others when they said that she was a woman who set a fine example. The Josephite nuns of today are women whom I admire in their commitment, their tenacity and their joy in seeing the beatification of the Blessed Mary MACKillop. I found when I attended the beatification ceremony at Randwick racecourse that I joined across the lines. of denominations and shared in a celebration of the works of someone who brought credit not only upon herself, which she never sought, but also upon her nation. She brought credit because she stood up for what she believed in. She fought those who had power and the orthodoxies of the day. She has finally made her mark in a way that I agree she would never have sought. The honour given to me to take part in the launch of that official biography left with me a feeling of warmth and admiration. As I said, I support the motion because I believe it is a celebration that all Australians can take part in, irrespective of the particular faith they follow.",76
80,Mr ANDREWS,MACKILLOP,"I too join with other members in supporting the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I do so recalling that each day when this parliament opens you, Mr Speaker, read prayers. We, as members of the parliament and representatives of the Australian people, call upon Almighty God to vouchsafe his blessings upon this parliament to the glory of God and also for the welfare of the people of this nation. Much of what has been remarked upon by members related to that service by Mary MACKillop to the people of this nation. I do not think we should forget for a moment the motivation that brought her to give her life to serve the poor in this country. All sorts of things will be attributed to Mary MACKillop in the future. All sorts of causes will be associated with her name. It is not a time to debate this at this stage in parliament. However, I think it is important to recall that it was her belief in a creator-a belief which she shared across Christian denominations and other religious faiths-that motivated this undoubtedly remarkable Australian woman. It was this belief and the living out of it that moved the church to declare her Blessed. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA",77

That is something the coalition has never done. It is what is overwhelmingly the requirement of, as I put it, the national interest.

118,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For the people opposite, let me come at it another way. I said that inflation underpins any interest rate structure and low inflation underpins this one. When the present Leader of the Opposition left office as Treasurer, the rate of inflation was 11.4 per cent. The current rate of inflation is 2.5 per cent and the underlying rate is 2.1 per cent. It went from 11.4 to 2.1 per cent. That reflected the whole interest rate structure of the - ay. The 90-daybill rate in his day, March 1983, was 15.9 per cent and in January 1995 it was 8.2 per cent. Remember this? The home mortgage rate, which was a regulated rate only for those lucky people who could get a loan, was 13.5 per cent. Of course, left to its price in a deregulated market it would have been up to 16 or 17 per cent. In December 1994, it was 10.5 per cent. Have you got that? One-zero-point-five per cent. It is a bit rich for the opposition, which could never as a government deal with inflation and hence deal with interest rates, to be putting questions to the government when the government has made a number of quick and successive monetary adjustments which I think have had the effect of appropriately slowing the. economy---'Mrs Bishop-Tell them they've never had it so good",79

139,Mr KEATING,NOES,"Mr Speaker, perhaps I could begin again and respond to the question. To get the economy for the last year into perspective, we have to understand that our GDP was growing somewhere between 5Yz per cent to six per cent with inflation around two per cent, and in the last calendar year employment growth was 3.6 per cent. That, I think, is probably the strongest conjunction of figures since the war. The current unemployment rate is 8.9 per cent. That has fallen by 1.7 per cent in the last year-the biggest calendar year fall on record. We have the highest number ever recorded of Australians in work, 8,073,000 and, as the Treasurer indicated a day or so ago, we have created 477,000 jobs since the election, or 721 jobs per day. Mr Costello-How many forest jobs?",81
140,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! We have been down this road already.,81
141,Mr KEATING,NOES,"The government set a job creation goal of 500,000 jobs in three years. We are 95 per cent on the way to that target in two years. There has been an extraordinary fall in long-term unemployment of 61,500, the highest ever labour force participation by women in the economy of 52.9 per cent and labour productivity growth over the last year of four per cent against the sorts of averages of the 1970s and 1980s of 1Yz per cent or 1.6 per cent. The economy is now slowing in some areas. The dwelling sector has peaked, consumer and Somlyay, A. M. business confidence levels have eased back from their peaks, real growth in retail trade is below the September quarter, we are starting to see the fiscal stimulus being unwound and, therefore, demand is starting to drift back more towards GDP growth. Much has been made of the current account deficit. Let me say a couple of things about this in the reflection of these quite extraordinarily good numbers for Australia in the economy in the last 12 months. The current account deficit is certainly relatively high, but the situation is so much better than in the past where the extraordinary health and robust strength of the economy is a completely different fact of life from what it was in 1985 or 1986. When the current account deficit was last this high, in 1985 or 1986, the ratio of exports to GDP was 15 per cent. We were exporting 15 per cent of all we produced. Today we are exporting 22 per cent-,-half as much again. The debt service ratio, when the current account was last this large, stood at 21 per cent of GDP----:-:in other words, 21 per cent of our debt servicing requirements, 21 per cent of our product. Today that is 11 per cent. So exports have gone up by half since then and the debt service ratio has come down by half. Our international competitiveness is 40 per cent better than when John Howard left office as Treasurer. Let me repeat the number, because around most OECD countries these sorts of statistics can never be mentioned with any veracity. The Australian economy, on the Treasury's latest statistics, is 40 per cent more competitive than in the last days and weeks that John Howard spent as Treasurer. It is because of that 40 _per cent improvement in competitiveness that exports have gone up by half to 22 per cent of GDP and the debt service ratio has come down. So, yes, the current account deficit is relatively high, but the circumstances are completely different from 1985-86. When juxtaposed against 477,000 jobs, 5Yz to six per cent growth, two per cent inflation and four per cent productivity, when did anyone in this House ever hear numbers like that? Never. Ian Sinclair is the only one who has been here longer than I and he never heard of them in his days here. John Howard never heard of them when he was Treasurer. Let us get this; as the questioner said,. in perspective.",81
142,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,You cannot see the wood for the trees.,82
143,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! I warn the member for 0' Connor.,82
144,Mr KEATING,NOES,"As the Treasurer will make clear, a lot of the growth in the current account deficit is coming from strong investment numbers in the economy. I want the House to recall that at the end of the last election campaign, two opposition leaders ago, the member for Wentworth said that Australia was in a double dip recession, and then in the last week of the campaign he said we were heading into a depression. Six per cent growth puts the lie to that. In the budget debate, the shadow Treasurer said: The business investment figures are crucial to the whole budget. If they don't come in, the budget falls apart. A dark cloud hangs over the future recovery. Business investment is dead in the water. There has simply been no recovery in investment. That was last May when the Treasurer was forecasting 14.5 per cent for investment growth. What is it now? It is 24 per cent. That massive growth in the strength of our capital base, in our productive capacity, because we are not a producer goods nation in terms of mainframe computers and digitally operated machine tools, comes by way of the current account deficit from imports. The Treasurer gave a first-class example yesterday in respect of an LNG carrier costing $300 million on the current account, but carrying $150 million a year of produce year in year out for Australia. I think these numbers need to be put in perspective. Yes, the current account is high, but the conditions are completely different from 1985-86. We have peeled away the restrictive layers of tariffs, the regulated exchange rate of the sclerotic financial markets that John Howard left this country. Today we have an externally oriented 40 per cent more competitive supple, modern Australian economy. If you are out there in the business of looking up polls-and you all regard yourselves as amateur pollsters, although the last election reveals that none of you knew the code to the poll; none of you understood the code-let me tell you what the code is. It has four letters-j-o-b-s. This "" government has given the j-o-b-s to the Australian community..",82

146,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The House will come to order. I think the Prime Minister has concluded. Tax Increases,83
147,Mr HOWARD,NOES,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Yesterday Mr Bob Carr, the New South Wales Labor leader, said that your government has 'got to rule out any increases in taxes' and that 'families that have battled rising interest rates should not have to cop further increases' and that you 'Paul Keating should tackle spending'. Is Mr Carr right to oppose your campaign for tax rises; or do you propose to hide your secret tax agenda until after the New South Wales election; or will you come clean on it now?",83
148,Mr KEATING,NOES,"Mr Speaker, I think he really means that question. He said it with such feeling. I thought he was on a unity ticket with Bob Carr-the east-west flyer. He was flying yesterday. He tells us he is going to open the runway over Kogarah and Rockdale and, as Mr Carr saidMr Costello-I rise to a point of order. Even the Prime Minister could understand that this is a question about taxes, a question about whether or not he will disclose his secret tax agenda, and a question about",83
149,Unknown,NOES,Government members interjecting Mr Costello-Just sit down.,83
150,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will allow me to adjudicate on that. You have got the call for a point of order.,83
151,Unknown,NOES,Government members interjecting Mr Costello-I thought he might make another mobile telephone call from his car.,83
152,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The deputy leader has the call. What is it? Mr Costello-The Prime Minister was asked a question about tax increases-whether or not he agrees with the New South Wales Labor leader that he should rule them out, and whether or not he will come clean about his secret tax agenda before the New South Wales election. Now he is talking about an east-west runway which bears no resemblance to the question. I ask you to direct him to the question.",83
153,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,I rise on the point of order. There is a way of raising points of order in this House. It is specific precisely to the technical detail of a point of order. That has always been the tradition in this place. It is not an occasion for a speech. Mr Costello-What is your point of order?,83
154,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,"It is on your point of order. The form in which that point of order was taken was with a full array of epithets, argument and all the rest of it, which is not permitted.",83
155,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,I think both honourable members have raised valid points in their points of order about the way in which those particular sections of the standing orders should be adhered to. I hope everybody does adhere to that.,83
156,Mr KEATING,NOES,"I was making the point that the Leader of the Opposition was alluding to the New South Wales election. That was the core point of the question. I was simply making the point that he is fond of quoting the New South Wales leader of the opposition. He has a policy unity with him on opening the east-west runway-that was my point-so that Coogee, Randwick, Bondi, Rockdale and Kogarah will be overflown by a coalition government. I was just making that point. Mr Abbott-I rise to a point of order",83
157,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"I have already warned the honourable member for Warringah about taking points of order. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, understanding order 98 I am entitled to take a point of order.",83
158,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"You are, with that proviso. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, my desire is to ensure that your rulings are respected. You said that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had a valid point of order. The Prime Minister has just ignored it.",83
159,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"I say to the honourable member for Warringah, who likes to talk about the standing orders on occasion, that I have repeatedly remarked in this place-as have many Speakers in the past-that in terms of the way questions have to be answered, if he has a look at Procedure Committee reports that have made recommendations which successive governments, not just this one, have chosen not to adhere to, perhaps better guidelines could be given to the occupants of the chair. He might be able to exert some authority over that. Why doesn'the try?",84
160,Mr KEATING,NOES,"The Leader of the Opposition, in his question, made this allusion to taxation, to revenue. Again, I think it is worth bearing in mind that in the mid-year review, which the Treasurer announced two days ago, government revenue to GDP was 24.0 per cent. This makes AustJ::alia, if not the lowest taxed country in the OECD or the Western world, within a decimal point of so being.",84
161,Unknown,NOES,Opposition members interjecting,84
162,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! There are no interjections required.,84
163,Mr KEATING,NOES,"But let me also remind you, Mr Speaker, that when the Leader of the Opposition was last Treasurer-in his last year, in his last budget-he had government revenue to GDP of 26.1 per cent. Now, people might say, 'Well, for those who are not following these numbers perpetually or consistently, what does that mean?' The answer: it means $10 billion of extra taxation. Mr Costello-That's what you want, is it?",84
164,Mr KEATING,NOES,"Mr Speaker, that is the record of the member for Bennelong. Let me just remind the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition, that when I took the Treasury from him, the top marginal rate of tax was 60 per cent; today it is 47. When I took the job from him, the company rate was 46 per cent; today it is 33. When I took the job from him, the bottom rate of tax was 30; today it is 20. These are the relevant statistics which reflect upon the high priest of high taxation in Australia, J. W. Howard. That is why I think that we need to keep these things in perspective. This is one of the smallest federal government sectors in the Western world. That was demonstrated yesterday by the review which had government outlays to GDP at 26.2 per cent compared with-again, in the last year of my friend over here-28.8 per cent. Hey, big spender! He knows all about it. The member for Mayo has that look of relief and joviality. He is feeling better. That was the same with the member for Bennelong in 1983. When I became Treasurer in 1983 and took the burden from his shoulders",84

168,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,"Mr Speaker, you have drawn the attention of the House to many standing orders today. I wish to make comment on standing order 52, the standing orderMr Beazley interjecting",84
169,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,You would not even know where to look in the book.,84
170,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Address your comments to me. Let us not talk across the chamber. The Leader of the House might just contain himself.,84
171,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,The standing order talks about 'order shall be maintained in the House by the Speaker'.,84
172,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Correct.,84
173,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,"Let me draw to your attention, Mr Speaker, that that will never be achieved if every time you tolerate this sort of personal abuse",84
174,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! There is no point of order.,84
175,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,"There is, because if you keep it up, I will keep it up. And I have some nice stories to tell.",84
176,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! I do not think anybody appreciates that. I have already ruled on the matter. The Prime Minister has been asked a question. He is answering that question. I invite him to bring it to a conclusion.,84
177,Mr KEATING,NOES,"I thought the rather jovial allusions made very clear this point: if you had an economy which was introspective, ring fenced by tariffs, with 11 per cent inflation and 10 per cent unemployment, that created only 300,000 jobs over seven years and whose average rate of growth was under two per cent, you would walk out of the job as if the weight of the world was on your shoulders. The member for Bennelong did just that, and it fell to this government to remodernise this country of ours. As part of that process, now that we have so much growth and such a lot of demand, particularly in investment there is a requirement that the public sector playa larger role in the savings base of the country. That is point the Treasurer made the other day; I have made it. This we will do in the budget. When we come to the budget, we will look at all the options, as we have, in my case, in the eight budgets, seven May statements and three prime ministerial statements I have presented, and as the Treasurer has done in the budgets he has presented and the ERC rounds he has presided over and participated in. In that we will, I hope and expect, come to the right judgments. But we will expect the opposition to show some form and at least give the parliament and the country the respect the government's budget deserves, not to be driven back to the sorts of silly games that were played in the Senate of a couple of years ago about trying to upbraid the government but, in doing so, putting the national interest year. asunder. Mr Costello-Do you agree with Bob Carr?",85
178,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! I warn the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.,85
179,Mr KEATING,NOES,"This government has never had any difficulty whatsoever in putting its budgets together, in articulating them, in explaining them and in getting support for them; and we will do just that on this occasion. Balance of Payments Mr JENKIN8--Can the Treasurer advise the House what prospects there are for improvement in the medium term in the balance of payments?",85
180,Mr WILLIS,NOES,"-I am pleased to do so. I can say that there are some encouraging prospects for improvement in the balance of payments in the medium term, but I must say at the outset that does not remove the need for action to be taken to improve it further. Let me refer to some of the factors which give us that confidence for improvement in the future. We all know that rural exports at the present time are being affected by the drought. The impact on the balance of payments this year of the drought and reduced rural exports is about $2 billion. There are now signs of the drought breaking, with the recent rains. If it does completely break, we can expect rural exports to recover quite strongly after this year. Rural commodity prices are increasing. They are up 11 per cent in the last 12 months, in the year to January. That will gradually feed into actual export prices. Non-rural commodity exports have fallen this year. They are down 7.2 per cent in the first half of the year, or about $1.2 billion. This is because of falls in volumes in some cases and price falls in others. A good example of volume fall is gold. It appears that previous stockpiling by the buyers of gold overseas has meant they are running down their stocks at the present time and reducing their purchases from us. That has reduced our sales of gold by about $500 million in half a With coal and iron ore, it is essentially a price factor. As members would be aware, in the negotiations last year with the Japanese there was a further reduction in prices. That was about the fourth year in a row for iron ore, but that has now been turned around with a seven per cent increase from April of this year. The producers of coal are currently renegotiating their price contracts in Japan, and they also expect prices to rise after several years of falling prices. Overall, the outlook for commodity prices remains positive because of expectations of continued economic growth in Japan and Europe-increasing growth-and declining world base metal stocks. The growth in Australia's major trading partners is around 4Y2 per cent and is expected to be that over the next year or two. That is solid growth which should serve our non-rural exports quite well. In respect of resource exports, we will benefit from some expansion to our mining capacity. In addition to the commissioning of several new mines, there have been a number of significant expansions to existing mines. New mines which have come on-stream recently or which are expected to commence soon include the Mt Keith nickel mine, the Marandoo iron ore mine and the MCArthur River lead and zinc mine. We have seen exports of manufactured goods and services grow very strongly since the mid-1980s because of the factors referred to by the Prime Minister earlier--our greatly improved competitiveness and the fact that those industries have become much more export oriented. Manufactured exports have trebled in the eight years since 1985-86 and . services have almost trebled. While those rates of growth are down somewhat this year, the continued improvement in rates of growth in the rest of the world should see them pick up again in the future. The major factor in the strong growth of imports at the moment is increased business investment which, as we know, is now growing at 24 per cent. Likewise, we have seen imports of capital goods increase by 24 per cent in the first half of this financial year. Next year we would not expect business investment to grow at such a remarkable rate, so we would expect there to be less pressure on imports-although we would expect that business investment next year will still be quite strong. Also, these imports add to productive capacity and future export potential. The LNG tanker is a good example of that. We also expect the rates of growth for demand and output to come much closer together next year than they are at present. members are aware, currently there is a gap of something like two per cent between the rates of growth for demand and output. That is spilling over into imports and giving us a substantial increase in the current account deficit. We expect that gap to narrow without doing anything else; just with what is in place at present. As the Prime Minister said earlier, we expect that gap to narrow very considerably, so there will be less spilling over into imports as a result of that narrowing. If we take further action, as I have foreshadowed in relation to the budget, there will be an even narrower gap than would otherwise be the case. Hopefully, there will not be any such gap and we will not have the spilling over of demand into imports in the way that we have seen in the past. By having that tightening we will also improve our savings performance. That is absolutely essential for continued improvement in our current account deficit and in order to give us a rate of growth for the economy which is sustainable. Of course, that is what we all want to see-strong, sustainable growth. At the moment growth is exceedingly strong. We can see. that growth pared back a little to sustainable levels and still have very good outcomes-still see employment growing strongly, still see the unemployment rate coming down, still see real wages and real household disposable incomes continuing to rise. That is what Australians want. Logging and Woodchipping",85
181,Mr MCLACHLAN,NOES,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister-get things in perspective, as he puts it. Prime Minister, you said to Premier Groom yesterday that you would send down a couple of officers to 'get the dud coupes out of the Tasmanian list' within a fortnight. However, of the 124 coupes listed for further evaluation in Victoria, 13 were logged last year, 10 are now being logged, two are designated for firewood, and five simply do not exist. Apart from how you intend to evaluate the ones that do not exist, will you also send a couple of officers to get the dud coupes out of Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia, As where the situation is much worse? Will you now agree that this shambles, organised by your nitwit Senator Faulkner",86
182,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member for Barker will withdraw that comment and refer to members of the other place with their correct title.,86
183,Mr MCLACHLAN,NOES,The Prime Minister uses those words all the time.,87
184,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Refer to them by their correct title, and withdraw.",87
185,Mr MCLACHLAN,NOES,I will substitute the word nonsensical minister. Will you accept that?,87
186,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Just refer to the minister.,87
187,Mr MCLACHLAN,NOES,has demeaned and undermined the conservation evaluation process detailed in the national forest policy statement? Would you now agree that the national forest policy statement-a contract that you signed two years ago with the states-should be implemented as a matter of urgency and implemented to the letter? An incident having occurred in the gallery,87
188,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! Those in the gallery have been warned today. I am sure you would like to hear the answer.,87
189,Mr KEATING,NOES,"Let me make a couple of points, firstly about the national forest policy statement. This has been the Commonwealth's approach to dealing with this stress on the issue of the environment versus the timber industry and creating ways of getting agreement across the Commonwealth for the development of regional forest agreements. A regional forest agreement can then look at all of the values of a state or a particular area of a state and representative reserve systems can be established. The industry will then no longer be set up with a coupe by coupe chase about whether some particular area has been logged or has never been logged or whether pristine stands are involved, et cetera. That is the point of it. At this point, regional forest agreement has been entered into because the Commonwealth has to be invited to participate. Let me make it clear that the reason they have not been agreed to is that the Commonwealth has not been invited. Tasmania is the only state that has not signed the national forest policy statement. Premier Groom is the only person who has not signed the national forest policy statement. The people in the gallery who applauded the member who asked the question should understand that the future for them under a Liberal Party policy is not regional forest agreements or the national forest policy statement but a coupe by coupe fight which, in the long run",87
190,Unknown,NOES,Opposition members interjecting,87
191,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! Those on my left!,87
192,Mr KEATING,NOES,"Those opposite will cheer the foresters while they know full well that in the end Australian public opinion will win out to save those important stands of forest. They know that, and the forest industry people know it too. It is a battle against a great reservoir of Australian public opinion in favour of our natural habitat and those important historic, pristine stands of trees. As an alternative, we have been working towards the development of a plantation based industry and a regrowth industry. We are a very long way down that road. We now want to see an appropriate set of balanced policies in place to protect what is left of those old growth forests. That is a completely reasonable and responsible national objective. Only a Labor government will ever actually establish this policy for the forest industry. Only a Labor government will put the adjustment packages into place to let them move to other areas, to take them out of some of their debts or to let them make that transition.",87
193,Mr CADMAN,NOES,You are a joke.,87
194,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member for Mitchell might be a little careful.,87
195,Mr KEATING,NOES,"The question comes from the coalition. There is a coalition government in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. Not not one one regional forest agreement in the big logging states of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania has been entered into--not one. Yesterday I met Premier Groom in all good faith. I said to him that, in terms of the verification process of some of these coupes, we would try to get it over with quickly. He put out the most tawdry press statement, saying that he had basically screwed these concessions out of the Prime Minister and that he had demanded a meeting with me two weeks later and that I had given it to him, et cetera. In other words, he came not with any interest in the Tasmanian people or its forest industries but with his own shabby political interests-his own tawdry, miserable, rotten political interests. Opposition l1'!embers interjecting",87
196,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The House will come to order!,88
197,Mr KEATING,NOES,I did the only thing I could do with such a person: I dismissed the meeting and told Premier Groom that we will carry on,88
198,Unknown,NOES,Opposition members interjecting,88
199,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! Those on my left!,88
200,Mr KEATING,NOES,"I will read from the transcript of a press conference held on 27 January. I said: Our policy is to protect these areas until values are properly assessed ... That is what we will do until they are properly assessed. Of course, it will be true that some were logged, and logged recently. But let me remind you, Mr Speaker, that when Senator Faulkner sought the cooperation of the states he was denied that cooperation. When Senator Faulkner tried on a number of occasions to enlist their support in the assessment process, the New South Wales and Tasmanian governments responded that they would not cooperate. The Commonwealth is not a forestry agency. The Commonwealth does not have contemporary-to the week, to the month, coupe by coupe-records. It has to be done in cooperation with the states. But there has been no cooperation from the states. As to this notion that some coupe that is missing from the list of 511 has been logged, it may have been logged in the last month or the last two weeks. It may have been logged since the state last supplied data to the Commonwealth. At any rate, one thing is very clear: Senator Faulkner, when he tried, was rebutted by the New South Wales and Tasmanian governments, which would not provide the information. Therefore, it will take longer for the Commonwealth to establish which of those 511 coupes adequately reflects the notional conservation value targets of national estate areas, heritage values, high conservation values, endangered species, et cetera. That first cursory assessment and then the verification, where people actually walk into stands and look where they are in a contemporary way, will take some time. Wouldn't you think, if you were a Tasmanian premier and you were worried about the forest industry's employment, that you would do something genuine instead of something tawdry and grubby---coming up to have a meeting and then running off and putting out a cheap, little press statement instead of trying to help people keep their jobs in Tasmania. I have told this place that, as far as we are concerned, we are prepared to try to assess quickly the status of these particular coupes and then to verify them. But, in doing that, their we will be bringing up to speed Commonwealth knowledge of those particular coupes, which in the ordinary course of events resides with state forestry departments. But that is the consequence of the Commonwealth having export power over woodchips. That is what the government has said it will do. That is what I said we would do on 27 January. That is what we will do. Mr Anderson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Under the relevant standing orders, I ask the Prime Minister to table the notes to which he was referring.",88
201,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Are they private notes?,88
202,Mr KEATING,NOES,"Private notes. Mr Anderson-Then I seek leave to table the exchange of correspondence that has taken place in relation to this matter, including the quite extraordinary letter by the Prime Minister. Leave not granted.",88

205,Mrs EASSON,NOES,"Can the Minister for Communications and the Arts inform the House of the benefits to Australia's economy, the balance of payments and Australian consumers arising from the government's telecommunications reforms?",89
206,Mr LEE,NOES,"While the opposition continues to talk down the economy it fails to give due credit to those industries, such as the munications industry, that are investing, employing and increasing exports in Australia. Since the mid-1980s, this government has introduced a whole series of reforms that have introduced a competitive regime in telecommunications. That has encouraged the growth of investment in manufacturing of telecommunications equipment. In particular, it has encouraged the carriers to invest billions of dollars in improving the telecommunications infrastructure here in Australia. The opposition is not too interested in an industry that is generating a lot of jobs and is positioning Australia for the next century. Let me tell you, Mr Speaker, that this industry's investment in capital equipment is showing. It has increased exports to some extent, but there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of equipment supplied by the domestic telecommunications manufacturing industry. The recent report of the Telecommunications Industry Development Authority has made it clear that about 70 per cent of that massive investment in equipment is Australian content. We have seen export sales of telecommunications go from $50 million a decade ago, when the policies of the Leader of the Opposition were affecting the industry, to more than $800 million this year. So from that $50 million in exports to $800 million in exports, which is directly the result of this government's industry development arrangements, we will continue to ensure further growth in exports in this sector. The growth at the moment is 28 per cent per annum - a 28 per cent compound. Not too many industries can match that. At the same time, this competition has meant that consumers are also getting the benefits. Whether they are residential or corporate customers, consumers these days are benefiting by more than $300 million a year because of the competition that has been introduced in telecommunications. So, as a result of the policies of this government there are lower prices for consumers, greater investment and more jobs in manufacturingMr Cleary-Tell us about the cheap mobile phones that they are using in the Wills electelecomtorate-the working class people",89

208,Mr LEE,NOES,"So while John Fahey refuses to introduce competition in electricity and Jeff Kennett refuses to deregulate the legal profession in Victoria, this government introduces competition and greater benefits in telecommunications. NA Motion of Censure",89
209,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,by leave-I move: That this House censures the Prime Minister for his continued deceiving of the Australian people in relation to: (1) his management of the economy and his threats to impose new burdens on Australian families through higher interest rates and higher taxation; (2) his failure after 12 years in office to tackle the fundamental problems of Australia's current account deficit; (3) the massive accumulation of foreign debt under his stewardship; (4) his failure to provide a stable and predictable environment in which families and small businesses can plan their futures; (5) for presiding over a nation in which the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer and; (6) his cynical use of interest group politics at the expense of timber workers and their families.,89
210,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,"Before the Leader of the Opposition starts, I again appeal to those in the gallery. A censure motion in this parliament is the most serious motion that can be moved. Both the people most concerned with this debate will have a chance to speak and I am sure will put interests represented by people in the gallery. Give them that courtesy; otherwise the attendants will be asked to clear the galleries.",89
211,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"I might say that in the 20 years that I have been in this parliament, it is lem. the first time. I have ever heard a Speaker make that threat. You should be ashamed of yourself for orchestrating that.",90
212,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The Leader of the Opposition should calm down. Nothing has been orchestrated. I heard your comment. It is not a threat; I am simply suggesting to those in the gallery that we in this place want to hear. There is no threat; they are the standing orders of this parliament which those in this place constantly remind me to uphold.,90
213,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"This is the first sitting of the parliament this year. This parliament at a time when the mood of the Australian people can best be summarised as a mood total uncertainty and total bewilderment, verging on anger and frustration. Today, we have been treated from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) with a prime example of that mood exists in the Australian community. If ever a man has demonstrated before the national forum of the Australian people he is arrogantly out of touch with how the Australians feel, it is the Prime Minister today. He has strutted this stage. He has behaved as though he presides like a phal, successful emperor over the greatest economy that the world has ever seen.Â· Yet the reality is absolutely otherwise. This kind of insufferable, conceited, arrogant, out of touch attitude on the Prime Minister's part is confined, of course, to the Prime runs like a river of deceit right through the whole of the government. Let me give you an example. I want everybody opposite and those in the gallery to listen to this. It gives you an idea of enormous problem that not only this governKeating. ment has got-this man Paul J. Keating has got-but also the Australian people have got. The other day, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said: 'The basic economy is in terrific shape ... He went on to say 'except this external side, sion? which is obviously not so flash, and we need to address this'. One of the more whimsical, erudite members of the parliamentary press gallery had this to say this morning: 'That's like saying the Titanic was in terrific not counting the iceberg.' That is the probThe greatest worry is that this man is so invincibly ignorant of the problem that this country has. What the Australian public really cannot understand is that after enduring three to four years of the worse recession in 60 years",90
214,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,You gave us the worse-4.1 per cent of GDP.,90
215,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"The Prime Minister is very fond of quoting history. Let me just say one thing to him about that: youÂ·can rabbit on as much as you like about the past. The more sits you talk about the past, the more you proclaim your embarrassment about the present of and the fact that you have nothing to say about the future. So you can rabbit on, you can talk about 1981, you can talk about John Howard and Malcolm Fraser, you can talk why about Sir Henry Parkes and the prophet Moses, but nothing will relieve you of the responsibility you carry for what you are doing to Australian families at present. Let that me remind you, while we are talking history-then we will get to the future, which is what the Australian public want to hear from John Howard and Paul Keating about over the triumnext 12 months-who gave us the worse recession in 60 years.

226,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,Who gave us the highest sustained levels of interest rates since the Great Depression? Opposition members-Paul Keating.,91
227,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Paul Keating. And, finally, who gave us record levels of bankruptcies and failures? Opposition members-Paul Keating.",91
228,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"It was none other than Paul Keating. We have opened this political year with the news that Australia has the worse current account deficit on record. We were told two days ago by the Treasurer that the estimate of the current account deficit had blown out from $18 billion to $26 billion. That is against the background that when this man became the Treasurer of Australia our accumulated foreign debt was $21 billion and it is now over $180 billion. There is one thing that the Australian people cannot understand. If you took time off from your political hobbies and became a full-time Prime Minister again instead of a part-time Prime Minister, you might spend a bit of time going around talking to the Australian people. You might hear them saying one thing; they would say it in different ways. Some of them would say it politely and some of them would say it ever so impolitely. What they would say is a very simple thing: 'I don't understand this. Our Prime Minister told us that if we endured the pain of the recession there would be some dividend, there would be some gain.' In other words, if we suffered the pain and the discomfort of high interest rates, if we lived through the difficulty of bankruptcy and failure if we were a small business operator and if we lived through the agony of our children being out of work year after year-not because they were stupid or indolent but because they could not get a jobmaybe at the end of the road there would be a little gain as a result of all of that pain. But what has happened? We have gone through the worse recession in 60 years; we have watched this man drive unemployment to its highest level since the Great Depression of the 1930s; we have seen horrendously high interest rates; we have seen Australian farmers groan under the weight of his failed industrial relations policies as well as his ruinous interest rate policies. He waited years before he recognised there was a drought and then he cobbled something together under the weight of absolutely unconscionable political pressure. He was finally shamed into doing something about the plight of Australian farmers. You showed more interest in the cost of tearing down the Cahill Expressway than you did in the plight of Australian farmers. It will ever be to your political shame that it took you so long to recognise the pain and suffering of the great rural areas of Australia. That will not be forgotten in the great rural areas of Australia. The Australian people just do not understand. The pain was supposed to deliver something: it was supposed to deliver a better Australia.",91
229,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,It has.,91
230,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"He says it has delivered a better Australia. This is the problem the Australian people have: here is a man who simply will not face the reality of his failure. Here is a man who would have us believe that you can run up an unacceptably high level of foreign debt and put this country in hock to foreigners. He struts the Australian stage talking about things that we all believe in: national independence, the Australian identity and national sovereignty. But he has done more in two areas to pawn the national sovereignty and dignity of this country since he has been Prime Minister and Treasurer than has happened over the previous 50 years. He has done it in two, ways: he has run us into debt via the expansion and the explosion of our overseas debt and, through the illicit use of the external affairs power of the constitution, he has utterly subverted the federal balance between the Commonwealth and the states. He has used the external affairs power in a way in which it was never meant to be used. The Australian people cannot understand why they should have to suffer the indignity, the denial imd the disappointment of a bare five minutes of economic sunlight and then it is on again. I was talking to one of my state colleagues the ,other day who represents an electorate in the western suburbs of Sydney. She said that when you go door knocking people say, 'I wouldn't have minded if after all the pain of the recession we were better off but we are no better off. We watched interest rates go down for a little while and now they are going up again.' This man, who campaigned at the last election, is very fond of spelling words out. He spelt out jobs, j-o-b-s. As everybody on this side reminded him, what about law, l-aw? This is the man who,' before the last electionMr Beazley interjecting",91
231,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The Leader of the Opposition has the call.,92
232,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"I do not need protection from him. I am perfectly happy. You just stay out of this. As I say, I am perfectly happy.",92
233,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The Leader of the Opposition knows the standing orders. I am protecting him.,92
234,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"I do. I know them very well, Sir. I am just saying that I do not need it.",92
235,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,I will remember that.,92
236,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Before the last election, good old l-a-w, law, who is sitting over here, said, 'I'm going to reduce income tax.' He said, 'You know why you can believe it? Because I said it, and I've translated it into law.' I remember him standing up in the National Press Club and saying, 'These are legislated tax cuts-I-a-w, law.' We all know what happened after the last election. Not only did he tear up l-a-w, law, but for good measure he increased the level of indirect taxation in a way that heavily impacted on the people that he is meantto represent. Yet such is the man's insufferable conceit, his political insensitivity, his infallible belief that he get away with saying anything and his characteristic of regarding the Australian people as being gUllible, I tell you, they are not. They are fast waking up to you and they are fast waking up to the sort of deception that you have practised over the years. _ Speaking only two days ago, he was asked something about increases in personal taxation. This is against the background of the man who promised tax cuts before the last election but delivered tax increases. In other words, he did the exact opposite of what he promised he was going to do. On the John Stanley program he was asked what his attitude was to personal taxation. He said, 'I'm not ruling out anything except to say, ""Have a look at our record in these things.''' I would be delighted to look at your record in these things. . Mr Snowdon-We know yours.",92
237,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,This is the absolute,92

239,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"You, Warren, should listen to this.",92
240,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The member for the Northern Territory!,92
241,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"It is very relevant to your seat. Speaking of members opposite, where is Barry Cunningham? I thought Barry might have been here. I will come to Barry's concerns in a moment. This is what the Prime Minister had to say, and you want to listen to this. Everybody in the gallery ought to listen to this because it really is a measure of the grand delusion of the grand emperor over here. This is what he had to say: 'We've delivered on every tax commitment we've made since 1983.' That man over there would have to be the only person in Australia who really believes that. But if you think that is the only sort of active delusion that has fallen from the lips of the Prime Minister, the man who, whenever anything is good, whenever anything comes right, claims the credit. He has got Bernie Fraser in his right pocket; he has got hands-on leaders. He is running everything. But when it goes wrong, oh no, Paul Keating is not to can blame. No, not on your life. If it goes wrong it is the fault of Malcolm Fraser, it is the fault of the foreigners, it is the fault of Alf Garland, Nobby Clark, Michael Codd, John Stone, Laurie Oakes, Bob Hawke, Wilson Tuckey, Andrew Peacock, Billy Snedden, Jack Birney, Frank Walker, George Campbell and the AMWU. The list just goes on and on. In other words, he has a very simple prime ministerial principle. It is a very simple principle. Government members - nterjecting",92
242,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"No, I do not respect him but you have to acknowledge the cheek and the gall of it. If something accidentally goes right, 'I'm Captain Paul.' But if it all goes wrong, 'Don't blame me. I'm only the Prime Minister. It's a bit unfair. I'm entitled:to be the Prime Minister. After all; as the Prime Minister I'm actually doing you fellows a favour even turning up.' Do not think I am exaggerating that. I did not make that up. He was the bloke who said, 'Basically, question time is a courtesy extended by the executive to parliament.'",93
243,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"Dead right. . - Mr HOWARD-'Dead right', he says. I might be a bit deaf but I caught that interjection. And so it goes on. It was not the only pearl of insensitivity to say that he has kept every tax promise. He also had something else to say in that same interview. He said: The last year is the best economic year since the war. He believes it-I .could tell by his response; Despite the fact that our current account deficit is the worse except Mexico's in the OECD area, despite the fact that we have an appallingly high level of foreign exposure, despite the fact that we have an appallingly high level of youth unemployment, and despite the fact that we have the highest youth suicide rate in the world-despite all of these things-he says, 'Don't worry, it's the best we've had since the war.' The other one that really caught my fancy but I do not think it would catch the fancy of the Australian people-and I say that only in political terms-was when defending high interest rates. He had this to say: I think people have to say ""This is a premium I pay for my job security."" What is he really saying? I will tell you what he is really saying. He is saying, 'You really should be happy that I am putting up interest rates to save your job.' That is a bit like saying it is a recession we had to have, is it not, Prime Minister? Mr MCGauran-The interest rates we have to have.",93
244,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Yes, the interest rate rises we have to have. This man is so utterly out of touch, this man is so arrogant, this man is so insufferably indifferent to the plight of ordinary Australian people, and certainly to the plight of timber workers. It reminds me of that famous saying of the father of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) when he was lamenting the state of the Labor Party. He said, 'When I joined the Labor Party 40 years ago it was run by the cream of the working class. It's now dominated by the dregs of the middle class.'",93
245,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,-'-Is the .motion seconded? Mr Tim Fischer-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,93
246,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"f course I reject out of hand the claims of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and just say: it will take more than the recitation of glib lines from a person without any original political thoughts. For a person who is a part-time thinker and who has no original political ideas, it will take more than a decade long recitation of old rhetoric to win the next election for you. It was not by accident that the Liberal Party passed over John Howard when John Hewson lost the last election. It was not by accident they passed over John Howard to go to Alexander Downer after John Hewson was removed. He is the Liberal Party's third preference but in his arrogance he wants himself to be Australia's first preference. This is the man who, after seven years of opportunity, left behind a moribund, inward looking industrial graveyard, a low growth, low investment, low profit, high inflation, high interest rates, high unemployment, high tariff country. And nobody can deny anyone of those claims. You had low growth averaging less than two per cent, low investment, low profits, 11 per cent inflation, 22 per cent in interest rates at their peak, high unemployment-lO- per cent-high and growing tariffs and, undeniably, on top of all that, an unproductive, inward looking economy. As I said in the House at question time today, the Australian economy is 40 per cent more competitive. Can you believe that any minister in an OECD country can quote a gap, a differential improvement of that dimension to a nation's competitors, of 40 per The Australian economy today is 40 per cent more competitive than when he was in office. I will tell you what else he left behind-a criminal tax avoidance system; a criminally evaded tax base. I will tell you what else he did. When you thumb through the then tax commissioner Bill O'Reilly's telephone book of letters you see him pleading to the clever little Treasurer, being silly and civil, understanding but not hearing, 'Please, Treasurer, help us put criminal avoidance of the tax system.' For five years as Treasurer, he failed to do anything until the MCCabe-Lafranchi report was presented, which he called a stunt. If he had any pride, he would run himself out of public life. Let us get the record straight. Apart from that inward looking, moribund economy he left-the principal charge against him-in terms of the recession he presided over, 4.1 per cent of GDP was lost. In 1990-91 it was 1.8 per cent. He has the prize for having the deepest recession since the war-and if he wants to debate that he should go and debate it with the Australian Statistician. Go to the Australian Statistician and ask him. Then he had the temerity to talk about tax cuts. This is the man who at the 1977 election said, 'Ring up and find out how much the tax cuts will be.' The Sydney Morning Herald had a picture of the hand holding the fist full of dollars. Then he took them away five months later. You humbug! When I became Treasurer he was like a man reborn. He sat on the opposition benches thanking God that somebody could inherit the problem and do something with it. Here he is, after 12 years of change-12 years that has made us the fastest growing economy in the Western world with the lowest inflation rate--on that combination bringing his miserable political carcass back to the opposition front bench of the Australian parliament. Here he is politically limping in like the Bishop of Autun, the Talleyrand of the Liberal Party, scraping his way back into Australian history, seeking to put his miserable politics. What possible use could a modern Australia-a country joining its region for the first cent? time in its history, becoming an outward looking country, getting low inflation and high productivity-have for a man who describes himself as the most conservative leader the Liberal Party has ever had? What use do you think you are to indigenous Australia? What use do you think you are to Asia, to our immigration? What use do you think you are to best practice? What use do you think you are to high investment? What use do you think you are to high participation a suture on the rates in schools? He was quite happy when he was in government to see fewer than three kids in 10 complete secondary school. Now it is eight in 10, and for the first time in our history more girls than boys are going to university. More young women than young men are going to university. He left them. He said, 'If we keep them uneducated we can run this as a sort of narrow elite in a sort of tied-up education system.' He has had only three policies in public life. I have been here with him. He came in 1974. In his political life he has believed in income splitting for families to give income to the high income earners, and labour market reform, which is code for cutting the wages of people under $35,000. He has opposed every wage increase since 1983 for the work force-every single one-through the centralised wage fixing system. He believes in an American style system where you have the American President standing before the Congress. Three weeks ago in his State of the Union address the President was talking about the American working poor who have not had a wage increase in 17 years. Th!:lt is the kind of Australia John Howard wants. He believes: rip the safety net from underneath them and they have got to take the contract-the same as America. They huddle over the railway grates for warmth under a newspaper, or live in substandard accommodation, or live without health care. That is the sort of Australia this conservative apparatchik believes in. Then, of course, we have this sort of morbid rhetoric-the sort of small thrifty shopkeeper gnarlishness. with the red tape of government spending. We have all this antigovernment spending rhetoric but, in his day, he was the big spender- Mr 28.8 per cent of GDP. Look, John, do not waste your time on me, son. I have been around. I know you. I know where the skeletons are in your closet. I know what Bill O'Reilly said to me in private about you as Treasurer and the criminal evasion of the tax system. I know how the tax office guys hung their heads, but when I said,'We are going to basically fight the High Court on the tax base; we are actually going to improve the tax base and make it impregnable; we are going to bring in low tax rates and encourage greater compliance with the system,' the whole bureaucracy lifted its head as if it was a new day-a new dawning. That was the dawning of integrity in Australian public finances. And yet, Mr Speaker, the most conservative leader the Liberal Party has ever had wants to talk about the future. Is 6.1 per cent growth and 3% per cent employment growth and the greatest fall in unemployment in a year not about the future? Is the white paper on the unemployed, to retrain Australia's long-term unemployed and young people-the greatest undertaking we have made in social policy since the war-not about the future? Was the cultural policy of support for the arts and multimedia and CDROM and the information highway not about the future? Was APEC, building for Australia abroad and Asia and Pacific rim markets not about the future? Are you telling us you could have done it? Would you have threaded together APEC? Would you have believed in the social and cultural liberation of the cultural policy statement? Would you have believed in giving long-term unemployed Australians income support, ajob subsidy and ajob compact?No way. Your then Leader of the Opposition attacked it. In relation to the white paper he said, 'Labor's spending spree. Whatever the merits or otherwise it is a spending spree'. That is the contempt in which you held it. That is not about the future? When we hear from John Howard, the very much recycled Leader of the Opposition, it is a case of back to the future. Years ago I did a little ditty in here about .a family walking through a museum. They are looking around and the kid says, 'Mum, what's that?' She says, 'Well, son, that is the Morphy Richards toaster. We used to have one. We used to put the bread in that. You had to wind it down and turn it on.' The kid says, 'What's this?' She says, 'That is the Qua1cast mower. We had one of those at home'. He says, 'Who is this?' She says, 'That's John Howard. He was the Treasurer who put Australia into moribund low growth back in the 1970s and the 1980s.' The boy says, 'But what is he, Mum?' She says, 'He is the future, son'. Don't make us laugh over there. John Howard believes in the glib phrase. Some-' body said the other day, 'He just keeps on talking. He will do as many radio interviews as possible. He will keep running the line through.' But that will not change the central fact because, as I said at question time, when people go through the polls and they understand the code, the code is the one thing that he shies away from like Dracula from a wooden stake, and that is J-O-B-S-the one thing you have never been able to produce. Do you know what John Howard's average was in jobs? It was 52,000 a year. In the years of his treasurership it was a pathetic 52,000 a year. Do you know what this government's average was right through the 12 years? One hundred and fifty four thousand a year-three times as great. Let me tell you another thing about employment. Let me give you another reasonably impressive statistic. Do you know what the change is in real household disposable income? You know what that means. Do you know what the change in real household disposable income is since you? It is 40 per cent. The nation's household disposable income has come up by 40 per cent; that is the change since you. Yet you say, in your tawdry opportunist way, that we have skittled families and small business. Yes, you believe in families. You arrogantly believe that you can speak for families, as if there is something you know about families that the rest of us do not. You say you believe in families. Yet you do not believe in family support. You do not believe in payments to low paid families. You do not believe in a family allowance supplement or additional family payment. You do not believe in Medicare. You have been trying to give a kick-up to doctors for the last 20 years of your life. Let us not burden you with families because families are affected by those people coming back into jobs through the white paper. They are the ones for whom you think it is a spending spree, those very same families. He talks about interest rates and small business. Small business died when he was in office. He left an industrial graveyardindustrial archaeology-in his wake. It was basically the old anvil industries of the pre-war years. They were watching them close in Alexandria and in all the industrial areas across Australia. When he walked out of office he walked out with his head down. Let the people of Australia understand: is the same guy, with no new ideas, only the same simple ideas. They are basically about cutting income for people on low and middle incomes, keeping income up to the rich, not understanding Australia's place in the world, not understanding Australia's psychology or its identity, of having loyalty to other countries and other forums and other norms, and being out of touch with the modern Australia. John Howard would be a disaster for this country, a poor choice for the Liberal Party and an absolutely disastrous choice for Australia.",93
247,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRIME MINISTER," Mr Speaker, it is with pleasure that I second the motion. If we are going to get into spelling words, there is one other word I would like to spell out to the House at this moment. After that disgraceful performance by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), if he is politically something it is this-he is politically d-e-a-d. He is politically dead after being done over by one of the most comprehensive speeches by a Leader of the Opposition ever given. We had from the Prime Minister the recycled approach. We had the accusations and allegations from the Prime Minister, dwelling on the so-called criminal taxation policy development. But who is the only Treasurer of this country to be a criminal and fail to put in an income tax return? It is none other than the Prime Minister. In his speech the Prime Minister referred to the need for Australia to build links with other nations, and to build its timber industry product exports and to reverse the situation where Australia is a massive net importer of timber products-to use one industry. But let me take the Prime Minister back to 1957. Who was it that brought about the breakthrough in building a trade treaty between Australia and Japan and between Australia and Korea? It was the coalition government that had the foresight to do that. I come forward to last year, to 1994. When the coalition was in government, under Malcolm Fraser and Doug Anthony, it developed special extensive relations between Australia this and New Zealand and negotiated the crucial CER agreement between Australia and New Zealand. Guess what happened last year in relation to that, and costing Australian inbound tourism industry jobs? Guess what really happened, drawing the ire of the Premier of Queensland, Premier Goss? The Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) did a backroom deal. They pulled the pin on Air New Zealand and brought in protection in the skies, not in Australia's national interest, and jeopardised the whole spirit of CER. So in terms of externalities it is the coalition that has the record. If you want to get down to just one other point with regard to the Prime Minister, if you want to get down to a criterion that really counts, turn to none other than the Economist magazine. Do honourable members remember the Prime Minister quoting the Economist from time to time?",96
248,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,An English magazine.,97
249,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRIME MINISTER,"An English magazine which the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and others choose to quote. In this particular edition on page 20 is a table which perhaps goes to the core frustration of so many people seeking work at this time and so many people worried about their jobs at this time. It relates to the gap between rich and poor in Australia after 12 years of Labor government. What does that table show? It shows that the gap is greater in Australia than in all other OECD countries but one. The gap between rich and poor is greater in Australia than in New Zealand, Switzerland, Canada, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Sweden and Japan. Twelve years of Labor has enlarged the gap between rich and poor. That is the true legacy of this federal Labor government. That is why the government will perish at the next federal election, whenever it has the courage to bring it on, and that is why we stand ready to do battle with the government. One thing we did not hear from the Prime Minister was any detailed defence of the government's record. We know why. It is not only the gap between rich and poor but our national debt figure detailed so clearly by the Leader of the Opposition, a range of other factors and the internal agony of this government. I want now to bring to the House for the first time a copy of a letter from one member of this dispirited government: the member for Lyons (Mr Adams). He was perhaps trying to make some effort to save the jobs of some Tasmanian timber workers. He wrote to his colleagues last week: While all that was happening those of us who might have been able to facilitate a more rational outcome couldn't get anywhere near the key decision makers. The fact that important information reaches the green lobby several days before it reaches the unions, industry or the Government, is a solid indicator that we need a major overhaul of decision making processes. That is the letter from the member for Lyons. Let him come in here and deny it. He went on to say: I can tell you that the claims made about the conservation values of a whole swag of primarily National Estate forests in Tasmania are simply not true. There it is-a government member letting the cat out of the bag. You are guilty with regard to process in relation to the timber industry and you are guilty with regard to outcome and lack of outcome with regard to the timber industry. That is why this week, in conjunction with all my colleagues-including the shadow minister for environment and heritage, the shadow minister for primary industry and our senatorial colleagues-I have tried to bring this timber industry debate back to where it belongs: with the national forest policy statement signed a couple of years ago. The tragedy is that that statement was never acted on and never implemented, because the Commonwealth government never gave the criteria to the state governments to proceed with their regional plans and assessments. It is not a bad document. It is a good baseline for getting it right in the timber industry, for. getting the answers that should have been out' months ago, not the shemozzle we have every 12 months, which this time has got out of hand because of the total inadequacy of Minister Beddall and Minister Faulkner. Where did that incredible list come from? How can you stand up and defend that extraordinary list, the core of the Prime Minister's decision making announcements of last Friday?It is a case of getting back to the drawing board, and fast, so the people who have been peacefully demonstrating this week in and around Canberra, as is their democratic right, can have some clear-cut answers with regard to their future jobs. This is not an unreasonable request. Mr Bevis interjecting",97
250,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRIME MINISTER,"I am sorry the member has interjected because he has alluded to another thing which the Prime Minister got wrong today. Late this morning, the Prime Minister said that I had displayed contempt for the institution to which I was elected-the parliament-by inciting.demonstrators to disrupt question time today and on Monday. I have to say, I was. I have a copy of the transcript here. I seek leave to table the transcript of my remarks to timber industry workers. I have shown it to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). Leave granted.",97
251,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRIME MINISTER,"The reason that I have tabled the transcript is clear enough. It shows that I was talking to friends in the timber industry. I was not being political; I was giving them information with regard to the sittings of both houses of parliamentsomething they are entitled to, whether the government likes it or not. I told them when both houses were sitting. Some of the people who are presently in the gallery may have been out there listening this morning when I spoke just after the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, Ian Armstrong. I said that both houses were scheduled to have question time today, the exact timing of which is not always known or familiar to members of the public. Sometimes they do not quite realise when question time is held. So I explained that question time is at 2 o'clock in the Senate and at 3 o'clock in the House of Representatives. I explained that I had asked a question of Minister Beazley yesterday ancl I hoped that there would be questions from members on both sides of the House today to the Prime Minister on this occasion-the first time this year that he has finally graced us with his presence in the parliament. I think that is a perfectly reasonable explanation. It was interesting that the Prime Minister did not seem to pursue the matter during his privileged visit to the parliament this afterrioon. I want to say how grateful the opposition is, how grateful the Australian public is, how grateful, perhaps, the timber workers are, that finally our part-time Prime Minister has decided to put in a day's work and turn up at the dispatch box in the House of Representatives-a little overdue. Can I say how humble we are to see the Prime Minister in the parliament today actually answering questions for the first time this year. We are delighted to see that he is man enough, for one day out of this whole parliamentary week, to attempt to answer some excellent questions from the coalition. Is he not doing a great job? We - see all around us evidence of his government's tremendous achievements-timber workers and environmentalists alike; the army of the unemployed; average Australians allover the country who are delighted to be paying what I think the Prime Minister called a dividend in the form of horrific increasing interest rates to keep their jobs and to keep growth! Enough of the sarcasm; this Prime Minister and this government are an absolute disgrace. How can you trust the Prime Minister and the Treasurer on the matter of interest rates? You simply cannot. How can you' trust the Prime Minister and the Treasurer on the matter of a taxation structure for the next budget? You cannot. How can you trust the Prime Minister on the management of our timber resources? How can you trust the Prime Minister on seeking to balance the budget? How can you even trust the Prime Minister to successfully open one simple thing-a north-south runway at Mascot? The performance of this government is an absolute disgrace. It has not learnt that if you do not stick to an agreed and orderly process of conservation evaluation with regard to the timber industry and correct forest policy processes, the result will be what we see all around this building today. This is not just an argy-bargy argument between timber workers and environmentalists. This is a complete failure of government policy process to arrive at decisions on time, in time to protect jobs and in a fair-mannered and properly constructed way. Indeed, it is a total failing of . not only Minister Beddall but also previous ministers who have held this portfolio, including the member for Maribyrnong. (Mr Griffiths), Senator Cook and others. They have all been sitting on this policy statement, along with environment ministers. I draw the attention of the House once again to who signed this policy statement: the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, Paul Keating; the Premier of New South Wales - now and continuing after 25 March-John Fahey; and Premier Jeff Kennett of Victoria. As well, Premier Wayne Goss of Queensland; the then Premier of Western Australia--dare I say it-Dr Carmen Lawrence; and the Premier of South Australia, Lynn Arnold, also signed the policy statement. The shortly-to-depart Chief Minister of the ACT, Rosemary Follett-she goes on 18 February-and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Marshall Perron, also were signatories to this statement. In all seriousness, .this is a pretty incredible document. Governments of all political persuasions and constructions in this country sat down two years ago and agreed to this national forest policy statement. Mr Chynoweth-What about Tasmania?",98
252,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRIME MINISTER,"Tasmania offered to sign a few weeks back and the approach was declined at the time. Tasmania met with the Prime Minister yesterday, and a partial agreement was reached. The Prime Minister did not like the press statement afterwards and, in his best arrogant form, decided to declare the meeting void. How arrogant with regard to Tasmanian jobs. How arrogant! It has got to the stage where it is almost like the emperor approaching Parliament House each day with the presidium guards, or the Lodge legionnaires. They receive their orders from the emperor: 'Push them out of the way or I'll push them out of the way. If they want to give me a message, write to me. ' If the Prime Minister got out of the capital city circuit, really put his head down, went to some decent town and city public meetings and took questions from members of the public, he might realise how grievous things really are in Australia today. He might then get back to comprehensive governance statements involving state and federal governments, such as this national forest policy statement. Then we might see some breakthroughs and some action. But the tragedy is that not only is he a partopposition time Prime Minister-a phrase so well coined by the Leader of the Opposition-but also he is going to depart Australia next month. The Prime Minister is going to attend the CEBIT affair in Germany as part of a five-day visit to Germany. Let me place on record my full support for the Prime Minister's attendance at the CEBIT affair. Let him release the rest of his itinerary, because I hear that he is going holidaying and job hunting in Europe for a period on either side of his visit to Germany. Let me put on the public record just what he is doing in Europe. Of course, he is entitled to visit his family; I would not stand in the way of that. But it is about time he applied himself full time to the job of Prime Minister of this country. The sooner he gets out there to protect the jobs of fair dinkum people who want a fair go-whether they be in the timber industry or any other industry in Australia-the better.",99
253,Mr WILLIS,PRIME MINISTER,"Gellibrand-Treasurer)(4.53 p.m.) This government is always happy to have a debate about jobs. I wish to give the House one statistic about jobs which sums up the difference between the two parties. When the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Treasurer, his government managed to produce 260,000 jobs in five years. This year alone, we will create 300,000 jobs. What a massive difference. What an extraordinary difference in the ability of governments to produce jobs for the Australian people. That one statistic says everything about the i capacity of the two sides of this House. There is one side which can deliver-it has delivered nearly two million jobs since it has been in government, and has produced 300,000 jobs in this one year-and there is an opposition which, during the five years when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, produced fewer than 300,000 jobs. What a comparison that is. It says a lot. This debate today also says a lot. It is the first censure motion by the third opposition leader in eight months. What did he have to say? A censure motion is a serious debate in the parliament. We are supposed to treat it very seriously and listen closely to what the has to say. That is the form of the House. You listen to find out whether there is anything the opposition says which might make one think it should be the government rather than the opposition. Could anyone listening to the effort by the Leader of the Opposition today really feel that he would be the next Prime Minister of this country? How could you possibly have that view? There was not one shred of substance-not one element-which showed any thinking about policy whatever. He just talked about problems, but he had not one constructive ideanot a semblance of a constructive idea. For the 20 minutes that he spoke, you heard nothing on what he would do about anything. All you heard were attempts to play it for laughs with his own backbench and the gallery. You heard nothing of substance. What the people want in a Prime Minister of this country is a man of substance or a woman of substance. They want a person who can lead the country and do it in a way which produces decent outComes for the Australian people. It is certainly the case that, when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer and a very important person in the Fraser government, that was not what was delivered for the Australian people. Eyeryone in the country knows that to be the case. If they do not know it, they can look back at the record and see that it is the case. It is an appalling indictment of the new Leader of the Opposition, who stands up here today with a record as a failed Treasurer and a failed Leader of the Opposition. He has been recycled again to supposedly offer some hope to the Australian people that the opposition might be a credible alternative. What did he produce today? A load of garbage. Not one sensible idea was put forwardnot even a skerrick of an idea. That in itself is an indictment, but it is just running true to form. Because that is what we have heard from opposition members. Since they abandoned Fightback, they essentially do not know where they are. With Fightback, at least they had some semblance of what they stood for. When the Australian people examined that document, they realised it was a particularly nasty piece of goods and were not going to have anything of it. Now that those opposite have abandoned it, they are just floating around in a policy vacuum. They have not got any idea what they stand for. When they do indicate a direction, is there any substance behind it? No. You never hear any substance. They say that they want to reduce the deficit. By how much? They will never say. They do say that it should be done by cuts in government expenditure. What cuts in government expenditure? You never hear any details about cuts in government expenditure because they have not got the guts, intelligence or policy framework to put forward a - ensible array--or any sort--of specific proposals. They are trying to run for government. They are trying to tell the Australian people that they have something to offer, but they have nothing of substance to provide at all. The strategy of the previous Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), was to keep whatever he hadwhich you could probably put in your pocket; it was probably an absolutely empty array of ideas-to himself until the election was announced. He was going to say, 'Hey, presto, here's our set of ideas to show that we should be the alternative government.' He probably hoped that, in the course of an election campaign, no-one would have time to look at them properly. What a pathetic, cowardly approach that is! One would hope the new leader would not be such a coward as to pursue that policy. But judging by today he is. He censures the government, but he has not one constructive idea to put forward. Let us look at the sorts of things that the Leader of the Opposition was complaining about. He criticised the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for his management of the economy and his threats to impose new burdens on Australian families through higher interest rates and higher taxation. The hypocrisy of that is just appalling. It comes from a man who, when Treasurer, had interest rates and taxation higher than they are now. Yet he comes in here and says what a terrible thing it is that there has been some increase in interest rates recently-after a long period of decline-and that there might be some increases in taxation. As the Prime Minister said in his contribution today, he was taxing two per cent of GDP more than we are-that is, $10 billion a year; about $550 per man, woman and child in the country. Yet he comes in here and says what a terrible thing we are doing to the Australian people. If we had his tax regime, the Australian people would be paying a lot more tax$550 more per person. That is the situation. We have reduced tax. We are in one of the lowest taxed countries in the Western world. In those circumstances, to suggest there is something heinous in any suggestion that there might be any increase in any tax at any time is just an absurdity. Let me also say on the subject of taxation that I cannot stand the hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition. He came into this place today and complained about our taking away tax cuts which were said to be l-a-w law. In fact, the first tranche of those tax cuts was paid 7""h months early. The second lot was certainly put off, but its eventual outcome will be announced in the budget. But the real hypocrisy comes from the fact that when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer back in 1978, he was the man who knocked off tax cuts which had been promised at the previous election and put into l-aw law. He turned them around. Those opposite went to the election in 1977 in a fistful of dollars campaign and told the Australian people, 'If you elect us you will get big tax cuts.' Several months later, in the budget of 1978, the now Leader of the Opposition, as Treasurer, said, 'That was the situation; but now we are going to impose an income tax surcharge.' They halved tax indexation which effectively took away, for most people, the whole of the tax cuts. There was a total repudiation of the election promise. That, in itself, makes it extraordinary that he can come into this place now and make a great feature-supposedly-of the fact that there has been some change in our position in terms of tax cuts. We delivered the first tranche absolutely, 7""h months early, whereas he totally overturned the tax cuts which had been put into legislation by the Fraser government before the election; they were taken away after the election. What an incredibly hypocritical approach! The Leader of the Opposition says that after 12 years in office the Prime Minister is to be censured for failing to tackle the fundamental problems of Australia's current account deficit. The problems of the current account are not new in this country. We had a current account deficit of 5""h per cent of GDP back in 1981-82. Who was the Treasurer? It was the present Leader of the Opposition. That current account deficit in effect was the beginning of the increase in the foreign debt of this country. The increasing foreign debt, which is also mentioned in the censure motion, has been a matter for some comment by a well-known Liberal, Mr Michael Warby, who wrote an article in Quadrant of 19 May 1994 entitled 'The Liberal Party: Past, Present and Future'. Mr Warby is also a member of the Federal Council of the Liberal Party so what he has to say I guess has a particular importance. He said: The Fraser Government's performance was, to be blunt, poor. The Fraser government presided over the period when high inflation, mass unemployment and plummeting national saving rates became entrenched, and growth in living standards stagnated. That is his summation of the Fraser government of which John Howard was the Treasurer for five years. Mr Warby continued: Even on foreign debt, the Fraser Government can clearly be held responsible for presiding over the start of the growth in foreign debt, which grew from 11 per cent of GDP to 21 per cent in a mere two years from June 1981 to June 1983. Guess who was Treasurer? It was the now Leader of the Opposition. Mr Warby also said: This rate of growth of foreign debt has only been briefly approached, and never exceeded, under the Hawke-Keating governments. So writes Mr Warby, a member of the Federal Council of the Liberal Party. That is an honest exposure of the fact. What he says there is absolutely true. Economic performance was appalling and there was also a spectacular increase in foreign debt while the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer of this country. The whole weakness in the external account was incredibly developed in that time. So was the loss of national savings; they declined markedly whilst the opposition was in office. It is absurd to say that we have done nothing to address the external account. Of course we have. The Prime Minister has been increased through the detail of that in question time in the censure debate so I do not intend to to the details. But, obviously, there has been an enormous improvement in the efficiency this economy and in its international competiincrease tiveness and capacity to trade with other nations. That has been recognised by Standard and Poor's-the rating agency-in reaffirming Australia's ratings just earlier this week. thinks our foreign debt and current account are so bad, why did it reaffirm our ratings? quote from its media release, which states: Improvements in overseas competitiveness growth prospects have been driven by important shifts in government policy over the past decade. Tariff reductions, along with deregulation structural reforms affecting a range of industries, have improved productivity and the functioning of the labour market. Exports are gradually diversifying and gaining market share, helped by declines in the real exchange rate in recent years. So those things are recognised by the rating agencies-the most important bodies which assess the credit rating of the nation. In a sense, they are very important critics indeed. They look at those things and say, 'These are very good achievements. On that basis, because these things are being done, we reaffirm the rating.' So it is not a matter of nothing being done on the external account. An enormous amount has been done on the external account. That shows that this government has not been idle and simply allowed an external problem to develop. It has been addressing that issue considerably indeed. That is not to say that there is nothing more to do. Of course there is more to do. There is more to be done about improving efficiency and improving national savings. What has been announced by me earlier this week shows that we intend to do that. It is also said by the opposition that this government has produced a more unfair distribution of income, that the poor have got poorer while the rich have got richer. I do not doubt that the rich have got richer, but it is absolute nonsense to say that the poor have got poorer. Mr Sawford-Everybody's got richer. MrWILLIS---Everybody has got richer. The fact is that we have very substantially benefits for people on various social and security benefits. We have had a 15 per cent go real increase in age pensions; a 36 per cent real increase for sole parents with two chilof dren, renting privately; a 56 per cent real for single unemployed people renting; a 151 per cent real increase in additional family payments for teenage children; and a 78 per cent real increase for children under 13 If it years. Single parents with two children and renting privately were nine per cent below the I poverty line in 1983; they are now four per cent above it. So do not give us this rubbish and about the poor getting poorer. We have looked after people at the lowest level and we have made sure that they are much better off and than they ever were under Liberal-Natiooal Party coalition governments. I move: That the question be now put. Question resolved in the affirmative. Question put: That the motion (Mr Howard's) be agreed to. The House divided. [5.12 p.m.] (Mr SPEAKER - Hon.

Mr MACK-I direct a question to you concerning the existence of a blockade this week. From my point of view, the blockade NOES has represented harassment, intimidation and a physical strain. It seems to me that it is a breach of privilege, and I ask you to investigate the matter. I would also like to ask you to initiate the formulation of clear guidelines concerning demonstrations affecting parliament, members and their electorate offices, particularly in view of the fact that in recent times we have had a number ofincidents. We have had the postal strike disrupting our mail; we have had the third runway people playing a recording of aircraft noise in the early hours at members' dwellings; and now we have this blockade. Things seem to be escalating and I think the situation should be brought under control in some way.",99
254,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The honourable member for North Sydney has asked me a question which in fact canvasses a number of different matters. 'I wOlild like the opportunity to prepare a thorough response for the members of this place, and I will undertake to do that. I might just say in passing, however, that the Joint Committee on the National Capital and External Territories is presently conducting an inquiry into the subject matter of demonstrations on national land, which encompasses this building. Might I suggest to the honourable member and any others that have an interest in that that they can perhaps make a contribution and a submission to that inquiry, which is chaired by the honourable member for Dunkley. But, as I said, I will give him and the House a fuller answer on this. That will probably be next week. PAIRS Visitors' Passes",103
255,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"In the interests of saving time, I have only one question. It concerns the issuing of passes to visitors to this' place. Today I had the surprising experience of having some visitors come in who were not allowed to have unescorted passes which I had requested for them. People in front of them were given unescorted passes. My guests were asked whether they were associated with the protest outside. When they said that they were, they were told they were not allowed to have an unescorted pass. I would like you to comment I think this is shocking. I hope you agree with me.",103
256,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I can say to the honourable member for Cowper that, again, this will be part of the broader statement. I will make next week. But in respect of this specific matter related to your guests that were issued with a different class of pass from others in this place today, that should not have occurred and I will investigate it on your behalf. Freedom of Speech",104
257,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"My question relates to both the question asked by the honourable member for North Sydney and also the conduct of question time when the Prime Minister was speaking earlier today and that raises the question of freedom of speech. We have had examples in this parliament before when people who were in the gallery made a reaction in support of the government. No action was taken at all and, indeed, it was accepted as if it was a good thing. But when we have people in the gallery who want to have their point of view expressed, whether it is by coming into the building-as we just heard then; they are being censored-or whether they come in here and they want to express their point of view against",104
258,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,And the question?,104
259,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The question is: it seems to me that we are in danger of losing some of our freedom of speech and 1 would like you, Mr Speaker, when you are investigating those other two questions that have been put to you, to put a strong accent on the freedom of speech and the need for ordinary Australians to have their voice heard.",104

262,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"When you view those concerns of the member for Mackellar, could you look at the complaints that were raised by the opposition in the Senate to interventions from the gallery during last year and the precedents which have occurred on numerous occasions of clearance of the galleries.",104
263,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I will bring back a full answer to that specific matter for the benefit of members in this place. But, in the meantime, 1 will refer you to standing order 310 relevant to that particular matter. 1 will also refer you to page 151 of House of Representatives Practice and subsequent pages where precedents of this matter have been canvassed because 1 do think, as members in this place from time to time point out to me, that the standing orders should be adhered to and that there are times, however, when of course, at the discretion of the chair, it is a matter of some interpretation so that the place keeps ticking over-and 1 would think that the honourable member for Mackellar might agree with me that an occasion such as today might have been one. Nevertheless, it does not go past the fact that standing order 3 10 now canvasses that specific matter but it is an issue which 1 will also bring back to the House. NA",104

I have been misrepresented by the Prime Minister because at no stage did I seek to incite demonstration from the gallery. In fact I said, and I quote exactly: Yesterday I asked Beazley a question. Well now we'll have the opportunity for people on both sidesclearly meaning the House to ask questions directly of the Prime Minister. and I hope people on both sides do just that. Indeed, the Prime Minister can say all that he likes but nowhere in this statement and in this transcript of my comments out at the demonstration can he find one word which incited violence, interruption or disruption from the galleries, and nor would I ever say such things.",105

282,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being almost 5.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Credit Referencing",106
283,Mr CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to bring to the attention of House the plight of people who, through no fault of their own, become victims of the Credit Reference Association and who are, due course, refused credit for other purchases. I understand the need for the Credit Association and the objective to ensure that businesses are not defrauded by loan defaultForestry ers. Notwithstanding that, I think a review of the rules covering the Credit Reference Association is required to protect genuine people who have unintentionally defaulted on a loan and, therefore, been put onto the lists of the CRAA. I am not asking for all people who come forward with an excuse to be taken off the list; what I am saying, though, is that many people are put onÂ· the list without a fair hearing. The first constituent I would like to talk about is Gary. Gary had a post office address in Northam, which is east of Perth. With his job Gary was sent to Albany, south of Perth, to work for about four months. His mail was collected and passed on by his sister and, in the process, a credit account of $109 was overlooked. This was promptly paid on being brought to his attention. Nevertheless, he has been listed as adefaulter in the CRAA system. I should also note that Gary has had other credit arrangements prior to this to the value of tens of thousands of dollars and these have all been met on time and cleared as per credit contractual arrangements. The late payment of $109-and I point out that it exceeds the listing minimum of $100 by only $9-hasÂ·ruined Gary's credit rating and he now has a non-credit sanction applied for a period of five years. An appeal by Gary to his creditor could not have his name removed, and I am suggesting that the CRAA should allow for this. If the creditor is happy for a debtor to be taken off the list, then so leavetoo should the CRAA be. Another constituent, Sharon, is a: victim of a marriage breakup. A loan was taken out during her marriage in her name only. When the marriage unfortunately broke down, her former husband undertook to pay the account. Sharon was eventually informed that she had defaulted on the loan-the loan her husband had undertaken to pay-so she promptly paid the it. She paid it straight away and .without question. Because her ex-husband did not pay the loan on time, and because the loan was in in Sharon's name, she is now listed as a loan defaulter and, like Gary, has, a non-credit Reference sanction of five years. Both these cases illustrate an unfair part of the CRAA. It is obvious that the agreements that the CRAA has with credit agencies need review to allow for names to be deleted. If the CRAA will not undertake such a review, then I call on the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) to perhaps intervene in these cases. Like many of my colleagues in this place, I am proudly supporting the Australia Remembers commemorations, and I take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) and his office for the hard work that they have put into this. I would also like to congratulate the Stirling Australia Remembers committee, chaired by Mr Jack Babbage, supported by local RSL groups, state politicians in Stirling, the City of Stirling and various other interested parties. I thank them sincerely for their time and effort in organising the Australia Remembers commemorations in Stirling. While on the subject, I know that many of the Australia Remembers committees throughout Western Australia would have valued contributions from the Australian Army Band, Perth. Regrettably, the government chose to disband the band at the beginning of this year, depriving Western Australians of its valuable services. Yet again, Western Australia is being picked on by this arrogant Prime Minister (Mr Keating). What makes this decision worse is that, while the government might argue that it was a cost cutting exercise, the Prime Minister is spending millions of dollars dolling up his aerial gin palace, otherwise known as his VIP jet. He deprives Western Australia of its military band on the one hand under the guise of saving money, but on the other hand he spends millions on his private jet so that he can get a little bit quieter sleep. Considering his Lodge purchases, there is no doubt that he is the most arrogant and selfish Prime Minister our country has ever had. Sydney Airport",106
284,Mr LEO MCLEAY,ADJOURNMENT,"Watson) (5.33 p.m.}Tonight I rise to respond to the continuously misleading statements by the opposition concerning the east-west runway at Sydney airport. On several occasions the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) has called for the reopening of the east-west runway. Again today in the Sydney Morning Herald the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the opposition spokesman on aviation, Senator Warwick Parer, called for the runway's reopening. Members of this House and the public not living near the airport need to be told the truth. The east-west runway at Sydney airport has never been closed. The supposed closure of the east-west runway has become another great urban myth, ranking very closely with the one about giant crocodiles living in the sewers. Today, the Leader of the Opposition called for a 'sharing of the pain'. Well, let me tell Mr HOWARD - as the residents of south-west Sydney will tell him-we have been sharing the pain for far too long already. The east-west runway at Sydney airport is and always has been operated when there were adverse weather conditions-which includes such things as cross-winds or traffic congestion restricting use of the north-south runways. The preferred runway has always been-for noise abatement reasons-the north-south runway, runway number 16, which was the old runway. This is still the case. The east-west runway has been used whenever there is a cross-wind exceeding 25 knots. In recent years this has meant that between 30 and 40 per cent of air traffic has taken off using the east-west runway. We were told by the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation that this would be reduced to 1.2 per cent of traffic when the third runway was opened. That was part of the EIS and part of the agreement for the opening of that runway. But residents living near the airport, and members of parliament, have learnt the hard way not to place too much trust in CAA and FAC statements or predictions. These authorities, like the opposition, are not above misleading this parliament and the public. While take-offs using the east-west runway have been reduced significantly since the opening of the third runway-the people living in the south-west are very thankful for this-residents know that weather conditions in recent weeks have been relatively good and that, as a result, aircraft have used optimum noise abatement procedures. I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Parer and the member for Cook go away and do their homework, take a look at the CAA radar tracking maps and see what happened when westerly winds prevailed in the week immediately following the opening of the third runway. The location of Sydney airport on Botany Bay means, as residents to the south-west of the airport know too well, that air traffic is completely at the mercy of the weather conditions. A tail wind of just five knots means aircraft must take off to the north instead of over the bay. A cross-wind of 25 knots means the preferred take-off runway is the east-west runway. As I said, this runway is anything but closed, and it is hard to comprehend from the repetitive gibberish that the opposition spouts precisely what it means. Surely it does not mean that it wants the reintroduction of the SIMOPS, the simultaneous operation of north and south runways. If that is the case, it is calling for the closure of the third runway, which for years they said Sydney had to have. It would be calling for a reduction in capacity and the spreading of noise to another 50,000 residents. If members need to refresh their memories on the former traffic operations at Sydney airport-the procedures that the member for Cook in this House has called for a return to-they should look no further than the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald of 8 November last year where a photo story appeared, headed 'Too Close for Comfort'. It pictured an incoming aircraft having to pull up because another aircraft using the east-west intersection was still on the runway. Safety concerns aside, it would be impossible to justify returning to the old system when that would mean closure of the third runway, a reduction in capacity, and noise pollution seriously affecting an additional 50,000 residents. Residents must seriously wonder just how concerned the opposition is about protecting the interests of the communi- country. ty when what it is calling for would mean that another 50,000 people would be seJ1iously affected by noise-not to mention travellers and possibly the lives of residents being put at serious risk. But perhaps this is not what they intend. Perhaps they are again touting for the small aircraft operators who are worried that when capacity reaches its limit in a few months they will be forced out of Sydney airport. If that is the case, what they are proposing is not an improvement to the noise problem but an increase in noise for residents living north of the airport. Any dummy-with the possible exception of the Mayor of Marrickville and the Leader of the Opposition--could see that shifting light aircraft off the main runways will simply allow extra capacity on the north-south runways and, therefore, more aircraft and noise over residents north and south of the airport. I think the Leader of the Opposition should come clean with his constituents and other residents around the airport and state precisely what he is proposing or is this like the rest of the Liberal policy platform-glib one-liners? Historically, the Leader of the Opposition has always 'been a mouthpiece for the airline industry' and there is no reason to think otherwise this time. He is on record as pushing the third runway cart from day one, and he has called for the cutting of the curfew. So to have the gall to say now that he is concerned about his constituents is absolutely ridiculous. (Time expired) Primary Producers",107
285,Mr FORREST,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to take this opportunity this week in the parliament to draw to the' attention of the House the desperate plight of primary producers in my electorate. My electorate is in the north-west of Victoria and takes in the famous regions of the Mallee and the Northern Wimmera. I have to say that these would have to be the most economically depressed rural regions in that state. Were it not for the terrible circumstances in Queensland and New South Wales as a result of drought, I would say they were the most depressed in the These areas heavily rely on the profitability of the grain industry. But the last few years, with varying degrees of natural disasters on top of a decade of high interest rates instigated by the current government, have crippled many farming families. The Victorians in this particular area were bitterly disappointed at the close of last year to find that Victoria not included in the special circumstances provisions of the drought relief. They feel particularly left out when they see so many Australians in need being provided for while their needs are being overlooked. In 1992-93 there was an extreme wet weather period during what was to be, a not bonanza harvest for the grain industry-14 million tonnes of grain grown right across Australia in record reduced areas, demonstratportant. ing the efficiency of grain growers in growing a record crop from' minimal areas. The fact is that 54 per cent of this crop was downgraded as a result of heavy ting' in losses of $17 million to the grain growers in my area. In 1993, prior to the harvest, during vital growing period there was an unpreceVictoria""s dented mouse plague. For those members have never seen a mouse plague, it is a terrifying experience to have mice not only eating your crop but overrunning your house and eating electrical wiring. It is not a kind experience to be part of. In the 1994-95 season we had a drought with the worse and lowest rainfall on record in Victoria. One the townships in the middle of the Mallee, Sea Lake, recorded only 160 millimetres of rainfall during the year. It is very difficult for me to convey to the parliament the extent of the hardship, pain and economic devastation which has resulted. I normally like to speak in a positive way the resilience and the determination of people of my electorate. They are desperate. I call upon the government and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) in the other house to reconsider the declaration that Victoria not be given special circumstances assistance. These people are discretion faced with crippling debt and ongoing inemployer. creased costs, and their mood is one of despair and disillusionment. The dilemma they are now confronted with is how to service their current debt and how to access the capital necessary to plant their next crop. I want to speak on this matter because there is a perception that, because it has rained in Victoria, the problems are over. They are not. Despite strong representation from a range of was interest groups last year, the federal government has chosen not to approve giving Victoria special circumstances assistance. This is despite Victoria clearly qualifying for five out of six of the criteria agreed between the joint governments across Australia. One criterion, that of meteorological circumstance, saw it qualifying for assistance. It is not so much the absence of rain, but the absence of rain during a critical growing season that is imThe declaration that over a 36-month period we have to have a one in 20-year sad circumstance has put Victorian primary producers, particularly grain growers, at a rain, resulsubstantial disadvantage. I have noted the willingness of the government to reconsider the sixth criterion, but I the am alarmed that the reconsideration of 'circumstances will not be conwho sidered until autumn. By then many of my grain growers will have gone to the wall as they face the dilemma of where to source the finance and income to plant next year's crop. very I have many primary producers and families whose children do not qualify for Austudy assistance, so they face the very real and of traumatic circumstance of choosing which one of their several children will not go on to tertiary education or even senior secondary education. These are dire circumstances. (Time expired) eRA: Industrial Relations",108
286,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"The of industrial relations policy of CRA has been the raised in this House on a number of occasions. There is no denying that CRA is among the leaders in the push for Australia to smash the trade union movement and to return industrial relations back over 100 years. CRA is determined that the absolute power and in industrial relations will go to the The seventh most profitable company in the nation is attempting to take all rights from the employees and is intent in bringing in work contracts, the aims of which are to push the award safety net to the limitcontracts that will mean in the end that there will be no minimum standards for workers, no minimum standards of health and safety, and no minimum wages. CRA has an Australia-wide program which hides its policy behind a screen of secret words like' change process', 'reform', 'differmeasure. entialrewards', 'conversion' and 'behavioural change'. As members would be aware, behind this jargon is the reality for CRA that Big Brother knows best. It wants a world all employees have to take what the boss wants to give them-a take it or leave attitude. Late last year it was announced that the Southern Copper smelter at Port Kembla my electorate would close. At the moment there is a hearing before the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission in Wollongong, where CRA is blaming the very Illawarra trade unions for the closure of the Southern Copper smelter plant. absolute nonsense. The closure of the Southern Copper smelter plant is in many respects a tragedy for the Illawarra, which can ill afford to lose in excess of 400 jobs. These claims now being made by CRA are in stark contrast to public statements made by Southnate ern Copper in the latter half of last year which it announced a new era in industrial relations at Port Kembla and the potential for international competitiveness at the Port Kembla smelter following the signing of an innovative enterprise agreement. I am convinced that the closure of the smelter at Port Kembla is part of an overall strategy by CRA to bring the trade union movement to heel. Its record throughout Australia is one of continual attacks on the trade union movement. What has happened at Port Kembla is only part of a wider scheme. Indeed, to reinforce this, late last year convened a meeting of Labor members with CRA works in their electorates. The story from each of them was the same. The indusSouth trial relations strategy of this crowd is appalpeople ling. As far as CRA is concerned, there be no negotiation or bargaining in the circumseasonal stances that CRA is seeking to impose upon its work force Australia-wide. CRA should be truthful to the work force at Port Kembla and to the people of the Illawarra and stop putting the blame onto the trade union movement. There are many reasons why the smelter at Port Kembla has closed. It is a matter of debate and negotiation at the moment whether this closure is a temporary or a permanent We all hope, and we are all working to ensure, that it is only a temporary measure. Not least of the reasons for the smelter being closed was the considerable amount of monwhere ey-in excess of $100 million-that the company had to spend to bring the smelter to it acceptable environmental standards. This Saturday, I will be attending the pollution meeting held in Port Kembla on the first Saturday of each month. Month after month, in people have come along to the meetings and demonstrated what has been happening with regard to the stuff that has been spewing out of the smelter stack at Port Kembla. It is a debatable point. The company will have to invest a lot of money there. It must look at That is an the matter seriously. That is one of the reasons but there are many other reasons-not least the price of copper. It is absolute nonsense, but typical of CRA, that the whole blame for the unfortuclosure of that smelter at Port Kembla in has been put on the trade union movement-a claim which I totally reject. Forestry Industry",109
287,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,"I draw the House's attention to the arguments that are taking place in the confines of Parliament House in relation to logging. I wish to bring a personal perspective to this terrible government decision to close down sections of the forestry industry. With all the arguments between Senator Faulkner, the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) and members of this House, we have overlooked I the human factor and the fact that a positive government decision will close down sections of the forestry industry in southern New Wales and Victoria. Quite clearly, these will lose their jobs next week or next can month, because the logging industry is a industry; they have to complete their job in the summer period. With the minister's decision and the procrastination that has taken place, these people will not have a job and will not be able to complete their contracts. What struck me was the genuineness of theseÂ· people who have been in and around Parliament House over the last four or five days. I have spoken to groups of them; I have invited two groups into my office. They could not beÂ· more genuine in their approach to the job in hand. They have made investments of up to $1 Y2 million, based on the fact that the Victorian government had given them security over a particular forest area and had said, 'Look, we agree that these areas are okay; they meet all the environmental standards and you should proceed to make the investments.' They have made. investments in sawmills. They have improved their technology and their value adding capacity. They have improved their trucks in order to extract the timber from the forest areas. In fact, one group told me this morning that it had doubled its capacity, that it had become more efficient and that it had made those investments. It now tells me that, if this decision is not reversed, next week that investment will be in jeopardy and those jobs will be gone. I think the House should be aware of that. The hyperbole of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) here today that the government will come up with the right decision and will find a compromise gets away from the truth. It gets away from the clear understanding of the state governments in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales, which had issued guidelines under the national forest policy statement as to where logging which would flow on to the obvious woodchippingÂ· of by-products could take place. The green movement and the environmentalists have used the export powers of the federal government to interfere with these state arrangements. These very genuine people whom I have talked toÂ· indicated that the Victorian government, under both shades of political opinionPremier Kirner and Premier Kennett-had adopted world best practice in environmental standards in arranging the way forests should be logged, and in ensuring SO-year rotations and sustainable forestry. Clear-felling arrangements are appropriate in certain areas but other felling arrangements are more appropriate in other areas. These arrangements had all been agreed to by the loggers, the governments and the department of conservation and lands. Now we have a minister of the federal government-which, of course, always knows better-being advised by greenie groups and saying, 'Look, we'll have a look at the 1,300 coupes. We'll have another look at them.' That was the first arrangement. According to greenie evaluations, their heritage value, et cetera, had already been evaluated almost year by year. Of those 1,300 coupes, the government compromised and came down to 511. Surprise, surprise - as members of this House are aware, some of these 511 coupes consisted of airstrips, quarries, pine plantations and some regrowth areas of less than 20 years, and some of these coupes did not even exist. What a remarkable situation we have. At a time when we need export dollars, we have a government that can make a decision about forest matters of which it has no real knowledge. The department of the environment has no real knowledge of the real issues in the forest, such as the by-products of woodchips, yet we have Minister Faulkner continuing to procrastinate when Minister Beddall has been struggling with this issue from within the government policy. Woodchips are an exportable commodity. They provide the viable industry of sawlogs within the Victorian timber industry and Tasmania. This one decision of Senator FaulknerÂ· and the Prime Minister will put at risk the $60 million worth of equipment owned by people who have come to Parliament House to put forward their case. It will put these people out of work and put millions of dollars worth of investment at risk, and these people will get no return on their investment. (Time expired) Brothels",110
288,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to talk about brothels. Brothels have been an institution in KalgoorlieÂ·virtually since its establishment, and they have served a very good and useful public service. They have been highly accepted by the community. They have operated under a policy of containment, which was policedvery effectively, I think-by the police force, and it has worked for many years. It worked to the benefit of the girls working in the industry, as it gave them security and protection, and it worked to the benefit of the community because it made health checks and control of drugs much easier. The police force has now moved to abandon this policy and allow what is virtually an open slather arrangement, where prostitution will not be confined to Hay Street but will be allowed in other areas, and escort services will be provided. I think that this is a very retrograde step, and we need to ask why this has happened. The truth of the matter is this: the proprietor of a brothel at 181 Hay Street is Maryanne Kenworthy. She has extensive business interests of the same sort in Perth. Virtually since the day she purchased this property, she has flouted the containment policy that existed in Kalgoorlie, and the police force has been either unable or unwilling to enforce it. There is no doubt that had girls living outside the street, which was in contravention of the policy, and that the girls had been attending hotels and nightclubs, which was also in contravention of Ms Kenworthy has also had many more than one girl in each room, which contravenes yet another requirement of the policy. The failure of police to enforce this situation has resulted in their moving to legitimise what they say they cannot control. One must ask the police why suddenly, after all these years, they cannot control it. Was there a lack of will in Kalgoorlie? Were they frightened of the operation at 181 Hay Street? Or were they directed from Perth? I do not believe there has ever been any corruption-certainly not of any significant nature-in this industry in Kalgoorlie. But there is a possibility that there was corruption in Perth and that the orders were fed down through the police force. Of course, there is room for some change in circumstances. I think it is a policy that must be reversed. I have no problem with the girls drinking in hotels or going to shows, provided they do not solicit. I think that would be an acceptable amendment. However, I think we have to look very carefully at this situation because at the moment the girls are at risk. Girls as young as 18 are now allowed to operate in the escort business or in brothels. If we allow people to be flown in for events in Kalgoorlie, the police will have no control. The present system gives the community some protection because it is easier to maintain health standards and is much easier to control drugs. I believe the council is right in its opposition. I urge the council to reinforce its zoning laws to make it very difficult, or impossible, for anyone to operate a brothel outside of a designated area. The council should leave it to the state minister to override that if he dares. I call on the police force to do what it has done very successfully in the past and police the containment policy that has been so successful. It is very easy these days to give into what seems to be an insurmountable problem. The establishment at 181 Hay Street has she thrown into confusion a very orderly and effective system that existed in Kalgoorlie. I believe that particular institution needs very close supervision and a very close study by the policy. the relevant authorities. Question resolved in the affirmative.

By not involved in the furious negotiations between government increased the excise on those consists of a range of hydrocarbons of varying to crude oil heated to remove the more volatile oil can be used as a substitute for fuel oil, it are now the same.

For the coastal shipping industry, the particularly severe impact, adding almost $10 whole, or an average cost of $290,000 per vessel in that industry, which saw crew levels reduced delivered savings of an average of $217,000 hopelessly negated by the fuel excise increases.

As a result, the excise on way of explanation-for the benefit of anybody the shipping and mining industries after the products in the August 1993 budget---crude oil molecular weight, so 'topped' crude oil refers or lighter hydrocarbons.

This contrasts dramatically with investments 10.3 per cent in 1981 to $13,916 million or 38.7 The same can be said for the United States, But the question in South-East Asia was that through for the year June 1991 to June 1992 only one year and, as such, it is not a huge been corrected.

(2) Are NETTFORCE approvals subject to the final approval of State training authorities. (3) What progress has been made in establishing agreements with each State on the relationship between NETTFORCE and State training authorities. (4) With which States have agreements been established. (5) How will the cost of establishing the wage system be shared between the Commonwealth and the States. (6) Have all States agreed to the cost-sharing arrangements. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) NETTFORCE can provide ""interim"" approval of training packages under the National Training Wage Award. Clause 7 of the AwardDefinitions-states that a traineeship means a system of training which has been approved by the relevant State or Territory Training Authority, or which has been approved on an interim basis by the National Employment and Training Taskforce (NETTFORCE), until final approval is granted by the relevant State or Territory Training Authority. (2) NETTFORCE ""interim"" approval of training packages is subject to the final accreditation by State and Territory Training Authorities. (3) NETTFORCE has approached all State!ferritory Training Authorities requesting them to enter into agreements to define the roles and responsibilities of each organisation and to develop a constructive working relationship. The negotiations go to such matters as the streamlined administration of training, including client responsiveness performance standards. (4) NETTFORCE is negotiating with all States and Territories. Agreements have now been signed with Queensland and New South Wales and are finalised and ready for signature with Victoria, NA Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. Discussions are continuing with South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. (5) Entry level training under the National Training Wage Award (NTWA) will continue under the existing cost-sharing parameters between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories. The Commonwealth is providing funding through ANTA for off-the-job training costs for trainees (following agreement by the ANTA Ministerial Council in 1993). The White Paper announced targets for additional trainees and provided additional funding to meet halfthe costs of off-the-job training associated with these trainees. The growth funding the Commonwealth is providing to ANTA can also be used. On-the-job training is to be funded by individual training employers, as is presently the case. (6) Discussions are also proceeding between my Department and individual State and Territory Training Authorities about agreement for processing and monitoring Training Wage agreements. Agreements have been signed with Queensland and finalised with New South Wales. The remainder are due to be completed over the next few weeks subject to receipt of proposals. Australian Electoral Commission: Household Numbering (Question No. 1734) Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 15 November 1994: Is the Australian Electoral Commission initiating a household numbering system for all federal electoral divisions; if so, when will households in the division of Wannon which are not assigned a household number be converted to the system.",146
313,Mr WALKER,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Electoral Commission is not initiating a Rural Property Numbering system. However, for some years it has been supporting the concept of numbering rural properties based on their distance from a fixed point (usually the start of the road). Rural property numbering gives advantages to property owners through better provision of emergency and other services and for deliveries and personal visits. The AEC is interested because better numbering has the capacity to significantly increase the accuracy of the electoral roll. Although there are electoral benefits, property numbering is properly the responsibility of local governments which control funding and timetables. However, I note that in New South Wales it is currently being sponsored by DEET as a job creation project. ' The Australian Electoral Commission's past support has taken several forms: preparation of an instruction manual for those local government areas that want to do the work themselves; seminars, instructional sessions and some preliminary field work training for those who are carrying out the task; sample numbering to show local government authorities how the concept works and to build Electoral Commission expertise. Some sample numbering has taken place on the Princes Highway and on the CobdenIPort Campbell Road in the Division of Wannon; Department of Finance Australian National Audit Office Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd, Com Super (2) Records are maintained in accordance with the Audit Act and Finance Directions.
