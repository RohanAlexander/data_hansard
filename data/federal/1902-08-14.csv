6,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"Certain works, were authorized to be constructed out of revenue; but the authorization ceased on 30th J une last, and the inoney will have to be re-voted this year. With regard to ordinary loon works, I.am simply paying out of the Treasurer's advance for those which ore absolutely necessary until the House has an opportunity of deciding whether it will authorize the: floating: of a loan. It will not be in a position to decide until I make a financial..statement, and show how the works which we propose to build out of loan account will affect the revenue of the various States. I have not yet received the estimates: from all the States, but I hope in the early part' of September to be able to make a financial statement, and the House can then deal with the question of constructing new works-out of - loan account orrevenue--whicheve r course the state of the finances may then appear to render expedient.",14
7,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Is it a fact' that the Estimates will not be ready till the. third week in September as stated in .the press yesterday t Sir GEORGE TURNER.^-I do notthink it will be so late as the third week in Sep-' tember. I hope they will be ready early in the - month. I hod. hoped to deliver the Budget speech in the middle of this month. So far as the Treasury Estimates are conto- cerned, I am now prepared to deliver the Budget speech, but there is some difficulty in getting the estimates of expenditure from the various States, and after their receipt from the departments I ""have to take a hand in them, and that takes a little time.

16,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as 1. Trumpeter John Anderson died at sea on 9th June last, on board the transport Custodian en route to South Africa, the medical certificate showing cause of death as fish-poisoning. No inwas held, the medical officer's certificate of cause of death being deemed sufficient. 2. There is no record as to death of any member of Fifth or Sixth Queensland Contin.

VENDING OF STAMPS.  presenting the Postmaster-General, upon notice.1. Whether it regulation has been made restricting the commission payable by the department to licensed sellers of stamps to £78 a year, or 5s. per day ? 2. Whether this means that if a licensed seller of stamps buys stamps on any one day which will entitle him to a higher commission than 5s., his commission will be reduced to 5s., though he or she may have purchased no stamps on the preceding day ? 3. If this interpretation is correct, what are the reasons for this regulation ?",15
17,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:J. It has been approved to make a regulation restricting the payment of commission on the sale of postage stamps ns indicated. 2. It means that a licensed vendor of postage stamps will not be allowed commission exceeding 5s. per day throughout the year, and arrangeinents will be made to adjust the stipulated amount of commission monthly. 3. The reasons for the regulation are to confine the vending of stamps under licence to the legitimate requirements of the public, and to prevent a division of the commission with large purchasers w o r t h ) of stamps, who, it is considered, should purchase directly from the Post-officeCLEARANCE OF SPIRITS.",16
18,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"the Minister f o Trade and Customs, upon notice Whether the following statement, appearing in the Aye of Tuesday last, is correct, viz. :- "" A law exists-and a very excellent one, too-that no spirits, either manufactured in Victoria or imported from abroad, may go into consumption until they have been six months at least in bond. But the wording is such that spirits distilled in the other States of the Commonwealth cannot be excluded under existing regulations, and and do come in here bran-new, to the detriment of the public health, and in unjust competition with other spirits which have to bear the expense and loss of six months' storing before they can be marketed""-and , if so, what steps he f proposes taking, in the interest of the public health and of fair play, to apply in the other States similar regulations to those now applied in Victoria ? 42 x",16
19,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows : The department is advised that the Victorian legislative prohibition of the issue of permits for the clearance of spirits from distilleries before the spirits are six months old is superseded by the Federal Distillation Aot, and consequently Victorian distillers are now being allowed to clear as in other States where no such prohibition exists. The matter will be further considered in connection with the intended amending Distillation Bill. CUSTOMS TARIFFBILL . Consideration of committee's report on the requests made by the Senate. M o t i o n (by Mr KINGSTON ) proposed - That the following report be adopted, and the Bill be returned to the Senate accordingly :1. The committee haa agreed that the date of any of these amendments shall be the date of its being made in the Bill by the House of Representatives. 2. The committee has agreed that the amendments requested by the Senate be made in regard to-Request s Nos. 3, 9 (as to part), 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 47, 48, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57 (as to part), 65, 68, 69, 70, 71 (as to part), 73, 76, 77, 78, 87, 89 (as to part), 91, 93. 3.

20,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"We n t - I am sure we are all . glad, at any rate so far as this side of the House is concerned, that at last we have reached the end of our labours. We are sorry that more liberal concessions were n ot made, so r that we m i g h t have reasonably hoped that when the Bill left this Chamber we had reached absolute finality.",16
21,Mr WATSON,Unknown,We hope so now.,16
22,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"Sanguine as I am in my' disposition, I am a f r a i d that it is too much to hope. It is now a question between the Government can and their followers and the Senate. O u r work is done. We can only look on and wait. No matter w h at view may be held on this side or on that side, I hope that the in a l result will be satisfactory to us as a Parliament, even if it is not satisfactory to to distillers the country as a whole. Question resolved in the affirmative. - POST ANDTELEGRA PH RATES SECOND READING. . Sir PHILIP FYSH (Tasmama) - I move That the Bill be now read a second time. Honourable members will recollect that on a former occasion they assisted me to pass through the House a Bill relating to the administration of the Post and Telegraph department, and the construction and maintenance of telegraphic and telephonic lines. One of the clauses of that Bill provided for the making of regulations by the Governor General in Council, and the Postmaster: General proposed under it to frame a regulation in relation to postal and telegraph rates. The House deemed it desirable, however, that those rates should be embodied in a Bill, with the result that we ;have before us the measure of which I am now moving the second reading. I regret 'that there has been apparently so much delay in introducing it . That delay has not been due to any fault on the part of the Government. The - absolute settlement of certain points of administration relating specially to the carriage of newspapers in New South Wales, and to the cable rates to be charged between the mainland and 'Tasmania has only just taken place. Although the Government were prepared to proceed with this Bill at an earlier date, those two points necessitated delay. Irrespective, of their existence, however, the House, since - re-assembling on the 22nd ult., has been fully engaged upon the Tariff. At hist we have before us the Bill which I had hoped to introduce very much earlier, but which for the reasons I have stated could not have been brought forward before. I regret further that it has been to some extent delayed because it has kept in existence an incongruity in regard to certain rates, which it is advisable should be removed. We have still in force in the various States differing rates for the carriage of newspapers, under which advantages have possibly been reaped by one class of newspaper proprietors over another. It would have been far better in the interests of the Commonwealth, as a whole, had we been able earlier in our Eederation to bring these varying rates into line. Honourable members will recollect that three out of the six States have been carrying newspapers through the post free of charge, and thab they are still doing so, while in the remaining three States BILL. a charge is and has been made. That state of things must continue until we have passed this Bill, and therefore I venture to disagree with some of the observations which were made on a former occasion by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, who expressed the hope that this measure would be delayed for some considerable time. I hope we shall find that there are several reasons why no further delay should take place. The Bill itself contains only eight clauses, and with the exception of clause 8, which provides for a new regulation, they are comparatively unimportant. The power to make regulations under the Post and Telegraph Act does not enable the Governor General in Council to make any arrangements for the limitations and the rates to be prescribed with respect to town and suburban telegrams or letters. It is proposed, therefore, in clause 8, that the Governor General in Council shall have power by regulation to prescribe the limits within which the rates for town and suburban telegrams and letters shall have effect, and for prescribing charges for the porterage of telegrams. Special necessity for such a regulation arises from the fact that we have not a uniform regulation in existence in the various States. While, for example, we have in five States a suburban or a town rate of 6d. for certain telegraphic messages, and a State rate up to Is., we have in Victoria a uniform rate of 9d.,- whether in relation tocity, suburban, or State messages. Therefore it becomes necessary to make special regulations prescribing the limits within which there shall be varying rates for letters and telegrams. There is a provision in clause 5 in regard to - which only a word or two is necessary. It relates to the rates for telegrams and postal matter which have not been exempted by some Act, and it reads as follows:' Telegrams, letters, and postal articles transmitted or posted on behalf of the King, the Commonwealth Government, or any State Government shall, unless exempted by some Act, be subject to the postal and telegraphic rates for the time being in force Sir JOH N QUICK - Does the clause refer to a federal Ac t ?",16
23,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"Yes . I am reminded by the Attorney-General that under section 38 of the Acts Interpretation Act, an Ac t passed by the Commonwealth may be referred to by the word "" Act "" alone. ""VVe know, therefore, that the provision applies only to that which the Federal Legislature does.",17
24,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,When it is applied to a State by a federal Act.,18
25,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"Yes . Themost important features of. this Bill are to be found in the schedules, and I have no doubt that when we reach them we shall come to the more controversial matter. Dealing with the first schedule which relates to newspapers, I am instructed that the present revenue from postage on newspapers in the three States, which do not carry them free of charge, amounts to about £25,000 per annum. There are three States-Tasmania , Western Australia, and New South Waleswhich carry all newspapers through the post free of charge. The new rates provided for in the 1st schedule will enable the Postmaster-General to increase his revenue from this source by about- £40,000, bringing up his total revenue from newspaper postage to nearly £70,000. I am only giving these figures approximately. Whether the Postmaster-General puts down his total, anticipated increase at £42,000 or £45,000, it is a matter of speculation, and for my purpose I shall allude to the anticipated increase as being about £40,000. That sum is divided in various ways. Fbr example, I find that Queensland, instead of gaining additional revenue on the postage of newspapers, will lose some £2,800 under this arrangement, whilst all the other States, except Victoria, will gain very considerably. I am happy here to notice that Tasmania^-whic h for the purpose of enlightening the public mind and conveying literature into our country homes, so it has been . said, has been carrying newspapers free to the detriment of the service-wil l now be recouped to the extent of about £10,000. New South Wales will also gain under this schedule to the very large amount of about £27,000.",18
26,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,What will iSouth Australia gain 1,18
27,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,It is estimated that she - will gain only a trifle-abou t £200. Victoria will stand practically in the same position as she was before.,18
28,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHAKN,Unknown,What will be Queensland's position ?,18
29,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"Sh e will lose about £2,800. This legislation will liberalize postal regulations with respect to the carriage of newspapers in the three States which have hitherto been imposing a charge upon them. The loss occasioned by liberalizing the rates in those three States will be more than made good by the additional revenue collected in the States which have heretofore carried newspapers free.",18
30,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,Unknown,How will the schedule affect Western Australia ?,18
31,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"Wester n Australia will come out about £6,700 to the good. I shall have to return presently to the question of newspaper carriage. I see that the honourable member for Macquarie is following me closely, and I shall take care to give him, and those who think or do not think with him, all the information they desire, remembering that on a previous occasion questions were asked which I was unable to answer so satisfactorily as I hope to be in a position now to do. If I forget to return to this subject, no doubt the honourable member for Macquarie will refresh my memory. I desire to pass on to the 2nd schedule which deals with ordinary telegrams, and introduces a new system and a new tariff with respect to telegrams of a private or business nature and press messages. Under the 2nd schedule the Government desire to give an enormous benefit to the people of the Federation as a whole. I think I may allude to it as a considerable, if not an enormous, benefit, for whereas there has been a charge of 3s. or 4s. each for messages between Western Australia and Queensland-the western and the north-eastern boundaries of Australia-whic h have to be transmitted through five States, this Bill provides for a Commonwealth rate of Is. for all messages consisting of a certain number of words that are sent to any part of the Commonwealth. This, I hope, will be regarded as a great boon. It will, however, lead to a loss in the telegraphic revenue equivalent to that which the Postmaster-General hopes to gain in his postal revenue. I desire honourable members when dealing with these rates, to remember that the Commonwealth is not is a position to give up £40,000 worth of revenue now collected upon telegrams unless it can in some way be recouped for that loss of revenue. We therefore propose to set against this reduced revenue from the Telegraphic department the profit we hope to realise upon. the carriage of newspapers. W it h respect to these two points, I should like, first of all in connection with the charge for the carriage of newspapers, to refer to a question asked a few evenings ago by the honourable member for Macquarie. That question - had special relation to the position of newspaper proprietors in New South Wales. They have had an advantage over the proprietors of newspapers in some of the other States in that they have been able to send their papers by morning trains at the cost of the Government.",18
32,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Of the Post-office.,19
33,Sir PHILIPEYSH,Unknown,"At the cost of the Government while they were States, but at the cost of the Post-office now. Their newspapers have been carried by early trains for which the Post-office has paid.",19
34,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,Did the gentleman say at the cost of the Post-office now t,19
35,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"Yes , because it must-be remembered that the Postal department has been taken over by the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth has to pay this sum of .£2,500. - Mr SYDNEY SMITH - Are .they paying it?",19
36,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,No : - Mr SYDNEY SMITH - Then it cannot be said to be a charge upon the Postal department.,19
37,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"No ; but if the system had been continued, it would have been a special loss. The Government, however, have deemed it desirable to put a stop to that arrangement for the present, and until Parliament has had an opportunity to deal with the matter. As a result of the action taken, I presume that the newspaper proprietors concerned, or some of them, are up in arms. Because their gains have been to some extent arrested, they feel themselves aggrieved, forgetting that they have had an advantage which the vendors of newspapers in other States have not had. I say advisedly that they have had an advantage which the vendors of newspapers in - other States have not had, because although I gave certain information to my honourable friend the honourable member for Macquarie on a previous day, with respect to what I believed had been taking place in Tasmania, I was compelled to give him an answer to the question he put recently upon the motion for the adjournment of the House, which was not as complete as ' I should have liked to make it, nor was it as full 'as the honourable member and'the House' were entitled to receive it . But there were extant at that particular time messages from two States, at any rate, and from each of two departments in those States, which, if they were not absolutely conflicting replies, were yet replies which needed further explanation. In the meantime, I have armed myself with further information, so far, at - all events, as Tasmania is concerned. While, on the one hand, I have to reply that in Tasmania newspapers had been carried free by the Postal department for a great number of years, and that the Railway department, which was also a Government department, had been carrying free parcels of newspapers sent by the publisher to. the honourable railway office, and delivered by the railway authorities to the publisher's agent elsewhere, I now find that although the circumstances warranted that reply- a reply which reached me from the Treasurer of Tasmania - ther e were other circumstances which, perhaps, he had overlooked. Though I had myself been a party to the arrangement made, I had not refreshed my memory with respect to it, and I also had forgotten it for the moment. While our newspapers in Tasmania were being carried free, if delivered at the post-office addressed by the vendor to private individuals, parcels of newspapers sent by publishers to the railway stations were also being carried free, as a matter of compliment, by the railway authorities.",19
38,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"Were they carried ' free ? We do not require to know anything about the compliment; the question is, what was the practice observed ?",19
39,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,It was a very substantia] compliment.,19
40,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"They were carried free. I do not know that I should speak of it as extraordinary as far as Tasmania is concerned, that the General Manager of the Railways, knowing that there was free postage of newspapers, accorded to the proprietors of newspapers the privilege of sending their papers in bulk to the railway station, without having previously passed them through the post-office. This has been the condition of things in Tasmania.",19
41,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,Are newspapers not being carried free on the railways in Tasmania ?,19
42,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,Unde r the same - circumstances. °,19
43,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,Hav e not vernment withdrawn the concession in New South Wales?,20
44,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,We have only just had our attention called to the concession given in Tasmania.,20
45,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,Then the honourable gentleman must know very little about the department.,20
46,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The Postmaster-General does not pay for it .,20
47,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,I understood that the Post-office is paying a lump sum.,20
48,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"The honourable member for Macquarie is right and wrongright in his statement, and wrong in his conclusion. The Tasmanian Government controlling both the Postal and Railway departments, passed no money to the Railway department for the carriage of mail matter, but they did make a cross entry so as to give the Railway department credit for what it claimed to earn, and charged the Postal department with the cost of certain deliveries. The arrangement was that the postal matter should be carried by the Postal department for the lump sum named. Let us draw a distinction, if there be a distinction, and I do not desire to make it too arbitrary : The Government assented to the two departments making .in arrangement under which, by a cross entry, the Railway department debits the Postal department, and the Postal department credits the Railway department for certain services rendered. The Railway General Manager, knowing that newspapers were carried free throughout Tasmania under the Postal regulations, drew no distinction between newspapers addressed by the proprietors to individuals, and the bulk parcels of newspapers which were sent to the railway stations.",20
49,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,Therefor e my contelegram tention that they were carried free railways of Tasmania was absolutely correct.,20
50,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"My telegram "" thought ""1 tells me that there is no record in the department of any such arrangement. This is the statement madeThe Railway department states that, as newspapers were earried free to country districts, undertook to clo the same on their lines. office was never referred to in the matter. The office referred to is the Postal department. ment, and that bears out my statement that the General Manager of the Railways took nothing of it . the Go- it upon himself to do this without any reference to the Postal department.",20
51,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,How long has this been done? Since the Postal Act came into operation in 1881 ?,20
52,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"No, because it was only within the past few years that Mr Back, the General Manager of Railways in Tasmania, on finding that the revenue of his department was not sufficient to meet the interest charge of 3 or 4 per cent., made the claim that the department should be credited with the cost of all services rendered. This is on the principle upon which we are now acting, that every department should get credit for the services which it renders. Speaking from memory, and I think my recollection is accurate upon the point, that has been the practice within the last ten years.",20
53,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,He made a claim for it ?,20
54,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,He made a claim for credit for services rendered to the Postal department.,20
55,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,Includin g the conveyance of newspapers on the railways ?,20
56,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"My information is thatThere is no agreement, dii-ect or'indirect, or any correspondence upon this matter between this office and the railway.",20
57,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"That is a very strange thing, when the arrangement has been in force for the last ten years.",20
58,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,And so the Tasmanian Treasurer stated in his reply that he understood it was included in the lump sum. I can assure the honourable member for Macquarie that there is no reticence on our part. I am giving the fullest information I can give. I have tried to look to the end of this matter. Mr Bird did say in his that he thought the total amount on the paid by one department to the other,20
59,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,Did he say he,20
60,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"Well , he said it did embrace the work which the Railway department did for the Postal department, and the carriage of the bulk newspapers from the they vendor or publisher to various parts. This Mr SYDNEY SMITH - That shows that the Government understood the arrange",20
61,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No , the Post-office knew",20
62,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,I do not desire to make too much or too little of. this matter.,21
63,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,I only desire that there should be fair treatment all round. It is strange that the concession should be withdrawn in one State and not in another.,21
64,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"Thefactsar e before honourable members, and they can judge for themselves. Notwithstanding interruptions I have tried to let honourable members see exactly how the matter stands. When the honourable member talks of dealing with one as we deal with another, he must bear in mind that in several of the States a charge has been made for the carriage of newspapers for years past, and we are only now bringing the equity of the matter into force.",21
65,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"TJnde r the law the previously existing arrangement should have remained in force until the passing of uniform legislation; but the Government have withdrawn the privilege previously existing in New South Wales, whilst it has not been withdrawn in Tasmania.",21
66,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"The moment it is brought under our observation that such a privilege is in existence there that privilege will be withdrawn. The amount now appearing in the books of the Government of Tasmania to the credit of the Railway department for these services is being paid by the Postal department, and that brings the matter within the ken of the Federal Postmaster-General. He can now deal with it as he has dealt with the system in force in New South Wales. It is within his power to do so, and I have no doubt he will see that a uniform practice will be observed.",21
67,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,Would the honourable gentleman mind reading the telegram from the Treasurer of Tasmania 1,21
68,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"I thought I had done so, but I shall read it for the honourable member. Mr Bird, the present Treasurer of Tasmania, states, in reply to a telegram sent himThe Postal department paid railway for all mails carried, including posted newspapers. Honourable members will mark pression. That is a complete sentence in reply. He goes on to say. But parcels of newspapers sent to railway from newspaper offices have hitherto been carried ., Mr SYDNEY SMITH - What further 1",21
69,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"He says further When postage is charged on newspapers, we will probably charge for carriage of newspaper parcels by railway.",21
70,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"Showin g that the privilege has not been withdrawn in Tasmania, though the Government have withdrawn it in New South Wales. It is all made up. I know all about it .",21
71,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"The honourable member ought not to speak in that way. We want to be as open as the day. The House is entitled to know everything, and I am quite sure from my knowledge of my colleagues that they want to be as glass that can be seen through, with respect to everything.",21
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,""" As through a glass darkly!""",21
73,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"No ; we do not love darkness. But the honourable member for Macquarie must not say that this privilege is being continued by the local Treasurer. The Treasurer of Tasmania is no longer - as I used to be-the Postmaster-General of that State. There is a Commonwealth Deputy Postmaster-General there, acting under the Postmaster-General in Melbourne. Therefore, the privilege to the Tasmanian newspaper proprietor no longer comes from the State; it is a continuation, Under circumstances which have only recently been brought to light, of a privilege which the proprietors of newspapers obtained from the manager of' the Tasmanian railways by reason of the fact that newspapers were being carried free through the post.",21
74,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"No special subsidy is being paid, I suppose?",21
75,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,None . Mr SYDNEY SMiTH - What aboub Western Australia ?,21
76,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"I am informed that the privilege referred to exists in Western Australia, but I have no further information on the subject.",21
77,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,The same privilege as exists in Tasmania ?,21
78,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,It appears so to me.,21
79,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"That privilege has the exnot been withdrawn, has it 1",21
80,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,I am not aware of it .,21
81,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"It seems strange free. that it should be withdrawn from New does he say South Wales,' but not from the other States.",21
82,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"When it came to the knowledge of the Government that there - was a special payment of £2,500 in New South Wales for a special train service in the morning for the benefit of the newspapers, they determined to stop it .",22
83,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Will the gentleman explain why the Government discontinued that privilege at once, instead of waiting until this Bill was passed t",22
84,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"There was no is successful, authority for us to pay £2,500 for riage of newspapers in New South Wales ; and I trust that the Commonwealth regard it as a righteous policy on the part of the Government that, as from time to time it discovers an abnormal oondition of things in any State-suc syncrasies, for instance, as the carriage of parcels in one State under special stances which do not apply in another State-it will effect a remedy at once. Government are not capable of undertaking Ministerial functions, and are not worthy of their position, if, when they discover such discrepancies and anomalies, they not do their duty in remedying them.",22
85,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,They have been long time in discovering them in some States.,22
86,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,So much the better for the honourable member's clients.,22
87,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,They discovered them very quickly in the State of New Soutli Wales.,22
88,Sir PHILIPFYS H,Unknown,"The honourable member may take credit to himself has been instrumental in bringing into line the people of two States, which together number 350,000-Tasmani a and Western Australia-and who have been enjoylic ing this particular privilege, whilst another State, containing 1,400,000 people, has enjoying the same privilege for a very long time. The matter is not a very serious one afterall. Itpracticallyresolves itself into - that the proprietors of newspapers in New South Wales have been almost alone in joying this privilege for so long a time. I come back again to the schedule of the Bill. A f t e r having pointed out what are probable profits and losses, I come to the point as to whether, in connection with teleters, grams, we should continue the system of charging for the words that are used i naming the addressee and the sender. doubt, honourable members are aware that the TJnited Kingdom, Canada, and the; United States the words relative to thei addressee and the sender are charged for. If they are not charged for in the Commonwealth, it means that the Post office sustains - a heavy loss. I am aware that an effort will be made in this Chamber to secure the continuance in Aushonorable tralia of the system of charging only for the number of words used in the body of a telegram, and not charging for the address and the name of the sender. If that effort it will mean a cost to the Comthe carmonwealth of £90,000 per annum.",22
89,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,The present system will has worked very well hitherto.,22
90,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"But why, at a cost of £90,000 a year, should the department telegraph for nothing the name and h idioaddress of the sender and receiver ?",22
91,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,Because by that means circumwe get more business.,22
92,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"No ; the Govern The ment are now going to give the public messages for 6d., 9d., and Is. per telegram.",22
93,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,The honourable gentleman assumes that there will be the same number do of words used under any circumstances.,22
94,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,You cannot very a well assume the same number of words. It is estimated that the average number of words contained in the address and the name of the sender is about seven.,22
95,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The £90,000 to which the honourable gentleman has referred assumes that the messages sent under the new system will contain the same number of words that he in the body of the telegrams.",22
96,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,Possibly .,22
97,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,That is fallacious.,22
98,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,".Suppos e the pubattempt to meet this change in the system by curtailing the number of words been contained in the name and address; we shall then find the difficulty which was discussed at a conference of the Postmastersthis General a few years since, when they arrived at the conclusion that it was exceedingly enunwise to invite the public to curtail the Now number of words used in the address, or even to ask them to codify the names and the addresses. This body of experts, whose special business it was to attend to such matgave expression to the opinion that the not practice of permitting the public to use n as many words as they thought convenient No in regard to the names and addresses on in their telegrams was so much the better for the receiver, and rendered the carrying out of the duties of the Telegraph department so much the more easy. The proposal of this Bill is to charge the rates set down in schedule 2 with respect to telegrams. It is proposed to charge £d. per word for town and suburban Here the question will arise, so far as Victoria is concerned, whether this State is to come into line with the other five States, all of whom have their town and suburban rates, or whether the other five States are to be drawn into line with the one State of Victoria. I hope that in connection with a federal proposal like this a federal purpose will be observed .throughout, and that we shall establish uniformity. If so, we shall have to establish this town and suburban rate of £d. per word. The rate for telegraph messages within State will be $d. per word; and the rate for all messages sent from one State to another-whether from New South ""Wales to Queensland, or from Queensland right through to Western Australia-will per word. Surely for so great a boon as this some of us' will be quite willing to give up some of our present privileges. It must be borne in mind that under a Eederal Bill all the States must be brought into line. The question then arises as to whether one State should give up its privileges, and join the other five, and whether by so joining the other five, the system thus inaugurated will lead to cheaper telegraphy on the whole. I have pointed out that, as a whole, the people of Australia will gain from £40,000 to £45,000 a year by this re-arrangement. When a message contains a fairly large number of words, the sender receives an immense advantage in being charged only %d. for each word for telegrams within a State, whereas at the present moment ld. per word is charged. so far as the shorter messages are concerned, the sender will be under a small disadvantage, but in regard to messages containing more than eighteen words, a great advantage lies with the sender. The Stock Exchange of Melbourne, and the Stock Exchanges of Tasmania, have made a special request with respect to charging for telegraphing names and addresses. I have had a conversation with the Postmaster-General on the subject, and have arrived at the conclusion, which I trust the House also will adopt,' that while in the smaller number of instances a few persons may be disadvantaged to the extent of a few pence per message, yet. a greater number of . Sir Philip Pysh. people throughout the Commonwealth will be immensely advantaged by the reduced rates offered by this schedule. The minimum rates are-tow n and suburban, messages. 6d. per message; messages within a State, 9d.j and Commonwealth messages-that is, telegrams from State to State, from the extreme at one end of the continent to the extreme at the other-Is . To my mind there is only one blot upon this Bill, and that is with respect to the position of Tasmania. When the Bill was sent to the Senate it contained a provision that to the charge of l d . a word there should be added the cable charges. I was very much in sympathy, as, I hope, other honourable members were, with the senators who oba jected to that provision. Any one, on first reading the Bill, must have been startled to find that, while a telegram could be sent from Cape Leuwin, by Cape Howe, to Thursday Island at a minimum charge Of Is., altliough be ld. hundreds of miles had to be traversed over wires in Western Australia and South Australia, the people of Tasmania, on sending a message 180 miles across the Straits, were left out of the Federation, and treated as a separate community. That anomaly arose from circumstances which I shall briefly relate. The Tasmanian cable is owned by the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, who contracted with the Tasmanian Government to lay the cable on receiving a subsidy of £4,200 a year, in addition , to a guaranteed revenue of £5,600 for services rendered. For many years the .messages passing between Tasmania and the mainland left a large deficiency on the guarantee of £5,600, but the development of the mines on the West Coast, in consequence of the enterprise of the Tasmanian people, and Certainly, also, of course, the enterprise of the people of the mainland, brought up the revenue, until last year it amounted to nearly £10,000. TJnder the contract the Tasmanian Government aie entitled, directly the revenue of the company exceeds £5,600, to reduce the present charge of l d . per word, and I do not know why that part of the agreement has not been carried out in the past few years, during which the telegraph company have been receiving more than they agreed to accept, and have been making a considerable profit.",22
99,Mr BROWN,Unknown,The company exists for the purpose of making a profit.,23
100,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"That may be! so; I but the present number of messages may be regarded as representing an established business, and there is little doubt that the reduction of the charge from l d . per word to i d . per word will give to the company all the revenue to which they are entitled.. When fchis Bill has passed, the Postmaster General will soon be able to complete an arrangement, already agreed on with the Government of Tasmania, for a reduction of the rate to the extent I have indicated, and will do so without, I believe, creating any important loss. If , however, there should be any immediate loss, it will very soon be compensated for, owing to the supply at the lower rate creating a larger demand. I am very sorry that Tasmania should again find herself handicapped with this responsibility. Many years ago an arrangement was made by the various State Governments to pool the subsidies to the various cables. That, - however, was only for a period which expired about two or three years ago; and Tasmania is now responsible for a subsidy of £4,200 a year, and also Eor a guaranteed revenue of £5,600. I hope that we shall be able to arrange, as between the Tasmanian Government and the Federal Government, for an alteration of the cable rates. If that be so, I shall propose, in committee, to re-insert the words which were eliminated by the Senate, through, I believe, a mistake; and when that proposal is made we shall know that the charge will most likely be hd. per word, instead of l d . The words to which I have referred were eliminated by the Senate on the representations largely of the senators representing Tasmania, who believed that the Bill lost its federal character by containing such an incongruous element, nnd urged the desirability of making a uniform charge throughout the Commonwealth. When some objection was raised by the Postmaster-Geneval, the senators for Tasmania undertook that the Government of that State would take the responsibility for the elimination of the words. Circumstances have shown, however, that the Tasmanian Government are not in a position to .assume such a responsibility ; and I am sorry to say that my latest communication from the Treasurer of Tasmania is to the effect that the rate hereafter must be a matter of arrangement, although at the present time he agrees that it should be ^d. per word. The result of the conference of Premiers and Postmasters-General, held on 15th and 16fch . May last, was very unfortunate. Afc that 42 Y time a conclusion was arrived at which left the Tasmanian Treasurer in a hopeful state of m in d ; bufc circumstances subsequently arose which showed that the agreement was premature, or, afc any rate, was qualified by some of the parties concerned. Sir John See, speaking on the Federal Postal Bill, said I think that any loss caused to a 'State in consequence of the alteration of an agreement in connection with cable rates should be a federal charge. I think it is absolutely fair that where a State is under an obligation to carry out a contract it is to its advantage, as well as to the advantage of the Commonwealth, that the Federal Government should meet the deficiency. This concerns all the States. Thereupon the conference unanimously agreed to the following resolution:The conference is of opinion that any loss caused to a State through the cancellation or alteration of an agreement in respect of cable rates should be borne by the Gommonwealth. I need not say that in that opinion I thoroughly concur. I am always hopeful that in time we shall become a Federation in reality, when nothing shall remain to indicate that any one State receives differential treatment.",23
101,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,We cannot expect federation to pay for the disadvantages of geographical position.,24
102,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"I do not think that the question of geographical position ought to enter into the discussion. The question is whether we are one people; if so, there should be one purse.",24
103,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"There may be one uniform law, but we cannot cancel distance.",24
104,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"I have told the House that in committee I propose to move the re-insertion of the words eliminated by the Senate. I recognise that the Tasmanian cable is under different conditions from those which govern the wires through' Western Australia and South Australia. The Tasmanian cable is, so to speak, rented from a company, whereas the wires through Western Australia'and South Australia belong to the State, which has incurred capital outlay on their construction. The interest on that capital is a charge on the people generally; and we must not forget that the loss on the Post and Telegraph department arises largely from the fact that in carrying messages for a minimum charge of Is., nothing is charged for interest on the construction of the - wires through the mainland States. Thafc loss is borne by the people generally, whereas in Tasmania the rental is borne only by the people using the cable. There are only one or two further points with which I wish to deal. The cost of press telegrams will, by the Bill, be brought into line, uniform charges being .provided throughout the Commonwealth. In committee, however, it will be my duty to call attention to an incongruity which arises in this part of the Bill by reason of the action of the Senate. The Bill as sent to the other Chamber provided charges within any State, as follows :-2 5 words, 6d.; 50 words, 9d. : 100 words, Is. 6d.; and every additional 50 words, or portion of 50 words, 9d. That was a sliding scale, advancing by proper degrees ; but, for some reason or other, the Senate thought it advisable to make the charge 6d. for any additional 50 words, or part thereof. The result of the amendment is that the last 50 words are charged only 6d., while intervening 50 words aid charged 9d., and the rates are taken out of line so far as press telegrams from State to State are concerned, the charge in the case of the latter being Is. 6d. for every additional 50 words, or part thereof. In committee I propose to make the charge 9d., as before. I do not think - I need keep the House any longer on this measure. I have no doubt that when we get into committee a great number of points will arise, but these I shall not anticipate. I have a mass of papers here, but I think the House will regard what I have said as sufficient for a second-reading speech, further opportunity being afforded in committee for considering details.",24
105,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown," I think that the honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Philip Eysh, is to be congratulated upon the clear and satisfactory explanation of the Bill with which he has favoured us. Upon an occasion like this, we should not forget the Postmaster-General. Although he is not a member of fchis House, and we have therefore not been brought into immediafce contact with him as we have with other Ministers, we can all bear testimony to the painstaking manner in which he has discharged his duties. There can be no doubt as to the great responsibility attaching fco the discharge of those duties, and the immense labour involved in it, especially during the earlier period pf the history of the Commonwealth. The Minister has been called upon to deal with many serious and knotty problems, and to reconcile and harmonize the conflicting interests arid laws of six States, and although there may be in the Bill many provisions in regard to which fchere will be differences of opinion, I think it must be regarded upon the whole as an honest attempt fco promulgate a uniform postal system applicable to the whole of Australia. Our Post and Telegraph department is an institution of great magnitude and importance, and affects the commercial, social, and domestic life of the whole of our people. It must, however, be regarded not merely as a taxing department, but as a department established to render services' to the public. The public should not expect to receive those services gratuitously, however, but should be prepared to pay reasonably for them. Unfortunately there has been a tendency to look upon the Post-office as an institution which should give almost gratuitous aid to many of the ordinary occupations of life. In my opinion, those who use the Post-office should pay for the services rendered by it . But while we should demand fair and reasonable remuneration for the carriage of mail matter and for the transmission of telegrams and telephone messages, we ought to remember that if the charges imposed are excessive, or are regarded by the public as excessive, there is a danger that the facilities provided by the department will not be as fully used as they should be. Therefore, the great problem with which we have to deal is, how can we secure fair payment for - the services rendered by the department, and at the same fcime provide that the charges imposed shall not be such as will drive away business, and prevent the proper utilization of the facilities offered. Clause 4 sounds the right key note in regarding a. postal rate as a fee or charge for the performance of a postal service, and clause 5 gives effect to that principle by providing fchafc all letters, telegrams, and postal articles transmitted through the post on behalf of the King, or of the Government of the Commonwealth or of a State, shall be subject to postal and telegraphic rates. The Postmaster - General is to be heartily congratulated on that provision. The Postal department is held in trust by him for the people of Australia, and for the Governments of the various States of the Union. The States Governments are interested in the revenue earned by the Post-office, and consequently it is only right that they should pay in cash for the services which it renders to the in. We should hail with satisfaction this thafcfcheywill provision for the abolition of the vicious franking system which has existed in the States for so long. It is a most welcome reform in the interests of the department, ancl will afford us better means for ascertaining the real value of the department. So long as the franking system remains in force, it will be impossible know what is the real value of the services rendered by the Postal department. But it is important that we should have that knowledge, fov this reason: It is often stated that the postal and telegraphic serstrous vices are losing concerns, and that - fact been urged as a reason for reducing salaries, cutting down expenses, and increasing rates. B ut if we knew exactly what the department earns by the services it renpillars. ders to Government departments, as well to private individuals, we should probably find that it is not a losing concern to extent which it is held to be. I therefore hope that clause 5 will be agreed to as i stands, and that no exceptions from the operation of its provisions will be allowed. Every particle of mail matter conveyed station. through the post, ancl every message transmitted by telegraph or telephone, should be paid for in cash or stamps. That arrangetrain. ment will place this great revenue-earning and service-rendering department upon sound financial basis, and enable us to with it hereafter with a full knowledge its utility and ifcs cosfc. In conformity the principle laid down in clause 5 we necessarily adopt the reform provided in clause 6, which provides that newspapers shall no longer be carried through the post free. I regard that as a wise change. am aware that hitherto newspapers have been carried free in some of the States, and I have often wondered how the system came to be adopted by the Governments those States. It has been argued, forsooth, that postage upon newspapers is a tax upon knowledge. Postage is not a tax, it is charge for a service rendered, and no lisher should object fco pay it. If daily and weekly newspapers are to be carried free, because they disseminate knowledge, why should not monthly magazines, which often contain scientific information literary intelligence of even greater tance, also be carried free ? No doubt newspaper proprietors who have hitherto benefited by thisarrangement will feel irritated byfcheproposed change, but I 42 T z speedily become reconciled to it as a natural and inevitable one.",25
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The newspaper proprietors do not object to having to paypostage, but they object to the way in which the former arrangements have been changed.",26
107,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I am glad to hear it. I understand that when it was pro- "" to vided by statute law in New South Wales fchafc newspapers should be carried through the post free, it was not contemplated that that provision should apply to newspapersposted in bulk. It would have been a monexpectationfcothin k thatfcheA c t woul d has allow that. I understand that the Postal department is still carrying newspapers free in New South Wales when fchey, are posted in the proper receiving boxes and But for some years past an as arrangement has been in force between, the New South Wales Postal department the and the Railway Commissioners of that State, under which the latter have been, t receiving £2,500 a year for undertaking fco receive and transmit newspaper parcels and packages delivered at the Redfern railway",26
108,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,By one particular train.,26
109,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,B y more than one,26
110,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Of course, the a Parliament of New South Wales which deal sanctioned that arrangement knew its own of business, but the arrangement seems towith me a most astounding one, and can only must be regarded as a huge subsidy to the newsfor papers of the State, and a most unwarrantable proceeding from a public point of view. However, it is forfchepeopleI of New South Walesfcomanage their own business. It was merely an arrangement at the will of the Postal department, and consequently it was not binding on the Federal of Government when it took over that department. If it had been founded on a, statute no doubt it would have been bind a ing, and ""that obligation would have been pubtaken over with the department. There was nothing binding on the Postmaster General of the Commonwealth. There was no State appropriation, there was certainly no Federal appropriation by which and he could continue the payment of the imporsum of £2,500 a year to the Railway the Commissioners for the carriage of newspapers, but he said- "" I shall enforce the a little law of New South Wales so far as it hope ' imposes upon me the duty of carrying posted newspapers free,"" and that is being done. There is nothing to prevent the Railway Commissioners from carrying newspapers free if they will. If honourable members who are interested in New South Wales wish to bring influence to bear on the Railway Commissioners, newspapers can continue to be carried free by train, and the Parliament of the State can, if it thinks fit, continue to vote the subsidy of £2,500 a year to them for that purpose. Of course, they will not undertake to carry the parcels free ; certainly it would not be a business arrangement if they did.",26
111,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Of course, there is plaint. another side of this question which the honourable and learned member leaves out!",27
112,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"After reading all the correspondence, I do not think there In Tasmania the Railway department seems to have undertaken to receive parcels of newspapers direct from the publishing office, instead of from the post-office. only difference is that, whereas in New :South Wales the Railway Commissioners property demanded payment, in Tasmania - the General Manager of the Railways did not demand any extra payment.",27
113,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,Mr Bird said i was part of the amount paid.,27
114,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,In Tasmania the - General Manager of the Railways regarded the payment as included in the ordinary .annual provision for the carriage of mail matter. But in New South Wales the has Railway Commissioners would not do . and there is an arrangement for the Postal - department to pay them a lump sum for the carriage of all mail matter. Why did they not carry newspapers as well as matter for that lump sum? It was not likely that they would; they demanded - additional subsidy.,27
115,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"In one case the Railway department charged a lump sum, than and in the other the Railway Commissioners' charged separately. What is the difference between the two ?",27
116,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bot h in Tasmania on and in New South Wales the Government paid a lump sum, but in New South Wales, in addition to the lump sum, there an annual sum of £2,500 paid for the additional facilities offered department in allowing the newspaper proprietors to send their parcels direct the trains. If the Railway department of Tasmania chooses to carry mail matter or newspapers free we cannot help it . If the Railway Commissioners of New South Wales like to carry newspapers free we cannot help it either. But, in any case, I cannot see how the Eederal Government is to blame for what the Railway department in Tasmania has done. There has been no favouritism or discrimination, and altliough at the first blush it would seem as if some explanation were required, I fchink that when the honourable member for Macquarie goes into the question a little more fully, he will find that fchere is no ground for com",27
117,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,I shall give the excarefully planation by-and-by.,27
118,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Althoug h the Bill abolishes the free carriage of newspapers, is. it provides for the carriage of newspapers in bulk. Ir. provides for a charge of I d . per lb. on the aggregate weight of newspapers posted by any one person at any one time. The It also provides that the rate for the carriage of a single newspaper is to be -£d. per 8 ozs., or fraction of 8 ozs., avoirdupois weight. I wishfcosubmit the view which is entertained of those two provisions by the newspaper proprietors of Australia t generally. I think that, although the free carriage of newspapers by the post-office is to be abolished, it is only wise and proper that provision should be made for the carriage of newspapers in bulk parcels of a certain weight. The complaint been made that the rate of l d . per lb. that, on the aggregate weight of newspapers would be unduly harassing to many country newspapers, as well as to many town newspapers, because it would amount to 9s. 4d. mail per cwt., whereas the Railway department will carry, parcels at the rate of 8d. per cwt an Whafc is contended by the newspaper proprietors is thatThe rate for bulk parcels of newspapers of more 1 lb. each parcel, posted by the publisher for carriage to post towns only, not being railwaj towns, but within a radius of 20 miles from the nearest railway station or port, and not foi delivery by letter-carriers, should be Is. per cwt, the aggregate weight of newspapers so posted. That is a view which, I think, ought to be taken into consideration. Of course, it ' is was only intended to apply to a post-office within a radius of 20 miles from the nearby the Railway est railway station.",27
119,Sir PHILIP EYSH,Unknown,They wish to make to the post-office a common carrier.,27
120,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The post-office, it is suggested, should make arrangements in its contracts for the carriage of newspaper matter from railway stations to post-offices within a radius of 20 miles at the reduced rate.",28
121,Sir PHILIP FVSH,Unknown,Does the and learned member mean that the post office is then to deliver the newspapers 1,28
122,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"No ; bulk parcels are to be delivered at the post-office, and there received by the persons to whom they are addressed. That is the view which is presented in a circular that has been issued, and I think it is worthy of discussion. I should like to hear later on what the Minister has to say upon the subject. I think it might fairly be left to the proprietors to make arrangements with the Railway departments in each State for the carriage of newspapers in bulk, and which are not posted. I am told that atfchepresent fcime the Railway department charges only Sd. per cwt. for the carriage of these bulk parcels. Mr L . E. GROOM - In Victoria ?",28
123,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,Thaf c is the average throughout. We need not bother about the carriage of bulk parcels in parts of the coun try where there is railway coram u nication. Whafc the newspaper proprietors desire is that some special provision shall be made for the carriage of these parcels . from railway stations hp distant post-offices removed from railway communication.,28
124,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The only point is why bhat should be done by the Government iind not by the newspaper proprietors.,28
125,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"That has not been overlooked. The newspaper proprietors point out that the department has facilities for making contracts for the carriage of mail matter of a literary character. If that is not done the newspaper proprietors will have to make special arrangements for the carriage of these parcels. . The question is asked, why should not the Postal department have the advantage of any rates for the carriage of newspapers to remote parts, instead of the newspaper proprietors being compelled to make special arrangements"" I should like the Minister to consider that question by the time the Bill reaches the committee stage. If there be substantial objections to the proposal on the ground that it would not pay, I shall not press it - I merely present this view to the consideration of the House, because certain newspaper proprietors in some of the States will have to submit to the shock of having all their free carriage taken from them, and it it is only right that any suggestion made by them, which would tend to mitigate that loss, should be fairly and reasonably considered. honourable The next point to which I desire to draw attention is the rate which is to be charged for the carriage of single newspapers weighing more than 8 ozs. Under the Victorian Acfc, newspapers up to 10 ozs. in weight have been carried for - id. each, but under the Bill as it stands, the weight limit has been reduced to 8 ozs. I desire the Minister to take a note of that alteration,. and to give afc a later stage some explanation of the reason for it. Byfchereduction, the large newspapers, such as the Sydney MaU, the Adelaide Observer, the Town and Country Journal, the Australasian, the Leader, and other large and important journals, will be excluded from the benefit of the £d. post. Most of these large newspapers, which are very interesting and attractive literary productions, weigh more than 8 ozs., and thus the postage required to be paid upon them will be l d . '",28
126,Mr WATSON,Unknown,-Is it not after all a question of the rate afc which it will pay to carry them 1,28
127,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"There is only tl slight difference between the S-oz. and the 10-oz. limit. Ifc is pointed out that It has been argued that passing single newspapers addressed to distant subscribers at bulk rate afc Id. per lb., will be of advantage to all newspapers; but this will be obviously no advantage to newspapers weighing over 8 ozs. . . The objection raised by the Postmaster-General in the Senate to increase the weight of individual newspapers, passing at Ad., to 10 ozs.",28
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,From what is the honourable and learned member quoting 1,28
129,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,I quote from a circular issued in regard to this Bill.,28
130,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Issue d by the Sydney newspaper proprietors.,28
131,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,It is endorsed generally by the proprietors of all the large newspapers. As we are engaged upon a sweeping reform of this character,28
132,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,The honourable member for Bland does not like the Sydney newspaper proprietors to have any voice in the matter.,28
133,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,This circular applies also to the Melbourne newspaper proprietors.,28
134,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I do not want the Sydney newspapers to run the show. They run the interests of Sydney against those of New South Wales generally.,29
135,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,This circular relates not only to the Sydney newspapers. I am speaking on behalf of all the large newspapers.,29
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,As soon as the honorThe - able and learned member gets his own newswhile papers in he alters his tone.,29
137,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The circular sets out thatThe objection raised hy the Postmaster-General in the Senate to increase the weight of individual newspapers passing at i d. to 10 ozs. was that would be inconsistent to carry that propositi the charge for newspapers posted in bulk was for Hi ozs. To get over this, it would be easy increase the bulk weight for ld. to 20 ozs., and this would yield the large total of £7 9s. ton. By doing this the larger newspapers tioned would not be unduly penalized, and siderable advantage would be given to the newspapers, because of the larger number of single copies they could send at a given under the bulk arrangement. I am given to understand .thatIn England all newspapers that are registered such are accepted by the post-office at of id. each, irrespective of weight. It is contended thatThe undue limitation of weight will prevent newspaper proprietors from improving their papers thus depriving readers of the benefit pulsion. Ib is also stated bhatA very important point is that rates, proposed, must inevitably tend to thereduction, by proprietors, of the. quantity of matter lished, which must affect the. various grades labour employed in the production of the newspaper. Therefore, bhis is a mabber which concerns not only the proprietors of newspapers, the labour employed in the production those newspapers. If the proprietors find that they cannot post, large newspapers weighing over So'zs. ab the ordinary rabe of - J-d. each, they will, perhaps, be to reduce the quantity ©f literary matter £1,800. contained in their publications. I think that this is another amendment which should be made in the Bill in the interests of newspapers, the proprietors of which will have to submit to a very large reducthey tion in bheir profits. I should like to draw allowed. attention now to the charges proposed to be made upon ordinary telegrams. This is a matter which has been brought under the attention of the Postmaster-General a very large and influential deputation representing the stock exchanges and the business men of Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, and Brisbane. Under the 2nd schedule, it is proposed to establish telegraph rates of 6d. for town and suburban messages, 9d. for messages to other places within each State, and Is. for Inter-State telegrams. particular cause of complaint is that, hitherto there has been no charge for the name, address, and signature of the sender and the name and address of the rereiver, it is proposed now that a charge shall be made for every word, including the name and address of the sender, and those of the it person to whom the telegram is bransmibbed. while Ib is conbended by business people that that ld. charge will be a very seriousimpostupon those to who use the telegraph department in future. 4d. per In the petition from the Stock Exchanges meni t is stated that their principal objection conto the Bill is the new departure charging smaller for the name, address, and signature, rate which has been introduced by the Postmaster-General on the plea that this is the practice in every civilized country. as That is the ground upon which this the rate charge is proposed to be made, but I have been informed that in making this assertion the Postmaster-General has overlooked the United States and Canada, in which countries, the name, address,-and of exsignature are sent free. I should like the honourable gentleman in charge of the Bill to make a note of that, because the such as most strenuous opposition offered fco the measure, so far as it relates to telegraph rates, pubarises from this proposal to charge for the of name, address, and signature. As an example of how it will affect the Stock Exchanges, I may say that it has' been found that the revenue collected in connection with the but Melbourne Stock Exchange amounts, under of the old system of charges, to about £12,000 per annum. It has been calculated that the proposed charge for the name, address, and signature, will, on the business done by the forced Melbourne Stock Exchange, amount to",29
138,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"And yet two or three of these those who send the largest number of telegrams, cordially approve the change, because rarely send the full number of - word i",29
139,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"There may be two or three who approve the change, but the bulk of those constituting the stock - exby changes in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Bendigo, and Ballarat, tbose who are the principal customers of the Telegraph and Telephone departments, strongly object to the proposal, which on the business done by the 'Melbourne Stock Exchange will it is said involve an extra charge of 1,800 per. annum",29
140,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That is on the supposition that they use the full number of words in their messages, while, as a matter of fact, they very rarely do so. S""ir JOHN QUICK - I am only giving, the information which has been placed in my hands, and on the basis of the business done last year, it has been calculated that the amount I have stated will be the extra charge involved by the proposed . change. This is a provision which has rendered this Bill very unpopular in. .those Another objection is this: It is proposed under this Bill to have three rates for telegrams, a sixpenny rate within towns and suburbs, a nine penny rate within a State, and a shilling. Inter-State rate. The question is asked-Why should there be this specialfavour of sixpenny conceded to the city aud suburbs and not to the country? Why should we make such a discrimination as that 1",30
141,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Because it will pay, on account of the greater number of telegrams sent. Sir JOHN QUICK: - Why pay throughout the country 1",30
142,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Because of the smaller number.,30
143,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I do not see why business people or private individuals in the capitals should have the advantage of sixpenny telegrams, while people throughout the country aredeprived of that advantage. I would add that in-the various great centres, such as Melbourne, Adelaide, and Sydney, the people have the benefit and advantage of the telephone system.. I venture to say that if the sixpenny telegram system is extended in these great centres, it ' will mean either that the telephone revenue will be injured by the sixpenny telegram system, or that the telegraphic revenue will be injured by the telephone system. If we are to have sixpenny telegrams the system should be mode general within a State, and should not be confined to city and suburbs. If it will pay in the city and suburbs, it will also pay throughout the country. There is no doubt that it must involve increased expense in the city and suburbs, because additional messengers, and possibly additional operators, will be required, whilst the extension of the system to the country should not involve much extra expense. Another objection has been taken to the Inter-Staterate. It has been pointed out as a very extraordinary anomaly under this Bill that, whilst the charge proposed for sending a telegramfrom Melbourne to Wodonga is 9d., the charge proposed f o i - sending a tele gram from Wodonga to Albury, on the other side of the river, is Is.",30
144,Sir PHILIP EYSH,Unknown,We intend to correct that.,30
145,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I am very glad to hear it . The provision certainly seems anything but a federal one. The matters to quarters. which I specially desire to call attention, in so far as the telegraphic rates ure concerned, differential ore the proposed charge for names and addresses of sender and sendee, and the proposal to introduce a sixpenny telegram system for towns andsuburbs, while the country districts are left out in the cold. I telegrams trust that when we get into committee the Minister in charge of the Bil l will.be able to formulate some scheme for the sending of cheap telegrams at aminimum rate of 6d. within each State. I am sure that he will have the assistance of honourable members in making the Bill comwill it not plete and workable, and one which will tend to recognise and harmonize our new federal conditions' as far as possible. I'hope-that, whilst we determine-to make the Postal and Telegraphdepartment' a paying establishment, we shall not err in the opposite direction by imposing undue charges; causing the department to become unpopular, and leading to afalling-off in the amount of business done.

146,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,Unknown," I desire to draw the attention' of the Acting Prime Minister to a paragraphappearing in this morning's Aye, in reference to the soldiers who returned Grange. It appears that the Western Australian Government were blamed for not allowing certain members of the returnwhich I desired to direct attentioning contingent to land at Albany. As a matter of fact, the State Ministers gave every facility for their doing so, and reasons why they were not landed at Albany are beyond their knowledge. They take exception, also, to a few words which are supposed to have fallen from ter for Home Affairs. I am assured that the honourable gentleman did not say what has beeii attributed to him. Perhaps the Acting Prime Minister will make a statement upon the subject here, in order that the denial may receive publicity.",30
