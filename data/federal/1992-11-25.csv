1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Leo MCLeay) took the chair at 10 a.m., and read prayers. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1992 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 October, on motion by Mr Free: That the Bill be now read a second time.",10
2,Mr MCLACHLAN,DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION,"Barker) (10.01 a.m.)The principal purpose of the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill is to extend the Commonwealth guarantee on the borrowings of the Australian Industry Development Corporation from its current expiry date of 30 June 1994 to 30 June 1998. The Bill ensures that the guarantee does not continue on moneys reinvested after the statutory limit on the Commonwealth guarantee has expired. It also reduces the size of the AIDC board. Since that institution was publicly floated in 1989, the Corporation has basically been a holding operation. The requirement for a board of up to 12 directors is seen to be no longer appropriate. The Bill also defines the powers of the AIDC to enter swaps and other financial transactions. This Corporation is a government business enterprise which has an 81 per cent interest AIDC Ltd, which is a company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. The Corporation borrows on behalf of AIDC Ltd and the AIDC Act allows for AIDC borrowings to be guaranteed by the Commonwealth. The organisation was established to provide what is termed development funding for Australian companies. The functions and objectives of the Corporation are set out in section 6 of the AIDC Act. In summary, they are to facilitate the establishment, development and advancement of Australian industries, and the partici30 pation in those industries by Australian residents, by providing finance to those engaged in the industries and by participating in enterprises or projects. According to the 1992 annual report, the Corporation's priority areas are the manufacturing, processing or transport of goods and natural resources; internationally competitive service industries, including tourism; and the development or use of new or improVed technology. The report says: It is an objective of the Corporation in the provision of development funding to Australian companies that the efficiency and competitiveness of those companies will be enhanced, that long-term viability of some industries will be achieved through reconstruction, and that new industries . . . good growth prospects will be established. It also states: An overriding statutory requirement for the Corporation is to act in strict accordance with sound business principles in performing its functions. This has ensured that commerciality and profitability are firm objectives for the Corporation. The accounts of the AIDC reveal a somewhat different picture and certainly a somewhat different perfonnance. The perfonnance of the AIDC does not reveal the disaster that has been perpetrated by various Labor governments around the States and the ridiculous and tragic perfonnances that those State governments have indulged in at the taxpayers' expense. The State Government of Victoria managed, through the State Bank fiasco, the VEDC and other scurrilous misdemeanours, to put it mildly, to put that State In an indetenninate position, to put it at best. That was followed by the Western Australian State Labor Party, which has managed to surround in that State with a whole lot of amazing corporate breakdowns. Includ- in many of those breakdowns were many of the Ministers of that Government, even to the point of the Premier being involved to some extent. In later days we have had the South Australian State Bank collapse, and the former Premier of that State has been castigated by the nonnally mild commissioner in his report. The AIDC's performance is not at that level; nevertheless, it has not been impressive. The consolidated operating loss before tax to June 1992 was nigh on $100m. That followed a loss of $31m in the previous year. The Corporation is now in the financial position of having little equity left. It has debts of $2.9 billion and assets of just over $3 billion. No wonder, with such escalating losses two years in a row and such meagre equity, the AIDC requires the extension of the government guarantee, which is the main purpose of this Bill. If the Parliament did not grant such an extension, the Corporation-if it were other than attached to the Government-would be in very great difficulty in approaching the markets for further borrowings and refinancing arrangements. On Budget night this year, the Government announced its intention to reduce its shareholding in the AIDC from the present level of 81 per cent to 51 per cent. Little wonder that those plans have had to be put on hold and an extension to the government guarantee has become so vital. At this point I ask: why 51 per cent? Why would.it be so important for the Government, in these days when it has finally been dragged, kicking and reluctantly, to the point at which privatisation of its business enterprises is no longer a political problem for it, to retain a 51 per cent ownership by the government of the day in an operation which provides services which can be better provided by the private sector? Throughout the 1980s we had a debate on this matter of privatisation, as we watched it happen in other parts of the world. The Labor Party was in many cases violently against such a move. Necessity in other areas, such as the State Bank of Victoria, has led the Labor Party to decide that, in the very basic interest of getting some money back, it has to sell some things; That seems to have changed its philosophy on nrivatisation. Our side has had no such doubts that these things can be managed better by private industry. When we see the financial position that the AIDC has managed to find itself in, we have to raise doubts about the whole purpose of such an organisation, which, I repeat, is to act in strict accordance with sound business principles in performing its functions, and to make sure that the efficiency and competitiveness of those companies in which it is involved are enhanced. We can hardly believe that the organisation has satisfied those criteria. I would like the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free), if he is so disposed-or even if he is not-to answer the question as to what good purpose such an organisation will serve from now on. Whatever the purposes might have been in the past, we have to say that in 1992 this organisation has not done well. The Government has been operating the organisation for a great deal, if not all, of its existence. At least in the last few years the Government's purposes and the purposes of this organisation have been quite clear. I have just read them out several times. The AIDC, under the Government'sauspices, has failed to bring those purposes to fruition. So why not privatise it fully? The answer, of course, is that it would be very difficult to do so right now, and the Government knows it. It is a disgraceful situation to have an organisation that was put into existence for these very honourable reasons fall into such disrepair. I said those reasons are honourable, but the fact of the matter is that the honourable purposes in setting up governmental institutions hardly ever work in the end. There are some exceptions, but experience-and I have just quoted one or two of the experiences in the States-shows that in the end human error and the lack of accountability to a: shareholder who really understands and cares about his own funds mean that those institutions fall down. The AIDC seems to be no exception. The coalition does not oppose the Bill. We actually see no other reasonable course of action, and we have no intention of seeing the AIDC collapse. We have some meagre hope, when this Government changes in the near future, that with some correcting, a bit of cut and thrust, something will be left in the basket to be sold or privatised. But if the guarantee is not extended, we understand that the financial risk facing the Corporation and, through the existing guarantees, picked up by the Australian taxpayer would be considerable. Our policy, as I have said-it has been said many times from this side of the House-on coming to government next year, is to fully privatise the AIDC. The present Government has already started down that track with the partial privatisation of the Corporation, but we propose to take that all the way. There is no good reason for the Government owning a merchant bank and tying up two secretaries of Commonwealth departments as directors of what should be a commercial enterprise. Experience has shown all too well how much of a mess governments can make of owning corporations such as this. In this country Labor Party governments, both State and Federal, have epitomised what sort of mess governments can make in owning corporations such as this and causing immense problems for taxpayers. Whilst I notice that Government members and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) during Question Time downplay the matter, it is in fact not so much today's taxpayers who are going to pick these bills up as the children of these taxpayers. Such ventures have wrought absolute disasters upon those future taxpayers. Governments should get out of the business of running financial institutions. We need in those financial institutions people who are responsible to the shareholders and shareholders who are interested in the performance of those institutions. It is patently obvious that only the coalition has the strength of purpose to see the privatisation of AIDC all the way through. Like so many of the so-called reform initiatives of this Labor Government, the commitment here is half-baked or compromised. Our policy is to fully privatise the AIDC because it undertakes virtually all of its business activities in normal commercial competition with the private sector. That, of course, is the other point. Why do we have these commercial operations getting a kickstart from government? The board of directors is not responsible to any individual shareholder who can stand up and question it. It is responsible to a big corporate shareholder, the Federal Government, but not to individual shareholders with particular points of view. This operation set up ostensibly to help the private sector in fact finishes up in competition with the private sector, and perhaps in the direction it is going it will finish up being an onerous burden upon the Australian taxpayer. Of course, part of the privatisation process would be to replace the government guaranteed loans with alternative sources of funding. But for this to be achieved the AIDC will have to be in a strong financial position, a different position from that which it is in at the present time. Failure to extend the guarantee would almost certainly lead to a loss of confidence in AIDC Ltd and would undermine its viability. We want to see the Corporation in such shape that it will be an acceptable commercial proposition to a potential private sector buyer. It is with reluctance, but with that view in mind and with our impending election to government in mind, that we do not oppose the Bill.",10
3,Dr CATLEY,DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION,"I rise in support of the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill 1992. It was introduced into the House by the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free), who represents the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act 1970 to extend the Commonwealth guarantee until 30 June 1998, to clarify issues related to the Australian Industry Development Corporation's trading powers and to reduce the size of its board. These changes will facilitate the smooth operation of the AIDC in the financial markets and will reflect the diminished level of activity conducted by the AIDC since the transfer of the bulk of its business to its subsidiary, AIDC Ltd, on 1 July 1989. I note· that the Opposition spokesman on industry, the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), does not oppose the passage of this Bill in the House or in the Senate. The explanation that he gave-and I listened to it carefully-was that the Opposition does not want to see the AIDC collapse and that the Opposition's intention, in the unlikely event of its being elected to government, is to fully privatise the AIDC. I will return to these matters later on. First of all, I say something about the extension of the Commonwealth. guarantee. The Bill amends section 35 of the Act to implement the decision announced in the parliamentary statement on the economy and employment just over a year ago on 14 November 1991 by the then Prime Minister to extend the Commonwealth guarantee on the Corporation's liabilities from 1994 to 1998. This move recognises the importance of the Corporation's role in industry development by enabling it to minimise its borrowing costs by reducing the risks thereby entailed. This amendment also clarifies the application of the guarantee to deposited funds left on· deposit with AIDC where reinvestment dates occur after the guarantee cut-off date. Such funds will no longer attract the guarantee after the statutory limit on the Commonwealth guarantee has expired. Secondly, I will say something about the reductions in the size of the AIDC board. This clause reduces the size of the AIDC's board of directors, reflecting the fact that AIDC is essentially a holding corporation with AIDC Ltd acting as the operating company of the group. Previously, the board had a minimum of four and a maximum of eight other directors. This amendment will reduce the board to a Chairman, the Chief Executive of AIPC, and the secretaries to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, and one other director. It also makes some changes to the powers of the Corporation. The amendments clarify the AIDC's power to undertake certain financial transactions following a UK court decision that called into question the ability of statutory corporations to enter financial transactions such as swaps, foreign exchange agreements, forward rate agreements, option agreements, futures agreements, or hedge agreements in the course of. their business. Given the AIDC's role as a corporation operating in financial markets, it is important to have its powers clearly defined in these respects. The AIDC is a government business enterprise with the objective of facilitating the establishment, development and advancement of Australian industries. It seeks to do this providing finance to those engaged in industry-particularly in the manufacturing, processing, or transportation of goods and natural resoUrces-and in internationally competitive service industries, including tourism. It also seeks to promote the development or use of new or improved technologies. The AIDC was established in the early 1970s, and in 1989 the operations of the Corporation were changed. A new company, AIDC Ltd, was floated on the Australian Stock Exchange. The Corporation retained an 81 per cent interest in AIDC Ltd. AIDC Ltd has taken over the investing operations formerly carried out by the Corporation. It operates in a commercial manner without government direction. The bulk of the AIDC's business has been transferred to AIDC Ltd. The AIDC holds government shares and holds the Government's guarantee on borrowings. AIDC Ltd continues to provide debt and equity funds to Australian businesses, therethe fore taking on the group's more administrative activities. Therefore, the objectives of the AIDC are achieved through its investment in AIDC Ltd. Obviously the Government was disappointed with the $98.6m loss reported by AIDC Ltd for the year to 30 June 1992. But in the marketplace over the last couple of years many companies, particularly those in the financial sector, have suffered such losses. This kind of loss is certainly not out of line with the results of other financial institutions. For example, many banks-and in many ways AIDC Ltd operates similar to a bank-not only in the public sector, to which the honourable member for Barker referred, but also in the private sector, have announced extensive losses over the last year or two. This was partly as a result of the world recession-and these are experiences shared by banks in other countries-but was also as a result of having to write down the decline in asset values which followed on essentially from the 1987 stock exchange fall. The 1992 Budget made an in principle decision to reduce the Government's shareholding in AIDC Ltd to 51 per cent at a time when the Government is able to get full value by for the underlying asset in AIDC Ltd. During the year, the board of the AIDC acted to review the operations of the company in view of the losses that it was making in the marketplace. With new people in key positions, the organisation has redefined its strategy and its business focus. The AIDC is able to cope with the losses that it has made over the last year without calling on the Government guarantee, and it expects to return to profitability, as do many other companies that have suffered financial losses during the downturn in the business cycle. As we go into the growth phase, it has a fairly reasonable expectation, with successful management practices, of seeing an improvement in its profitability. These losses will affect the retained earnings and reserves of the AIDC, but the retained earnings are in excess of the losses that have been made. As at 30 June 1991, retained earnings stood at $122m compared with the loss in the following year of 1991-92 of just less than $ 100m. It is also fair to point out that historically AIDC has returned $53m in dividends. The AIDC will now focus on its core objective: the building of Australian industry. Under this newly redefined strategy, the AIDC will focus its work on what it does best-the funding of development, particularly in resource based development and in infrastructure projects. But the company will work in new ways to get the maximum benefit possible in tenns of development from the funds which it can mobilise. In the past, the company has worked through equity investments and loans. Now it will use its recognised expertise in infrastructure and resources financing to help get projects off the ground. There are still some cases in which the AIDC takes an equity position or provides loans in its own right, but increasingly the company will identify and market equity and lending opportunities to other investors and institutions. This will allow the company to mobilise significantly higher levels of funding than it could itself provide. The amendments to the AIDC Act which I have outlined are essentially minor in nature, apart from the extension of the guarantee which was agreed to by the Government and has been publicly announced· previously. These amendments will facilitate the smooth operation of the AIDC in the financial markets and will reflect the diminished level of activity conducted by the AIDC since the transfer of the bulk of its business to its subsidiary, AIDC Ltd. The Opposition, while agreeing to pass this amendment, has made some comments through the Opposition spokesman on industry concerning the performance of government business enterprises. I think it is appropriate that I make a few concluding remarks about government business enterprises. The situation that has arisen in the States of Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia to which the honourable member for Barker referred is of course a cause for concern on the part of the Government and on the part of members like me who represent constituencies in the State of South Australia. In the case of Victoria, the perfonnance of the bank must raise questions about the the personnel who undertook the perfonnance of that institution, which has of course since been taken over by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. In the case of South Australia, I have repeatedly expressed publicly on the record the view that the State Bank of South Australia should be sold to the private sector as soon as possible. That is a view I still hold and am urging upon the South Australian Government. The perfonnance of the bank over the last couple of years has left much to be desired. In th- case of Western Australia, I do not propose to make any comment other than to observe that a number of people are being prosecuted in the courts. However, the problem that arises with government business enterprises is a larger one. The market economy does not always function effectively and economists are prone to point to what they call 'market failures'. When a failure occurs in the marketplace, when the capital markets do not mobilise funds for new technologies or new industries which seem appropriate for the nation to develop, and when infrastructure is not produced for business to go about developing the economy, it is sometimes necessary for public instrumentalities to step into fill a market failure. The honourable member for Barker has referred to a number of problematic instances of government business enterprises trying to fill such market failures. We might just as well draw up a list of those that have been very successful. For example, the development of the railway infrastructure throughout the country during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was a very successful instance of a government business enterprise providing a transportation infrastructure that the private sector, left, to itself, would not have produced. In the airline sector, I might make the same pbservation about Qantas and the then TransAustraliari .Airlines which were set up by governments in order to produce an airline infrastructure that the private sector did not seem likely to produce. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia has operated in the same fashion and, in telecommunications, Telecom produced the kind of infrastructure that the private sector was not producing. In each of these cases, market failure has been offset by the Government's preparedness to put in public infrastructure in order to offset that failure. These have been successful instances of government business enterprises operating in that fashion. It is true that at some stage, as time passes and as the market changes its structure, these operations can be provided by the market itself, at which time it is appropriate for government to review the operations of such government business enterprises and ask whether it is appropriate to retain them as publicly owned institutions or whether they should be privati sed. I have no quarrel with that. Obviously there has been a debate in this country over the last few years as to which of these government business enterprises should be retained in the public sector and which should be privatised, the time having been reached when there is no longer a market failure and the private sector can undertake these operations itself. , In the case of the airlines, it has become view of this Government that the private sector could operate airlines to the satisfaction of the national interest in the provision of airport infrastructure, and we are in the process of seeking to sell them. In the case of the railways, other refonns are being undertaken. In the case of telecommunications, a competitor in the fonn of Optus has been provided to Telecom to ensure that not only the infrastructure of telecommunications is provided but also it is done in a competitive and efficient fashion. In principle, I have no quarrel with the argument that is put forward that if there is no market failure, if the private sector is capable of producing the needs of the national market, it may be time to review whether it is appropriate for the Government to be involved in that sector. To take the case of the AIDC, in the early 19708 there was clearly a market failure in the fonn of the mobilisation within Australia of funds to produce infrastructure, natural resource projects and, as it later emerged in the late 1970s and into the 1980s, funds to produce and to develop commercially new technologies or to introduce existing technologies into Australia that would not have otherwise been undertaken because there was not an appropriate market in capital for new technologies. There was a shortage and it was thought appropriate at that time that the Government provide a corporation, the AIDC that, in part, could fulfil this role. Since then other mechanisms have been tried, including the 150 per cent income tax write-off against new technologies, the MIC programs, and now the Australian Technologies Group. There is a market failure in the fonn of mobilisation of capital for new technologies and for many fonns of new businesses in resource development, in manufacturing, in infrastructure and most certainly in an area that I have personal experience in; that is, the mobilisation of capital for the development of new technologies in Australia. The AIDC has generally over the years fulfilled some function in that market failure hole. It has to be said that the perfonnance of the AIDC over the last couple of years, on the financial records that we have before us, has the been somewhat disappointing. What happens to a corporation in the marketplace when its financial perfonnance is unsatisfactory but its shareholder is asking it to perfonn a function within the market; that is, to fill a market failure in the mobilisation of capital? We do what has been undertaken over the last year; that is, revise the management of the corporation, redefine its business towards its core, sell off some of the assets and introduce new capital into the corporation. At this stage I would say that this seems the appropriate way for us to proceed, which is what the Government is doing. If in the fullness of time we decide that the private sector can fulfil this market failure obligation just as readily as a government business enterprise, the time may have come to privatise it. But at this moment that has not arisen.",12
4,Mr BEALE,DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION,"The Australian Industry Development Corporation is another failed socialist icon established to provide for the market failure to which the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) referred. It has indeed failed to assemble capital for that purpose. It is a symbol of a bygone era, as are those opposite. It is a relic of another age. It is extraordinary that in his earlier days the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was something of a supporter of the AIDC. When he was first Treasurer he referred to it in glowing terms, but those were the days when he was a true interventionist. By 1988 he had changed his mind. In reference to the AIDC, he said: ... we've got a better solution, we'll regulate of it off you . . . He went on to say: What do you think that every investment manager out there in the AMP Society or National Mutual or the other 300,000 funds is? A lemon? .. the funds can only be invested wisely by someone at the AIDe, which is just a Government merchant bank? By the way, it's a Government merchant bank which has conned two-thirds of the party... This was the Prime Minister talking in 1988 about the AIDC. Despite the fact that five years ago the Prime Minister was giving the AIDC a belting, the Government still would not face up to the fact that this failed socialist icon should be moved from the government sector into the private sector. For five years the coalition has been saying that the AIDC should be privatised. The Prime Minister alluded to that in 1988, but all the Government could do, and then reluctantly, was to move to just short of 20 per cent private capital in AIDC. Although it said at the time it would prefer to go to 30 per cent, it never did. In the recent Budget it said that it will go to 49 per cent. This is a sort of Clayton's privatisation. This is the privatisation that really is not privatisation because any investor in a company where the Government owns 51 per cent knows that that company will continue to be subjected to political and bureaucratic interference. Privatisation means the transfer of 100 per cent of the ownership of the shares from the public sector to the private sector. The losses by the AIDC, recently announced, of around $100m testify to the fact that the Corporation has failed to achieve the objectives that the Government had set for it. Not only has it failed to achieve those objectives but also the Minister responsible, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), has failed the people of Australia by his inability to be able to monitor the activities of the company in such a way that it did perform its so-called social objectives. But the Minister, unable to achieve that, washed his hands of the whole thing and said, 'All right, if it can't achieve what we set a bit out for it to achieve, let it be a commercial organisation'. It is in that capacity that the Corporation has had a very bad year. We all hope that the losses incurred by the AIDC are at an end. We all hope that, because of the employees in the company, because of the investors in the company and because the taxpayer has an interest in the company, those losses are at an end. But I think it has to be said that the finance institutions around Australia are continuing to suffer further losses. They are continuing to have to raise contingencies, and they are continuing to have to make reserves provision for further losses because the investments and the loans they made over the last five or six years are still not at the point where those finance organisations can recover the full amount either invested or lent. Although we all hope that the AIDe's losses are at an end, we should be prepared for the fact that the company will continue to have difficulty as it trades out of the investments and the loans that it has made in the last few yearS and attempts to redeploy its funds into the infrastructure area. The important clause in the Bill before the House today is clause 5, the guarantee by the Commonwealth, because this clause extends the Commonwealth guarantee for AIDC loans by four years to 30 June 1998. The coalition-rather reluctantly, I am bound to saywill not oppose this Bill, and particularly this clause, because we recognise that, unless the guarantee is extended for a period of time, the Corporation will have difficulty in raising the money that it needs for its trading purposes. It is a matter of some regret that both the Corporation and the Government have found themselves in a position where they have to extend the guarantee. If, as the Government says, AIDC is to operate commercially, ideally it should do so in such a way that there is no further call on the taxpayer by way of either funds or guarantee. Unless this guarantee is extended by that four-year period, the Corporation will have difficulty. In those circumstances its investors and the taxpayer will be penalised. So the coalition will not oppose that clause. We have to ask ourselves what the answer is for AIDC. The answer is that as soon as practicable the remaining shares in the company must be transferred from government ownership to ownership in the private sector. I say as soon as practicable because it is clearly now going to take more time than was originally envisaged to effect the privatisation of the Corporation. If the Government had accepted our advice five years ago and privatised AIDC at that time, this problem would not have arisen. We would not now need to have the taxpayer guaranteeing an extra $3 billion-odd of loan funds in AIDC. I This is another example of mismanagement of government business enterprises by the Government. We see plenty of evidence of that. The Government has disastrously bungled the privatisation of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. It is in the middle of a further fiasco with the Qantas sale. The guidelines on Qantas have been changed in a major way three times over the past couple of years, and the rules under which investors can make an investment in Qantas have been changed at least four times. How can anybody in the private sector come to a sensible commercial decision about an investment in Qantas when the Government is continuing, even to this day, to make rule changes? The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) is coming back today from a jaunt to New York, where he probably changed the rules on the Qantas sale yet again. Up to that time he had been saying that only 35 per cent of Qantas would be sold overseas, but in New York in recent days he has said, 'Maybe we can give another 15 per cent of Qantas to portfolio investors from overseas'. It is 'unclear whether the Minister meant 35 per cent and 15 per cent, making 50 per cent; whether he meant 25 per cent, which is the limit of one buyer in the trade sale, plus 15 per cent, making 40 per cent; or whether he was back to 35 per cent, implying a 15 per cent portfolio investment and a 20 per cent single owner trade sale. The Government has no idea how to carry out a sensible privatisation. One reason the Government has no idea is , that it is doing it for the wrong reasons. We cannot trust Labor with our money. Labor is doing this only as a sordid exercise of money grubbing. The sole objective of privatisation for the Labor Party is to reduce the Budget deficit. The Labor Party will have a great deal of trouble reducing its Budget deficit with the privatisation program this year. One billion six hundred million dollars is slated to come into the coffers from privatisation. If the Qantas sale does not proceed in this financial year, it will probably take $1 billion off the proceeds. That will mean that the Budget deficit blows out by $1 billion with the consequent pressures that the financial markets will bring to bear. Labor is privatising for all the wrong reasons. It is privatising just for the money. The real benefits of privatisation arise for quite different reasons. The real benefit to accrue from the privatisation of the Australian Industry Development Corporation is that the Corporation will be operating in a competitive market with the resultant lower prices and better services given to customers. There are further reasons why the AIDC will benefit from privatisation. The first reason is that the Corporation be subject to the pressures of the financial markets. It will be under the discipline to raise equity and debt funds in a way that will enhance its business activity. When it is in that position it will not need to come back to the taxpayer to guarantee its loans. The first advantage for the Corporation under privatisation is that it will be subjected to the disciplines of the financial markets with the benefits that that will bring. The second reason is that the management will be subjected to the much stronger pressures of the share market. Nothing so concentrates the mind of a manager as the threat of a takeover that will arise if his performance does not represent itself in the share price of the organisation. A third benefit that will accrue under the privatisation program that we plan is that the employees of the organisation will be given the opportunity to participate in its ownership. This will fit together very well with our industrial relations policy, which is going to set the framework to encourage employer and employee to get together and sort out the terms and conditions under which employees will work with the employer in the enterprise. These workplace agreements will be enhanced by giving employees in an organisation such as the AIDC the opportunity to participate in the ownership. The coalition will not oppose this legislation. We are glad to see the AIDC have an opportunity to get itself back on track with the extension of the guarantee. But it is only a short term solution for the future of AIDC. The medium and long term solution is that the Corporation must be privatised, because it is privatisation that will enhance the competitive environment and produce benefits for the users of the services of the Corporation.",16
5,Mr FREE,DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION,"in reply-In closing the debate on the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill 1992, I want to thank those who participated, the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) and the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale). I return very briefly to the purpose of the Bill. will objectives: first, to extend the government guarantee on the borrowings of the Corporation from the current expiry date of 30 June 1994 to 30 June 1998; secondly, to reduce the size of AIDC's board; and, thirdly, to define the powers of AIDC to enter into swaps and other financial transactions. I mention the purposes of the Bill because the debate has ranged over a much wider canvass and I want to address some of those issues in reply. ' I turn first of all to criticism by the Opposition of the performance of AIDC. There are a number of points I want to make. The loss of $98.6m recorded by AIDC Ltd for the financial year to 30 June 1992 is, of course, a matter which has been of concern to the Government, but I should point out that this figure is the result of a write-down-and a very conservative write-down at that. Any suggestion by the Opposition that any extension of the government guarantee will result in an imminent call on taxpayers' funds is an attempt to draw a very long bow indeed. Secondly, we have had from the Opposition the suggestion that somehow or other this poor performance was a direct consequence of a majority government shareholding. The Opposition would have us believe that the AIDC's having lost its way in the 1980s-and the Government does not resile from that for a moment-should in some way be considered a unique event. But during the 1980s AIDC was not Robinson Crusoe. Those opposite should think about Westpac, Elders, Skase and Bond. So let us not persist with the pretence that somehow or other the performance of AIDC during the 1980s can be considered in any way a unique event or in any way a direct consequence of a majority government shareholding. Quite clearly, private concerns also lost their way during that decade. As has already been reported, but not acknowledged by the Opposition, remedial measures within the organisation are already in place. There is a new chairman, new management, new key executives and a refocusing on the core objectives of the organisation, which is the building of It has three Australian industry. Some comment was made on the inprinciple decision to sell down the Corporation's interest in AIDC Ltd from 81 per cent to 51 per cent. The question was asked: why 51 per cent? Why not the lot? The honourable member for Barker answered the question, at least partially, himself. It is not the right time to be looking at that kind of a sell down anyway. He said that it would not by appropriate now-and the Government agrees. The sale will not go ahead until the Government is able to get full value for the underlying assets of AIDC Ltd, and that may not be for some time. There is a second matter relating to the 51 per cent that also ought to be mentioned. The suggestion has been made that somehow or other the 51 per cent figure gives the Government the power to direct the Corporation and therefore AIDC Ltd to do or not do certain things. I point out that in section 9 of the Act, except for the national interest provisions which I will come to shortly, the Corporation is not-I underline 'not'-subject to direction by or on behalf of the Commonwealth. That is a matter that has been made clear in this place and in the other place on a number of occasions. I come to the national interest provisions because I believe they are important. As we are all aware, all of AIDC's operations now are carried out by AIDC Ltd. AIDC has the malaria vaccine project, the Saramane project, as an ongoing matter, and the national interest provisions are retained in the Act and therefore can be used in instances such as this. I point out that this project has met with the approval of both Houses of this Parliament, and it currently involves very significant cooperation with the Hoffmann-La Roche organisation of Switzerland. Having listened to the Opposition speakers in the debate, one could be pardoned for believing that nothing worthwhile had ever come out of AIDC. This is simply not the case, and I draw the attention of the House to the fact that AIDC was quite instrumental and necessary in establishing the Australian Submarine Corporation, which is certainly responsible for a great deal of industrial development in the home State of the honourable member for Barker. It would have been reasonable had he been prepared to acknowledge that in his remarks. I also draw the attention of the House to the involvement of AIDC in the development of Interscan, Australia's microwave landing clearly system, which leads the world and which operates internationally. AIDC was needed to attain such a success for Australia's industry in the development of Interscan. , As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, the Bill is limited to three measures. I thank the coalition for its support for these measures and for the Bill. Question resolved in the affinnative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Free) read a third time. NA NA 1992 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 November, on motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time.",18
6,Mr LLOYD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"-:The Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 makes three changes to government policy in relation to the pig industry, the meat industry and the grain industry, the primary industry commodity organisations, their representation and their accountability both to their people and to government. The coalition parties will not oppose the legislation. But I make it very clear that in government we would not be committed to the rigid requirements that this Government has imposed for a trio or triumvirate of organisational arrangements, that is, an industry policy council, a resear-h and development corporation and a statutory authority or corporation. We would question whether there needs to be three organisations for every rural industry-I think in particular of the wool industry and of a whole range of small agricultural industries. Secondly, we question whether the selection process is the most appropriate process and whether it is too expensive, particularly for smaller agricultural industries. Thirdly, we would question the method ?f financing, which is a central part of the pig industry section of the legisl-tion, whe-eby, in return for the industry sectIon acceptmg a broader industry involvement-I acknowledge that there is value in that if it will gain a more targeted direction for the industry as a whole-it will be required to give into a degree of government control, firstly, in relation to the financing of that industry policy council and, secondly, to the Government's appointing of the chairman. In government, the coalition will discuss with each rural industry what the most appropriate and cost efficient arrangement is for that industry, taking into account the particular circumstances of that industry. As I said, the major part of this legislation relates to changes to the pig industry. In the second reading speech by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), he indicated that this will bring the pig industry into line with other rural industries in the third part of that trio of arrangements with the broader based policy council, in which case the Government will pay for the council and choose the chairman. This particular legislation comes· at an awkward time for the Government because of the recent investment of $430,000 by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in a piggery, which in six months has increased in value to be now worth $4.2m. The Prime Minister does have some questions to answer in regard to this legislation because, when one talks about ministerial responsibility at any government level, but particularly at the Federal level, justice must appear to be done, as well as be done, by Ministers who have an interest. The Prime Minister must answer these questions in relation to this legislation, because they are legitimate and serious questions. The first is: did the Prime Minister declare an .interest, because of his now significant investment in the pig industry, when the Ministry",19
7,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I interrupt the honourable member for Murray. Obviously, the House of Representatives is the appropriate place to raise questions, but I want to take this line in this debate: matters reflecting upon honourable members in the chamber need to be raised by way of substantive motion. I know that another place may have a different ruling, but I do not. Whilst it is quite correct for the honourable member for Murray to raise general questions in relation to the pig industry, because that is within this Bill-that is quite correct-I do not want this to become a debate about a particular member of the Parliament, be it anyone in this chamber. Noone is treated differently in this respect. I am sure that the honourable member for Murray can understand that and is able to work within my ruling in that respect.",20
8,Mr LLOYD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"We are here talking about some very significant industry legislation which places the Government in a very significant control position with regard to a new industry council, which the Government pays for, and a chairman, whom the Government appoints. It is quite correct and, I believe, necessary, that when one talks about declarations of interest in an industry where a Minister, any Minister, has an interest, it is appropriate to ask the question: when this matter was discussed in the Ministry, was any statement made by the Prime Minister declaring an interest in the industry covered by this legislation? Secondly, did he abstain from any discussionMr Free-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. You might be able to guide me. I understood that you had given a ruling on this matter.",20
9,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Yes. Mr Free-It appears to me, from the remarks of the honourable member for Murray, that he is now seeking to canvass this ruling.",20
10,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Yes. I was letting the honourable member for Murray proceed a little, because obviously we do not want to curtail debate too much. But I do want to make this point: reflecting upon honourable members of the House, be it the Prime Minister or other honourable members, needs to be by way of substantive motion. What we have before the House, in fact, is a second reading debate. As the honourable member for Murray quite accurately states, it does entail the pig industry. So I am conscious of that. The honourable member has the right to do that. But I would say, and I want to make this clear from the chair, that matters reflecting upon other members of the House need to be by way of substantive motion. Opposition members-Who has reflected on him?",20
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That is to be detennined by what the honourable member for Murray has to say, which is why I have not cut him off yet. I am sure that he can work within that. I will leave it to the judgment of the honourable member for Murray.",21
12,Mr LLOYD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I make the point that I have made no reflection on any Minister or any member of parliament, but I have raised questions, because it is correct and proper to raise questions. The reason why I have raised these questions is that concern has been expressed in the pig industry in relation to this legislation because of the connection of the Prime Minister with that industry. There has been a second area of concern, and that is that-and I am not making any reflection on the Prime Minister, because I am not even mentioning him in this section-because the Government will be appointing the chainnan of the Industry Council, will the Government give the assurance that no-one associated with the Brown and Hatton piggery, either in the past or in the present, will be appointed chainnan of the new Council? That is a perfectly proper question, because it is the Government that appoints the chairman of that Industry Policy Council. It is absolutely essential for the Government to give that assurance if that new Policy Council is to have any credibility and is not to be as government intervention flowing through this legislation. It is a fact-it is not a reflection-that the Prime Minister does have half ownership in the Brown and Hatton piggery through a holding company, Euphron Pty Ltd, which was purchased from a colleague and former Labor Party Minister, John Brown, who continues to enjoy a close relationship with the Government. Brown and Hatton with the Danish company, Danpork, has entered into a joint venture of $80m. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, in his second reading speech, referred to the need for the pig industry to become export oriented. I agree with that. The industry has been too domestic and too defensive. I commend Danpork for providing substantial capital and, presumably, technology to increase the export outlook for the pig industry in Australia. There are tremendous opportunities. For example, under the free trade agreement with New Zealand, there is that market. Pork is a major consumption item in· Asia. That is increasing. In a number of Asian countries, environmental problems are reducing the ability for those countries to produce pig meat. I think in particular of Taiwan, which has been a very substantial producer for the Japanese market which is now, as I understand it, phasing down pig meat production. We do have natural advantages. We have cheap grain. We also have areas of land which can overcome the environmental problems that are now confronting European and Asian countries. But it is important in the context of this legislation, where the Prime Minister now has a significant investment in what is in total an $8Om investment in the pig industry, and where the Government, through this legislation, does appoint the chainnan, that there is not seen to be evidence of interference by the Government. I emphasise that: by the Government. No individual Ministers are named-by the Government. I cite some of these concerns about government interference in the pig industry. On 18 June, Senator Button told the Senate that there was no ministerial involvement in discussions seen on the importation of pigs from Denmark. However, a letter from AQIS to the Pork Council of Australia dated 3 June and obtained by Senator Boswell under freedom of information states: The Danes first raised the possibility live pigs in the mid 1980s. This request was not formally followed up until 1990 when it re-emerged as an issue at Prime Ministerial level in the of proposals for a joint venture between Danish and Australian pig breeding and processing interests. Page 3 of the same letter states: Having regard to Government to Government discussions over the years and in particular recent Minister to Minister discussions it will be necessary to give some priority to the long standing Danish requests. On 21 July, AQIS wrote another letter Council which said: I must correct an error in my previous advice to you at page 2, paragraph 4 of my 3 June 1992 letter regarding the status of proposals for importation of live pigs from Denmark. This letter incorrectly advised that the issue of possible live pig imports from Denmark re-emerged at Prime Ministerial level on April 1990. This letter did not, however, deny that there had been Minister to Minister discussions on the importation of pigs or breeding material from Denmark. Why, then, did the matter of the importation of that material suddenly rise to the top of the pile within AQIS? As evidence that it did, I quote a DPI officer in Brisbane who sent an urgent telex to AQIS in Canberra on 5 March 1991 in respect of pigs from Denmark. The telex asked: Could you please tell me why does this have a prior-ty one? AQIS told the industry in letters that Denmark had an excellent disease record and that there had l1een strong pressure from within the industry for imports. However, the Pig Improvement Co., which is one of the leading pig breeding companies in Australia; the Australian Pork Producers Council; the Western Australian Pig Producers Association; and the New South Wales Farmers Association, all oppose the importation of live pigs. The only pressure for the importation appears to have been from Brown and Hatton. I quote from a cable tabled in the Senate on 15 September: AQIS has been approached by the Danish Government and the Confederation of Danish Industries to undertake assessment of imports of live pigs and ·pig semen. Higher priority was, until recently, being placed on these tasks as imports of genetic material were linked to a joint venture proposal between Australian and Danish industry that was for access for being forged during 1991/92. We now know that that was the joint vencontext ture-Brown and Hatton-to which I have previously referred. The cable went on to say: However, it now appears that these import proposals may be a lesser priority. . It is interesting to note that the cable was sent in July, after the coalition had raised the matter in the Senate, and it sought documents under the Freedom of Information Act. The following apology or correction appeared into the· the Melbourne Age on 16 September: The early editions of yesterday's Age reported that a family company of the Prime Minister was an investor in Danpork Australia, which planned to import live pigs from Denmark as part of a joint venture operation with a Danish Company. This was incorrect. The joint venture in which Mr Keating has an interest will use local stock. It has no intention of importing any pigs or breeding material from anywhere, and has not applied to do so. This mistake was made by a reporter. Mr Keating says the joint venture has not been the subject of any ministerial talks, nor has it been involved in contact with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service ... However, on 17 June Senator Button told the Senate: This has led to the quarantine service telling the company that appropriate protocols would have to be developed if such imports were to take place. I understand that the Danpork company has now advised the quarantine service that it intends utilising the breeding qualities of Australian pigs, realising that it may not be appropriate to use its own stock. That raises very serious questions of Government involvement in the matter of giving top priority to AQIS's jobs and procedures for the importation of live pigs from Denmark. There is evidence from the quotations I have made that the only people seeking that importation were Brown and Hatton. I have stated who the owners of Brown and Hatton have been and who they now are. There were Minister to Minister discussions; Senator Button has not denied that in the Senate. There is a telex from a DPI officer in Brisbane asking the question: why the request for putting that application for material from Denmark at the top of the pile, priority No.1? Every other pig industry group in Australia has basically publicly declared that it is opposed to any such request. If there is to be credibility for the pig industry in this new Council, which is the central part of this legislation, under which the Government pays for the Policy Council and chooses the chairm-, and if the concerns of the broader pig industry in Australia are to be allayed, then those questions have to be answered. Where was the declaration of interest when this matter was going through the Ministry? Will the Government state that it is not applying any influence with regard to this company, either in relation to imports or in any other way, and will the Government give the assurance-it has to if there is to be credibility for that industry and the Policy Council-that no-one associated with Brown and Hatton at any time will be appointed as chairman of that Policy Council? There are also other problems for that company, as it is a major factor in the industry. As I said earlier, I commend any attempts and proposals and investments not only to increase production of a very important primary industry commodity in Australia, but also. to upgrade its technology and go after exports. A detailed analysis of the returns filed by that company and prepared in association with a leading Australian accountant and lawyer has revealed that there have been consistent breaches of the corporation law and Australian Securities Commission requirements. The first was by the failure of the Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd to file its detailed public company accounts for 1990 until forced to do so by request from the Australian Securities Commission in July 1992, more than a year and a half after the due date of December 1990 and after the Group had belatedly filed an inadequate and false statement of key financial data in its 1990 annual return on 10 January 1992. Secondly, the Group filed for public view an annual return for 1990 containing a statement of key financial data that was significantly false in that it overstated by at least $23m the net tangible assets of the Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd and two of its subsidiaries. The remaining subsidiaries were not consolidated, nor were full accounts filed for them. This overstatement probably amounted to another one million dollars or so in view of further false declarations within the return. The $19;85m that it stated to be the net tangible assets of the Group in its key financial data return was subsequently revealed in the full return to be instead the total of gross assets which, after deducting $18.45m in liabilities, gave net assets of only $1.3m. When intangible assets of $4,45m were deducted, being owed for goodwill to Mr John Brown's company, the real net tangible assets position deteriorated to a negative $3.14m.",21
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Hollis)Order! I am reluctant to interruPt the honourable member, but the Deputy Speaker did give a ruling on this matter, and you have canvassed fairly widely. I would ask you to come back to the terms of the Bill. As I understand it, we are dealing with individuals in an organisation, and basically this Bill is about setting up the Australian Pig Industry Council. I do not see what individual firms have got to do with that. So I ask you to restrict your comments to the legislation before the House.",23
14,Mr LLOYD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"This company is one of the major pig companies in Australia. Therefore, it has a very significant role with regard to any pig industry organisation. If one wanted to, and I certainly do not, one could go further and comment on principals in that company being members of pig industry bodies in this country. They have every right to be members of those. I do not knock that at all. But I make the point that this is something very central to this legislation. We are talking about the way in which the legislation structures the Industry Policy Council and, in particular, the fact that the Government will choose the chairman. Secondly, we are talking about the fact that the Government will be paying for the operation of it. I acknowledge that that is no different from any other industry policy council in primary industry that has been established by this Government, but there is a relationship with the Government, which is putting forward this legislation. Therefore, these issues are very relevant to the debate, particularly the fact that the company is obviously, on the evidence or information that I am given, in breach of a whole series of Australian Securities Commission reporting requirements. I believe that is very relevant.",23
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I remind the honourable member for Murray, who has had many years experience in this House and who understands the Standing Orders, that he is treading a very fine line. He has to be very careful. There are set ways in this House of making an imputation against an honourable member. I ask him to be very careful in the comments that he is making.",24
16,Mr LLOYD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"In relation to my providing information about the analysis of the returns filed by the Brown and Hatton group, I have not named any individuals. I am just reading from that detailed analysis which refers to the filing of annual reports. It does not mention any individual. Therefore, I believe it is completely appropriate for me to continue in this way. The analysis states: This false return does not appear to have been questioned by the ASC despite its seriously misleading nature. To this time it has not been corrected and is the return provided by the ASC in response to public enquiry. The detailed public company 1990 accounts, eventually and reluctantly filed on 10(th) July 1992 (eighteen months late and signed on May 201991, six months late) are themselves false and misleading in several material particulars and have not been audited, in breach of ASC requirements. It then tells how it is in breach. It continues: a) The statement that net profit for the year was $842,999 ""after income tax"" is clearly false, is the Director's declaration that no item, transaction or event between balance date of June 30 1990 and the belated signing of the accounts on May 20 1991, would significantly affect the Group. This emerges from the fact that:i) Note three to the accounts states, ""no provision for income tax is considered necessary as the interest expense payable on loan funds received from Rincraft Pty Ltd (an associate but not consolidated company) amounting to $11,495,000 will ultimately exceed any taxable income generated"". ii) No present or future interest liability is stated in the accounts although it must have been established for tax purposes prior to the Group's tax return and certainly before the Director's declaration that the accounts were ""complete and correct"" was made in May 1991. As a result either the net profit should have been reduced by the interest charge or a provision for the interest charge should have been created, further diminishing the Group's net tangible assets position. b) The accounts do not represent a true and fair view of the company's financial position and the information is not ""complete and correct"" as required by the ASC in the relevant officers' declaration in the annual return in that depreciation of assets, which the notes to the accounts claim has been charged ""over their estimated useful lives commencing from the date of acquisition"" has not been accounted for at all, with the piggeries being shown at the acquisition cost of $7 million and other property, plant and equipment at cost, so overstating the profit and assets position of the company. Mr Deputy Speaker, to your relief I will not continue to quote, although there are two more pages of this detailed financial report of how the Brown and Hatton company is in breach, and I understand that has now been put before the Australian Securities Commission for its urgent investigation. I indicate that the Opposition does not oppose the legislation. (TIme expired)",24
17,Mr COURTICE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Hinkler) (11.26 a.m.)Every time. I tend to think that I have judged· the National Party of Australia too harshly, I am pleased to see that it justifies my criticisms and lives up to its own level of expectation. It is good to note that in this chamber there are two farmers, as well as myself, who as do not belong to the National Party. I acknowledge the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), who are both members of the Liberal Party. One thing that the members of the National Party cannot accept or come to terms with is that there are farmers in this country who do not hold their philosophy; they may support Liberal, Labor or, to some degree, even the Australian Democrats. It really does get at members of the National Party that there are people involved in agriculture who do not believe in their philosophy and who do not follow their views. The two Liberal members who are in the chamber probably have as much time for the Nationals as I do, but as they are in coalition they are not able to say so, as I can. If it is the case that we are getting into reading text and transcripts, I am more than happy to come in here and read a transcript of the Fitzgerald inquiry week after week to show what grubby sort of representation the Nationals gave to Queensland for 32 years. For any National Party politician coming close to an election to talk about propriety, being a Queenslander myself and a proud one, simply makes a sick joke. But I will deal with some of those comments later. It is necessary to point out the functions primary industry councils to the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), who certainly does not understand anti-dumping, the sugar industry and, obviously, the function of primary industry councils. Policy councils are designed to assist in the development of consistent and comprehensive policies of those primary industries for which they are established. Industry councils will this by reviewing the strategic directions of the industries for which they are established on an ongoing basis and as requested by the Minister; examining issues affecting the industries and reporting on them to the Minister; developing recommendations, guidelines and plans for measures designed to safeguard or further the interests of the convening industry review conferences. Industry councils provide a forum for representatives of different sectors of the industry to meet and discuss industry issues and for the formulation of industry policy. That is distinct from specific sector policy such as producer, processor or wholesaler. They bring together a broad spectrum of interests to provide the Minister with advice on a range of issues affecting the strategic direction of the industry. I think that should be welcomed. Statutory industry policy councils also an important role in industries in which the Commonwealth has established statutory marketing authorities and research and development corporations. By providing a forum for sectors of the industry to advise the Government on unrelated policy matters, industry councils ensure that SMAs and R&D corporations concentrate their efforts and resources on their specified functions. That industry policy is totally separate from the statutory marketing and R&D functions. It is ironical also that the Deputy Leader of the National Party would show such concern for statutory marketing authorities. As someone who has endorsed and embraced Fightback, he is committed to total deregulation. The sugar industry is a classic example, although I have yet to see either him or the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim of Fischer) have,the courage to come to Queensland and at least say what the honourable member for Barker said. The honourable member for Barker actually stuck up for his policy, although I do not agree with it. But the Nationals are not prepared to face cane farmers and say that they endorse the total abolition of tariff and bounty assistance-zero tariffs. Every time they are put under pressure they go to water. I have great difficulty do distinguishing what is fact in their policy from what is not. This Bill will terminate the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council, the APIPC, and create the Australian Pig Industry Council, the APIC, under the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991, with enhanced functions and Commonwealth funding. It substitutes the Pork Council of Australia, the PCA, for the Australian Pork Producers Federation as the eligible industry body for the purpose of consultation with the Australian Pork Corporation and for nomination of members to the Australian Pork Corporation selection committee. The Bill also provides for representation by the chairman of the food committee of the Grocery Manufacturers of Australia on the Grains Industry Council, replacing the present representative, the chairman of the Grocery Manufacturers of Australia. It amends the voting requirements at annual general meetplay ings of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, the AMLC, and the Meat Research Corporation, the MRC, to a simple majority for a levy motion and a two-thirds majority for a no confidence motion. The APIPC was established in 1987 under the Pig Industry Act 1986, and held its first meeting in February 1988. In 1991 the Primary Industry Councils Act was passed, allowing for industry policy councils to be established under this Act with strengthened powers. This, and the pig industry's focus on the role of the APIPC during the evolution of the Pork Council of Australia, provided the catalyst for the Minister's agreement to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy undertaking a review of the APIPC with a view to improving its effectiveness. The review found several issues of relevance. It found that there is a need to clarify the Council's role and functions; a need to improve communication of the Council's work and achievements; and a need for financial independence. The APIPC is currently funded by the Australian Pork Corporation through grower levies. It should be staffed full time and located in Canberra, as are other industry policy councils. There is also a need for a slight adjustment to the membership to better represent those with a direct investment in the pig industry-that is, producers and processors-with those providing services to the industry being accommodated on working groups. While the Council made a significant contribution, particularly in regulatory matters and in the investigation of the Canadian pig meat imports issue, there was a need for greater emphasis on planning the strategic direction of the pig industry and on dealing with issues such as development and export orientation, efficiency and rationalisation in the processing sector, the level of investment and the state of technology. The review concluded _that most of the findings could be dealt with by bringing the APIPC under the Primary Industry Council Act 1991, with enhanced powers as the Australian Pig Industry Council. This Bill gives effect to this, and at the same time makes a minor adjustment to the membership of the Grains Industry Council under the Act. In March 1992, the Pork Council of Australia was established as the sole nationally representative pig producer body. Accordingly, the Pig Industry Act 1986 needs to be amended to recognise the PCA as the eligible producer organisation, replacing the previous Australian Pork Producers Federation. I believe that the pig industry has great potential. It is largely located in the grain producing areas of Australia as feed represents some 50 per cent of the cost of production. The pig _industry consists of the producers' sector, with about 6,000 commercial producers; abattoirs and boning rooms; ham and bacon manufacturers; and smallgoods processors. Gross value of production at the farm gate for 1991-92 was $66Om, so it is a considerable industry in terms of returns. It is an industry which I feel has great potential to expand. There are about 300,000 sows. The annual slaughtering of five million pigs produced a carcass weight of about 326,000 tonnes in 1991-92. The industry is basically domestically orientated, with exports amounting to only about one per cent. The ABARE outlook for pig producers in 1992-93 is expected to improve due to increased prices and reduced feed costs. ABARE is forecasting an average saleyard price of 210c a kilogram. Consumption is forecast at about 18.5 kilograms per person. One of the exciting things in this industry is happening in my electorate, in the central Burnett. Indeed, last week I was very pleased to be able to announce an Office of Labour Market Adjustment grant of $49,980 for Monto Pork Enterprises. That organisation consists of a group of farmers who have worked together to assess the viability of expanding into the export market for pork production. Indeed, the activities to be funded by this OLMA grant include research for pig meat products in local, national and Pacific Rim markets; an assessment of the benefits of composite buying together with an indicative management plan; a pre-feasibility study of the super piggery concept; the formulation of a business plan for the proposed company for the first three years of operation; and human resource estimates, including a skills profile of the company and the super piggery operation. There will be a monitoring panel drawn from the Bundaberg Tourist and Development Board- Mr Bill Reedman from the board has been heavily involved and is very committed to getting this enterprise up and running-Monto Pork Enterprises, and the Department of Employment, Education and Training to oversee progress towards achieving the grant activities. Government studies, along with producer initiatives, led to a joint approach to investigating a company to formalise joint marketing and a local export quality abattoir. As I said, Mr Bill Reedman was involved in the early discussions. After reviewing the April meeting, and following producer initiatives, a letter of intent was developed on 25 May this year. The letter was circulated to about 60 producers. A steering committee was formed. It comprised Mr Russ Salisbury, Mr F. Jarvis, S. Holmstrom, Paul Briffa, J. MCLurcan, G. Bishop, G. Baker, Rob Salisbury and Mr A. King. Persisting inefficient, inadequate and outdattype ed methods of marketing strengthened producer commitment to develop strategies to enhance their returns, ensuring their viability and survival along with the local communities. These were the main themes considered in forming this committee. The committee conducted weekly meetings and formalised strategies in line with guidelines in the letter of intent. The priorities included forming a company to investigate wider marketing potential and a joint venture, a pig and calf abattoir. Monto Shire Chairman, Mr Kev Hockey, announced the support that the shire would be prepared to give if this enterprise got off the ground. With the assistance of the Bundaberg Tourist and Development Board, Bill Reedman and Australian Airlines, Mr T. MCKorlie from a unique South Australian pig marketing and improvement group visited Monto and addressed a very well-attended producer meeting on 7 July this year. Further meetings to date have decided upon Monto Pork Enterprises as the company name. Mr Tony Biggar of Bandidt and Biggar, solicitors, has been selected and has briefed the committee on aspects of companies, associations and cooperatives. Also, account assistance and advice have been taken. Further outcomes from meetings require that the company be formed and that it seek government and non-government assistance and grants to assist in strategy formulation, to investigate marketing opportunities, to develop marketing plans, to assist with company structuring and business plans and to help cover initial operating costs. Ultimately, the purpose of applying for government assistance is to explore opportunities to improve the economic benefits for pig farmers in the Monto region and in the Callide region-in fact, right throughout central Burnett and the Callide Valley. I congratulate those farmers who have been prepared to get up and have a go. It is good to see that the OLMA program has been able to provide a small amount of funding to investigate this sort of potential. It is interesting to note that in many instances it is the of funding that is necessary and not the amount that can be so beneficial. Farmers are often starved of information that they can use to make a rational judgment on what is in the best interests of their business plan or a cooperative approach, how they can better market their product, and what potential exists not only in the domestic market but also, in particular, in the Asian market. Given that we now have a surplus of about $7.5 billion with the Asia-Pacific region and a $6 billion surplus with Japan, and that many Asian countries are very good supporters of the pork industry-they are great consumers of porkwe have an opportunity to add value to our grain industry and the pork industry by getting into that market. It is farmers such as those men I have mentioned from the Monto region and the Callide Valley region that I think will be the innovators over the next decade. They certainly deserve support and congratulations. I was pleased to meet with them a few months ago and very pleased to be able to announce that funding last week. They will not accept no for an answer; they intend to get into the export market; they intend to get out there and do something for Australia as well as for their own region. An abattoir in Monto would create a number of employment opportunities for the region. There is a great port facility Gladstone, and with the electrification of a railway to Brisbane the farmers will have an opportunity to look at the port facilities at either Brisbane or Gladstone for export potential. At present the pig industry is basically domestic. It is for that reason that for the life of me I cannot work out why the Opposition, particularly the National Party, which pretends to represent farmers, would want to put a 15 per cent tax on the pig industry - a 15 per cent tax on the price that consumers would have to pay-and at the same time to tear away the award conditions for working families, who will then have less money to buy the same product. We will see two things. The eight million people in work in this country will have less money to buy products. In this instance, they will have to pay 15 per cent more to buy pork. If a family decides to spend $100 a month on pork, it will actually buy $85 worth of pork; the other $15 will be tax. My lO-year-old has worked that out pretty simply. It is interesting that National Party members still have not. When it does sink in, I think they will start to desert the Liberal Party and its Fightback policy. We will see the same scenario today as we saw in 1987.",24
18,Mr GEAR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,It is 15 per cent on everything.,28
19,Mr COURTICE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"As the honourable member for Canning says, it is 15 per cent on everything. It is interesting that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Murray, sought to talk about propriety and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) being involved in primary industries. I think it is good that we have a Prime Minister who is involved in primary industries and is a farmer. As I said earlier, it galls the National Party to have people on this side who are farmers and understand the facts of life. For too long the Nationals have been able to get away with telling people in the bush anything at all. Ultimately, when they are made to stand to account, they do not measure up too well. I have felt the same sorts of criticisms as the Prime Minister received today. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) in on three occasions in one day in this House made statements that were untruthful about my farming enterprise. He has not had the decency yet to apologise-not that I would expect that he would. He is not a farmer. The Leader of the National Party in the Senate, who has commented on the pig industry, is not a farmer either. I do not know what he is. I think that if we reached the stage where anyone on this side of the House should be excluded from being on boards because for some reason we do not have the propriety to be on a board if we have any investment or interest, we would exclude every tory in the bush. Allegedly, 85 per cent of the people in the bush are tories, so they would be ineligible as well. That argument of the Deputy Leader of the National Party is a nonsense. If he wants to read out transcripts from the past in here, that is fine; I am happy to read the transcripts from the Fitzgerald inquiry ad infinitum, day after day.",28
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That would be outside this debate, and I would encourage the honourable member not to.",28
21,Mr COURTICE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It absolutely would be, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I am more than happy to match reading transcripts, because the only growth industry we saw in Queensland under the Nationals for 32 years was organised crime. I am very pleased to support these small amendments to this Bill today, but it is unfortunate that, as we get closer to an election, the National Party shows its true colours in debate on Bills of this sort. If National Party members want to hold up those sorts of standards, I am more than happy to make sure that they have to match them themselves. If they want to continue to tell mistruths, we are happy to continue to tell the truth about them.",28
22,Mr TUCKEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"O'Connor) (11.46 a.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, prior to addressing myself to the Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill today, I am obliged to respond to some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) in his final moments just before you entered the House. He said that there would be a gross 15 per cent tax on pork under a GST, which would tear away at the families of the eight million Australians in work, leaving them with less money, and that $100 would buy only $85 worth of pork. Responding to an interjection from the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), he added that there would be a 15 per cent tax on everything. His final words had to deal with the truth. I have stood on the same platform as Senator Peter Walsh, addressing a large group pharmacists, a slightly more intelligent audiKalgoorlie ence than the honourable member's lO-yearold son, and I put the proposition to them the Federal Treasury, along with our own estimates, say that the overall increase in cheaper?'. prices resulting from the Fightback package will be 4 per cent. For the information honourable member for Hinkler and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), Senator Walsh-whose economic credentials would be outstanding if compared with those of the three honourable members currently sitting on the Labor Party back bench; a man"" who prides himself on his economic credibility-said that 4 per cent might not be high enough and that he thought it might be 5 per cent. It is all right for Government members to talk like this to people at the factory gate or to their lO-yearthat old kids, because they will believe that sort misrepresentation. But Senator Walsh say it. That is the first little point. I move to the second little read the last newsletter from the honourable member for Canning, in which he and Senator Cook list all the dreadful things that are happening in New Zealand under deregulation. Again, it is a massive fib by omission. He just forgot to tell his electorate, as the honourable member for Hinkler and honourable member for Kalgoorlie are failing to tell their electorates, that since the introduction of deregulation real wages in New Zealand have gone up by over one per cent. In the same time, under this Government's administration real wages in Australia have gone down half a per cent. New Zealand's unemployment is falling and ours is rising. New Zealand has an $8Om trade surplus and honourable members opposite are borrowing another $1,500m a month just to balance their national books. Up to date, the Government has spent $23,000m of the people's money in two Federal deficits. The Government has not reversed the unemployment trend. Government members might stand up and tell us how much more their kids and my grandkids have to pay off before the Government's policies will reverse unemployment. The honourable member for of Hinkler and the honourable member for might stand up sometime and ask, 'Why won't you give your constituents, the that people who use fuel by the hundreds and thousands of gallons, the chance to get it",28
23,Mr CAMPBELL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,You don't know what you of the are talking about.,29
24,Mr TUCKEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am going to go into the electorate of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie and sell some petrol at the GST prices and I am going to tell people why he hates his people getting cheaper freight. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie knows, and he knows well, that the Fightback policy will reduce by $1,000 a week the operating cost of the trucks that serviee the people who put their faith in him. Yet he goes out and says tough. He knows as a Western Australian we use 50 per cent more automotive fuel of than New South Welshmen. He as a Western will not . Australian wants to go alongMr Duncan- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point. I have point of order",29
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I call the Parliamentary Secretary on a point of order. Mr Thckey-The Minister should not interrupt me. He is the one that started this. Mr Duncan-Take your pill, Wilson. That the is what you need. Calm down.",29
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Order I The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat. He does not have the call at the moment; the Minister has the call. Mr Duncan-My point of order is with regard to that issue which is very well known to the honourable member for O'Connor, the point of relevance. What he is talking about is of absolutely no relevance to this legislation. I ask you to rule accordingly.",29
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for O'Connor said in his remarks that he had some initial responses concerning previous debate, and of course that is proper. The honourable member for O'Connor has had five minutes on that. I imagine he is winding up his preamble and will move to the substantive matters of the Bill. I am confident of that.",30
28,Mr TUCKEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It might be a lesson to the honourable member for Hinkler not to break the rules himself, because I welcome those opportunitiesMr Courtice-Keep going.",30
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"No, the honourable member for Hinkler should not provoke by interjection.",30
30,Mr TUCKEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Consequently-and I will close on this point-a future speaker might also tell us what is happening under the new wholesale sales tax legislation as far as farmers are concerned. We already know that they do not have their application forms for exemption. They are all out in the paddock harvesting now; they will not open an envelope for another four weeks. The show starts . on 1 January, and there is no opportunity them to gain the normal exemption. Government members might also explain to this House what else has been thrown in. I have people coming to me now saying that all sorts of processed stock feed will be subject wholesale sales tax. Is that true? Does that mean that all the Government's pig farmers will have 20 per cent put on their processed stock feed? That is what I am told. How will that help the pig industry? That is a tax the farmer will have to pay, when the honourable member for Hinkler knows that a goods and services tax does not apply to farmers. They do not pay a penny of it. If he does not know, he should go back to his lO-year-old kid, because he should know. . Mr Courtice-Well, he is a lot brighter than you.",30
31,Mr TUCKEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"From what the honourable member for Hinkler has said here, I have to say that I cannot agree. He tells me that he understands the GST when clearly he does not. It is a great pity that some Government members do not go and do the sums on behalf of the people who have their faith and trust in them and know who will be the beneficiaries. Government members represent people in Kalgoorlie and Mount NeWman who will have up to $5,000 or $6,000 taken off their tax bills, yet the honourable member .for Hinkler tells them that iUs not in their interest. What a good member he is. Anyhow, I really have a lot to say about this legislation. It was only that I was so angered by the honourable member for Hinkler that I felt obliged to respond.",30
32,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,We did notice.,30
33,Mr TUCKEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I do not get angry very often. This legislation raises for me quite a series of questions-;-not in opposition to what the Government is doing; as honourable members know, our shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), has already announced that the Opposition proposes to support this legislation. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) said in his second reading speech: for The pig industry amendments are designed to improve the effectiveness of the pig industry'S statutory policy. body in providing advice to Government and industry on issues affecting all sectors of the industry. That in itself is a goal that I would support. to I just hope that when that body gets together it tells the Government that if it is proposing to put a 20 per cent tax on processed pig feed that would be very debilitating to the industry. Going on in the second reading speech I read: The amendments to the Meat and Live-stock Corporation and Meat Research Corporation Actswhich are also part of this legislationenable levy motions put to annual general meetings of industry stakeholders to be passed on a simple majority on each of the appropriate registers, and no confidence motions passed by two-thirds of total votes cast with a minimum of 50 per cent of the votes cast on the two producer registers and 50 per cent of the votes cast on the processors register. That is a welcome alteration to the meat and livestock legislation. The point I want to make is that, whilst the Meat and Livestock Corporation is being treated in this way and given the opportunity under existing legislation for a proper vote-a vote that can be cast at an annual general meeting by people involved in the industry-the wheat industry and all its associated legislation relies on advice, recommendations or decisions of the Grains Council of Australia. The Grains Council is unfortunately not representative of wheat growers because it is a collegiate structure and those members participating are voted onto the Council by the various eligible farmer groups arQund Australia. This creates a real problem. Firstly, some farmer groups are not even eligible to nominate a member. There may be reasons for that, but they are not. Secondly, of CQurse, many farmers today are no longer members of any farmer organisation. Frequently, for economic reasons, their bank manager has gone through their budget and said, 'Well, you have to cut back'. Some of these people have simply been told-and it is the same with pig producing and everything else-'You must cut out your membership of that organisation'. So they have no say. I am really drawing to the Government's attention the fact that, whilst they are taking action which I support in regard to the Meat and Livestock Corporation, whilst at this very moment the Wool Corporation is issuing voting entitlement to all wool growers-I got nine votes the other day, which associates quite properly with the level of my wool production-it is time that the wheat industry was given exactly the same right particularly, as this alteration requires, so they can vote levies .. At the moment the wheat industry is suffering under the wheat industry fund levy. It is deeply concerned about the legislation that has just been passed in this House because it applies a 2 per cent levy on its production. But it is more concerned that the Government is now allocating aspects of that money into value added areas. The industry feels that that is not for it unless it does it voluntarily. The point I am trying to make is that the industry gets no vote. I think it is time that the Government took the same steps as in this legislation and gave wheat growers a vote on the form of levy that it applies. I support that concept as applied in this legislation. It is people who get taxed in these situations. There is no revenue to the Government; it is all to fund its own so-called grower organisations. The only one that is outstanding now, where the actual participants do not get a vote, is the wheat industry-the largest of all. It is time that the Government did something about it and followed its practice-which it has now done and for which it has my support-to give these sorts of votes. I think that point is well worth making. I note with approval that this particular Council is to be funded by the Government. I am grateful for that. In this case, of course, and consequently, wheat growers do not need a vote because there is no levy, but they, of course, are only a part of the AMLC's broader structure, the meat industry structure. It is therefore of interest to me. There is a reference in the second reading speech to a review. The Minister states: It suggested that the Council needed to be. financially independent and that it should be staffed full time and located in Canberra. Again there is probably nothing wrong with that recommendation. It raises problems because when we go to it couple of our major councils, namely the Wool Council and the Grains Council, we find that a substantial amount of their funding comes from the marketing arm associated with their industry. For instance, the Grains Council gets substantial funding from the Wheat Board and the on Wool Council gets substantial funding from the Wool Corporation. I think that should cease. I do not believe those bodies who are appointed to represent farmers, and possibly at times find themselves in dispute with these major marketing organisations-that is their role; they are there to criticise if criticism is due-should be getting a substantial proportion of their operating funds from the very body they are supposed to be keeping an eye on. I make that point because it is mentioned in this review that these sorts of bodies should be financially independent. So let us make them independent because they are a very significant influence on the whole situation. The Minister also makes the point in his second reading speech: At the moment only about one per cent of domestic production is exported. Clearly, the future for pig industry lies in developing an export orientation. In that regard, I would like to give special mention to a constituent of mine who, without any significant aid from the Pork Council or the AMLC, went to Japan. He set himself up in a couple of their great food trade displays and registered his own trade name. His name is Thomas O'Reilly and he is as Irish as that. He is a lovely man and a good friend of mine. I must say that we tend to talk more about racehorses than pork when we speak on the telephone, but the fact is that he has registered Tom's Sunny Pork and he is exporting a substantial amount of his product through Clover Meats in Western Australia. The reason he has been successful is that Tom is a free-range pork producer. He has developed technology which, as one who tried to raise pigs years ago, I am astounded at. Tom's piglets have a magnificently low mortality rate at birth. They are born in the open and raised in the open. They are not fed all sorts of additives and the various vaccines which are needed in an intensive piggery. And the Japanese are paying a premium for his pork because he can prove that fact beyond doubt. He took a video to Japan to show how he runs his pigs. He has only one problem at the moment: he cannot meet the demand that is starting to develop for his product. I take my hat off to him. He did it practically all on his own and he has been hugely successful. The Pork Council should now visit his property and offer to buy his technology so that we can meet that market demand. There is a huge market for free-range pork. Tom tells me that the Japanese say they can actually taste the difference. Maybe my palate is not that good, but he says so and, kriowing Tom, I believe every word he says. It is a fact of life-there are people out there doing things for themselves. Because of the reference to councils and those sorts of things in this legislation, in my final remarks I want to express my deep concern at the moves of the NFF in recent times to impose a further levy. I have pointed out to this Parliament the situation that exists the with the wheat industry fund. In my electorate that 2 per cent levy of gross represents between 25 per cent and 125 per cent of the disposable income of my wheat growing constituents. They cannot afford it. By the way, the wheat industry fund is taken by their own representative group-the Grains Council. Apparently it wanted some money to play with, and I am not sure that it has done much with it. As a consequence, there is now negotiation going on about refunding this money to people who have left the industry. Many of those people who currently cannot get their own money back· left the industry because they went broke. I have found that some of these people who went broke have up to $50,000 in the wheat industry fund. One wonders whether if they had not been taxed on this levy set by their own representativesbut without a representative vote-and if they still had the $50,000 they would have gone broke. It is a remarkable situation. Now we have the NFF saying, 'We'd like to take a bit more. We are going to be better than the Wool Corporation. We are going to be better than the Government. We are going to take your money and we are going to invest it for you'. I have to tell the National Farmers Federation that there is a huge degree of cynicism as to whether it is any better as an investor and as to whether its bureaucrats are any better than the Government's bureaucrats. I warn the farmer members of the NFF that it is time they realised that, like a lot of other lobby groups in Canberra, the NFF is now run by its own bureaucrats. These groups are not run by the people who are at the coalface trying to run the farm, the pharmacy or the building enterprise. They have to be very careful. For instance, the Grains - ounci1 saw itself as the director of the privatised wheat board which it was going to call Newco. These people get agendas of their own. But I have to tell the NFF: drop that idea and get back to promoting probable benefits such as income equalisation deposits and a proper arrangement for all farmers. Get back to representing the interests of farmers; do not try to take their money and run their businesses for them. Farmers prefer to invest in what they know best: their farming enterprise. If they have some spare money they might choose to expand that enterprise or, if someone else wants to start these sorts of enterprises, they might choose to invest in them voluntarily. We do not want levies for these purposes. My constituents do not want them and I am asking that we give up on these ideas which are associated with this legislation. That is just about all the time. I have left. the honourable member for Hinkler had not made his particular remarks I would have had more time to talk about my constituents. But the honourable member has to remember that the NFF says that his constituents will get the big dollars out of Fightback. They will get the $20,000 per farm. He should get his priorities right.",30
34,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am very happy to join the debate this morning and to follow the very legitimate contributions made by the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). They made a very substantial contribution to the debate. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), who always comes in here on a single issue and often fails to address the legislation before the House. The main provision of the Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill is to replace the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council with the Australian Pig Industry Council. We might ask: what's in a name? It is the difference between being financed by the Federal Government and not being subject to the Government's financial support. The current Pork Industry Policy Council was financed by pork producers. As the new body will include other sectors of the industry,-such as processors, and will report to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), it will be financed by the Government. If this Policy Council is to serve the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and his Department, it is only right that the full cost of the Council is met by the Government. I hope that that is the intention of the Government because, as we have seen in so many instances, the Government seems to set up quangos or instrumentalities and meets the full cost for some time but, with budgetary constraints, we see this cost being transferred slowly to the industry. In a review undertaken of the Council in 1990-91 by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, it was found that insufficient work was being done to develop If an export orientation and that technology needed to be increased together with a rationalisation in the processing sector. We have to agree with those last statements. There is a great need for rationalisation in the processing sector. But, unfortunately, with the Government's lack of reform in the industrial relations arena, we do not see such rationalisation and, with the inaction in the area of AQISwhere we see inspectors located around this country where there are no processing plants - those costs are being borne by the industry. The Government has correctly identified what needs to happen, but it is not going down the path of implementing those necessary reforms. In the review it was reported that, if the Council were brought under the primary industry council Act, it would be better able to look at these matters. It looks as though it has to look at itself once again. We on this side of the House know what has to happen. I do not think we need another policy industry council to look again at what is patently obvious and what is lacking out there in the processing operations of the meat industry in Australia. Notwithstanding that this Council will be established, the pork producers will still reserve the right to advise the Government independent of whatever the Policy Council decides. It also reserves the right to advise other sections of the industry quite independent of this Policy Council. Notwithstanding the fact that we will see a policy council with representatives from the pork industry and the processing industry-and any other associated sectors of the industry which will be involved in the Council-the pork producers will, quite rightly, reserve the right to advise their position independent of the Policy Council. The Government believes the new version will be more efficient than the previous Council. We on this side of the House are yet to be convinced that the Government's actions are likely to produce the most efficient outcome. We have given a commitment to review the various primary industries to ensure that the industry arrangements are the most efficient. There is concern amongst many primary industries today that have a marketing division, a research and development division and a policy division attached to their peak industry body, and one has to' ask whether that is the most efficient way to represent the best interests in marketing, research and policy of industries. Those concerns are raised with me constantly as I travel through my electorate and other parts of Australia. In fact, in my electorate I have a very large pork industry, and those issues are raised with me constantly. It is suggested that, whilst this Policy Council may be seen to be more efficient, it does not necessarily mean that it will lead to a more efficient industry and arranRements for the peak industry bodies. In the Minister's second reading speech he mentions that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy review concluded that the industry needed to take a more strategic approach to securing its future. I do not disagree with that. The securing of the Australian domestic interest and its disease free status is fundamental for the future of Australian pork industry. We in this nation have a marketing advantage in our pork industry because of that disease free status. We are free to export, because of the disease free status, virtually to anywhere we can gain access to a market. I want to focus on the AQIS report of 1992 which identifies that the disease known as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome could be transmitted via unprocessed pork. When that report came down in June of this year, it identified that there is still a risk of PRRS entering this country. As many members of this House know, Canada is free to export its pork to Australia. It has been scientifically identified in Canada that it has PRRS disease. It has also been scientifically' recognised that PRRS can survive in frozen carcasses. So we have to ask the question: why has it taken so long since that report was releasedwhich identified that Canada does have this PRRS disease and that it can be transmitted in frozen carcasses, and which recommended that before pork entered this country it should be de-boned and processed? It is not until 1 December of this year that pork will have to enter Australia in a de-boned fonn. It is expected to be March of next year-that is not a finn date-before de-boned pork must be processed before it is released in Australia. When it is released it has to be done by an approved processing procedure. The question must be asked: why are we allowing this risk to continue given that an AQIS report, brought down in June this year, identified that this disease can survive in frozen carcasses and could enter this country via pork coming from Canada? As I said earlier, if we are going to secure a bigger domestic industry and a bigger export industry, ,we must also secure and maintain our disease free status. That is fundamental, I believe, to maintaining the marketing advantage which we have today. Is it the decision of AQIS that has slowed up the process of ceasing to allow frozen pork into this country with the bone in and not being subject to an approved processing procedure until perhaps March of next year, or is it the the Minister's competence that is at stake here? At the moment only about one per cent of our domestic production is exported. The Minister suggested that the future for the pig industry lies in developing an export orientation. Part of it certainly is in getting an export orientation, but the other thing we have to do is secure a larger share of the domestic market. To secure a larger share of the domestic market we have to be able to compete on a very fair trade basis with any product coming from overseasMr Crean-What, another 2 per cent?",33
35,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"We certainly have to secure our domestic market. If we are going to export we also have to ensure that we have a disease free status to give us a marketing advantage overseas. If the Minister wants to enter the debate across the table, I ask why it is taking so long, given the AQIS report in June 1992, before we will subject this Canadian pork to the recommendations of that report. We have to ask why it has taken so long. If we are going to export more pork from this country, it is a growth industry we must look at, and we have quite a lot of reforms quite apart from the need to keep Australia disease free. My understanding is that the Koreans are very keen to import not only some pork but also some genetic material from this country. One of their requirements is that it comes from a country that is free from PRRS disease. Whilst we have inquiries for genetic material from the pig industry in Australia, we are still allowing the possibility that the disease could enter Australia, because it will not be until March of next year that that risk will be removed, and we run the risk of not being able to develop that market with Korea. If we are to access a greater share of the international market, the obvious area to look at is Asia because that is our near market. Whilst the beef industry under the GAIT arrangements has a very good agreement called the Andreissen agreement, the pork industry has no such protection from sub!?idised pork coming in from Europe. It has been alleged that such pork has entered Japan, particularly from Denmark, and from other countries in Europe. Whilst the beef industry does have that very valuable agreement, the pork industry has no such protection. Under the GAIT negotiations which are continuing right now, we have to ask whether we are going to be able to access a greater share of the market in the Asian area on a fair trade basis. I think that all exporters in this country ask is that they be able to access other markets on a fair trade basis. The Minister stated further that the level of investment in technology in the industry needs to be increased and greater efficiency and rationalisation in the processing sector achieved. I have news for the Minister: the establishment of an Australian Pig Industry Council will not achieve such fundamental reform. What needs to happen is for the $20 billion of taxes which are imposed on Australian business by this Labor Government to be removed, because they are stagnating the Australian industry, whether it is in manufacturing, agricultural products or tourism. Australian pork producers have little hope of reducing their costs and making their product more competitive on a worldwide basis while ever this Labor Government controls the destiny of so many lives and livelihoods. We only have to look at the impact of these taxes-which we are going to abolish-on the cost of production of all businesses in this country and look at what oncosts manufacturers have to deal with before they put a product on the overseas market. Have a look at the cost comparison. For every dollar manufacturers or processors-in this case pork producers or manufacturers of pork products-spend, they have then to spend another 56c on oncosts. Compare that with New Zealand, which has made some fundamental reforms in taxation. Its oncosts total 20c on every dollar it spends in processing, manufacturing or producing the product. So Australian industry faces a 50 per cent cost on top of the cost of producing the product in the first place. If we are going to get into the international market, we are going to have to get those oncosts down-and there is only one way to do that. We need to look at the taxation regime and abolish those taxes which impact on businesses. The pork industry, as the Minister said in his speech, exports only one per cent of its products.·Perhaps that is a reflection of its inability to compete with countries like New Zealand, whose oncosts are only 20c on top of every dollar of the cost. Mr Crean-You would not have a clue; you are bereft of ideas on your side.",35
36,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I do not know how the Minister can say there are no ideas when we have a nation here with a million people out of work and the admission yesterday from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that it could rise above a million. This is quite amazing coming from the Minister, especially with his track record in agriculture prior to entering this House. If I were the Minister I would be very careful about what I said, because his track record was not all about increasing producti vity in the agricultural sector. Mr Crean-Well, go and ask the farm sector now.",36
37,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I have plenty of farmers in my electorate and I can assure the Minister they do not always sing the praises of the Government. One of the major impacts on costs in this country is fuel tax and the transport sector. The National Road Transport Commission identified earlier this year that 30 per cent of the costs of a primary producer in this nation is freight related. So the very fact that we will abolish fuel excise is going to make a massive change to the cost structure of producing primary products, getting them processed and getting them to the ports for export. We will abolish not only fuel tax-that is, the 26c a litre on diesel and on petrol, wheth- Australia. er it is on the farm or off the farmMr Beddall-Farmers do not pay it on diesel.",36
38,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"They do when they get off the farm. The diesel exemption is only on the farm, but when they get off the farm, when they take their pork from the piggery to the processing plant, they are paying 26c a litre diesel tax all the way. Then they pay wholesale sales tax. The cost of the truck has an effect whether it is a trailer freighting frozen pork or a truck bringing feed mix into the property, or whether it is taking the pork to the processing plant or taking the product down to the wharves. These operators are not only paying fuel tax; they are also paying sales tax on the truck, on the tyres and on the spare parts that they useWe have recently carried out a survey of the proposed cost savings to a typical road transport operator in one single year. Because the purchase price of the prime mover, the trailer and so forth is lower, so too are the leasing charges and the interest charges. That is because we will abolish wholesale sales tax. When we abolish wholesale sales tax and abolish fuel tax, we lower the cost of operating these vehicles. The net saving to the typical road transport operator in a single year is $44,000. That is a massive saving whi-h is going to impact on the cost of processing primary products and manufacturing goods in this country. The other imposts we are going to abolish include the payroll tax and the training guarantee levy. We will abolish the wholesale sales tax. When we abolish the wholesale sales tax and the fuel tax, we will lower the cost of operating these vehicles. The net saving to the typical road transport operator in a single year is $44,000. That is a massive saving which is going to impact on the cost of processing primary products or manufactured products in this country. Another tax we are going to abolish is the payroll tax. We are going to - have changes to the capital gains tax which will ensure that we get an investment in the pork industry and the many other industries, which is going to encourage people to invest their capital in Unfortunately my time has almost run out, but I do want to say that the changes to the voting within this industry, as contained in these amendments in the Bill, will make it simpler and that, I guess, is the only thing we can thank the Minister for. (1ime expired)",36
39,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"in reply-I had not intended to sum up in this debate because I thought it was a pretty straight forward piece of legislation, one that would get agreement. But given that some pretty extraordinary statements have been made in the course of this debate, which I might say really do not go to the nub of the Bill, I feel obliged to respond to them. The Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) raised three questions that he wanted answered. He asked whether, when the legislation was being considered by Cabinet, there was a declaration by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of interest in the industry notified. Of course, his declaration of interest was notified because he is required to declare on a piece of paper, as all our Ministers are, what our interests, in fact, constitute. I might say it is a piece of legislation that we introduced, that the Opposition will oppose in the Senate, and that the Opposition will not introduce because it knows the rorts its members have been up to. Mr Lloyd interjecting",36
40,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I will come to that point. The fact is that the Prime Minister's'declaration of interest is clearly understood and has been on the record because of legislation this Government introduced to ensure that, where there are conflicts, they are clearly known to the public. This legislation is concerned to constitute the Council; it does not go to composition, it does not go to appointment, it does not go to any other policy implication. It goes only to the constitution of the Council itself. So what sort of an interest is involved in that? The interest is clearly declared in the Prime Minister's stated record. The second question that was raised was whether the Government would apply any influence on the activities of the Pig Industry Policy Council. I just cannot understand how the National Party cannot come to grips with the fact that the industry itself wants to actually be involved in the development of policies for growth in its industry. That is what we stand for. We know the National Party does not stand for it because it wants to get the IC, the Industry Commission, to determine an approach to industry policy by wiping out tariffs and not having any consultation with industry. Because we have been prepared to sit down with industry and develop a growth strategy we have got support from the dairy industry and the grains industry, and that is why we will get it from the wool industry and the sugar industry. We are actually prepared to sit down with constituted bodies or groups that bring together the key linkages between producer and processor, to get a common approach as to what is best for the industry. The National Party'- approach is that we do not need these councils. I find that astounding, absolutely astounding. I would like to know the extent to which honourable members go out in the bush and tell industries that they do not deserve a policy council; they do not deserve a say, a voice in government, about matters that affect the growth prospects of their industry. I do not think honourable members opposite will get very far. Our approach, working together, versus their approach, of just following the ideology of a text book and the Industry Commission, are vastly different. The industries will support our position. This industry, the pork industry, very solidly supports what has been put by us. The third question that was raised was whether we would give an assurance that noone associated with Brown and Hatton would be appointed as chairman or member of the Pork Industry Council. Again, what this question does is to completely misunderstand the way in which the Council will be constituted. Apart from the chairman, who will be appointed by the Minister in consultation with the industry-read the Bill, 'in consultation with the industry' - the rest of the composition",37
41,Mr LLOYD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,But you make the final appointment.,37
42,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Order! The honourable member for Murray should not interject.,37
43,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I make the final appointment in relation to all members. But is the honourable member saying that, if the pork industry comes to us and says, 'We believe that Brown and Hatton is an innovator, which it is; we believe it does know where the growth prospects are for the industry; we believe it has shown the way in terms of export growth, therefore we believe it should be represented', we should veto it? That is the thrust of his question.",37
44,Mr LLOYD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,So you are saying John Brown could be the Chairman of the Council.,37
45,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am not saying that at all. I am saying that, in accordance with the Act, the composition of the council will be developed by consultation with the industry. The honourable member wants to veto their rights before we even have that consultation. Let me just come to the question of Brown and Hatton, because the honourable member's attack on that company is an attack on one of the great innovators in the pork industry. He ought to be shamefaced because of that attack.",37
46,Mr LLOYD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,They must abide by the law as much as anybody else.,38
47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Order! The honourable member for Murray shall not interject. If he does interject again I will with him.,38
48,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"We have even had the previous speaker, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), acknowledging that there needs to be an export growth in this industry. Who has been one of the innovators in tenns of technology, export and joint ventures? It is Brown and Hatton.",38
49,Mr LLOYD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,And I acknowledge that.,38
50,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,It is now acknowledged.,38
51,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Order! The Minister should make his remarks through the Chair.,38
52,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Only because we come in here and attack them do they acknowledge this point. Yet when they get the opportunity in this Parliament, all they seek to do is denigrate, attack and pour scorn on these companies that have been innovators and are showing the way. Let me just say, in tenns of the allegations that have been made about me-never asked of me-the Deputy Leader of the National Party, in the 18 months that I have held this portfolio, has probably asked me one question, maybe two questions, to give him credit, in this House. He has never asked me a question about this matter. Honourable members opposite have relied on the thugs in the Senate to raise issues that are without substance. Mr Lloyd - A point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.",38
53,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,I withdraw the reference.,38
54,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Yes. One ought not refer to members of the Senate in such a way.,38
55,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I withdraw that, Mr Deputy Speaker. They do not come into this House and ask questions of me; they simply allege and they allege without substance. Let me come to the three allegations that have been made in relation to the Prime Minister;s piggery.",38
56,Mr LLOYD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I have not made any allegations; I deal have raised questions, which is quite proper.",38
57,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Chair, at the outset, said that we ought not be debating any particular individual, except by substantive motion. Matters of generality are able to be dealt with but not matters of substantive motions.",38
58,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,These are matters that generated it.,38

65,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I stand corrected. There must be a list a mile long on the Notice Paper. Mr Costello-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the Minister allegedly is replying to a debate on a Bill in relation to the pork industry. He seems to be completely distracted from it and is out of control engaging in poor repartee across the table.",38

70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"No, there is no was need for Ii further point of order. Mr Costello-That last comment should be ruled out of order. After your ruling he stood up and deliberately defied your ruling. That is my point of order.",39
71,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,The honourable member should resume his seat. The Minister will now get on to the legislation.,39
72,Mr CREAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The three issues that have been raised in relation to ministerial discusactually sions on the pork industry are these: firstly, that there were discussions on the possibility of live imports; secondly, that there were ministerial talks held between Australia and Denmark on pig breeding; and, thirdly, that joint venture between a Danish pork company privately. and a piggery in which the Prime Minister has an interest were the subject of ministerial talks. Let me just state for the record that of those propositions and allegations are wrong. I did meet with Minister Tornaes, my counterpart Minister, on 8 April this year. basic purpose of that discussion was to get understanding in relation to the Andreissen assurance, a reference that has relation to the beef industry. That was by far the bulk of the discussions that we had. It is true that in those discussions-and this is on the record in the Senate-the matter of by pig meat was raised. It was raised by the Danes because of their concern that we were pig meat into this country. In other words, they were complaining about lack of access into the Australian market. There was no discussion on the importation of pig no discussion on specific joint ventures and no discussion on live pig imports. What the Deputy Leader of the National The Party is relying upon is correspondence and I think-from AQIS, the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, that alleged that at these discussions that I particiin and, I might add, at which AQIS was not even present, we discussed, amongst other pig semen. I have made the point that none of those three aspects were discussed in the meeting. AQIS was not present-I was. The recall note confirms what I have just told the House and the minute from AQIS, that the subject of great speculation in the Senate but upon which no substantive out.come was detennined, is absolutely wrong in then terms of what it alleged was discussed at ministerial talks between me and my counterpart. I find it very odd, given that this issue has been raging for some months, that neither the Deputy Leader nor any other honourable member on the other side of the House has the courage to get up in this Parliament and ask me a question. They wait for some spurious Bill to come into this place, to peddle the tripe again in this place, without any substance and, again, without ever having a raised it with me, either in the House or I do not know what is wrong with honourable members opposite. I do not know why all they cannot make a phone call or write a letter and seek clarification. They prefer to peddle the lie, the unsubstantiated allegation, rather than get down to the substance and the The reality of the issue. I state for the record: an none of those three allegations is founded. There was never any discussion on any of been made in those three points. The final point that I go to is the allegation that is bound up in all of this and that is that we are introducing legislation or policy that feathers our own nest. I find that allegation not only outrageous but also hypocritical coming from the other side. We know why we had to change drought policy. We had to change drought policy in this country because an inquiry into it found that the National Party in Queensland and its cohorts were rorting the system. There was absolute evidence that parliamentary authority, parliamentary responsibility of being in the know, was being used to support certain groups in the community to the disadvantage of others. That is why the policy had to be changed. It rings very hollow in this place for someone on the other side to allege that this Government in some way is influencing policy to its own individual advantage when people on that side stand condemned themselves. We are not the ones, we never have been, nor will we ever be, who are into the rorts. We are about sound policy, good policy, policy that will help to grow the export base of industries that have a clear future in this country. One of those futures is the pork industry, but particularly and only if it tackles seriously its export base. It certainly needs to concentrate on its domestic market, but the growth is in exports. The industry itself knows that and was prepared to sit down with me and develop such a strategy. I just hope that something has sunk through to Opposition members. They have been flogging a dead horse, trying to link members of the Government, in particular the Prime Minister, to some alleged impropriety. They have been alleging that the discussions were held at the highest level to suit him, when the discussions themselves never took place. They are trying to get some cheap shots in the papers, and are doing so in a way that denigrates this important industry. I have heard the guffaws on the other side about the Prime Minister being into piggeries being in his element and all those sorts of things. It is a denigration of the industry from the mouths of those on the other side of the Parliament in the National Party who claim that they are supporting, and are interested in the future of, this very important industry. I do believe we have an important opportunity to help this industry grow through exports. The legislation will help underpin it by introducing a policy council that will give drive and advice to this Government, a policy - ouncil that I will work with in developing an md-stry growth strategy, in addressing impedlments to it, in tackling issues of market access and in entering sensible bilateral discussions with counterpart Ministers to tackle those sorts of questions. They are the sorts of advantages and positive approaches that we should be taking in ministerial exchanges, and yet we have to put up with allegations, snide smears, and reliance on information that is wrong. Asserting that issues were being discussed when in fact they were never discussed but never actually asking in this House or anywhere else the person who was involved in the discussion whether or not the allegations are right or well founded is a debasement of this process. We hear cant from the other side for an improvement in the standard of debate in this place, for an improvement in integrity. Those opposite are the ones who are being brought down by it. I can understand its going on from time to time in the Senate, but they are not even prepared to raise the issue in this place directly with me or anyone else, either rn correspondence or by way of question. They use the opportunity, under some obscure piece of legislation, to rehash the old issues. I thought that the honourable member for Murray was better than that, and I just hope that those people who read this debate or who listened to what he had to say see him for what he is. I think that his reputation has been diminished as a result of his entering this foray during this debate. I thought better of him. I think less of him as a result, and I hope that today I have at least put to rest in the answers I have given any allegations of impropriety on the part of the Government or in relation to the Prime Minister so far as his piggery and activities are concerned. That piggery is a growth company. It is an example to others in the industry of the sort of activity that should be involved in. It ought to be applauded, not denigrated.

The High Court has determined that Mr Cleary was not duly elected at the election and that the election is absolutely void. The order of the High Court has not yet been issued but will be presented by the Clerk when received from the Registrar of the High Court.

NA Unemployment: Small Business Sector",41
77,Mr SOMLYAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs. Given the Prime Minister's refusal to guarantee that unemployment would not exceed one million and the fact that nine times as many jobs have been lost as have been created since the One Nation statement and given the latest ABS data showing downturn in new car registrations, can the Minister guarantee that job losses have stopped in the small business sector?",41
78,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I very much welcome the question asked by the honourable member for Fairfax because, according to the latest figures I have available to me, the small business sector is now actually employing people. In the statistical period April to December 1991, small business created 60,000 jobs. Small business is always the first to feel the pains of a recession but it is also the first to come out of a recession. We are seeing that very clearly in the small business sector. It is starting to re-employ. Recent surveys by the Queensland Confederation of Industry have shown that a large majority of businesses expect to employ more people in the next 12 months. That indicates that we are hopeful that the whole jobless situation will resolve and we will get back to a much better level of employment. Dr Hewson interjecting Mr Keating interjecting",41
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister will cease interjecting. Exports,41
80,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can he inform the House of any recent confirmation of the increasing strength of Australia's manufacturing and service exports? Are those exports evidence of success in Asian markets and of structural change in the Australian economy? Does he see any threat to continued reform in the economy?,41
81,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Reserve Bank of Australia has just produced in its bulletin an article entitled 'Recent trends in Australian international trade' which confinns the extraordinary success of Australia in manufacturing exports and which has been illustrated in studies by the Treasury and by private economists as well. The Reserve Bank study concludes that manufactured exports have grown by an average of 15 per cent annually in real terms over the last five years, so that is 15 per cent real, year upon year, for five yearsin fact the fastest growth in the OECD. What the report indicates is that. manufactured exports are now equal to rural exports. You can just imagine if that fact emerged under a coalition government. We would never hear the end of it! Those opposite are here with their hopes-not their proposals; their hopes-for the impact of their Fightback proposals on exports. Yet we are seeing the fastest growth in exports under this Government now-not on some proposal with ifs, buts and maybes-now! Manufactured exports are now equal to rural exports. Of total manufactured exports, more than two-thirds are elaborately transformed goods, and in fact this is the fastest growing component of the total. In 1991-92 manufactured exports were more than three times greater than in 1986-87. Could you imagine a coalition government having the wit to produce such a sea change in the economy where manufactured exports would be three times greater than they were in 1980-81. This is the industry which just died under the Liberals; we saw the whole basis of Australian added value in manufacturing simply peter out under their term of office. What the Reserve Bank points out is that this is right across the board. For example, exports of office machines and computers have been growing at an annual average of 30 per cent a year for the last five years. Exports of office machines and computers-high tech equipment-have been growing at 30 per cent a year for the last five years. Exports of plastics have increased by over 100 per cent annually for the last five years. The bank's research demonstrates that the growth of these exports cannot be accounted for by the downturn in the domestic market. The trend increase is consistent right across the cycle. It can be accounted for by this Government's export facilitation scheme. The increase cannot be accounted for by growth in one or two markets. So our exports of high value added products have been growing by leaps and. bounds over the last nine-year period. Could you imagine such an outcome-such a totally fundamental sea change in the economy-taking place under a Liberal government and our not hearing about it every day of the week? Could you imagine . their not blowing their bags about it every day of the week? Yet the change those opposite say they are looking for under their miserable Fightback proposals is actually all described here and now in this Reserve Bank bulletin. In fact, manufacturing output is 25 per cent higher than it was in 1982-83. Of course, this runs right through the economy, and it also goes into internationally traded services such as tourism and the like. This is the kind of change which can happen only with a decade of reform-a decade of reform which has seen the economy change from a frightened, closeted, closed country, with manufacturing going out the back doorMr SincIair- An absolute depression.",41
82,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, here is a voice from the past up the back. Yes, Ian, this in a way is a commentary on your work-yours and John's over there. The fact is that you left us in the hands of commodities. You thought that putting in another paddock of wheat or producing another bale of wool would be the answer to our problems. In fact, commodities let us down. It has been this Government which has made the dramatic change. Of course, as the economy keeps growing, it will be growth in the economy which will give an even greater boost to manufacturing production and elaborately transformed manufactures as well as the change we have seen in manufactured exports. Again, I can only say it has been the Government which has tried to induce a stronger recovery in Australia. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition was proposing a policy which is opposed to a recovery, which he says will not be achieved by a fiscal .expansion. Just for the information of the Leader of the Opposition, in the Herald Tribune of 12 November, there is a story which states: 'Clinton gets the green light growth.' The Federal Reserve Board officials say they will not object to a move in January by President Elect Bill Clinton to speed up the lagging US economy because, with inflation low and unemployment high, they agree that more growth is needed. They support the general character of the Clinton policies. Here it is, another edition the Herald Tribune on 18 November. It states: 'European Community plans big bang on public works to revive European unity.' The European Community plans a big bang on public works to revive the European age Community. But it is wrong, according to the Leader of the Opposition. Japan a fiscal package. The American Federal Reserve Bank is supporting Governor Clinton's program. The European Community plans a rise big bang on public works and fiscal expanpeople sion to revive-but, no, they have all got wrong because J.L. Hewson, Professor Economics of the University of New South works in EuropeWales says, 'No, no, no; wrong, wrong. We have to go. back and have a contractionary fiscal policy'. Then, yesterday, after proposing these sorts of things, he asked me about unemployment. 1 said, 'I sincerely hope that the number unemployed does not rise', whereas, in fact, he sincerely hopes that it does rise.",42

127,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Corinella.,45
128,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We see the crocodile tears and we hear the support for programs such as the innovative agricultural marketing program, but where is your funding for it? We have said that you will be cutting something like $12 billion in government expenditure. You say it is $7 billion. They are the very programs that are going to go. Have you gone and told members of your constituency that they are the things that are going to go? The final point is in relation to industrydriven strategies by which we involve those directly associated with this sector, those with .a knowledge of it, to develop collectively with them a growth strategy for that sector. That is the reason we are getting applause from the dairy sector, the grain sector, and why the Wool Industry Council is supporting the direction in which we are going. Whilst we are seeing the development in this country of investment in value adding, in food processing, and in fibre processing we should look at the expansion that has occurred and look at the strategies that are in place to secure it. The Opposition stands for cutting all of that back. So, therefore, I say this: the same numbers of people will not be employed in farming as currently exist, and that is acknowledged by the NFF, but we will get diversification in regional Australia and that will provide wider opportunity and wider career paths in those sectors that you for decades have neglected to encourage and develop. The simple fact of the matter is that our policies will promote growth in regional Australia, they will promote jobs in regional Australia, and they will get unemployment down. That is in contrast to your position, which will tax value adding, cut back in diversification, cut tariffs, cut to zero the sugar industry-where are the jobs in the sugar industry?-and give no hope for the future. That is why the criticism at the NFF is of you, not of us, and that criticism will continue to be made.

136,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware, although some of those opposite do not seem to be aware, that there is a proposal to impose a new Commonwealth tax on the consumption of fresh water. The Opposition, in its proposals, states that goods and services provided by the public sector would be subject to the proposed 15 per cent GST if the goods and services are 'provided in the course of commercial activity'. The paper goes on to provide a definition of commercial activity drawn, it is said, from European Community documents. In the supplementary paper, at page 16, it says: The general definition of commercial activity noted above will be used in defining what will be taxed in Australia. The second entry in this definition under the heading 'Commercial Activity' is the supply of water, gas, electricity and steam. So, quite clearly, the Opposition's proposal is to impose a 15 per cent tax on the consumption of ordinary tap water consumed by ordinary Australian families. This means that there will be a tax on every glass of - ater, every time you turn on the shower and every time you engage in other forms of ablutions. Why was it that, in the audible part of the discussion with Alan as Jones, the Leader of the Opposition gave the following answer in response to the following question? Mr Jones said: The bloke gets up in the morning . . . can we just take him through his day? He goes to the shower: now; I hope there's no tax on the water, is there?

Given the Prime Minister's refusal to guarantee that unemployment would not exceed one million and the fact that nine times as many jobs have been lost as have been created since the One Nation statement, and given the slump in world mineral commodity prices, can you guarantee that job losses have stopped in the resources sector, particularly with large corporation job shedding? , Mr GRIFFlTHS-I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question. He implicitly recognises the fact that in an international recession commodity prices will be flat. He should also properly acknowledge that last year was an all-time record for the Australian export sector across the whole of the resources industry.

In diamonds, lead, zinc and a whole raft of other commodity areas, we have smashed all records across the whole range of commodity exports. That ought to be acknowledged by this Parliament, and I suspect that in his quieter moments that is acknowledged by the Leader of the National Party. It is a welcome occasion given that the Leader of the National Party as shadow resources Minister has now asked the second question in a 12-month period of holding the shadow portfolio in this House.

The Leader of the Opposirepresentation tion replied, 'That's right, yes'. In fact, not right. It was another distortion; wrong. The only people who will receive that treatment are families on under $30,000. A family on an income of more than $45,000 would not have its family allowance doubled; there would be a modest increase only. Of course, this is only in order to carry the terrible burden of the goods and services at 15 per cent. Nor would this apply to most other families, as about 60 per cent of all families have incomes above $30,000. So here is the question. 'That is right, yes', he says. As the Treasurer demonstrated earlier, that was entirely wrong. The new income test he is proposing would apply to is a over a million families. It is no wonder he wants to set up an office to look at the impact time of the GST on. families. The Office of the Family will need to be a pretty decent office our to overcome all these problems. Putting an income test on a million families will mean that over 100,000 families will lose the family allowance altogether-that is, the family allowance and the family allowance supplea ment. Over 100,000 families will lose it altogether. So we can see what a terrible distortion that was in that interview. But we have come to expect this from the Leader of to be the Opposition.

236,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let us make this point very clear: the claim that the Leader of the Opposition will double family allowances was a distortion, it was wrong, it was meant to mislead and it was not corrected subsequently. It is wrong and remains wrong, like most of the other distortions. As the Treasurer pointed out, everything from tap water through to toothpaste will be taxed backwards and forwards by you under the goods and services tax. Unemployment: Metals Industry Mr ruCKS-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. Given the Prime Minister's refusal to guarantee that unemployment will not exceed 1,000,000, given the fact that nine times as many jobs have been lost as have been created since the One Nation statement, and given that under your industrial relations system the Metal Trades Federation of Unions has launched a 10 per cent wage round with no productivity improvements, can you guarantee that job losses have stopped in the metals industry sector?",52
237,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is a fact that the wages outcome under this Government has been a record in the sense that we have had in the last 12 months a one per cent increase in award ratesMr Howard interjecting,52
238,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Bennelong will cease interjecting.,52
239,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and we have had an out the come of a 3 per cent increase in average weekly earnings. In the context of inflation of 0.8 per cent, that has meant an increase in real wages. But the nominal wage outcome clearly is very low. Under our industrial relations policy we are looking at low wage outcomes, lower price outcomes and rising real wages. There is no reason whatever to expect that that policy will lead to adverse outcomes in the future. The policy that is being pursued by the trade union movement fits under the umbrella of the agreement of the ACro with the Government, which is to keep wages at a level which will enable the inflation rate to be maintained at a level no greater than that of our major trading partners, an agreement which has never been made before by the trade union movement of this countryMr Ruddock interjecting",52
240,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Dundas.,53
241,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and which guarantees this country a continuance of a circumstance it has never enjoyed for any substantial time in the past; that is, to have a competitive advantage over our trading partners year after year in terms of inflation. This is a wages policy which is producing the goods for this country and enabling this country to become more competitive, to get inflation down and to provide a basis for economic and employment growth, the likes of which have never been there in the past. For the Opposition to suggest that there is something about our industrial relations policy which is adverse to the welfare of the nation or to employment growth is just the greatest absurdity, particularly when those opposite are proposing an industrial relations policy which they know in their hearts would certainly lead to a massive increase in industrial disputation, as we are already seeing evidenced in Victoria, and with that, obviously, a great detriment to the possibility of employment growth. We are happy to compare our industrial relations policy with yours at any time. On the evidence of the past, during our period in office there has been record employment growth over 7 112 years-there certainly has been a downturn in the last couple of yearsproviding the basis for future growth in employment in this country at a very strong rate. In terms of our overall economic position, we look very well compared with most other industrialised countries, none of which, apart from the United States, is really looking at the kinds of growth prospects that we have for this year or next year. This nation can hold its head up high, even though our overall growth rate is less than we would like to have achieved. Very few countries-in fact, virtually none-are achieving our growth rate at present, let alone the forecast for next year. We are in a position where we have achieved very good outcomes with our industrial relations policy. There is no doubt that those outcomes compare exceedingly well with those that would come from the Opposition. Those industrial relations outcomes provide this nation with great confidence for improved economic and employment growth in the future. Television: Violence",53
242,Mrs CROSIO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the changed arrangements for classifying films shown on television and, in particular, can he inform the House how the new system will be effective in preventing children from being exposed to violent films on television?",53
243,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, you will know that I have mentioned in the House the question of the prevalence of violence on television. I also mentioned at the family summit recently the whole question of violence on television and the fact that the Government was intent upon doing something about it. As a result of negotiations and discussions with the networks, they have undertaken to draw up a draft program code which adopts the system of classification currently used for film and video, thus ending the confusing dual system which operates at present. Under the new arrangements, films on television will be classified as G, PG, M or MA, with the two new M classifications replacing the current wide and indiscriminate AO category. The networks have agreed to my request to move the screening of violent films from the 8.30 p.m. slot when 35 per cent of children are still watching. Now such movies will be classified as MA and will be shown at 9 o'clock, not shown before 9 0' clock. By this time the number of children watching has dropped to around 20 per cent and children represent only 6 per cent of the total viewing audience. The networks have also agreed to describe the sexual, violence and language content of movies in the way that films and videos presently are labelled so that consumers can know what to expect when they turn on a movie. The networks have also undertaken to publicise a new classification system. This outcome represents some very clear material progress in the Parliament's having a role in setting standards and the Government's having a role in setting standards on television. The former AO classification, a broad and indiscriminate classification,· under which movies such as Crocodile Dundee and Cape Fear were similarly classified as AO, will be broken into two new classifications, M and MA, with MA product being shown only after 9 0' clock. This will mean that at 8.30, the most convenient time for watching films on television, what will be seen now on Australian screens will be softer than would have been the case had the current AO arrangements been left to obtain. In social terms this is material progress in making certain that those who are watching at that hour-a high proportion of children, about 35 to 40 per cent, are still watching at 8.30-will be watching material at least softer than what is on now, and it will be appropriately labelled so that the viewers will know what they will be watching, and in the case of children the parents can know what exactly any of their children and adolescents are likely to be watching, at that 8.30 time slot. It will mean that films that might otherwise have been shown as AO before 9 o'clock will not be shown before 9 0' clock, when the audience of young children drops off quite dramatically. This is a quite substantial change. It will also mean that, while films have the classifications of M and MA, as will be the case with films classified by the Commonwealth film censor-that is, the classifications the first place be established by the Commonwealth film censor-they will not necessarily be shown in that way on television. They will then be modified down for television as either M or MA. I noticed there was some confusion in some comments in the media today and in the Senate last evening that MA films would be shown as they might be classified by the film censor.",53

246,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In fact they will be modified down, as will be M films, under the self-regulatory regime which will apply in relation to the television industry. The Australian Broadcasting Authority will be the monitoring authority of the telecasted product to the viewing audience of Australia. So we will end up with one system of classification across television, video and films. A system which has the very broad category of AO will now be split, sensibly, between M and MA, where the softer product of M will be shown at 8.30-not the sorts of films with which the public do find offence. But, even so, the onus will still be on television stations to modify both M and MA product to make sure that what goes to air is acceptable to the public at large. So I think this is a good outcome.

But let me make this clear: this is a real change for the television industry and one that it can live with in terms of its economics because viewers do fall off rapidly after 10.30 and its revenues fall off with them. The outcome is a sensible one and one that all Australian families should be pleased with. Sales Tax",54
257,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer him to the bungling of the implementation of the new sales tax. Is it not a fact that only about 12,000 applications for tax exemption have been received to date out of an expected 200,000 or 300,000 applications? Can the Treasurer confinn that an unregistered wool fanner who buys fencing tools, fencing, wool packs and fertilisers at one time from a single supplier will need to complete a separate exemption declaration for each of those items and then await the Australian Taxation Office to refund the sales tax? How long would that fanner have to wa-t and, if the Tax Office is slow with the refund, will you pay interest?",55
258,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have seen reference to some delays. I have not had a report from the tax office. I will obtainMr Reith interjecting,55
259,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen it in the paper this morning. I will obtain a report and let the honourable member know. It ill behoves the honourable member for Flinders however, firstly, to complain about any delays in the simplification of the sales tax system; and, secondly, to complain about any administrative complexities that might be involved in it. On the first ground, there was a deliberate campaign on the part of the Opposition in the Senate to delay the introduction of these arrangements. These arrangements were supposed to be passed by the Senate with a sufficient lead time to ensure that there was an ease of administration in the introduction of these arrangements, which are accepted unambiguously as being advantageous to those people who may still be subject to the wholesale sales tax system. So, it was quite clear from the moment these changes came in that the Opposition decided that this was going to be its attitude. It said, 'We are not going to facilitate any easing of the administration of the sales tax system. We want to make that as complex as possible in order to exacerbate the problems for the Tax Office'. That was its policy, and to the extent that it was able to involve the Australian Democrats in that process, then the process was delayed in its passage through the Senate.. However, the Tax Office has been trying to comply with a shorter implementation period in order that the benefits of the new system can be extended to as many taxpayers as quickly as possible. What the Deputy Leader of the Opposition understands-probably should understand-is that tens of thousands of people previously subject to the old wholesale sales tax system will be removed from it entirely. Those who remain in it will have a simplified arrangement and will be more simply able to claim any exemptions under that system. Mr TIm Fischer interjecting",55
260,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the Leader of the National Party.,55
261,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much for that very helpful observation. The point is that what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should understand-and what the Leader of the National Party might understand-is that the administrative complexities of the GST are just bewildering and immense. One just has to look at the most recent survey to come out of New Zealand. It is an authoritative one, independently constructed with the help of the inland revenue department of New Zealand. It demonstrates that the smallest operators, the smallest businesses-which would include fanners, presumably-have 500 times the administrative burden of big business in terms of the compliance arrangements with the GST. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Treasurer was asked a question about the operation of his sales tax Act. He stood up and said that he did not know what the answer was. He is now making a speech about GST. He does not know what the answer to that is either. In my submission, he is not being relevant to the question. He to have concluded his answer.",55

It had intended to present me with a report earlier this week, but has sought additional time in which to do that, because its members believe that the progress has been such that they can get greater consensus amongst themselves. I think that is an admirable step forward, given that what we have done for the first time in this industry is bring together the producers, the processors, the marketers and the distributors. The critical issue that has been the focus of public attention in this debate is the level of tariffs. As important as the level of tariff is, it has been recognised by this task force that there are a number of other important issues that need to be addressed as well: the question of marketing, the question of assignments, the issue of pricing, further processingMr Hand interjecting",57

I believe that important progress has been made, and I am pleased to give the task force the additional time. I might say that this approach is the same as the successful one we pursued with dairy farmers and grain growers. We got an outcome which the industries endorse and support. It was an outcome which gave them confidence for the future. I hope that we can achieve the same result with sugar. Let me contrast that to what the Opposition proposes.

I might say that it is one more than the Leader of the Opposition was prepared to give when he made a speech in Mackay recently which went for 6 pages. Honourable members should take note of these very important words which appeared at page 11 of the coalition's document: Tariffs mean nothing to the European Community and some Asian countries and even if Australia increased its sugar tariff any country wanting to get sugar into Australia would simply lift its export subsidy to override that tariff. Apart from the fact that that is the only message in the document, it completely m,isses the point because tariff has been used as a price support mechanism. You should go up north and tell any cane grower that you believe tariffs mean nothing. See what response you would get from them. Not one cane grower believes that tariffs mean nothing. The Deputy Leader of the National Party adopts a different position when he speaks to his own constituency. Recently he addressed an Aystralian fruit growers conference and said that tariffs were right up-front.

NA Unemployment",62
355,Mr SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) proposing that a definite matter public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's economic mismanagement which has thrown a million people out of work and shedding. provides no plan to solve the unemployment crisis. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number o/members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",63
356,Dr HEWSON,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There should be no doubt in anybody's mind in this place, as there is no doubt in anybody's mind right around Australia, that the two dominant issues today are the level of unemployment, with nearly one million Australians-just on 980,000 Australians-now unemployed and perhaps nearly as many again underemployed; and, secondly, for those who have managed to keep their jobs, the lucky ones, incredible job insecurity about whether they will keep their jobs. I thought that it was particularly telling today that when in the course of Question Time four separate Government Ministers were asked for an assurance that, as far as the industries under their responsibilities were concerned, there would not be any further job losses none of them could give that assurance. All four of them· were asked whether they could give an assurance that there would be further job losses in the small business sector, in the farm sector, in the resources sector and in the metals industries, and all them failed to give that guarantee. The only honest one admitted that there would be job losses, although he tried to create the impression that somehow that was not related to Government policy or the Government's recession, but he did concede there would be job losses. So in two days the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has not been prepared to give a guarantee that the number of unemployed will not go above a million. The Government has not been prepared to give a guarantee that the unemployment rate will not exceed 11.3 per cent, and four separate Ministers in four major areas of Australian industry were of unprepared to give any guarantee that there would not be further job losses in their area, except one who, as I said, admitted that in the farm sector there would be further labour Yet where is the Prime Minister? There are two dominant issues on today's agenda on the minds of every single Australian, but where is the Prime Minister? Where is the Government? This is an indication of how important they think unemployment, underemployment and job security are in this country. This is a clear-cut example of how arrogant and insensitive those opposite are about the plight of average Australians who have been subjected to the deepest recession since the Great Depression of the 19308. Yesterday, in Question Time and in the matter of public importance, I focused on the fact that those opposite are not prepared to give an open and honest assessment of where this economy is. They will give no indication of the direction in which this country is going. Today we see that they just walk out en masse when I raise the issue of unemployment and job security. The Prime Minister, the ultimate coward when it comes to political debate, stood up in Question Time with 12and IS-minute answers to serious questions from this side of the House on unemployment forecasts in the last two days, and deliberately and knowingly misrepresented and distorted whatever he wanted to in order to get by on those answers. He is not prepared to come into the House and face a genuine debate on what is now Labor's badge of dishonour: the one million Australians who are unemployed. It is going to hang around the necks of those opposite every day between now and the next election. It does not matter how many stunts .they try, how many misrepresentations they try, how many distortions they try, or how many diversions they try; the people of Australia never going to forget and are never going to forgive this Government for throwing nearly one million Australians out of work. Perhaps the most disturbing thing to us on this side of the Parliament, apart from the that those opposite are not prepared to face the reality and debate it, is that we know they have no answers to the unemployment crisis. They know they have no answers to the unemployment crisis. They caused the problem. They cannot fix it; they cannot solve it. They know that, but they are not prepared to debate this issue. They run around trying to scaremonger and to frighten the people of Australia about an alternative which does actually deal with the problem of this country and promises to create two million jobs by the end of this decade. Those opposite know that and they are not prepared to come into this House and debate it. The very threat of the Government's current policy stance is another round of the great boom-bust psychology in this country. Honourable members will remember the 1984-85 boom and the 1985-86 bust, then the 1987-89 boom and this phenomenal bust which has thrown us into the deepest recession in 60 years. If the fiscal profligacy that those opposite are now trying to peddle as a policy alternative takes hold, we will have the biggest boom this country has seen in the postwar period, crashing into the deepest possible recession. Sustainable jobs cannot be created with that type of policy. The Government knows that. What do we see when we go' back over the last two cycles? What happens every time we come out of the boom-bust? We have a higher level of real interest rates and a, higher level of unemployment. Already 320,000 or 330,000 Australians are long term unemployed with the threat of 500,000 Australians being long term unemployed under the types of policies we have seen from the Government. The only time those opposite address the issue at all is when they try to blame somebody else. They will go back as far as they want to go in order to distort that,. I am surprised that they have not blamed Captain Cook, because I think everybody since Cook are has, in fact, been blamed by this Prime Minister for this problem which was of his own making. Probably the most disturbing feature of this Government is that it willingly and knowingly fact uses unemployment as a policy instrument. It set out to deflate this economy and to boost the number of unemployed as a deliberate and wilful act to try to slow down an overheated economy. That shows just how arrogant and insensitive this Government has become in its final days in office. It is important to stop for a moment and look at the magnitude of this unemployment crisis in Australia today. Let us go back to the One Nation statement. As we have said in several questions today, there have been nine times as many jobs lost as there have been created since the One Nation statement, which was supposed to be the solution to the unem'ployment crisis. Employment has risen by 8,000 and unemployment has risen by since the One Nation statement was brought down in February. Nine times as many jobs have been lost as have been created in the time since that statement was brought down as the panacea for all our economic ills. I notice that whenever we ask the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) a question about unemployment he always runs back to the participation rate. He says, 'If that hadn't moved, we would be in a different situation'. It is interesting to note that the participation rate in February is the same as it was in October. Yet we have had nine times as many jobs lost as have been created over that period. Indeed, pation rate, which had been trending up, had continued on that trend over the period since February this year, we would have an unemployment rate today of 13.3 per cent. If the Treasurer wants to argue the case about participation rates-which are a bit technical to most Australians-the fact is that the participation rate has not moved in the way it had been moving, in a trend sense. If it had, the unemployment today would not be 11.3 per cent, it would be 13.3 per cent. We look forward to the Treasurer continuing to argue about participation rates as an excuse for what is massive policy failure on the other side in dealing with the unemployment problem. Today, there are some 680,000 children who live in a home where neither parent has a job. In the middle of June this year there were nearly 700,000 Australian children living in poverty-undoubtedly that number has gone up during the last few months as this Government has done absolutely nothing to address the unemployment problem. There are more than one in six Australian children aged 14 or under where the family breadwinner does not have a job. In a class of 30 children in Australia, five of them would live in homes where neither parent is employed in the work force; five kids out of every class of 30 have neither of their parents in a job. At least 50 per cent of the sole parent families headed by women live in poverty. As we go from one level of statistics to the next, we get to understand the magnitude of the pain and hardship that those n,ooo opposite have inflicted on the Australian family and on Australians generally as a result of their callous economic policies. When we allow for the fact that there are many people who cannot get as much work as they want-those who are underemployed-we see that the unemployment and underemployment rate is not just 11.3 per cent but, as Access Economics has concluded, it is closer to 20 per cent. I get criticised for saying that this country is in danger of drifting towards a depression. What is 20 per cent unemployment and underemployment but a very real danger that we are drifting in the if the particiwrong direction., Every time we hear an excuse from the other side, the unemployment rate jumps a month later. Those opposite are not doing anything to deal with the problem. I notice today that the Anglican Home Mission Society has put out a press release referring to the recession Christmas that is coming up and drawing attention to the human dimension of the unemployment problem and how that is going to impact on low income Australian families under the Government's policies during the next few months. I thought it was interesting that the Prime Minister is obviously very sensitive about this. He is very sensitive about the fact that some of the biggest losers under his policies have been blue collar workers, the people that he claims as a Labor government to represent. He is also very sensitive about the fact that the low to middle income Australian family has been hit the hardest. Honourable members would have noticed that the Prime Minister got a question today in relation to the family allowance supplement and how the Government had introduced a family allowance supplement in order to deal with the problems of the low income family. That is a classic example of the way he misrepresents the facts. Who introduced the family allowance supplement? It was not this Government. The family income supplement was introduced in the 1982 Budget by our side of politics. Every time the Prime Minister gets up under pressure he distorts something else. He said today that we were going to put a 15 per cent GST on toothpaste. He did not tell those opposite that the Government already has a 20 per cent sales tax on toothpaste. The price of toothpaste under us will not go up by 15 per cent. The Prime Minister always stands up and distorts and misrepresents the facts. He does not care. He does not deal with the problem because he has absolutely no answer to any of Australia's economic ills.",63
357,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Are you going to put a GST on water? Yes or no!,66
358,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The Minister should not interject.,66
359,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Are you going to lose your seat? Yes or no!,66
360,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member for Bennelong is not assisting ·his Leader with interjections.,66
361,Dr HEWSON,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The simple fact is that Fightback is all about jobs; it is about job creation. If those opposite put a Fightback policy in place, they would be able to create something like two million jobs by the end of this decade, which will roughly have the unemployment rate. Yet the Prime Minister had the gall to come in here yesterday, without one policy-without any policies to deal with unemployment-and make the outrageous claim that unemployment would always be lower under them than under us. He is always good with a catchy phrase. There is no limit to the arrogance and insensitivity of this Government when it comes to making statements like that. Those opposite know that the reverse is true: unemployment will always be lower under us than under a Labor Government simply because we have a policy solutionFightback. Fightback equals jobs .. The Government's boom-bust scenario equals unemployment. A vote for Hewson is a vote for a job; a vote for the coalition is a vote a job. A vote for those opposite is more of the same: more unemployment, more pain and hardship, and more families living in poverty. That is what the choice is going to be at the next election. Fightback is all about jobs; it is all about getting the Australian business sector moving again; it is about lowering business costs so that the business community can replace imports, expand its exports and be more internationally competitive, all to one end and one end only-jobs. Jobs and job security are the two dominant issues in Australia today. Fightback is the only policy package that has set out to address that issue and can deliver the results, and those opposite know it. That is why they come in and make all these callous claims and distortions about what unemployment will be under them. Yet when they are asked the direct question: will it go above 11.3?-no guarantees. Will we have more than one million unemployed by Christmas?-no guarantees. They are not prepared to face the reality of what they have done to this country. They are running around creating any sort of distortion they can to divert attention from the fact that they have no answer to the unemployment crisis in Australia. Quite frankly, I think the Prime Minister has given up on unemployment, except in one sense: he is worried about his own unemployment; he is worried that he might lose his job. All he is about is trying to save his job. He does not care how many other jobs are lost in that process. He does not care less. He is not even prepared to come into this Parliament today and to debate the fact that Fightback is the answer. Fightback has set the agenda for the last 12 months, and those opposite know it. Why else would they spend every second of every day trying to knock it over? Of course it set the agenda. Those opposite know that it is electorally very powerful; they know it is going to deliver the jobs that they cannot deliver, which they have made no attempt to deliver. One Nation was a political stunt to try to distract attention from the fact that the Government could not come up with an answer to Fightback. Do not forget that for Fightback knocked off one Prime Minister. The second Prime Minister pulled the One Nation stunt, and then the Budget as a second stunt. The Government knows that it has no answer. Let me finish with one simple message: a vote for Hewson and the coalition is a vote for jobs, and a vote for Labor is a vote for more of the same-more unemployment, more pain and more hardship for Australian families.",66
362,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"A vote for the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is a vote for losing jobs. It is a vote for higher taxes and it is a vote for reducing our income and challenging our job security if we happen to be in work. Anybody who believes otherwise has the perfect pilot or test case-however you wish to describe it - sitting in Victoria at the moment. The Opposition's argument on where it intends to go on employment and on its policies overall manifests two traits: one is collective amnesia about what its policies actually say and the second is absolute deceit in dealing with the figures to illustrate its points. Let me take the last point first because I do not intend to go through them in too much detail. The Opposition argued, for example, that 680,000 kids are in situations in which neither parent works. That is a correct figure; but the inwardness of that figure is the thing that needs to be understood. The vast bulk of those parents are on the supporting parent benefit-in other words, they are single mothers or single fathers and are receiving the supporting parent benefit. The vast bulk of those 680,000 parents are in that position, and the vast bulk of them are in that position because that is where they wish to be; they wish to give full time care and attention to their children. What does the Liberal Party have in mind for them? The Leader of the Opposition said that we should be concerned about kids under 14 years of age. Why then does he propose that, at the point in time when a kid reaches 12 years of age, it will put its parents in a situation where they must seek work because they will no longer be entitled to the supporting parent benefit. That is what Fightback is about. That is part of the Liberal Party collective amnesia. That is why the Government takes such fundamental objection to those opposite when we are subjected to their shedding crocodile tears for the poor in this country, when we know what is inside Fightback and when the Liberal Party will not discuss it. ' The collective amnesia on Fightback is becoming extraordinary. When the Leader of the Opposition stood up. on Alan Jones's show and said that he did not know that Fightback taxes water-when a fundamental element of Fightback is that it picks up all consumption-it was an act of amnesia which was truly breathtaking. Those of us who know the background of the Leader of the Oppositionand you must assume at least that he is capable of understanding the Fightback document and capable of dealing with it honestly when conveying it in public-will know that that statement was an act of fundamental dishonesty. We now turn to the area of employment. A few things have been said by those opposite about employment in their moments of honesty. About 12 months or so ago, the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) believed that they could afford a degree of honesty on these issues. The honourable member for Bennelong said, 'Unemployment will be with us for' a very long time in the sorts of numbers that are with us at this stage'. The Leader of the Opposition said that there would be transitional effects. What he meant by transitional effects was that there would be an increase in unemployment. When it came to the question of the two million jobs, he said at the time, 'That is not modelled; that is our best hope'. The Opposition's best hope, on the estimates of what is going through in the economy at the moment, would be 1.7 million jobs created over that period. Without any argument as to how it would occur, the figure would be up by about 300,000, according to the Opposition when it talks about its two million jobs. That was more deceit from those opposite with the use of figures; but those figures are totally unrelated to Fightback. All of the people who have modelled Fightback have made absolutely clear that, if there is no substantial suppression of wages and substantial wages discipline, which can only be brought about effectively by sustaining very high levels of unemployment, what we will get will be an inflationary effect which will directly affect unemployment in the upwards direction. The Prime Minister was criticised by the Leader of the Opposition when he said that, whatever the level of unemployment is now, unemployment would be worse under those opposite. But I remember distinctly what the Prime Minister was quoting from. It was not some figure off the top of his head. It was not even a figure produced by either his Department or Treasury. It was an opinion of three-quarters of the economists who comment on these matters in this country. All of them had estimates that the level of unemployment would be 150,000· greater under the Opposition's proposals than any level of unemployment reached under this Government. So, if it were the case that some 980,000 people were unemployed at this time, the relevant figure under the Opposition's package, using the same basis of comparison, would be 1.13 million. This election will actually revolve around trust. Would people trust the Opposition with a proposition for massive cuts in outlays, particularly cuts in outlays directed towards poor people and middle income earners, and with its policies to take people off the dole after nine months, to eliminate both enterprise bargaining and the wages system and to remove essential protections for people already in employment in jUst the same way as Jeff Kennett has done? Would people trust the Opposition to produce a result other than an increase in unemployment? Would unemployed people trust the Opposition to sustain them and their families in life when its tax cuts associated with the Fightback package are 100 per cent dependent upon its capacity to deliver cuts in the social security system? The Leader of the Opposition has made a big issue in this place about whether or not we are prepared to debate these issues. Nobody is listening to this debate outside place because this is not a broadcast day for the House of Representatives. The 20 or 30 people in the gallery are the only people in the whole country who are listening to this debate. But there is one distinct difference between when I am speaking in this debate and when the Leader of the Opposition was speaking: I was here when he was speaking, but he has not stayed here for the rest of the debate. He initiated this debate. He started it in this Parliament. He challenged us to respond to it. We are here; we are responding to it. But he is not here. Mr L1oyd-1 raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Where is the Prime Minister?",67
363,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! There is no point of order.,68
364,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Leader of the Opposition went through the motions of putting forward his deceitful package in this placeMr Rocher-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is it appropriate for the Minister to refer to the absence of the Leader of the Opposition in that way? The Minister has only two of his own side behind him.",68
365,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,'-Order! That is a frivolous point of order. That is the second frivolous point of order taken by Opposition frontbenchers.,68
366,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is not our debate; those opposite started it. Our backbenchers are getting on with the process of finding work for people, looking after the needs of their people. Those opposite raised this matter for debate and yet they are the ones who have walked out on it in the Parliament. That is the point about those opposite. In the process of the Opposition Leader's remarks he blatantly misled this Parliament about where the Fightback package would take us. One of the things he cannot stand is being shown decent figures. He had one set of figures that he chose to use. They are erroneous figures. They do not reflect what has been happening in the labour market. Basically, what has been happening in the labour market is good news. In my view, it is not good enough news, and it is not fast of this enough, but it is basically good news. I can tell those opposite that my position standing at this despatch box as employment Minister in Australia is a hell of a lot better than would be the case for my counterpart in the United Kingdom, my counterpart in the German Bundestag or my counterpart in the Republican Administration in the United States. The position I am in is not one that 1 necessarily would like to be in, given the circumstances in which we find ourselves, but there is always somebody worse off, and the people who are worse off than me in this situation tend to be all of our counterparts the OECD. The Leader of the House in Britain came to see me the other day. He said, 'I am amazed by your debate in this country. We would kill for your growth rates. We in Britain would kill for your growth rates'. That was said by the Tory Leader of the House of Commons. He came to see me for a bit of a chat about where he saw our economies going. Of course, he is living with very substantial negative growth. As far as our counterparts are concerned, the report of the Economist is absolutely clear. The growth rates in Australia are better-and this is on the analysis of the British Economist, not ours. The growth rates that it foresees for this economy over the 12 months are incomparably better than anything that has been presented as a likely outcome in Europe. Just in case honourable members opposite have flot noticed, as the rest of the country has noticed-at least the American presidential election happened to help in that regard-this country is not Robinson Crusoe when it comes to economic difficulty. All the member countries of the OECD are in difficulty. The difference is that this country is coming out of it. We have got the growth rates. We have a Government that has put in place the stimulatory measures which, of course, take 12 months or more to work. They do not happen straight away. They have to be planned through and put in place. Of course they take 12 months. The countries with which we in Australia like to compare ourselves are only now starting to put in place the policies that we have put in place in the last couple of economic statements. The policy of the Leader of the Opposition-and it needs to be clearly understood-is this: to cut, in the first instance, $11 billion from the pre-existing outlays, that is, pre-existing to the last Budget, principally in the social security area. To that cut he has now added $7 billion in the statements that he has made. He asks this country to believe that, if he cuts $18 billion from outlays, he will actually not create more unemployment. This is an extraordinary assertion. This is an assertion of in a set of prospects which 1 do not think any economist in the world would concede as a likely outcome. Whatever else happens when that $18 billion is cut out, one thing that is not going to happen is that employment will actually increase. Honourable members opposite say, 'We will make it available in tax cuts.' They are not doing that but, if they were, they could make that argument. In comparison to other member countries of the OECD, we happen to be a low taxed nation. Most Australians probably will not believe that, but I am afraid the figures are objectively there. It is a fact that this country, in comparison with most of the countries in the OECD, is a low taxed nation. But there are other figures that the Leader next of the Opposition ought to concentrate onand with joy, as 1 do, as the employment Minister. 1 refer to the huge lift in the number of skilled vacancies notified to the Commonwealth Employment Service. He does not really want to talk about the Commonwealth Employment Service. Firstly, he does not want to talk about the increase in the number of skilled vacancies, because that indicates that the labour market is turning in the right direction. Secondly, he does not want to talk about the Commonwealth Employment Service because he intends to abolish it and send its functions to the private sector and then tax those functions at ·15 per cent. I ask honourable members: can you believe it? Somebody who seeks work is either going to have to pay a 15 per cent consumption tax on his approach to the private sector, or his employer is going to have to pay it when the particular employee is delivered to him. Now that the CES is doing such a fine job in being the focal point for the distribution of jobs in this community and is actively out there there raising consciousness amongst employers about job possibilities, and doing a fine job of it-he intends to abolish it. He intends to abolish the programs which are attracting people to employ people. Then, of course, he intends to ensure that there is no focal point at which those skilled vacancies can be coordinated and delivered to the unemployed. That is a very bad prospect in particular the long term unemployed. Unless you have both access to the CES and access to the labour market programs that we have put in place, the evidence is now irrefutable: you have no chance of a job, none whatsoever. You are among the long term unemployed who confront the Leader of the Opposition's intention to cut you off unemployment benefits. You will have absolutely no prospect of work, none whatsoever, in what is proposed to be done about all the areas of social securi13.2 ty that impact on jobs. The Opposition's policy on jobs is deceitful, and the members of the public know it. In the final analysis, that is what they are turning on. They are not turning on the fact that they know dam well that if a 15 per cent tax is imposed on everything that small business does, small business will not be interested in employing people. They know that, but they know overall that what the Opposition has in mind for them is that they will not be supported if they are unemployed; they will not have job security if they are in employment; and they will have an inflationary, anti-employment tax imposed on them. They reject it, and they are wise to do so. ;",68
367,Mr LLOYD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Murray-Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia) (4.05 p.m.)This discussion is about the Government's policy of despair for Australians. That policy has resulted in one million unemployed officially; nine jobs lost for every job gained since the One Nation document was introduced six months ago; no plans; no hope. If the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) in his swan song in this Parliament with regard to the next election wants to talk about deceitful statistics, he should be remindand ed that it is only in the last few days that it has been made clear that in the last two years, Australia's record on job losses is the worse of the 10 main Western economies. That is something that cannot be denied. When one talks about this Government and its policy of despair for regional Australia, in addition to Australia generally, the message is even worse. In addition to the one million people who are officially unemployed-the 11.3 per cent official rate and the 15 to 20 per for cent unofficial rate-the Minister's own Department, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, has released the latest figures that it has with regard to regional unemployment. These were collated when the official general unemployment rate was 10.6 per cent and not the 11.3 per cent that it is now. When the unemployment rate was 10.6 per cent, for - the Hunter region of New South Wales, that part of regional Australia, it was per cent. For the Richmond-Tweed area it was 15.8 per cent. In Victoria, for the Loddon, Campaspe and Mallee regions it was 13.4 per cent; for Central Highlands it was 13.4 per cent; for Queensland, north and west Moreton, it was 13.4 per cent; and in Tasmania in the Mersey-L'yell district it was 12.4 per cent. The point is that unemployment in all of those regional areas has deteriorated since. Those figures actually mask the true position. All honourable members know that in small towns and on farms, there is a lot of unrecorded, unregistered unemployment. If we look beyond that to youth unemployment in regional Australia, the situation is even worse again. The official figures from DEET show that the regional teenage unemployment rate in Australia is 32.4 per cent. One out of every three young Australians in regional Australia is unemployed. Again that point is correct. The true level of unemployment is masked because of the lack of registration in the small towns and on the farms. Let us look beyond that. In New South Wales, in the Richmond-Tweed area, the rate is 43.4 per cent; in Victoria, the Barwon region, it is 42.1 per cent; all of Gippsland, 47.9 per cent; Queensland, the Darling Downs south-west, 40.9 per cent; South Australia, southern and eastern, 33.9 per cent; and Tasmania, northern, 38.2 per cent. We have a tragic and deteriorating employment situation in regional Australia, particularly for young people, and this Government offers no plan and no hope. The farm situation is a significant factor this very serious and tragic depression that we have in regional Australia. The latest calculations on farm income provided by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics will show that this year the average farm in Australia will lose $26,000. Last year the figure was $29,000. The year before it was $24,000. So, for the last three years, including this year, $79,000 will be by the average Australian farmer. The sheep growers are the worse affected, with a loss of $109,000. In that same time, since 1988, the level of indebtedness in rural Australia has increased almost 50 per cent from $9,894m to $14,264m this year. In other words, farmers are living on borrowed income and borrowed time. Mr Anderson-Yet Mr Crean thinks that farmers are happy with the Government.",70
368,Mr LLOYD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is the point we want to come to and drive home. That adds to low regional income and low regional employment. The Minister, as the honourable member for Gwydir has said, not only agrees with it; he encourages it. He thinks it is a good thing. He did his best in that regard when he was the Chairman of the ACTU, with his almighty double standards of driving out jobs in the bush and hanging onto jobs at any cost for his ACTU people and his own electorate. Every person in rural Australia should now be very clear about the stated policy of this Government and this Minister responsibleand that is more farmer unemployment. Mr Bruce Scott-To get rid of farmers; he said so today.",71
369,Mr LLOYD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right. The Minister has said, 'Well, look, value adding is going to save employment in regional Australiafurther processing'. First of all, if we have fewer farmers in regional Australia and no livable income, we are going to have less product to process anyway. That seems to have escaped him. I want to use my electorate as an example to show what a farce his policy and his comments are. The Murray electorate in northern Victoria is the major value adding or further processing electorate for food in in Australia. There are 15 major food processing factories. But the employment in those factories is not about to increase dramatically; that employment is at risk. Today at lunch time the coalition rural committee had a dramatic reminder of that. Terry Ward, chairman of Heinz Australia, referred to tomatoes and processing as an example. Most of the tomatoes that Heinz lost uses are grown in my electorate. One of its two processing factories is in my electorate; the other is in Dandenong. He said, - Any major move by Heinz with its factories in the future will be to New Zealand. It will not be to elsewhere in Australia, because my area, Australia, cannot compete against New Zealand with value adding, or for that matter with California'. For example, with the processing of tomatoes and the canneries, he said that labour costs in New Zealand canneries are only 64 per cent of the labour costs in a similar cannery in Australia and that the cost per can through a processing factory in New Zealand is 30 to 35 per cent cheaper than in Australia. In California the price is much the same as New Zealand. In California the transport cost is under half per kilometre of the cost in Australia. Why this difference? It is because of the Labor Government's policies; the union accord. Heinz in Australia runs eight shifts per week. Heinz in the United States and New Zealand runs 16 to 20 shifts per week and therefore has a far more efficient use of capital resources. In New Zealand with the GST there is no payroll tax. Heinz in Victoria alone would save $4m. Because New Zealand has a GST there is no payroll tax. He also referred to the fact that there was no fuel tax and no sales tax, et cetera, in New Zealand. Mr Ward also made the very important point that with a goods and services tax, which is part of our Fightback policy, there is no hidden tax on exports. So all that New Zealand product that comes across to Australia has a 5 per cent advantage over any product made by Heinz, Campbells, Unilever or Plumrose-they are all in the electorate and they are all thinking about New Zealand - because we have this 5 per cent hidden export tax, which as recently as last Saturday Tony Cole, the head of Treasury, confinned because of the application of the sales tax, payroll tax and the fuel tax. So our people, even in Australia, start off with a 5 per cent cost disadvantage as against New Zealand or any other country that has a goods and services tax system. Of course, that is only part of our Fightback policy. That is where the answer is; that is where the plan is; that is where the hope is. There are no makework schemes such as Labor tried with One Nation. The Government went off the rails so much with its national rail program that six months later there was not one job in regional Australia. In local government it will maintain some employment in the short term, and then there will be no hope. So for the future of regional Australia, particularly for young people, the answer is the coalition and Fightback; otherwise there is no hope, with no plan, no future, and only despair under this despicable Labor Government.",71
370,Mr GEAR,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have just heard another two speeches from those opposite which did nothing to put the Opposition's view. We heard platitudes. One thing that always amuses me about Opposition speakers is how zealously they talk about the good points of the GST when they were never consulted about its formulation. In looking at the way the GST is viewed by the Australian public, one does not have to be an Einstein to know that the reason it is not being accepted by Australians is that they had no part in its formulation. We can contrast the formulation of the Fightback package withMr Tim Fischer-One Nation?",72
371,Mr GEAR,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"One Nation, as the honourable member who is out of his seat interjects. There is exactly the same process under One Nation and our tax summit; that is, consultation with people around Australia. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of this country actually talked to people to find out their views and to find out, in their opinion, what improvements we could make. The One Nation package was indeed borne out of consultation. The Fightback package was formulated in a room with a bunch of technocrats and a computer. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) took it down to the party room, to where people who had never seen it and had had no the part in its formulation-and I am talking about the back bench and most of the front bench-who had never had a word to say about what went into it, were suddenly given what the Prime Minister referred to yesterday as a bag of rotten fish. A year afterwards, how true those words are. They were given this package and asked to go out and sell it. In the early days that was easy because of the problems we were having as a government, but it is looking a lot sicker now than it did a year ago. When one talks with members of the Opposition privately, they will concede that. But, of course, it is their job to go out and sell it. The matter of public importance before us today refers to the nearly one million people out of work. There are a number of reasons for that: the massive changes we are making in our industry; the restructuring of this country; the restructuring of industry which means we are producing more with fewer people, more than we ever did before. The Opposition is starting to ridicule the participation rate, but when we look at the participation rate-that is, the number of people of working age who are either in work or who are actively looking for work-we find that just that one factor alone has added over 300,000 people to the unemployment list: just from that one factor, the restructuring. Those opposite would not have any idea how they would go about getting more jobs. Let me quote a few of the people who will be affected by the Opposition's proposals and see what they have to say about it. I refer to somebody who is in industry. His name is Mr Louie Mazloum. He is the general manager of Toto's pizza restaurant, involved in catering. Talking about the Opposition's Fightback package, he said on radio: Well the problem as I see it, you know we take the respectable firm of accountants like Ernst and Young, and here they say that GST would increase accommodation costs by thirteen percent, restaurant prices by fourteen percent, and alcohol prices by nine percent. Now restaurants at the moment, with the recession we are living in, it's a deep recession, we're hardly making any profit at all. A lot of restaurants have gone broke already. Now when the GST comes in I can tell you that Lygon Streetin Melbourne, of coursewill be like a cemetery, everyone will shut down. That is the sort of policy that the Opposition is bringing in, as it says, to create jobs. The lie was put to that by the economics editor for the Sydney Morning Herald, Mr Ross Gittins, in his article on 16 November. He had this to say, in part: Dr Hewson choses to pretend Fightback is a close substitute for short-term demand stimulus; that it's merely a different way of producing the same quick results. In truth it's not, and never was, a response to recession. Bringing in Fightback will not create one more job. In fact, the estimates are that if we had Fightback we would already have more than a million people unemployed. We would be past that barrier; we would be past 1.1 million with Fightback. Those are the sorts of policies that we are talking about, but those opposit- talk about the plight of the unemployed. There are some people around here who take some comfort from that because they believe that it is causing some discomfort to the Government. Let us also have a look at some experiences with the GST to see what sort of impact the GST would have on small business in Australia. Small business generates the most jobs in the Australian economy. A review of the GST in New Zealand over a year states: In New Zealand, the cost of collecting the GST is 25 per cent of the value of the taxes collected. The New Zealand Government collects $5 billion in tax. However, it costs $1.25 billion to collect it-and the Government does not pay that cost, small business does. It will be the same in Australia. Hardly any small business in Australia collects tax. It is only wholesalers that collect any tax; small business does not collect it. But under the Opposition's proposals we will have 800,000 more tax collectors in Australia. After one year of experience of the GST in New Zealand, Mr Morine, who is a New Zealand accountant, says of all the strong arguments against the introduction of a GST: The most persuasive is that complying with the GST legislation will require business of about 20 per cent of its resources. This serious redirection of resources will lower the business income subject to company income tax by the Australian Government. The impact of the Opposition's policies falls most heavily on that area of business that can create jobs. But it gets worse than that, because the biggest and fastest growing industry in the world now is tourism. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald stated: The executive director of the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, Mr John Dart, said the proposed goods and services tax (GST) would add 10-12 per cent to the cost of domestic travel packages. He is worried about it, and he has a right to be worried about it. What he is looking at in his particular industry is a rapid fall-off in the biggest employer in Australia, that is, tourism, and that would have a devastating impact on jobs. Yet those opposite ask questions about the one million unemployed in Australia. They know in their hearts that the proposals they have will make it worse. The matter of public importance today was not directed at the almost one million people out of work. It was moved for the second day by the Leader of the Opposition, who is daily looking rattled in this place; he is daily looking over his shoulder. The matter of public importance was a way that he could get up, turn his back on the House and talk to the back bench. I am told that this morning he had one of his rare coffee mornings with his back bench, and so he should. The backbenchers of the Liberal Party are waking up to the fact, as they move around the electorate, that the goods and services tax is poison. Nobody wants to know about it because, as I said before, there was no maSs support in the community for such a tax. There was no consultation about the tax. It was constructed in a room with a computer and a few technocrats, and it was dumped on the poor mugs on the other side of the House. They have to get out and sell it. I do not envy them their task. I have not heard a good word about the goods and services tax in my electorate, from either small business or electors. I have not heard them say that they are welcoming with open arms the prospect of paying 15 per cent on all the goods and services that they purchase to divest itself every day. The Government has put in place policies that will create growth in the Australian economy. We have the lowest level of industrial disputes on record. There was no confrontation until the Victorian Government in the middle of the night took away workers' rights and conditions and started the industrial confrontation in Victoria. But prior to that we had the lowest level of disputes on record. We have a wages policy that actually allows employers to plan with predictability against the chaos that would be caused by the introduction of the so-called 'Jobsback' policy. The lower interest rates would go up if the GST were ever introduced, and the inflationary impacts of that would take interest rates up with them. Those opposite do not have any wages policy so the inflationary effects would be built in and we would go back to the bad old days of high interest rates and high inflation. The Government totally rejects the matter of public importance brought forward today. It believes that the future prosperity of this country will be better served by having a Labor government in Canberra than the alternative of a 15 per cent goods and services tax. My colleague the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) has been given the job of silencing the churches when they raise objections to the goods and services tax. Mr Chaney-A million unemployed!",72
372,Mr GEAR,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Go and talk to the churches, Fred. The Government rejects the matter of public importance. (TIme expired)",74
373,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr HolIis)Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. NA NA The following Bill was returned from the Senate without amendment: Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1992 NA Public Works Committee Approval of Work,74
374,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Minister for· Small Business Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall): representing the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969. it is expedient to carry out the following proposed works which were referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: facilities for an increased Anny presence in the north and redevelopment of Larrakeyah Barracks, Darwin. The first proposal relates to the force structure review, which was announced by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) on 30 May 1991. Under the force structure review, a Regular Army brigade is to be pennanently based in Darwin by the end of the decade. This will be achieved by the staged relocation of southern based units to Darwin. This proposal is the first of two stages for the construction of working, training and accommodation facilities for these units. The facilities will be constructed at the site of the new Army barracks, currently under construction for the Second Cavalry Regiment, which is relocating to Darwin at the end of this year. The Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency has stated that assessment to date has revealed only minor environmental impact. The estimated cost of the proposal is $177m. The second proposal is for the redevelopment of the Larrakeyah Army Barracks in Darwin. The barracks were constructed prior to. and during World War II and have undergone little development since then. The Army is experiencing chronic overcrowding problems, and the conditions of the working and living accommodation can be described as some of the worse in the country. This proposal will rectify the current problems, primarily through the refurbishment of existing facilities and the construction of a new facility for the Joint Headquarters Northern Command. The estimated cost of this proposal is $26m. In its report, the Public Works Committee agreed that facilities for an increased Army presence in the north should proceed, but it raised the following specific issues: firstly, the Committee agrees that fire management is an important issue at Palmerston and it recommends that Defence take all appropriate precautions to prevent fire risk in the· area. Secondly, the Committee is of the opinion that large grassed areas should be kept to a minimum and replaced with native plants. This will reduce water consumption during the dry season. Thirdly, the Committee noted that consultations have taken place with the Aboriginal community and recommends that the Aboriginal community be kept aware of any further proposed works in the Palmerston site. In its report on redevelopment at the Larrakeyah Barracks in Darwin, the Committee agreed that the works should proceed, but it raised the following specific issues: firstly, the Committee doubts the heritage value of building 27, but acknowledges Defence's policy of liaising with environmental bodies until differences are resolved. Secondly, the Committee recommends that Defence continue discussions with the National Trust of Australia and the Heritage Commission concerning the future of building 27. Thirdly, the Committee commends the Department of Defence on discussions held with the Aboriginal guardians of the site and recommends that discussions continue during the project. Defence agrees with the Public Works Committee recommendations for both the APIN and the Larrakeyah Barracks and will take the appropriate action to implement these recommendations. I know that the Minister would like me to acknowledge on his behalf the commitment of the Public Works Committee under your chairmanship, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the fact that, while some of us presumably will take the opportunity in January to relax after a fairly hectic year of parliamentary duties, you and your Committee will work on during that month. On behalf of the Minister, I thank the Committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Reference",74
375,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Minister for Small Business and Construction (Mr Beddall), representing the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: HMAS Waterhen facilities modernisation, Waverton, NSW. HMAS Waterhen is the national mine warfare base for the Royal Australian Navy, and is located at Balls Head Bay, Waverton, New South Wales, some four kilometres north of the Sydney CBD. Existing facilities and services date back to late 1940. A number of demountable buildings and transportable containers have been provided over the years to supplement the facilities' requirements pending modernisation. The age and poor condition of existing facilities necessitate replacement or major specific repair to continue operational activities and to provide for future mine warfare capability. Various proposals have been consideted and developed for the Waterhen site over a period of about 10 years. In May 1991 the Defence Force structure programs and policy committee endorsed a high priority for the modernisation of the existing Waterhen mine warfare base. It is proposed to provide purpose-built facilides for the developing Royal Australian Navy mine countermeasure capability. The scope of the work provides for continuous Navy operations throughout the construction implementation period, and includes an operations and administration building, supply and diving centres, a workshop building, a transport compound, flammable materials and explosives storage, and all associated site works and services. The estimated total cost of the works is $71m at December 1991 prices. Subject to parliamentary approval, work on site is expected to commence by May 1993. Due to the need to keep the base operational, contruction will be staged, with completion due - y August 1997. I table selected drawings the proposed HMAS Waterhen facilities modernisation at Waverton, New South Wales. On behalf of the Minister, I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Reference",75
376,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall), representing the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bollcus), I move: That in accordance with the provisions of the Public 'Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work.be referred .to the Parliame-tary Standing Comnuttee on PublIc Works for consIderation and report: Construction of a housing develings opment, Kellyville, NSW. The Defence Housing Authority has entered into a joint venture agreement with Jennings Group Ltd to develop a residential subdivision area of 36.4 hectares at Kellyville. An option to purchase this land from the current owners, the trustees of the Society of the Divine Word, is held by the joint venture. The land has recently been rezoned by the responsible local authority, and approximately 20.2 hectares is zoned for residential purposes, with the rest zoned for educational establishment purposes, special uses, community facilities special uses, public transport corridor, and trunk, drainage and non-urban purposes. The joint venture will participate in an entity called the Rouse Hill Infrastructure Consortium Pty Ltd which has been established by ·landowners with interests in the Rouse Hill-Kellyville area to facilitate the provision of water and sewerage services to the area. The development of the Kellyville land will be substantially by way of subdivision for residential purposes, but including such cOinmunity and commercial facilities as may be considered necessary or desirable in the context of the overall development. The joint venture expects that the 20.2 hectares of zoned residential land will provide sites for 380 dwellings. The DHA proposes of the construction of approximately 115 dwellings for service families, with the remaining 265 sites being available for sale to the public. The provision of 115 houses in the 1993-94 time frame envisaged for this element of-. the joint venture program will be critical for the replacement of 150 houses subject to the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreem(fnt for servicemen which are due to be returned to the States under agreed arrangements over the next two years. Preliminary cost estimates are that the site purchase, subdivision development and construction of the overall development, together with associated consultants' fees, will amount to $421f2m. Revenue from the sale of the remaining 265 sites to the private sector is expected to net in the order of $22m. On behalf of the Minister, I table selected drawof the proposed construction of a housing development at Kellyville, New South Wales, and on his behalf I commend the motion to the House.",76
377,Mr ROCHER,COMMITTEES,"The Opposition notes the reference, and is pleased that the housing at Kellyville will be an improvement on the existing accommodation; which is to be replaced. We note also that the joint venturer is the Jennings company. I have to say, as a former employee of that company, that it has a very fine reputation in the housing field in Australia. I am sure, notwithstanding present difficulties in the industry, that it will be a fine partner for the Defence Housing Authority. As the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) pointed out in his tabling speech, it is proposed that 115 dwelling units be provided on the site, and there will be 265 additional sites made available to the public. We welcome this procedure because it is desirable that Defence personnel living in DHA housing remain, as far as is practicable, in the wider community so that their families may mix with the families of the public generally in schooling and as they grow up. It provides the alternative for the spouses of serving ADF personnel to socialise with people not necessarily associated with the Services. I see that the 115 houses will be provided over a fairly brief period, but that in fact they will be replacing 150 houses. One does not have to be much of a mathematician to work out that there will be 35 houses fewer than were provided previously. This raises a question in my mind, but I have no doubt, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in another capacity you will find out more about that. In due course you may see fit to include this in the report of the Public Works Committee to the Parliament. It is also interesting to note that in this venture there is an expected net surplus of $22m. I presume that this goes to the Defence Housing Authority, although it is not clear from what the Minister said in his speech whether it is divided on the basis of the arrangement with the joint venture, whether it is fifty-fifty or whether all of the $22m accrues to the authority. I would like to observe that, although it might be reasonably assumed that the housing and land markets are at their lowest ebb given these recessionary times, and the extended nature of the recession, there is a certain amount of risk involved in marketing houses and land. I would not like it to go unobserved that, where there is profit, the associated risks also have the potential to mature. Whilst I am aU for getting out of the constricted ways in which we have been providing housing for Defence personnel, it seems to me that we do not always pay due regard to the risk elements in doing business. In effect, this is what is happening. The Defence Housing Authority, with its partner, will be entering into a risky operation. Whilst I accept that there is an expected net gain in the order of $22m, by no means can that be guaranteed. We only have to look at the activities of governments around the country to see what can happen. The Government should be alert to the possibility that a net gain can tum very quickly into a net loss. I wonder whether an instrument of government should be doing business in this way. However, as I say, that is something you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and your Committee might want to look into in due course. It is a matter for decision of the Government. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the coalition is alert to the possibilities of problems. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Reference",76
378,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr BeddaU), joint representing the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Housing development at Flinders View near Ipswich, Queensland. In January 1988 the Government established the Defence Housing Authority as the first step towards providing a better standard and an increased choice of housing for defence personnel and their families. At this time the Defence Housing Authority took over responsibility for some 23,000 houses. It has a current investment program in excess of $27Om per annum. The development will replace existing substandard housing located in the Amberley area. It is in line with the DHA's commitment to improve the standard of accommodation for defence personnel and their families, and its commitment to return houses to the States. When complete, the development will provide for 560 residential blocks, incorporating both detached and medium density housing. The Defence Housing Authority proposes construction of around 180 houses for service personnel and their families. The remaining housing will be integrated with the service housing and will be offered for sale to private purchasers. The project is estimated to cost $31m, of which $18m will be recovered from the sale of building lots. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is planned to commence in April 1993, with completion anticipated for late in 1997. On behalf of the Minister, I table the drawings and commend the motion to the House.",77
379,Mr ROCHER,COMMITTEES,"This is a very similar proposal to the previous reference. I note that there is deemed to be a need to replace existing substandard housing in the region of the Amberley base. This proposal, entailing as it does the construction of about 180 new houses for service personnel and their families, is not just unobjectionable; it is welcome. The information the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) was able to provide on this reference is less forthcoming than that in his speech on the previous reference. Whilst he talks about the construction of 180 new houses to replace existing substandard units, he does not say how many of those existing units are to be replaced by the proposed 180 houses. I cannot comment on that, but I suspect that the number to be built will be less than the number to be taken out of commission. That is to be regretted. I will be very interested to hear how the Government proposes to make up the difference, if not in this case-because I simply do not know, for want of information-in the case of the previous reference. I note that the project will be partly paid for by the sale of building lots and that it is hoped that $18m of a total outlay of $31m will be recovered. My comments on the previous reference apply here also. While I think it is good that it should be anticipated that some money can accrue to the Commonwealth, I am not sure that it is that cut and dried. It is, after all, a business venture. In this case, we do not know whether there is a venturing partner. It certainly was not mentioned in the speech, so I presume there will not be and that the houses will be constructed by the DHA going to tender or by some other means. I guess that is a matter which the Public Works Committee will look into. I will be interested in what it is able to inform the Parliament in due course. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee A.pproval of Work Reference",78
380,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I wish to make a few remarks on the references relating to Larrakeyah Barracks and HMAS Waterhen. The first of the references relates to the facilities for an increased Army presence in the north and the redevelopment of Larrakeyah Barracks in Darwin, which I visited a few weeks ago. The coalition supports the relocation of an appropriately structured brigade group to Darwin, but we have made it clear that we will not support the relocation of a tank squadron. That will have some impact on the Public Works Committee's consideration of this proposal. The plan to relocate a squadron of tanks from Puckapunyal to Darwin will cost in the vicinity of $19m-at least that was the original estimate. That simply is not a cost-effective way of deploying tanks. They can be moved on tank transporters from Puckapunyal to the north in a mere 48 hours. I do not think that is a sensible way of spending taxpayers' money. In the force structure review, which was brought down in May 1991, the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) said: An annoured regiment with one regular tank squadron, and a. composite aviation squadron will be deployed in Darwin by the mid-1990s, and an infantry battalion by the end of the decade. The regular tank squadron in DarWin will be able to be reinforced by the reserve tank squadron, which will remain at Puckapunyal. It has been estimated that the proposal for the movement of the Regular tank squadron will cost something like $19m. On 28 October this year, Senator Bob Collins, a senator for the Northern Territory, put out a statement that the Federal Government plans to relocate two tank squadrons from the First Armoured Regiment at Puckapunyal to Darwin between 1994 and 1997. At no time was this Parliament ever informed that the Government had made such a dramatic change in its defence planning for the north; nor is there any allocation of funds to cover the doubling of the number of tanks to be moved from Puckapunyal to the Northern Territory. I hope that the Public Works Committee will be able to examine that issue and that we will get some answers to it. I am sorry to say that it sounds very much like an ad hoc electorally based decision, such as was the decision to rush out and splurge, at the very least-according to Senator Ray's own words on the Dateline program-$200m on the 18 FIlls, and the sudden decision overnight to abandon what is in the lO-year defence plan, the purchase of the helicopter support ship, with a program due to begin next year. That has been abandoned as well. There are ad hoc decisions being made very quickly and it is very hard for anybody in Australia to keep up with what but it is clear that these decisions are driven by one thing, and that is· the forthcoming Federal election. The coalition supports the proposal to refer the matters for the modernisation of HMAS Waterhen, which is the mine warfare school, to the Public Works Committee. In our My defence policy, A strong Australia, we place requirement. a very high priority on the development of strong mine countermeasures capability in Australia. We believe that, despite paying lip service to this essential capability, the present Government has not been truly serious about mine warfare. I refer particularly to the inshore minehunter project which has dragged on for the entire life of the Hawke-Keating governments at a cost of some $l00m to Australian taxpayers without ever producing a capable vessel. That is a project that we will disband as a coalition government. That is significant to HMAS Waterhen because the two prototypes-the subsequent vessels are not going to be constructed anyalso way-are to be based at HMAS Waterhen. This will have some impact on the deliberEssentially, ations of the Public Works Committee. I hope the Committee will give particular attention to the part of the development which will involve facilities specially built for the inshore minehunter. I thank the House for allowing me to say a few words on matters.  tary to the Minister for Defence)-by leave I just wanted to respond to a couple of the first time. comments of the shadow Minister for defence, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). Firstly, I think that there has been general agreement within the community, particularly amongst defence specialists, about I move: what an astute purchase the extra 18 FIlls has been. It was always a sensible decision to be able to extend the life of a plane which really has a 1950s or 1960s design delivered in the 1970s and is without peer in the rest of the world. That an opportunity arose for Australia to buy these 18 FIlls and to therefore· extend the life of those currently in .service seems to me to have always been a logical, common sense solution and one which is happening, I say is accepted. I agree to an extent with the shadow Minister that there has been some controversy about the inshore minehunter. But I think he ought to check his latest facts about whether or not the words he used to describe the inshore minehunter can now be accurately applied. understanding is that they are meeting the As for not being serious about the HMAS Waterhen and not taking the issue of minehunting seriously, I think I should remind, the House that there is currently a request out for tender. The Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, has applied the most demanding timetable on both the Department and the bidders, and we should be making some announcements in January this year. I think it is important that I reassure the House that the Government is taking this program very seriously. From my perspective, I am hopeful that we get a decent amount of Australian industry involvement in it and that we might be able to exploit any opportunities for exports that may exist within this program. I reject the comments of the shadow Minister regarding these two notices.",78
381,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Hollis)Order! The discussion on this matter has now concluded. these MURRAY-DARLING BASIN BILL 1992 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Crean, and read a Second Reading",79
382,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEES,"Hotham - Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (4.53 p.m.)That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to give effect revised Murray-Darling Basin agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia for the improved management of the land, water and environmental resources of the Murray-Darling Basin. The agreement is set out in the schedule to this Bill. The Murray-Darling Basin agreement provides the framework for intergovernmental cooperation to address natural resource management issues in the basin of joint concern. As Australia's most important agricultural region, the Murray-Darling Basin is a major focus of the Government's approach to achieving sustainable resource use. The Murray-Darling Basin comprises about one-seventh of Australia. It also produces about one-half of Australia's total output from natural resource based industries. It supports 25 per cent of the nation's cattle and dairy farms, about 50 per cent of its sheep, lambs and cropland, and almost 75 per cent of its irrigated land. Production derived is valued at some $10 billion annually. It is Australia's agricultural heartland. Until well after the Second World War, the River Murray Commission, established under the first River Murray Waters Agreement of 1914, stood the test of time in successfully regulating the shared water resources of the River Murray to ensure reliable supplies for irrigation, urban and industrial use. This provided the foundation for the irrigation industry in the Murray Valley and ensured that South Australia received a supply of water essential to its survival and growth. In the early 1980s, however, there was growing community and government concern about the economic and environmental costs of resource degradation in the basin. The four governments party to the River Murray Waters Agreement recognised that a joint approach was necessary to address broader resource and environmental problems in the basin. The breakthrough in achieving a genuinely holistic approach to basin natural resource management came in November 1985 when Ministers with responsibility for natural resources in the Labor governments of the Commonwealth, New South Wales, ,victoria to a and South Australia agreed to adopt a cooperative approach to the better management of all the resources of the basin. This new approach was given effect through an amended River Murray Waters Agreement which was signed by the Prime Minister and the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia in October 1987. Parallel legislation was passed in all parliaments a short time later. The paramount feature of the new Murray-Darling Basin agreement was the establishment of a ministerial council to promote effective planning and management for the equitable, efficient and sustainable use of the water, land and environmental resources of the basin. The agreement also created the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to assume the River Murray Commission's regulatory responsibilities and take a broader advisory responsibility to the ministerial council. Another important element in the agreement was the provision for a direct line of communication between the Council and the basin community through the establishment of the Community Advisory Committee. All participating governments recognised the need for cooperation not only on an intergovernmental level but also with the community. With this strong institutional framework, the Murray-Darling Basin initiative represents a genuinely comprehensive approach to natural resource management. Innovative public administration arrangements are linked with a strategic and comprehensive suite of policies and programs. These are firmly aimed in addressing real problems and realising genuine opportunities open to governments and communities to progress their mutual interests. In addressing natural resource management issues, the initiative depends fundamentally on mobilisation of the community. It is an outstanding demonstration of how policies and practices can be integrated to resolve the conflicts between competing demands for natural resources on the one hand and their sustainable use on the other. The initiative has an impressive list of achievements. The salinity and drainage strategy, a major component of the overall natural resources management strategy, has provided an effective means of dealing with land salinisation and waterlogging in the irrigation areas of the basin. It is a dramatic reminder of the benefits resources. of taking a coordinated approach across State borders to address natural resources management problems. The strategy aims to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in average salinity levels in the River Murray while providing the opportunity to protect, through drainage and disposal of wastewater, up to 500,000 hectares of land affected by water logging and salinisation. The strategy complements other market based measures such as more appropriate water pricing and transferable water entitlements. Since adoption of the strategy in 1988, over $74m has been jointly expended on government funded salt interception schemes and joint government and community based drainage and salinity management plans. Major salt interception works have been completed at Woolpunda and commenced at Mallee Cliffs and Waikerie. Drainage programs are being undertaken at Shepparton, Deniliquin and in the Murrumbidgee region. The natural resources management strategy, now in its fourth year, has become an effective framework for individuals and governments to jointly attack environmental degradation in the basin. The natutal resources management strategy promotes and sustains activities as widespread and diverse as river management, water quality management, land and vegetation management, and conservation of native flora and fauna and the basin's cultural heritage. It is a working example of an integrated regional approach to the sustainable use of natural resources. It has elicited a joint government funding commitment to date of $55m. The increase in Commonwealth support in this period has been equally impressive; rising from $1.9m in 1989-90 to $7.6m for 1992-93-a total of $22m over the period. The NRMS on-ground works undertaken through the community have been effective in fostering and harnessing community commitment and involvement in the initiative. More than 200 community groups have received assistance. An ethos for sustainable resource management is taking root across the basin. It will provide the enduring basis for sound stewardship of the basin's irreplaceable The experience gained over the first five years of the initiative confirms the view that an integrated and cooperative approach to basin-wide resource and environment management can achieve significantly more than would be possible through independent action by the Commonwealth and States. The current development of new strategies for irrigation management and water quality management indicates that the initiative's momentum is continuing. Sound and responsive water resources management policies are essential to support a viable irrigation industry in the Murray-Darling Basin. Similarly, a comprehensive basin-wide nutrient management strategy is needed to address pollution of the river system. Work on this strategy has been given new impetus following the widespread algal blooms of last summer. The maturing of the initiative has led to further refinements of its institutional framework. IIi 1989, the ministerial council commenced a review 'Of the Murray-Darling Basin agreement to provide for the evolving role of the council in water, land and environmental management and to allow more efficient implementation of council decisions. The Bill before the Parliament contains a number of significant amendments which will further strengthen the initiative. The inclusion of the salinity and drainage strategy as part of the amended agreement is foremost among these amendments. This major achievement, a cornerstone of inter-governmental cooperation, has developed to the stage where it can now appropriately be given the backing of legislation. More efficient allocation of water, essential to the viability and sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the basin, is also addressed. The amended agreement provides for water·allocation through a system of continuous water accounting. This will allow New South Wales and Victoria to draw on their annual water allocation according to need. Unused allocations will be carried forward as credits; above allocation drawings will be carried forward as a debit against future entitlements. This will facilitate the optimal use of a shared resource without disruption of fundamental access guarantees. In line with effective program administration and efficiency goals, financial provisions will be revised to allow improved budget management by the Commission. Particular changes include the ability of the Commission, with the approval of council, to carry over limited funds from one year to the next. This will allow the Commission to apply its financial resources more flexibly in responding to changing circumstances and needs. The development of new strategies to meet changing priorities and emphases, against a background of complex economic, environmental and social issues, requires a flexible legislative framework. Accordingly, the amended agreement empowers the ministerial council to modify the agreement through approving additional schedules. This will enable, for example, the timely incorporation of new strategies into the agreement. With successful passage of this Bill through parliament, the first schedule to be brought forward for approval under this process will be one authorising the accession of Queensland to the initiative. Approximately a quarter of the basin lies in Queensland, including the headwaters of the Darling River, the major tributary to the River Murray. Queensland's accession will permit a truly basin-wide perspective to be brought to resource management issues. The Commission's day-today workload is increasing and issues being considered are becoming more complex. The provision for the appointment of an independent President in the agreement will facilitate strong, ongoing Commission leadership in the development of sound advice to council and in the implementation of council decisions. The Government is confident that the changes to the Murray-Darling Basin agreement proposed by the Bill before the House will strengthen the legislative underpinning of the initiative and facilitate its forward progress. In this way we can build on the significant achievements to date. The manner in which the community of the basin has embraced and adopted the objectives of the initiative, together with the unprecedented cooperation of all levels of government, is clear evidence of a government and community partnership that can secure the future of the basin's resources, to the benefit of both the local community and all Australians. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Carlton) adjourned. NA PROCESS BILL 1992 Second Reading [COGNATE BILL: NA PROCESS (TRANSITIONAL NA AMENDMENTS) BILL 1992] Debate resumed from 9 November, on motion by Mr Duncan: That the Bill be now read a second time.",79
383,Mr WILSON,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"In the unavoidable absence of the shadow Attorney General, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), he has asked me to present his views and the views of the Opposition on the Service and Execution of Process Bill 1992 and the Service and Execution of Process (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1992. The Opposition will be supporting the Service and Execution of Process Bill which will replace the now outdated Service and Execution of Process Act 1901. That Act will be repealed by the second Bill. The genesis of the Bills under present consideration lies in the report produced by the Law Reform Commission in 1987 entitled Service and execution of process. The report came about because of a reference given to the Commission in November 1982 by the then acting Attorney-General, the Hon. Neil Brown, QC. The Commission was asked to. inquire into, and report upon, the adequacy of the law relating to the service and execution throughout the Commonwealth of the civil and criminal process and the judgments of the courts of the States and Territories. In many respects, the reference came about largely at the behest of some State judges who were concerned to see that the procedures for the service and execution of interstate process were' streamlined: The Law Refonn Commission reported to the Parliament in 1987, recommending the drafting of a fresh Act to include changes in the procedures for interstate service and execution of process within the scope of the Act, and in the procedures for the interstate enforcement of judgments. It also recommended that the scope of the Act be broadened to enable interstate service and execution of the process of investigative and adjudicative tribunals. This latter change was implemented, in part, last year by the Service and Exetution of Process Amendment Act 1991; the passage of which was supported by the Liberal and National parties. That Act amended the 1901 Act to enable royal commissions and other investigative tribunals to serve subpoenas on persons interstate and to provide for interstate enforcement of subpoenas to give evidence to investigative tribunals. The Bills before the House today largely implement the balance of the recommendations of the Law Refonn Commission. Their purpose is to repeal the existing service and execution of process arrangements in the 1901 Act and to institute a new scheme. The Service and Execution of Process Bill is the more substantial of the two Bills now before the House. It replaces the 1901 Act, setting out new procedures for the interstate service of process in both civil and criminal proceedings; interstate service of subpoenas; interstate service of process of tribunals; interstate execution of warrants; interstate enforcement of court and tribunal judgments; and enforcement of fines imposed by courts of summary jurisdiction. One of the most important features of the Bill is that it sets out an exclusive method of interstate service of process. At present a plaintiff can use proced.ures under the Service and Execution of Process Act or procedures under State laws. This can cause confusion particularly where a plaintiff attempts to use part of the procedures under the Act and part of the State procedures in the one proceeding. Clause 15 sets out the rules for service of initiating process in respect of civil proceedings, and clause 24 sets out the rules for criminal proceedings. Service on an individual is to be effected in . the same way as service of such process in the place of issue, on a company in accordance with clause 9 and on any other body corporate in accordance with clause to. Clause 9 of the Bill sets out the procedures for service of a document on a company. The procedures are the same as in section 220 of the Corporations Law. Clause to sets out the rules .for service of a document on a body corporate that is not a company, such as a statutory corporation or an incorporated association. Service may be effected by leaving the document at, or posting it to, a place specified for service by· State law; or, if there is no applicable State law, by leaving the process at, or posting it to, the body corporate's principal office or place of business. The current provisions in the Service and Execution Act as regards service on bodies corporate are inadequate in several respects. First, they only deal with service on companies and not other types of body corporate, such as statutory corporations. Secondly, the provisions do not confonn with the Corporations Law rules which can, because of this lack of confonnity, result in confusion. No endorsement will be needed on the process commencing a proceeding against a person in another State. At present a writ of summons that is to be served out of jurisdiction und-r the 1901 Act must bear the endorsements prescribed by section 5 of that Act. Instead, a copy of a prescribed notice, which will be set out in the regulations to the Bill, will be required to be attached to the process served. This is provided for in clause 16. Failure to attach the notice will result in service being ineffective. Also abolished by the Bill is the need for a particular connection between the cause of action and the State in which the proceedings are commenced. Instead, clause 20 of the Bill will allow the court of issue, on the application of the person served, to stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is a more appropriate forum to determine the matters in dispute between the parties. Clause 20 does not, however, apply to proceedings begun in a Supreme Court. The rationale seems to be that there is already sufficient provision for transfer of proceedings commenced in Supreme Courts under cross-vesting laws. Cross-vesting legislation, as the House would know, provides that a Supreme Court may transfer proceedings to another Supreme Court if it is 'in the interests of justice' that the proceedings be determined by the other Supreme Court. Part 3 of the Bill deals with the service of subpoenas. The requirement to obtain leave to serve a subpoena will be abolished. Service is to be effected in the same way as service of a subpoena in the State in which it is issued. In addition, the Bill sets out a number of conditions which will need to be complied with for service to be effective. These include: the subpoena must contain an address for service of the person at whose request the subpoena was issued; the period between service and the day on which the person is required to comply with a subpoena must not be less than 14 days; copies of any prescribed notice must be attached to the subpoena; and the person served must be paid, at a reasonable time before the time for compliance with the subpoena, moneys sufficient to meet the person's reasonable expenses in complying with the subpoena. Division 2 of part 3 sets out separate provisions for service of subpoenas addressed to persons in prison which require the prisoner to attend before a court in order to comply with the subpoena. Clause 39 provides that the court or authority which issued such subpoena may order the custodian of the prisoner, by issuing an order for production, to produce the prisoner at the time and place specified for compliance in the subpoena. Such an order may only be made where the evidence sought is necessary in the interests of justice and there will enough time for the order to be complied with; or for an applicatioJ,l to be made to set aside or vary the order. Seivice of the order for production will be effected only if there is paid to the custodian of the prisoner the money for the expenses the prisoner would incur in complying with the subpoena if he or she were not a prisoner. There will also be some new provisions as regards the interstate service of subpoenas on persons who are under some kind of restraint which affects their ability to comply with the subpoena. Examples include persons on bail subject to reporting requirements, on parole, in home detention, or doing periodic detention or other forms of altemati ve sentencing options. A person subject to a restraint which might be breached if he or she complied with an interstate subpoena will be required where State law permits, in the first instance, to apply under State law for consent to comply with the subpoena; for example, where a witness is on bail, by applying to a court to vary his or her bail conditions. If no consent is given, a warrant can be issued and a magistrate will decide whether the person should go interstate on bail or in custody. The Bill also provides for interstate service and execution of process of State and Territory tribunals. As I have pointed out already, the Law Reform Commission's recommendations for procedures to enable the interstate service of subpoenas issued by investigative tribunals was implemented last year by the Service and Execution of Process Amendment Act 1991. Division 4 of part 4 of the Bill replicates the effect of the 1991 amendments. Procedures for the interstate service of initiating process issued by a tribunal performing an adjudicative function of the kind specified in the Bill are set out in division 2 of part 4. This includes a tribunal performing a disciplinary function; for example, a tribunal determining whether a person is a fit and proper person to carry on a particular profession. The rules for service are essentially the same as those I have outlined in regard to service of a COlnt process. It will be possible for subpoenas issued by adjudicative tribunals to be served interstate where leave is obtained from a court, judge or magistrate. Apart from the requirement to obtain leave, the rules as to service are similar to those I outlined in regard to the service of subpoenas issued by courts. Judgments of tribunals performing an adjudicative function will be enforceable interstate by registration in a court in the same manner as judgments of a court. The Liberal and National parties have asked previously in relation to the 1991 amendments to the service and execution of process legislation whether the Commonwealth has power to legislate with respect to the service and execution of process of State tribunals. The doubt arises from Mr Justice Mason's obiter dicta comments in the case of Amman against Wegener, reported in 1972, 129 Commonwealth Law Reports, at page 415. In that case Mr Justice Maspn, as he then was, expressed some reservations about 'whether or not the power'-as set out in section 51 (xxiv) of the Commonwealth Constitution- 'extends to the process of Royal Commissions and Tribunals which are not courts in the strict sense'. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) responded to the concerns raised by us in the earlier debate by informing the House on 3 June 1991 that the Government had received advice from the Solicitor-General that it was within the legislative competence of the Commonwealth to provide for the service and execution of process of State tribunals. This issue has, however, not as yet been determined by the High Court. I note that the provisions in the Bill dealing with tribunals have quite significantly been grouped together which would enable them to be severed from the rest of the Bill in the event of a successful High Court challenge. Division 1 of part 5 of the Bill provides for the execution of warrants. The requirement for interstate warrants to be endorsed by a judicial officer of the State of apprehension is abolished. The Bill also enables copies of warrants-including fax copies-to be acted upon. This removes the need for the issue of a provisional warrant while the original warrant is being sent interstate. In addition, the grounds upon which an apprehended person may seek release will be narrowed considerably. At present, subsection 18(6) of the Service and Execution Process Act 1901 sets out the following grounds upon which a magistrate may release an apprehended person: if the charge is of a trivial nature; if the application for the return of the person has not been made in good faith in the interests of justice; and if for any reason it would be unjust or oppressive to return the person either at all or until the expiration of a certain period. None of these grounds for release has been included in the Bill. Unless the warrant is invalid, a magistrate will be required to remand the apprehended person on bail to appear in the place of issue of the warrant, or order that he or she be taken in custody to that place. In this respect, the Bill diverges from .the Law Reform Commission's recommendation that the Bill should contain a provision to enable a person liable to interstate extradition to obtain relief if he or she satisfied the magistrate conducting the extradition hearing that it would be manifestly unjust or oppressive to order extradition. The Law Reform Commission considered that such provision was necessary to prevent extradition where 'it would be contrary to the notions of justice and fairness for a person to be compelled or required to go to the State or Territory of issue of the process'. The Opposition has been informed by the New South Wales Attorney-General, Mr Hannaford, that the streamlined procedures in part 5 of the Bill for the return of persons interstate to face criminal charges, including the omission of the discretion recommended by the Law Reform Commission, were initiated by his predecessor, Mr Collins, in the forum of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and agreed to by the other State and Territory Attorneys-General. Further provisions of the Bill relate to suppression orders. Under the present Act a magistrate does not have the power to make a suppression order. Under the· new provisions, magistrates conducting an extradition proceeding under clause 83 with respect to a person apprehended and brought before them under a warrant will have the power to order that a part of the proceeding or review held in public, or a finding publicly made, not be published or broadcast. For this provision to apply, the magistrate must, for example, be satisfied that publication or broadcast would give rise to a substantial risk of prejudice to the fair trial of a person; prejudice to the law enforcement or national security; or identification of the victim of a sexual offence, or identification of a child in proceedings concerning his or her welfare, or where the child is the victim of the alleged offender. Pursuant to clause 97, a suppression order remains in force until revoked. It is arguable that this provision is not within the Commonwealth's power to make laws with respect to the service and execution of process, and is therefore not constitutional. This is because it purports to extend suppression orders beyond the service of process or extradition of the person into and beyond the conduct of the proceedings themselves. This is another issue which may need to be determined by the High Court. Finally, the Bill substantially reproduces part IVA of the current Act which provides for interstate enforcement of lower court fines. Part IVA was inserted in the current Act in 1963, has been subsequently amended and was excluded from the reference to the Law Reform Commission. Minor changes have been made to ensure consistency with the rest of the Bill but in substance it is as appears in the Act being repealed. Apart from the two points of constitutional argument which I have drawn to the attention of the House and the point I raised with regard to extradition, as I indicated at the outset, the Opposition supports the passage of these Bills. We believe them to be sensible, and indeed overdue, updating the Commonwealth's procedures for the service and execution of process.",82
384,Mr KERR,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"It is very disappointing that this gripping debate on the Service and Execution of Process Bill 1992 and the Service and Execution of Process (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1992 has such a small audience. Perhaps that is because of the nature of what is a dry as dust legal subject as far as the general public is concerned. Nonetheless, this is another major step forward in the chapter of growing nationalism. It recognises for the first time that,in a practical sense, we are now one nation. Our legal system dates back in large measure to pre-Federation days. Before Australia was formed, its legal systems comprised the legal systems of the various colonies. They each had their separate supreme courts, their police structures and their enforcement mechanisms. When Australia federated in 190 1 some arrangements needed to be put in place to allow for the service and execution of process between the different States. I suppose we would now look back and say that the system which was put in place was essentially skeletal. It allowed for process to occur, but in many ways the arrangements between the States-in their legal proceedings with each other and in their legal arrangements-were that of foreign countries. Indeed, if we look at the supreme court civil procedure Acts in different States, we see that they do refer to foreign jurisdictions as meaning the jurisdictions of Tasmania vis-a-vis Victoria and the like. That arrangement is quite unsatisfactory. We staggered on for a long time postFederation making minor amendments from time to time to the Service and Execution of Process Act which was first enacted in 1901 it following Federation, but there were a number of significant deficiencies. For example, leave was necessary to proceed in routine matters. How extraordinary that one citizen must obtain leave to take legal proceedings against another. As citizens of the same Commonwealth one had to beg permission of the court system to institute interstate processes, and there were all sorts of complications. Now this is swept aside. There are a number of significant steps we can note in Australia's constitutional development as we moved, firstly, from a colonial status to Federation, a dominion status in the early 1930s from the previous constitutional framework where we were regarded as part of the British Empire, and then post-dominion status through the Australia Act, a recognition of Australia's intrinsic sovereignty that it stands alone in a world in which it has relationships with other nations on the basis of equality. In terms of Australia's internal development, we saw Australia begin to have internal shapes at nationhood when World War II forced the exigencies of national taxation on this country in times of stress. Until then we basically had separate income taxes in each State and in many ways we functioned as six separate countries. It was not until last year that we developed a national corporations structure and not until 1992, with this Bill, which with the approval of the Opposition will pass into legislation, will we have a simple, comprehensive system of exchange of legal documentation, institution of actions, issue of process and the like between different States. So in this we are actually seeing the culmination of a legal development in this country which has seen us become externally independent and internally more one nation. So it should be seen very much in a political context as wen as in a legal context. I certainly welcome the simplicity that is now provided for in this legislation. The content has been described in the tabling speech by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), who is at the table, and by speakers from the Opposition, so I do not think I need to plough through it in any turgid way. Rather, I just mention that one of the major improvements in this Bill is that it deals with the proceedings of tribunals which are not strictly courts. As our legal system has developed, many proceedings are now held in tiibunals which are not constituted fully as courts. It would be absurd if their processes were not capable of being dealt with as expeditiously as are processes in the ordinary court system. Indeed, I imagine that in many ways much more work is now done in different States by non-judicial tribunals than by the courts proper. So, notwithstanding the doubts that may arise because of some dicta in the 1972 case, I think this is a very wise way to proceed. It would now be regarded as outrageous were the High Court of Australia not to regard the grant of power in section 51 as being extensive enough to extend to the very modest measures that have been included in this Bill. Certainly it would invite derision were it to so hold, and I do not believe that the judges of the High Court would move in that direction, notwithstanding the very proper caution that the draftsmen have obviously taken in making sure that there is the capacity for severability should that exigency arise. It is an exigency that, because of its possibility, has been provided for, but it is not one that I think should stay this House in any way upon what is a common sense measure and one which I am sure the Court, if ultimately asked to find upon this matter should anyone take the step of raising it, would find was plainly within its power. With those few remarks, I commend this Bill to the House. It is a measure of which all honourable members should be proud. It is a measure which, with Opposition support, will see its way through the Senate and into law in the closing months of this Parliament and, I believe, will in no small part contribute to the lessening of costs in legal proceedings and to the efficiency of the legal system, which is something to be pleased about.",86
385,Mr DUNCAN,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL," in reply-l thank honourable members for their contributions, all of which were erudite expositions of this particularly fine example of lawyers' law. I want to make only one point and that is that the Government and its legal advisers have no concerns about. the constitutional position with this legislation. The drafting of the legislation in essence in two sectors was in fact done to ensure that people accessing this legislation would be able to get to the particular codes easily without any confusion. That is the reason why the drafting was undertaken in the way that it was. With those few words, I commend the Bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Duncan) read a third time. NA PROCESS (TRANSITIONAL NA AMENDMENTS) BILL 1992 Second Reading Consideration resumed from 9 November, on motion by Mr Duncan: That the Bill be now read a second time.

NA OFFICERS AMENDMENT BILL 1992 Consideration resumed from 12 October. Second Reading",87
386,Mr BEAZLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PRESIDING,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Parliamentary Presiding OffIcers Act 1965 to . take account of the change of title of the Deputy President and Chairman of Committees of the Senate. I also foreshadow amendments to this Bill to be moved in this chamber which will alter the title of Chairman of Committees in the House to Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees to reflect the importance of the dual functions the occupant of the offIce performs. The Parliamentary Presiding OffIcers Act 1965 provides for the exercise of the statutory powers of the Presiding Officers, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, in the event of the holders of these officers resigning, becoming incapable of acting, ceasing to be members, leaving the Commonwealth or dying in offIce, and in the event of a dissolution of the relevant House. Sections 5 and 7 of the Act provide for the Chairman of Committees of each House to exercise the statutory powers of the relevant Presiding Officer in appropriate circumstances. When the Act was passed in 1965 the Deputy Presiding Officer of each House had the title of Chairman of Committees. In 1981 the title of Deputy Presiding OffIcer of the Senate was changed to Deputy President and Chairman of Committees. The title of Chairman of Committees is now used only in relation to the function of the offIce as chairman of committees of the whole. The Act has not been amended to take account of this change and, while the Act remains unamended, there are potential diffIculties. For example, when signing documents on behalf of the President, in order to conform with the Act the Deputy President must sign as Chairman of Committees, a title which is otherwise not used except in relation to committees of the whole. While it is unlikely that instruments signed by the Deputy President would be held to be technically deficient as a matter of law, it is possible that they could be. It is therefore desirable to update the Act to take account of the altered title. The Bill amends the Parliamentary Presiding Officers Act 1965 accordingly. As the principal Act which the Bill amends comes before Parliament rarely, the opportunity has also been taken in the Bill to amend the use of masculine pronouns in the Act. As I have said, I am foreshadowing amendments to this Bill which will amend the title of the Deputy Speaker. Other amendments to be moved in the House will tidy up terms relating to expiry or dissolution of the House and to reflect a minor change in drafting phraseology. I commend the Bill to the House. .",88
387,Mr SMITH,PARLIAMENTARY PRESIDING,"The Parliamentary Presiding Officers Amendment Bill is about a change of title. On behalf of the coalition, I indicate that we will be supporting this piece of legislation. The Bill emanates from the Deputy President and Chairman of Committees in the Senate, Senator Colston. Some time ago Senator Colston introduced a private member's Bill designed to give effect to the points that have just been made by the Leader of the House, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley). Obviously, the Opposition does not have any difficulties with the Bill. We have received letters from the Speaker regarding this matter. I understand that it has been considered by the Standing Committee on Procedure and that the members of that Committee also support the measure. The changes, though small, would certainly be welcome, particularly to avoid the prospect of some difficulty with the signing of instruments, to which the Leader of the House referred. Of course, one would not want that to take place. So that possibility is now removed by this amendment. The recent changes that were brought .to Parliament some weeks ago about the conversion of Sessional Orders to Standing Orders was a major undertaking for the Parliament. It was something that I think everyone welcomed, particularly those who serve in the chair from time to time and, indeed, members of the J>rocedure Committee. That change was welcomed by members on this side of the House and I know that the Government was pleased to see it take place. It does put into Standing Orders a range of changes which can be quite important once a new parliament commences. We welcome those changes also. There is not a great deal to be said about this Bill. Improvements, small though they be, that we make from time to time to the procedures of this House are important. It is good try to seek that bipartisan support. One would hope that the approach that all honourable members take to the procedures of the House are going to be positive. I think there is an opportunity for more work to be done about how the House manages itself, how it manages legislation, and the image that it projects to the community. I know that I trespass on dangerous ground during a debate such as this to refer to any particular matters, but I think that most honourable members ought to realise that the conduct of Question Time is the window through which most judge the Parliament. They do not see the more detailed and rational debates that we have in here from time to time in which there is a high level of bipartidebating sanship. Even when there are not very many members in the chamber, many are listening to the various monitors around the place. Question Time gives me a great deal of concern. It ought to give any thinking member of the Parliament a great deal of concern. Sure, we are running up to an election and we expect there to be a high degree of volatility on matters, but the continued respect of this chamber is something that each and every one of us-and I do not mean to sound pompous about this-should keep in the back of our minds. The respect which we give the Chair and, in turn, the respect which the Chair gives the Parliament is an integral part of this place and is something which lives beyond Standing the Orders. We cannot legislate for behaviour and respect. It is something that has to be earned. It has to be given from both sides of the chamber and from those who occupy the chair from time to time. I think that we could be doing far better than we are doing. I cast no aspersion upon any individual, but I think that we can be doing far better than we are doing. Indeed, I think the community thinks we could be doing a little better than we are doing. Whilst the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business do what they can to facilitate every opportunity that the Standing Orders provide in a tactical sense and also to manage the legislative flow in a way that is conducive to the opportunity for members to to proceed with meaningful debate, there is some scope, I believe, for a far better representation to the broader community about how we conduct ourselves. I would have thought that some elements of Question Time today were somewhat of an unedifying spectacle, even though I was a participant in it I do not absolve myself from blame. With those few remarks and without sounding pompous, it is probably a good time at this hour of the day to reflect upon what it is that we are supposed to be doing.",88
388,Mr SCHOLES,PARLIAMENTARY PRESIDING,"The Parliamentary Presiding Officers Amendment Bill does nothing that is not already practised. It may tidy up a few technical aspects. I have to say that I would much rather be here more substantive matters relating to changes in the practices of the Parliament tItan this one. But to the extent that it recogin ruses the position of the Deputy Speaker, the IJgislation is important at that level. The role of Chairman of Committees is no 6nger one which is practised at a high level in this House, largely because of changes which were made a number of years ago when it was decided that the Budget debate, for instance, would take place with the Speaker, as opposed to the Chairman of Committees, in the chair. This was the practice House of Commons where Budget procedures were part of the Committee of Ways and Means. The importance of the position of Chairman of Committees has declined somewhat. There have been one or two major debates which have been chaired by the Chairman of Committees, and I think that is about where the matter lies. The most important matter, I suppose, in the years in which I have been here was the debate on the Family Law Bill. The Chairman of Committees at the time was Joe Berinson. I was very fortunate. I became Speaker about two days before the committee stage of the debate started. During that period, Joe Berinson had an extremely trying time as Chairman of Committees. He had the disadvantage also of no Government or Opposition sponsored amendments, but amendments sponsored from all parts of the House at all times. The debate went on endlessly. But it is still an important role. I believe that it now should be switched so that the Chairman of Committees in fact is the person who has responsibility for all of the committees of the Parliament at the administrative level-I should say the House of Representatives; honourable senators might object if I go any further than that-and also the responsibility for the House of Representatives secretariat. I think de facto that probwhen ably does happen now; nevertheless, these are responsibilities which could well be allocated to that person. I raise one minor matter. It may be corrected in the Bill, but I do not think so. The Presiding Officers Act, which is the Act amended by this Bill in one way or another, provides that if the Speaker is absent-and, fact, we had a situation where the Chairman of Committees became a Minister during the absence of the Speaker-and the Chairman of Committees is not available, the person who is authorised to act is the immediately preceding Chairman of Committees and now will be Deputy Speaker. I raise the matter because there have been at least one and, I think, two occasions during my time in this place when ex-Speakers have of the been in the House and a person who was Chairman of Committees would have had precedence-and I am talking of the administration of the departments; it would have been fixed if the House were meeting-over the former Speakers. It seems to me to be an incorrect chain of responsibility. It is not something that happens very often, but I think it ought to be corrected, because we do not have the practice in this House-and the size of the House largely precludes it-of Speakers retiring at the time they cease t.o hold that office. I can assure honourable members that I had no intention of retiring in 1975. I had not even qualified on service at that time. I had been here eight years. Quite seriously, I believe that there is need in this Parliament-and I probably will not see it now-for a major change in the way we do business. I happen to believe that we cannot continue to conduct all of the business of the Parliament in 70 days a year. I also believe that the Parliament will not sit many more days than that. It will be peripheral at best because of the nature and the expectations that we have created for ourselves of being in our electorates. I do not think people are entitled to that. We could follow Washington in the United States or some other country such as Britain, where the Parliament meets in London all the time. Members get the brass band out once every three years they go back to tell the people that they are going to be candidates again. In America it is two years. The reality is that the day to day business of the House should be able to be done in a committee of the House and be done concurrently with others. The major business of the House should be debating the major questions of the day, which does not happen at the moment, for all sorts of reasons. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) will tell honourable members that, if we spend five minutes debating a ministerial statement, the Senate spends five hours debating the same ministerial statement, and we cannot get any business through the Senate anyhow. So it is an inhibition that is unexplainable in the parliamentary process. I think that is important. I understand that some of the recommendations of the Procedure Committee are going to be dealt with. The Procedure Committee has recommended, and in fact this House on one occasion decided by resolution, that we should change the rules with respect to the opening of parliament, the election of theSpeaker and a number of other aspects of the conduct of business in this place. A good many of those reports have been around for some time. I hope that the Leader of the House will respond to them soon. I will be the Chairman of the Procedure Committee for only a short time longer, but it has been going since 1986 and it has made some major changes. But the final thing is that we have to change the way this House conducts its business. I can sympathise with the spokesman for the Opposition, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), in relation to Question Time and the treatment of the Opposition. I made the same speeches between 1975 and 1977 when I had the same job he has now. When I came here in 1967, Lance Barnard was making those speeches because it was then the Deputy Leader's job. I have no doubt that, unless we change the way we do our business, in 1999, even if the honourable member happens to be the Leader of the House-and I think it is a bit early to anticipate that-he will be making the same sorts of speeches. This House, as far as Question Time is concerned, has degenerated ever since the retirement of Robert Menzies, and it has to do with a lot of things. But in the end we cannot blame the Chair and we cannot blame the Standing Orders. The Standing Orders have not changed materially in that time. What has changed is. the way in which members of this House do - their business, the way it is reported and the pressures which exist. I just wrote down here a moment ago: during Question Time prior to 1966, when Arthur Calwell was on one side of the table and Robert Menzies and, for a short time, Harold Holt were on the other side, Arthur Calwell I think had a staff of three. He had to do all his own work: write his own speeches and write his own questions. The mutual respect which existed across the table in this chamber was quite high. That has changed because of the confrontationist nature of the Westminster system and because the nature in which the Parliament is now reported has changed. Honourable members can get a 30second grab in the 6 o'clock news. There are about 20 staff members in one place, and God knows how many in another, whose job it is to prepare 30 seconds of Question Time for the news and to fill in the rest of the hour that we have for Question Time. I am quite serious about that. I think Question Time started to degenerate when questions gravitated to the front bench on both sides. If honourable members have a look at a graph which I have produced-and I think they have seen it-they will find that the length of questions has almost inevitably become longer and longer as the questions have come to the front bench. Gough Whitlam started that practice. I am not blaming the Opposition for that. The questions have become longer, and they have become more political. I did make a point today that no questions are asked seeking information these days. I know that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) asked a question which had that appearance, but in fact he was trying to highlight a political point he had made some time earlier. The fact is that Question Time is not a time when people are seeking information, and to pretend that it is is a farce. Ministers, as far as the Government is concerned, are answering questions, usually on notice, which they believe are to their advantage. The Opposition is asking questions almost inevitably prepared in the office of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) or another office designated for that purpose which it believes will gain a - olitical advantage. That is what it is all about. As for the pretence that things have changed, the only thing that has changed in this Parliament over the years is the members - nd the way they· choose to do their jobs as Imembers of parliament. If that is demeaning, or if it is not acceptable, then the members and no-one else can change it. A Speaker cannot tell the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister how they should conduct their day to day affairs. He cannot tell the media how they should report the Parliament; he cannot tell the backbenchers that they should stand up and refuse to give up their rights to the people on their front benches. This Bill changes a name and little else. It probably does not deserve the time of the House for what it does. Nevertheless, we are. debating it and we do not get many tunities. But there are changes that need to be made in this House. They are radical changes, and if they are not tried in the near future House will continue to degenerate in the it conducts business. I finally say that those who seek to blame a person or persons for the way in which Question Time is conducted OlJght to get a mirror and look at themselves, because it is the members who have chosen to allow that degeneration to take place it is the members and only the members who can change it.",89
389,Mr TUCKEY,PARLIAMENTARY PRESIDING," Mr Deputy Speaker, the Parliamentary Presiding Officers Amendment Bill is proper and sensible, in as much as we have had a situation for a long time where a person who was Chairman of Committees has in fact been known amongst most of us as the Deputy Speaker. Because of the very fact that you bear that title, I have often wondered whether another word could have been used to better designate a person who acts automatically the Speaker in his absence. But 'Deputy', course, is the usual choice of words. I guess that by adding 'Chairman of Committees' we differentiate the person concerned. That person is extremely important in the processes of our Parliament and extremely important the wider process of the Westminster system. It was not that long ago that the person who held that role was Acting Speaker here fortnight and, of course, exerted all of the powers of the Speaker during that period-so well done that we put any question of doubt about the role or responsibilities of the occupant of the chair beyond us with this legislation. I wish to take this opportunity, because of the significance of the role and the people we are dealing with and their chairmanship in this place, to make some comments similar to those made by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). I do not say this in any critical way, but I thought the honourable member gave us a very sad summary of the degeneration of this Parliament. I cannot accept his excuses for that. He makes the point, from his great experience, that he saw it all change from the days of Robert Gordon opporMenzies, Arthur Calwell and others. In Western Australia we now have a situation where a group of royal commissioners the has said that there needs to be a watchdog on way parliament. I always thought that was the people; I really did. But I have been raised with the concept that there is a Westminster system, and fundamental to that system has always been the principle that a Minister who misleads the Parliament resigns. We have and seen, I must say with some pride, some Ministers in this Government take that decision-in particular, John Brown, on an issue which some might have thought was not all that important But he knew his responsibilities; he knew that the price of misleading the Parliament, ever so innocently as it may appear, was to resign. That is the major control over the honesty of this system. But now a parliament in Australia has been too dragged down to a point where three eminent judges, members of the judiciary, have said that parliament cannot be trusted; parliament for must have somebody to keep an eye on it. We of must wonder, having heard the remarks of the honourable member for Corio, how close this Parliament is to having some eminent judges making a similar recommendation. It is a huge worry and one that, contrary to popular in opinion, is the basis for my constant complaints in this place about the handling of things. It is relative to the responsibilities of for a the Speaker and the person whom we now choose to name Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker. I would like to say a little more about this and to quote from an article some of the things the royal commissioners said about the Western Australian Parliament. The article states: Question time in Parliament was open to manipulation by the Government, the royal commission said. And questions were evaded or answered in such a way that the truth was concealed. It called for an urgent review of how question time was run. The report said question time should be used to make ministers accountable for their administration. I remind honourable members that standing order 142 refers to the fact that Ministers should be asked questions only about the administration for which they are responsible. The article continues: But at present it provided the crudest form of accountability. ""The Parliament in this state had donel relatively little to provide the public with the protection its constitutional review responsibility is there to secure,"" the report said. ""Much of the burden of review still falls on that most traditional and random of measures, question time. , ""The manner of its conduct, the apparent acceptance of evasion and equivocation in providing answers and the governmental manipulation of it for its own Purp0ses can leave the public with little reassurance that it presently serves the accountabilithree ty purpose in anything other than a fortuitous way. During the commission's hearings, one witness said questions were answered in a way that was more an art form than an exact science and he admitted drafting inaccurate answers. Of course, the honourable member for Corio gave testimony to that very theme in this place today. The article continues: The report said: ""Parliamentary questions are so instance specific in character, limited in the they allow and dependent for what they reveal upon the answer given as to provide little more than a symbolic expression of Parliament's discharge of its review obligations. ""Parliament's procedures must allow for a more comprehensive, informed and searching examination of governmental activity. The royal commissioners were grasping for a solution. The article goes on to say: The report said this would be achieved by giving more powers to parliamentary committees of inquiry. In other words, we again have to have someone keeping an eye on us because the fundamental of Westminster government is to be cast aside. It has too much fun for the media and certain members of parliament who have learnt their skills well, if not their ability to administer. The article continues: The report said the committees must not be limited in what they could investigate. They must be adequately resourced. ""An unsupported committee is a wounded committee,"" the report said. It said there was no reason the committees should be chaired by members of the Government. The positions should be shared among the parties. Of course, it went on. How could a group of parliamentarians walk down the street of their home town, having read that comment on their activities? The simple fact is that the only reason it has not been said about us is that we have not had a royal commission. That is a matter of considerable importance to me, as I hope it is to some of my colleagues on the front bench. The simple fact is that it is in stark contrast with the views of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who said as Treasurer that Question Time was 'a courtesy extended to the House by the executive branch of government'. That is not the way the Royal Commission, which comprised eminent and highly respected judges in Western Australia, saw it. It saw it as a disaster for the people. That is what it said. It said that the people are denied by this process. Today a Minister was asked a question about his administration of the sales tax law in a situation where, if the Government goes back and checks, it will find that the inquiry commissioner's press release that he brought to this place makes a claim that the very law prevents the commissioner from: giving people some special form of exemption. In fact, they either have his number or they pay the tax and claim a refund. Yet the Minister had to stand up here and say, 'I don't know about that. That is a major issue. It's a major reform in the Tax Office, a major piece of legislation. But, to tell you the truth, I have not even read - hat they said in today's paper'. Then he - pent five minutes tipping a bucket on the Opposition. We have achieved a situation Where, if we ask the Government what is two plus two, it says, 'GST'. It is programmed to ,it. It is an outrage as far as the royal commisable sioners in Western Australia are concerned in their broader view and in referring to another parliament. : Mr Deputy Speaker, you have heard time and time again the complaints from this side of the House-I go along with the honourable member for Corio in that they are complaints that always come from this side of the House-as to the conduct of Question Time and the length of answers. Our Prime Minister, as Treasurer, took 20 minutes. on three occasions: he used some 1,200 to 1,800 words to answer a single question. That stands in stark contrast to the situation in Canada where up to 40 questions will be answered in 45 minutes.. I am told that they achieve that because the Speaker of the day is brutal on people who ask questions that do not seek information, as the honourable member for Corio mentioned with his vast experience. The Speaker is brutal on Ministers who try to give anything but a relevant answer. I am afraid that is a message for this too. The Standing Orders have been written by very wise old men. They knew what members of parliament could get up to. It is interesting to see the things they set out to prevent. When one reads the Standing Orders-I am sorry that I do not have a copy here from which to quote-one sees that they put in provisions such as the one that a member can only ask a Minister about his own responsibilities. That makes a lot of sense. But when one goes through some of the other conditions that they have applied, one sees that they are there to prevent abuse of the system. If they are applied strictly and fairly, no-one should have a complaint. That is all we need. We do not need a time limit. I am prepared to concede the Prime Minister 10 minutes if it is a very serious matter and a proper answer takes 10 minutes. I do not want him restricted to two minutes when it is appropriate to take 10. But when the simple answer is yes or no and we get 15 minutes of rhetoric, that brings this place into contempt. Surely, starting tomorrow, with this new piece of legislation, we might set about running this place. I invite my colleague the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourmember for Bass (Mr Smith), to come in here tomorrow. I think it is a chicken and egg situation and I am in agreement with the honourable member for Corio: when we never get an answer, we have to make the question answer itself. The questions become rhetorical when the Standing Orders say that they should not be rhetorical and they should not debate the point. I wonder what the Government would do tomorrow if we came in here with lO-and we should get them up easily-questions seeking advice from the Government as to how it is running the country. It would be a bit of a shock because I do not think the Government knows how it is running the country, to be quite honest. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) has given up because he knows Brian Hilbert is now 5 per cent in front of him, and I am told that he is planning his new employment in America. Putting that aside, the simple fact is that if we do not come back in line, to quote the House, now Governor General, once Leader of the Opposition, Bill Hayden, Question Time becomes high farce. It is high farce and it has been recognised now by no more independent authority than a royal commission. They say in Western Australia that it is a joke, and we are a mirror image of what they describe. Put the blame where you like, but there is only one person who can fix it: the Speaker. I blame the Government in many ways for not keeping to its responsibility, and I have said that in this place in debates. I think it is a matter where the Government could just stand up and say, 'Enough of this. We have a desperate community because it is worried about the economy, and we will even get our own dorothy dixers'. I would like to say in respect to dorothy dixers that I have never seen such a regimented back bench. The honourable member for Corio made reference to the fact that all questions are now written by the front bench. I spent three years as a backbencher in Malcolm Fraser's Government. I could refer to myself as a back backbencher because I could not have been any further back than I was in those days. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would remember that in the old House we had long benches and every now and again-not often-a dorothy dixer would turn up and it would slide down those benches and nobody would pick it up. I will tell the House why-we all had our own questions. We used to tre-t the front bench of our Party as people who were supposed to be delivering information on behalf of our constituents. Time and time again our frontbenchers had to answer genuine questions without notice-and I challenge anyone to check the record and read themabout what they were doing as it affected the people of Australia. As a back bench we saw our job as one of keeping our own side honest. That has become a farce today because questions are written by the - inisters. Occasionally the questions do not meet the Standing Orders, despite the fact that they have been written by the Ministers' officers. It is outrageous to think that the Government has to rely on dorothy dixers. For a long time Oppositions have controlled Question Time. They are the ones that must ask questions. I say to my own side that there is a responsibility to give backbenchers the opportrying tUnity to ask questions. It is interesting to note that in 1971 an Opposition backbencher complained bitterly that there were more backbenchers· on the Opposition side than there were on the Government side. That backbencher was of the view that questions should be allocated the size of the party's backbench; therefore, that would give backbench members the authority to test the front bench of the Government. At that time it would have meant that the Opposition back bench was allowed three questions and the Government back bench two questions. The name of that backbencher was Paul Keating. He strongly held that view. In later times he has told us that Question Time is a courtesy extended to the House by the Executive branch of government. I do not believe the royal commissioners in Western Australia took that view of Question Time. They are deeply concerned that members of parliament have allowed the whole process to sink to this despicable and demeaning level where it is considered by the community as a joke and as a game by the press gallery. This place is built like a Roman colosseum. The only thing members of the press gallery are lacking is the ring of olive leaves around their head and the appropriate robes. It is thumbs up, thumbs down. The other day, after the Prime Minister should have had the worse day of his political life11.3 per cent unemployment-we had the journalists talking about his body language in the Parliament. That is just as much an indictment on the system as anything else. The issue should be dealt with. Mr Sciacca-What will it be under you lot?",92
390,Mr TUCKEY,PARLIAMENTARY PRESIDING,"I think the· honourable member who is interjecting should listen. He is a very new member; he is quite a lad. He has not been around the place and he should be listening. I am not throwing any criticism at any individual, or even the Government for that matter. I am of the view, however, that the Government has never been worse-and I have been here for 12 years. I think he was still in short pants when I came here. I am to say something that I wish a few people would take note of. It is no joke. That brings me to my next point. Today the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), in defending the failure of his Department to send people application forms so they could comply with the Government's new legislation, said, 'It on was all your fault, you held it up in the Senate'. As I recollect-and I will stand corrected by 24 hours-l,500 pages of tax legislation were brought into this Parliament on, I think, a Thursday to be debated under guillotine the following Thesday or thereabouts. The Government wonders why the Opposition had to delay the legislation in the Senate. Nobody knew anything about it. The legislation came out of the Senate on 30 September and now it is nearly 30 November and the Government has not delivered booklets that presumably it had prepared and only had to have printed. I remind the House of my association with the racing. industry, arid we actually produce a race book in two days that has more information in it than that tax booklet. The Government could not produce a booklet in two months. I want to make a point about this log jam of legislation that gets thrown into the Parliament every year. Why can we not have a situation-in the interest of the community, which is very interested in every piece of legislation-where in the first two weeks of any session we bring the relevant legislation for that session to the Parliament and leave it there. We could introduce the legislation and put it on the Notice Paper. Why ambush the community with legislation? I think the bureaucracy ambushes the Government. But why do it? There is no reason. Most of the legislation is not that urgent. Let us put the people on notice and let us convert this place into something the people could be proud of. At the moment they are not. (TIme expired)",95
391,Mr BEAZLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PRESIDING,"in reply-I will wind up the debate on the second reading stage of debate on the Parliamentary Presiding Officers Amendment Bill. This stage allows us to range as widely as the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) have. I will address one or two of the points that were made in the debate. The first point that ought to be made is that an offer of a proper scrutiny at Question Time was made by the·Government to the Opposition. I personally think that it was a tragedy that it was never taken up. That offer proposed to put in place a process by which individual Ministers were subject to scrutiny in much the same way as in the British Parliament. Different Ministers appear on roster on different days to have the administration of their departments questioned. There is absolutely no doubt at all that in Question Time these days there is no scrutiny of government. The situations described by the honourable member for O'Connor and the honourable member for Corio certainly are the situations which prevail. It is not the situation that has necessarily prevailed on all occasions in this place, but it is undoubtedly that which prevails now. There has been no effort by members of the Opposition, or for that matter members of the Government, to elicit information on the administration of portfolios. I think if the Opposition came into this place and asked 10 questions on the detail of the administrations of Government Ministers the Ministers would not die of shock at the fact that they were being obliged to answer questions on their administration, but they would die of shock that they were being asked. It would be totally against the run of performances in this place. . The honourable member for O'Connor said how well his back bench had done at the time when he recollected the Liberal and National parties being in government. I do not think in my service in the Parliament, which is as long as his, that I have seen a performance by an Opposition back bench to equal that of his Opposition back bench in the period since August. Eighty per cent of questions asked by the Opposition in this place since that time have been asked by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia (Mr Reith) or the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). It is an extraordinary record. It was the case when we were in Opposition that we organised Question Time. I do not chiack the Opposition for that, because that element of it is not a new phenomenon. But the extension of it to the total exclusion of the Opposition backbench and the sorts of things that the Opposition backbenchers want to ask I have never seen before. I do not think that since Federation there has been a precedent for it in the Parliament. When we were in Opposition, on nonbroadcast days we left Question Time totally open to Opposition backbenchers to ask questions; it was a totally free day. All members had to do was check with the Opposition Whip whether the question was within the framework of the Standing Orders. Even with the two broadcast days, at least one of those two days was half and half-half the time was devoted to organised questions from the front bench and the other half was effectively left open. On that basis we had a reasonable level of scrutiny. In those days, the Opposition backbenchers who had a chance to ask questions were at least as likely to trip up Ministers as was anyone on the front bench. The simple reason is that every Minister in this Parliament comes into the chamber well prepared on the issues of the day. Opposition members should not kid themselves about that. There is nothing in the area of devoted public interest in our portfolios on which we are not ready to take questions. Mr Thckey-John didn't do too well today on the WST.",96
392,Mr BEAZLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PRESIDING,From time to time there may be bits and pieces. I think in the case John BrownMr Thckey-No; I was talking about John Dawkins today.,97
393,Mr BEAZLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PRESIDING,"The honourable member for O'Connor raised the question of John Brown. In that case, John Brown was tripped up by an Opposition backbencher-he was not always a backbencher, but he was at the time. As far as I can discern, he was not asking a question that his front bench had organised for him. The Opposition should think carefully about its extraordinary performance to this point, in the same way as it ought to think carefully about the offer we made. Only in those circumstances will it get scrutiny. The honourable member for O'Connor talked about the decision of the royal commissioners with regard to the operations of parliament. He 'believed that there was merit in the propositions of the royal commissioners that there ought to be parliamentary committees of inquiry in greater number and with more powers attached to them. I agree with that. One of the things we have done in recent times is to enshrine our own committee processes. I think we can build on that. I do not think we have said the last thing that ought to be said about how those committees ought to operate. I think the commissioners and the electorate of Western Australia need to bear in mind that in the Western Australian Parliament there is a fundamental problem with scrutiny when there is of necessity an executive sitting in the House, as occurs under the Westminster system. It is only in a presidential system that congressional scrutiny or parliamentary scrutiny reaches a high point of real clarification of what is going on inside the bureaucracy or inside a Ministry. Opposition members need to think carefully about that. No doubt, when we eventually decide to put a proposition on a republic to the Australian people-maybe a few parliaments from nowMr Costello-Before the next election?",97
394,Mr BEAZLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PRESIDING,"No; everybody has been talking about a decent review of the Constituof tion by the year 2000. I think that is reasonable. There will come a time when we ought to put those propositions forward, and that is probably when we ought to consider where the Executive is and whether or not the Executive ought to be sustained in parliament. The royal commissioners had views on that. They also had the view, which I wholeheartedly applaud, that if parliaments are not to be corrupt they need to start out on the basis of their representation. The commissioners have emphatically put the view that there ought to be a one vote one value principle in Western Australia. Unless that basic principle is recognised, the Parliament is likely to be a corrupt parliament. I agree wholeheartedly with that. No doubt the honourable member for O'Connor will be pressing that view on his Liberal Party colleagues in Western Australia, who for some strange reason have said they would introduce the royal commissioners' report lock, stock and barrel. There is now only one party in Western Australia which is advocating a lock, stock and barrel implementation of the royal commissioners' report. That happens to be the governing party. The Opposition has said that it would walk away from that in spades. No doubt the honourable member for O'Connor will be pressing his colleagues to support the one vote one value principle. He has had absolutely no problem representing a rural electorate. Sustained on that, he feels hB can do it so readily that he does it from m constituency, as opposed to from his. He evidently finds the vast areas that he has to cover in that area no problem at all. That is fine, if that is the way he wants to go about representing his constituency; but from that position he cannot argue that it is too hard and that, therefore, there has to be some special organisation of representation from the country to set aside the one vote one value principle because there is a problem of the distance to be covered. He augments the distance in his constituency with no difficulty at all. This part of the debate, unlike the committee stage, allows fairly wide-ranging discussion. Honourable members have had that wide-ranging discussion. If Question Time is to be improved, in my view there is a strong case for a reconsideration of the structure of Question Time to devote it more effectively to the scrutiny of ministries. That can be done by making our Question Time more like that which occurs in Britain, which is a very effective Question Time. We ought to give it more serious thought than it has been given to this point. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee The Bill.",97

Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Beazley)-by leave-read a third time. CRIMES (SHIPS AND FIXED PLATFORMS) BILL 1992 Second Reading [COGNATE BILLS: NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.3) 1992 NA BILL 1992] Debate resumed from 19 August, on motion by Mr Johns: That the Bill be now read a second time.",98
396,Mr COSTELLO,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Higgins) (6.29 p.m.)The Crimes (Ships and Fixed Platforms) Bill will be supported by the Opposition in this place. The Bill implements international instruments which have been designed to deal with crimes consisting of unlawful acts against private ships, including merchant and passenger ships, and acts of violence or destruction against fixed platforms, such as ocean drilling platforms. The titles of the instruments are, respectively, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation, and the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf. The convention and the protocol were made in Rome in March of 1988 and came into force on 1 March this year. Under the terms of the convention and the protocol, the States that are parties agree to establish penalties for title. the offences set out therein. There is, of course, Commonwealth and State legislation in place relating to crimes at sea which in effect mean that the criminal law of a State will apply to an act committed at sea provided that the offender, the ship or the territory in which the act was committed had some connection with the State. There is, however, no legislation specifically dealing with crimes on fixed platforms. The events which prompted the steps leading to the adoption of the convention and the protocol were the events involved in what is now known as the hijacking of the Italian cruise liner the Achille lAuro. In October 1985""terrorists took command of the Achille lAuro 10 nautical miles from the coast of Egypt. They held the ship's crew and passengers hostage and threatened to kill them unless the Israeli Government released Palestinian prisoners. On 8 October 1985, when their demands were not met, in a shameful action the hijackers shot and killed a US citizen. Unaware of the killing, the Egyptian Government granted the hijackers safe passage in return for surrender of the passengers. Subsequently, the United States intercepted the Egyptian plane carrying the hijackers and forced it to land at a NATO air base in Sicily. At the trial that subsequently took place in Italy, only five of the 15 accused came before the court and three life sentences that were imposed were imposed in absentia on terrorists who were still at large. The making of the convention and the protocol was in part due to the uncertainties about the legal position of the parties involved. The Achille lAuro was a ship under an Italian flag. The hijacking took place in Egyptian waters. The murdered victim, Leon Klinghoffer, was a US citizen. I am sure that all members of the House share an outrage at that action. Against that background, the convention and the protocol were adopted at a conference of the International Maritime Organisation in Rome in March 1988. In essence, the Bill creates offences as required by the convention and protocol in relation to acts likely to endanger the safe navigation of a ship or the safety of an ocean drilling platform. Division 1 of part 2 of the Bill creates offences relating to ships as required by the convention. The offences are directed towards the prevention of unlawful acts which may endanger the safe navigation of private ships. These include: the forcible seizure or control of a ship; acts of violence against persons on board a ship likely to endanger its safe gation-for example, killing the master; damage to a ship; placing devices on a ship likely to destroy it-that is, sabotage; and the communication of information known to be false which endangers the safe navigation of a ship. Attempts and threats to commit these offences are also covered. In line with the seriousness of the offences and the requirement of the convention that states parties make the offences duly punishable by appropriate penalties, the Bill prescribes heavy penalties for division 1 offenders ranging from life imprisonment for forcible seizure of a vessel to two years imprisonment for· threatening to endanger the safe navigation of a vessel. Division 2 of part the Bill sets out the powers of a ship's master. They include the power to arrest and hold in custody any person he or she believes to have committed an offence under division 1 and to deliver that person to the appropriate authorities of any convention state. Clause 18 of the Bill sets out the circumstances in which the Act will apply. It will not apply to purely domestic offences. There must be an international element. The basic rule is that the ship concerned must at the time of the offence be either on an internatioParliamentary nal voyage, whether within Australian waters or not, or in the territorial sea or internal waters of a country other than Australia. The alleged offence must also have an Australian element or a convention state element. An Australian element is where the ship is Australian or the alleged offender is Australian. A convention state element is where the ship is flying the flag of a convention state or is in territorial waters of a convention state, or where a national of a convention state is the alleged offender or was seized, threatened, injured or killed during the commission of the offence. Part 3 of the Bill provides for a similarange of offences in relation to fixed platforms, as required by the protocol. They are directed towards the prevention of acts which may endanger the safety of fixed platforms. For the purposes of this Bill, the fixed platform must be outside the Australian territorial sea and there must also be an Australian or navi- protocol state element. Such an element would be present if the platform were on the Australian continental shelf or the offender were an Australian or another Australian party to the protocol would have jurisdiction under the protocol. Pursuant to clause 30, a prosecution for an offence on or against a ship or fixed platform cannot be commenced without the written consent of the Attorney-General. This does not prevent preliminary steps being taken, but committal proceedings could not commence without such consent. The explanatory memorandum states that the intention of the legislature is to prevent prosecutions being brought under the Bill in cases where prosecution 2 of under a different Commonwealth law or under a State or Territory law would be more appropriate, as well as where prosecution would not be appropriate at all. As I noted before, the Opposition will support the passage of the Bill. We support the convention and the protocol and therefore this Bill as a means of furthering international efforts to prevent terrorism and ensuring the prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators of terrorist acts. There is, however, one matter I would draw to the attention of the Secretary to the Attorney General (Mr Duncan). It is a matter that was raised on behalf of the Opposition in the Senate when the matter was raised there. The Parliamentary Secretary will notice that in part 2 of the Bill when it comes to acts of violence on board a ship under clause 9, destroying or damaging a ship under clause 10, putting destructive devices on a ship under clause 11, or giving false information under clause 13, it is stated in relation to offences that a person must not knowingly do an act that would endanger safety or must not do an act knowing it is likely to endanger safety. In other words, it is part of the offence to prove that the person concerned did it knowing that the action would be likely to endanger safety. That phraseology is not provided in clause 12, which deals with destroying or seriously damaging maritime or navigational facilities. I cannot see why the wording of the offences should change in relation to clause 12-that being a constituent element of the offence in the other clauses, why indeed it has been left out there. I raise it for the Parliamentary Secretary. It may well just be that that was an error. When the issue was raised in the Senate on behalf of the Opposition, the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) conceded the concerns and gave an undertaking that they would be looked at by the Government and, if need be, dealt with in this place. If the Minister would like to add that clause in this place, I would be happy to move it in due course. There is one matter that I want to expressly negative, which was raised in the second reading speech in relation to this Bill. That was the suggestion that the Bill makes it an offence to do certain acts in relation to oil drilling platforms, including, for example, seizing control of an oil platform and will have 'no application to other acts such as might be committed during an intense industrial dispute'. I have to tell honourable members that when I read that in the second reading speech I was absolutely flabbergasted. I could not for the life of me think that the Government would want to allow acts of violence on oil platforms committed during an intense industrial dispute. This is something that conceivably could happen. Indeed, there was an example on the North West Shelf, honourable members will recall, where certain people seized control of an oil platform. I was absolutely flabbergasted by this and I thought, 'Oh no, here they go again'. The Government, unable to apply the law without fear or favour and believing its special role in this place is to look after its special mates, namely the trade union movement, is going to try to put some kind of proviso in the legislation that will exempt criminal behaviour if it is done during an intense industrial dispute. The best thing that can be said is that the Act provides for no such thing, unless the intention is to use the discretionary power of the Attorney-General to institute or not institute proceedings in such a way as to exclude, by his discretionary fiat, criminal actions that are committed during industrial disputes. If that is the intention, the Government ought to have come clean. It stands condemned and shamed for trying to raise that possibility in a second reading speech. I hope that when the courts come to look at this matter they will ignore that second reading speech. It is certainly not the intention of the Parliament to exempt criminal action because it is done in the course of an industrial dispute. If there had been anything in the wording of the legislation which hinted at that we would have taken it out. I now come to the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill 1992, which we are debating cognately. This Bill seeks to amend a number of Acts dealing with Commonwealth criminal law. The Opposition will not oppose the passage of the Bill, although we do have some reservations about the amendments proposed to the Crimes Act 1914 as regards piracy, which I shall return to shortly. Part 2 of the Bill deals with amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988, most of which have been recommended to the Attorney General (Mr Duffy) by the Ministerial Advisory Group on the Operation of the Cash Transaction Reports Act. The bulk of the amendments are aimed at modifying the account verification scheme to make it more flexible. These amendments have been made in consultation with the industry and the Opposition supports them. I note that the statement on the financial impact in the explanatory memorandum says that the changes to the account verification provisions may reduce the costs of compliance to cash dealers. That is to be welcomed. The amendments make special provision with respect to certain specified groups of people who have changed their names-for example, people who change their names upon marriage or revert to a former name, having been previously known by the name of their spouse; people who change their names to protect their personal safety, having been victims of violence or threatened violence; or people who are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and who change their names to traditional names. People in these circumstances will be able to use a referee procedure to become a signatory to an account without having to meet the usual requirements in relation to documentation. The Bill proposes some sensible amendments to the Crimes Act 1914. Part 3 of the Bill will introduce a penalty units scheme Commonwealth legislation, as recommended by the Gibbs committee. That is a scheme whereby fines are expressed in terms of units-a certain offence carries a penalty of so many units. The definition of a unit may then be changed so that penalties can be effectively indexed across all Acts without amending sections. The proposal is to set the value of a penalty unit at $100. It is a sensible proposal. I know for a fact that in the State of Victoria a system of penalty units been operating for some time and it is obviously a convenient way of allowing for quick changes to pecuniary offences under the statute. The penalty units scheme will not apply to section 76 of the Trade Practices Act. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that again is one of those areas where the Government could not help itself. It recently increased fines against corporations under part IV of Trade Practices Act to $1Om and quarantined fines under sections 45D and 45E to $250,000 - the special rate for Labor's union mates. That is one-fortieth of the penalty. It is shameful. The penalties in that Act are not affected by this legislation, but perhaps they . ought to be. Perhaps we ought to express the penalties in units and we could increase them unilaterally and uniformly across the board. Perhaps that is the way in which we might do it when we increase the penalties when we are in government to make them equal and when the penalties, therefore, go to $1Om under sections 45D and 45E. Those opposite have not chosen to set that as the limit, and they may well regret that day. The Attorney-General really regrets that day. I have never seen him so ashen as when he sat in this place and had to hear about the heinousness of his own Government. The first law officer of the Crown sat there shamefacedly and had to suffer the indignity of legislation that introduced a special privilege in terms of penalty under a part of the Trade Practices Act. The Bill also amends the Crimes Act in relation to the commencement of prosecutions and it introduces a provision which sets the time limit in relation to the seriousness of the into offence. The Bill further amends the Crimes Act, as recommended by the Gibbs committee, by limiting the circumstances in which a court is restricted in imposing prison sentences. The present position, which was criticised as too general, is that, where a person who has not previously been sentenced to imprisonment is convicted of an offence relating to property or money whose total value is less than $2,000, the court is not to impose a sentence of imprisonment unless there are has exceptional circumstances. Pursuant to the amendments contained in this Bill, this limitation will apply only to offences against a limited number of specified provisions of the Crimes Act. So in relation to serious crimes that limitation would not apply. The Bill also inserts a new part into the this Crimes·Act relating to piracy. Because of the way in which this Bill and the Crimes (Ships and Fixed Platforms) Bill, which I have just the addressed, are drafted, the legislative provisions do overlap to some degree. I can see situations where one incident could give rise to possible offences under each of the Acts. I believe it may be necessary to clarify and delineate the Bills further in order to reconcile them. However, the amendments came out of the Law Reform Commission, which identified shortcomings in the present piracy lawprincipal of which was that piracy is set down by imperial Acts, various other State and Territory provisions and, indeed, the common law. There were many sources of the substantive law and the Law Reform Commission recommended replacing the various imperial and State Acts with a single Commonwealth offence. The Bill proposes to implement the recommendations and to make it an offence punishable by life imprisonment for a person to perform an act of piracy, which is defined as an act of violence, detention or depredation committed for private ends-'-I think the point about piracy is that it is done for private ends, whereas we might say that terrorism is done for political ends and not necessarily private enrichment-by the crew or passengers of a private ship or aircraft and directed against a ship or aircraft if done on the high seas or in the coastal sea of Australia or beyond the jurisdiction of any country if it' is committed against a ship, aircraft, persons or property. The definition is not entirely clear. Upon a wide reading, it could be interpreted to cover the internal seizure of a vessel or aircraft. This is because paragraph (b) does not require the relevant act of violence to be directed at 'another' ship or aircraft or a person on board 'another' ship or aircraft. The Law Reform Commission specifically addressed this issue in its report. It said: ... a final difficulty with the current wording of the Convention concerns the internal seizure of vessels. It is clear from the drafting history of the international provision that internal seizures were not intended to be piracy. The present form of the clause, however, is ambiguous, since it includes as piracy acts of violence for private ends by the crew or passengers of a private ship or aircraft against ""a ship, aircraft, person or property in a place outside the jurisdiction of any State"". This appears to have been intended to include attacks which take place on terra nullius rather than acts by passengers or crew againSt their own vessel on the high seas. The ambiguity should be removed by referring to acts against ""another ship or aircraft, or against persons or property on board another ship or aircraft"" in the definition of the proposed Australian offence. In order to avoid any confusion, perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary should confirm that the definition of 'act of piracy' in section 51 does not require that the perpetrator of the relevant act be from another vessel or aircraft. The convention's definition of piracy has also been criticised because of the requirement 'for private ends'. It is capable of excluding some acts of politically motivated terrorism. It seems that the 'private ends' limitation was included in the Bill upon the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission. It was of the view that politically motivated terrorism would be dealt with by the hijacking provisions in the Crimes (Aviation) Act and the Crimes (Ships and Fixed Platforms) Bill, which is the Bill I have just addressed. There may be examples where an Australian ship on an intrastate voyage is hijacked where that would not arguably be an act of piracy because it was not done for private ends, but it would not be an offence under the Crimes (Ships and Fixed Platforms) Bill because the provisions of that Bill apply only if there were that international element that I have already dealt with. We might say that that scenario could be dealt with by laws such as assault, robbery or kidnapping, but we can see situations where we might fall in between. The Act also makes minor amendments to eight other pieces of legislation. It broadens the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to grant indemnities in respect of proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 and the Customs Act 1901. It amends the Act to simplify the service of process on the Director and to enable the Director to arrange representation by State and Territory counterparts. There are amendments to the Customs Act providing for the Commissioner of Police to make decisions about the disposal of narcotics, and there are amendments to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 enabling Australia to comply with the Council of Europe Convention on laundering, search, seizure and confiscation of proceeds from crime. The amendments provide that documents are admissible if they are provided by a party to the money laundering convention where the proceeding arises from a request made by a foreign country for international assistance in a criminal matter. The coalition welcomes the extension of the ambit of the money laundering offences in sections 81 and 82 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. Currently not all foreign offences are covered; only those which are narcotics related and, by the extension of the definition, other serious offences will be covered, such as arms trafficking and kidnapping. The third Bill that we are debating cognately is the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3). In due course I will be moving a second reading amendment. I will also be moving some amendments in committee. They are amendments that have been circulated in my name. The second reading amendment will be to the effect that we should not decline to give the Bill a second reading. I do want to deal-I will deal with it when I come to it in due course-with the situation of private lawyers- having to gain admission in various States of the COnlmonwealth and the position of public lawyers under the Act. I am going to suggest that the public and the private sectors ought to be treated in the same way. The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus Bill which amends the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, and a number of others. It will insert a new section into Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act which, subject to certain exceptions, will require that persons whose interests are affected by a reviewable decision must be notified in writing of the decision and their rights of review. This is obviously a sensible thing because, if we are going to give people a right of review, it is of no use to them unless they know they have it. We welcome the fact that there is provision made in the Act. When the right of review was first brought in and it was realised that it might apply to the Australian Securities Commission, the Chairman of the Commission raised a concern that, under the ASC, it could lead to unbelievable notification requirements. Mr Hartnell suggested, for example, that if the ASC granted a public company's request to change the date of its annual meeting, then it would be required to notify every shareholder that this was a reviewable decision. He said that if a person got into a situation like that the ASC could be spending millions of dollars on notifying. When the Bill was debated in the other place, we raised this with the Government, and an amendment was moved and agreed to by us, the thrust of which would be to defer the application of that section to decisions made by the ASC under the corporations law for six months. After that period, the ASC will be required to comply with those requirements unless the regulations provide that particular decisions should be exempt. Whilst we are not opposing that amendment, I would like to add that we are not entirely satisfied with the solution put forward by the Government. Given that more than three months have elapsed since Mr Hartnell raised the matter with the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) one would have thought that the Government had more than enough time to determine and put before the House the specific exemptions, rather than this stopgap matter of just allowing for a six-month exemption, as it were. It will have to have to be fixed sooner or later, and it ought to be fixed sooner. We would have preferred to fix it today. No doubt, if the Parliament sits next year, we will be back here with the Law and the Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1993, fixing up some of the things that have not been fixed up in this Bill. I should make it clear, having raised this matter in relation to other law and justice legislation amendment Bills, that I do not blame the drafters for that; I blame the Government. If the Government allowed enough time to debate these Bills we could fix them up and we could make sure that, rather than having law and justice amendment Bills Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4, we could have just one for the year and do the whole thing at once. The next part of the legislation concerns amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982, amendments that we will oppose. In committee I will move amendments to delete some of the proposals that have been put forward. The Bill goes on to propose amendments to. the Judiciary Act which will be dealing with the position of public lawyers, and I will deal with that in relation to our second reading amendment. The Bill goes on to provide for amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination Act and to provide effectively that, than at the moment on a procedural application having to take a matter to the whole of the Commission, it will be possible to take it to the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. So the proposal will then be that a commissioner's decision in certain circumstances can be reviewed by the President, which we see as sensible. There are other provisions into insurance, cross-vesting and family law for consent to step-parent adoptions. The Opposition supports these omnibus amendments in relation to those Acts. As I have already indicated, I will be moving a second reading amendment in respect of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) and I will be moving some amendments in committee in due course. We have reservations about the position that would prevail in relation to public lawyers vis-a-vis private lawyers which would come out of this Bill. We also have reservations as to the effect of amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982, and I will deal with those in due course.",99
397,Mr SCIACCA,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (6.57 p.m.)-In the cognate debate on the Crimes (Ships and Fixed Platforms) Bill, the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) and the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill I will talk mainly about this Government's ongoing fight against fraud· and organised crime in this country. Through the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill 1982, the Government is proposing amendments to a number of Acts dealing with Commonwealth criminal law. In such a short time. I will not retrace the technical detail already outlined the second reading speech of my good friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney General (Mr Duncan); I would rather talk in a more general sense. We are proposing changes to account opening procedures which will make them more flexible and streamlined which, in tum, will lead to reduced costs to cash dealers. The requirement to hold account information and .signatory information in relation to each account replaces the requirement for the cash dealer to obtain a signed statement each time rather an account is opened ot a new signatory added. The amendment will also enable identifying cash dealers to utilise alternative methods of identifying verifications approved by the director of the CTRA. These amendments implement recommendations of the ministerial advisory committee on the CTR Act. Under the Act, a person who opens or operates an account in a name other than one relation by which he or she is commonly known commits an offence. The new provision enables those who adopt a new name by marriage-women who have returned to the use of a former name due to marriage breakdown, victims of violence or threatened violence, lind Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who wish to become commonly known by a traditional name-to open a bank account in that name. These changes have been brought about in response to requests by individuals and government agencies on behalf of these people. Through this Bill the definition of 'primary identification document' will be extended to make it easier to achieve the 70 points in the 100-point method. Currently, the States are enacting legislation requiring the reporting of suspect transactions to the Cash Transaction Reports Agency. The use of the centralised facilities of the CTRA has several advantages, one of them being the maintenance of an overview of suspect transactions to detect organised criminal activity through the analysis of information by the CTRA. The Government has done a lot in this country over the past decade to combat the black economy. I want to talk a bit about the black economy because, unlike the Opposition in which seems to think that the black economy will be virtually wiped out by the introduction of a GST, we are somewhat more realistic. Mr Costello-It will be.",105
398,Mr SCIACCA,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I want the honourable member for Higgins to listen to me. I will explain to him in a legalistic sense, if he likes, how that is not going to happen. This Government has developed more relevant measures to attack the underground economy by enforcing compliance with the existing tax system through the prescribed payments systems; the Cash Transaction Reports Agency; tax file numbers; the 1987-88 tax amnesty, which waived penalties on people filing missed returns from earlier years and coming clean about earlier income; and audits which match taxpayers' declared income with their expenditure and living standards. All these measures were implemented by this Government. Many were opposed by the coalition. The best those opposite have been able to come up with is the GST, which is currently being pictured everywhere across the country as a dead cat, albatross, ball and chain and any other symbol possible that signifies political death. Senator Jim Short, the coalition's finance spokesmen, said on about 1 July last year, 'I mean, a consumption tax will not stamp out the black economy'. That was a simple but 'true statement. We, on the other hand, as evidenced by these Bills before us today, are always diligently at work making practical inroads into the cash economy. It always intrigues me how the cash, black, underground or hidden economy has been held up as a major reason for the introduction of a GST. I would like a dollar for every time. I have heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) running around the country saying, 'But it is going fix up the black economy' - the argument being that a GST would tax people who would otherwise avoid paying tax. The cash economy includes drug trafficking, illegal gambling, prostitution and crime generally. How on earth did the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition think a dead catthat is, a GST-would magically stop these activities? Ms MCHugh-They can't.",105
399,Mr SCIACCA,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"They cannot, as the Minister at the table says; it is impossible. The cash economy also includes more commonplace activities such as babysitting, lawn mowing, car washing and home maintenance services provided for cash. In service industries which involve a high labour input-such as the services provided by a plumber, electrician or motor mechanic-there will always be an incentive for dishonest people to avoid declaring income for tax by accepting and not declaring cash payments. A GST would not change this. In fact, it is an incentive for avoidance. As Professor Head from Monash University said last year: In basic structural terms the GST simply fails to address the black economy issue. The same tax evading tradesman who falls outside the income tax net would likewise evade GST. Just for the record, the International Monetary Fund, which has been a prime advocate of GSTs and VATs, stated in 1991: In general terms, neither a retail sales tax nor a VAT can tax the unofficial or black economy. To press the point further, Fightback's own supplementary paper No.6, which summarises several overseas studies on the size of the black economy in various countries, shows that the two countries with the smallest black economies were two countries which did not have VATs then and do not now; namely, Switzerland and the USA. In juxtaposition, Belgium at the top of the table did have a VAT. While we go on forever tightening current legislation, as with these Bills today, to maintain our national and international fight against crime and to make sure that there is to increased equity in the tax system, those opposite wildly swing their dead cat around and try to sell it as a perfumed flower. Fortunately, Australians, though maybe not in general terms economically educated or across the fine detail of Fightback or One Nation, can still fall back on their acute sense of smell. They know a dead cat when they smell one. It does not matter how much birthday cake they stick in its mouth, rigor mortis has firmly set in and no-one will bring it back. Mr MCGauran- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. My patience has been tested to the limit. I would draw your attention to the relevance of the honourable member's contribution to the legislation before the House, which has nothing whatsoever to do with the Opposition's proposal in regard to the GST package. His comments are far away from the Bill before the House.",106
400,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Mr Jenkins)The cognate debatt. i- on three Bills relating to criminal law. The Parliamentary Secretary is in order. He will continue. Mr MCGauran- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a further point of order: would you be good enough to inform the House where the GST is encompassed in the three pieces of legislation before the House?",106
401,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Order! The honourable member for Gippsland will resume his seat. The Parliamentary Secretary is relating his comments to the black economy and crime.,107
402,Mr SCIACCA,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for that ruling. These Bills relate measures that we are taking on this side of the House to try to do something about the black economy. It is important to compare these with what the Opposition would do in its platform. Let me give the House an example of how a consumption tax cannot possibly wipe out the black economy. If anything, it would exacerbate the situation. Everyone who knows anythihg about anything knows that a lot of this sort of goes on around the place. Let us take the example of a plumber who comes along to Mrs Joe Blow's house and says, 'Yes, 1 can do that job, but it is going to cost you $3,000'. The consumer says, 'Gee, that's a bit dear'. The plumber says, 'If you pay in cash underneath the hand I will do it for $2,500'. The consumer gets a good deal with a $500 discount. The tradesman gets only $2,500 in cash but does not present it for taxation purposes. The Government misses out in terms of taxation and the consumerMr MCGauran-But he's doing that now.",107
403,Mr SCIACCA,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I have not got to what the GST situation is. The honourable member for Gippsland should just listen. What happens is that under those circumstances the consumer is $500 better off, because she gets a discount on the deal, while the plumber ends up receiving $2,500 and never pays tax. What happens now-when 1 say 'now', I mean in the unlikely event that this mob across the road were to get in-is that the same plumber goes up to Mrs Joe Blow and says, 'I'm sorry, Mrs Joe Blow, but the amount you're going to have to pay me is $3,000 and of course you have to add the 15 per cent GST onto that. That adds up to $3,450'-1 think that will be the amount'But, Mrs Joe Blow, if you give me $3,000 in cash we can forget about the $450'. Under those circumstances, not only does the Government still miss out but also the consumer misses out while the tradesman ends up getting his full $3,000. If the honourable member for Gippsland is able to say to me that in his worldly way he does not think that is going to happen, 1 think he also believes in fairies. The reality is that the black economy will be exacerbated. It will not be wiped out. to In fact, there will be an incentive for it. The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1992 makes amendments of a minor policy nature to legislation within the Attorney-General's portfolio and also makes some minor technical amendments to legislation. The proposed amendments will not have any significant financial impact. The legislation includes an amendment to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 where there thing is a requirement that persons affected by reviewable decisions be notified in writing of the decisions and of their rights of review. It also makes certain provisions relating to the Office of the Australian Government Solicitor within the Attorney-General's Department. 1 understand that office is now going to a user pays system. The Bill will give officers certain rights and privileges as those in the private legal profession have, as well as the duties and obligations. I will be quite interested to hear the answers to the queries raised by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) with respect to that. 1 will be interested in what happens within the private legal profession as well as the public one. This Government continues to tighten its legislation to make Australia a fairer and more equitable place in which to live-unlike those opposite who, judging by their policies, are trying to create an Australia that is not fair and equitable, but an Australia where we have a class of the haves and the have-nots. The Leader of the Opposition talks about the GST cleaning up the black economy, whereas the reality is that in countries where a GST or VAT is in operation there is an industry based upon defrauding the tax office. Fraudulent traders can run separate cash register rolls to avoid disclosing sales. VAT fraud in the United Kingdom is reportedly rife in the building industry. An article in the Australian Financial Review of 30 July 1987 said that, during 1984, the Building Employers Confederation estimated that work valued at about two billion pounds was undertaken by what it called cowboy builders who trade for cash only. The article goes on to say that for many householders the chance to avoid paying VAT provides the incentive. For others, paying for repairs or renovations in cash is the only way they can get the work done quickly. Evasion of VAT or GST provides the link between the customer looking for cut price services and the worker who benefits undeclared income. According to the Leader of the Opposition and my friends opposite, that is how the black economy is going to be believes that. fixed up. 1 think that the only things that will be being cleaned up around here will, in fact, be the Leader of the Opposition and the have Opposition. 1 will not continue. 1 know that the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Mrs MCHugh), who is at the table, would like me to continue and keep talking about these sorts of things but will not because 1 think that we have made the point. 1 hope that the honourable member for Higgins has, in fact, listened and now understands why there is just no way in the world that what the Opposition is proposing will get rid of the black economy. these Bills to the House. They carry my full support.",107
404,Mr MCGAURAN,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT," I am moved to contribute to this debate following the contribution by the Parliamenper tary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca). He tells us Government is responsible for a fairer and more equitable society and that, consequently, this legislation will work further towards objective. It seems to me that the more the Government members shout these slogans and cliches, the more they truly begin to believe them. It is only in the bubble of Parliament House and Canberra at large that one can be so removed from the horrendous reality affecting our society. Our society is anything but fair and equitable. The gulf between the rich and poor in society has never been so wide as it has been and is under this Government, and that will continue into the future. So let us not have any of this empty rhetoric about fair and equitable societies. The Government is responsible for impoverishing, particularly through unemployment, more than one million Australians. That is the figure when one takes into account those who have given up work and those who are underemployed. The Government is responsible for throwing so many people, in both human and economic terms, on to the scrap heap. Personally, nothing enrages me more-I know my colfrom leagues as well-than the Government's smug, self-satisfied, self-serving slogans about equitable and fair society. Nobody at large The ignorance of Government members with regard to the goods and services tax, 1 to accept, is honest, rather than dissembling of the truth. For instance, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security talked about the building industry to and tried to show that the experience of a 1 VAT in the United Kingdom led to wholesale evasion in the building industry. We have learnt the lessons from the introduction overseas of value added taxes or goods and services taxes or consumption taxes. Consequently, in the Fightback package, the con1 commend struction industry is exempt. Do Government members understand what an exempt industry is or what a zero rated industry is? An exempt industry means that the construction industry does not charge 15 cent. Consequently, the scope for fraud or evasion is minimal, if not non-existent. Under that the us it is an exempt industry. Another point that particularly angered me was, of course, when the honourable member that for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) tried to argue that goods and services tax would, if anything, promote fraud and evasion. To anybody who has a basic understanding of the introduction of a broad-based goods and services tax nothing could be more ridiculous. Let me explain it for the honourable member and any other Government member who does not understand the essentials of a goods and services tax. For businesses to receive a refund of the per cent goods and services tax on their inputs, they have to register. When the goods and services tax was introduced in New Zealand four or five years ago, overnight suddenly there were thousands of new businesses that the tax department was never aware of. Businesses have to register and get a goods and services tax number so that they can claim the rebate. That way the Tax Office is able to track their income and set it off against their rebates. The honourable member gave the example of the plumber going to somebody and saying, 'The job is going to cost $3,000. With 15 per cent goods and services tax, it will be $3,450. If you give me $3,000 cash in hand, we will forget about the $450'. The point is that if that plumber is registered, with a GST number, all of his or her input costs are so much lower: fuel tax and sales tax; if it is a big. enough firm, payroll tax, but payroll tax indirectly affects everybody; and, of course, training guarantee levy; compulsory superannuation-all those business taxes we will abolish, or those which indirectly feed into even the single tradesman or tradeswoman. So the 15 per cent quoted to the customer is applied to a much lower base because of the abolition of the taxes. The $3,000 job that he quotes will be considerably less, roughlywho knows? It could be $2,500 or thereabouts. So everybody has to understand that the 15 per cent is going on top of significantwant 1y reduced costings for all goods and services. That applies particularly in the supennarket. It is a lie for any Government member to claim that the price of goods and services is going up by 15 per cent. On the Government's own figures, the one-off increase in the cost price index, the CPI, would be 3.6 per cent; on the Opposition's reckoning it would be 4.4 per cent, but it is roughly 4 per cent. If that plumber is not registered for GST rebatable purposes, but decides to continue in the black economy, then we catch that plumber with the spending on every day items or with the purchase of petrol for the vehicle or for the hand tools or for the services of an accountant or a lawyer. We are all consumers. 15 If the consumer does not get a rebate, as in business, or compensation by way of pension increases or by personal income tax cuts, then, of course, we catch you. It is elementary. If the consumer pays a goods and services tax on everything he purchases, except for those exemptions such as in the areas of health, education, charitable organisations, the construction industry, the finance industry, and exports, then of course we catch you. We are all consumers. The goods and services tax therefore is not a foolproof method of ensuring that everybody pays his proper liability for tax, but it is better, more equitable and more effective than any other system of taxation yet imposed. Mr Broadbent-It's fairer.",108
405,Mr MCGAURAN,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"As the honourable member for Corinella quickly reminds me, it is fairer. The prescribed payments system and withholding tax are not as broad based as the GST. The GST will catch everybody, whether or not they are registered for GST rebates or whether they continue to operate in the black economy. The ignorance of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security is staggering. I know that generally he is an honest man. I will take it that he will read my comments in Hansard and divest himself of the empty rhetoric and misleading statements to which he has unfortunately subjected the House tonight.",109
406,Mr HOLLIS,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I to make a brief comment in this cognate debate. I will not rage, as some honourable members have done, on goods and services. I will confine my remarks to the Crimes (Ships and Fixed Platforins) Bill. This legislation will enable Australia to become a party to two international instruments relating to the prevention of maritime terrorism: the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against Maritime Navigation, and the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against Fixed Platfonns Located on the Continental Shelf. The convention and the protocol, made in March 1988, came into force on 1 March this year. This Bill will make the changes which are necessary to our domestic law for Australia to become party to them. Once the Bill is passed, Australia will accede to the convention and the protocol. As has been stated earlier, the impetus for the convention and the protocol was the hijacking of the Achille Lauro in the Mediterranean Sea, during which an American tourist was murdered. That incident exposed deficiencies in international law which were fatal to attempts to bring most of the terrorists to justice. This was due, at least in part, to uncertainties about the legal position of each of the parties involved. The ship sailed under the Italian flag, the first port of call after the hijack in Egypt, and the principal victim was a citizen of the USA. Safe passage for the hijackers out of Egypt was arranged. The Egyptian aircraft carrying them was, however, intercepted by United States Navy aircraft and forced to divert to a NATO base in Sicily. The United States then tried to take them into custody. Italy objected to this and refused the United States request for extradition of the hijackers. Italy also permitted Abul Abbas, who had been the hijackers' shore contact, to leave Italy on the basis that he had diplomatic immunity. Fifteen people were subsequently tried in Italy. Of those, only five appeared before the court. One was a juvenile and was later tried and convicted by the juvenile court. Nine, including Abul Abbas, were tried in absentia. Life sentences were imposed on three terrorists who were still at large, including Abul Abbas. Much of the uncertainty which characterised the handling of the affair arose because of the special position of terrorism with respect to criminal liability. There are now many international conventions dealing with aspects of terrorism. Until 1 March 1992, however, when the convention on maritime safety and the protocol on fixed platforms came into force, there was nothing specifically dealing with the question of terrorism at sea. The nations involved, therefore, had to try to sort out jurisdiction on the basis of existing international law, such as hostage taking and piracy. The Achille Lauro incident did not fit neatly into any such law and this was the cause of great difficulties between the countries involved. If this convention had been in force between the parties when the incident occurred, Italy, as the flag state, and Egypt, as the state in whose territory the offenders were foUnd, would each have had jurisdiction. Each would have had two options: initiate prosecutions themselves or grant extradition to another state with jurisdiction under the convention. The USA, as the state of the victim's nationality, could have established jurisdiction under the non-compulsory jurisdictional provisions of the convention. Any party in whose state was any of the offenders were present would have been obliged to ensure that the alleged offenders did not escape prosecution. As most of the points have been covered, I will not continue. I realise that the time is late and there are some amendments to be moved. I welcome this legislation and commend it to the House.",109
407,Mr DUNCAN,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT," in reply-The hour is late and I will attempt to deal as briefly as possible with matters that have been raised. Before doing so, I thank honourable members who have contributed to the debate. I will not rise to the bait that was set for us all by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) in his contribution. Given the hour, I will note the fact that the proceedings are not being broadcast and bring that to his attention. The speech he gave seemed to intimate that he thought he was· broadcasting to a wider audience than we have gathered here this evening. I want particularly to deal with two or three matters that were raised by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). In particular, I come firstly to the second reading amendment that he has foreshadowed and deal with that briefly. The second reading amendment that he has foreshadowed states: ... ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that lawyers in the Government sector should be subject to the same regulatory requirements and regulatory costs as lawyers in the private sector"". The Government cannot accept that amendment. It is not prepared to accept it because these rules exist at the State level to protect the public, and similar considerations do not apply to Commonwealth Government lawyers. In saying that, I want to make it clear that the Attorney-General's lawyers who are admitted as practitioners will be subject, and always have been subject, to judicial control of the courts. That is not in issue and will not be in issue. The lawyers of the Attorney-General's Department, however, are in the situation where, whilst not subject to State or Territory regulatory regimes, they are already subject to regulatory regimes as officers of the Commonwealth, and those include: the Parliament, parliamentary committees, representations from members of parliament, parliamentary questions and annual reports to Parliament, administrative law, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, the Ombudsman and the AAT. They are also subjected to the requirements of the Audit Act 1901 and the finance directions made under that Act. They are subjected to the disciplinary procedures under the Public Service Act 1922 and, in addition, they are subjected to sanctions under the Crimes Act applying to officers of the Commonwealth in particular. These regimes, of course, are not applicable to private practitioners. I could go on at some length, but suffice it to sum up this point by saying that if the Attorney-General's legal practice was to be subject to the control of State regulatory regimes on the grounds of eliminating any competitive advantage, then perhaps private practitioners when acting for Commonwealth clients should be subject to the Commonwealth regulatory regimes. Clearly, that would not be appropriate, and the situation is that the normal regulatory regimes of the various law societies and bar associations in the States and Territories are quite specifically designed to protect the public, to protect the public's financial interests and the like. Any officer of the AttomeyGeneral's Department acting in a court as a solicitor or barrister or both would clearly already be in a situation where his or her clients would be well protected in that regard and would not require additional protection of the sort that applies with private lawyers. I want to come now to a couple of other issues that have been raised by the shadow Attorney, in particular his concerns with the Crimes (Ships and Fixed Platforms) Bill, clause 12, where he has pointed out, as was done in the Senate, that a particular offence does not require the person to undertake the action set out in that clause knowingly. What is set out in that clause is that a person must not destroy or seriously damage maritime navigational facilities or seriously interfere with' - their operation, if that act is likely to endanger the safe navigation of a private ship. The first thing I want to point to is the fact that it would be the obligation of the prosecu\ tion to prove that the act was likely to endanger the safe navigation of a private ship. It would also be obligatory on the prosecution to prove that the act had caused serious damage to maritime navigational facilities or had seriously interfered with their operation. The reason why the requirement for knowing actions is not in that clause is, quite simply, that when persons sail on the seas they ought not to be negligent in their approach to maritime navigational facilities. It is obviously necessary, or highly desirable, that those sorts of facilities be safe from the actions of people who may well damage them negligently. There is a real need. to ensure a fairly strict regime of protection for those types of facilities. For example, under clause 11(1): A person must not, without lawful excuse, place or cause to be placed on a private ship, by any means, a device or substance that is likely to destroy the ship. (2) A person must not place or cause to be placed in a private ship, by any means, a device or substance that is likely to cause damage to the ship or its cargo knowing that it is likely to endanger the safe navigation of the ship. Those sorts of offences are in a different class of offence and it was felt appropriate to provide a criminal burden of proof, .criminal knowledge at least, of the individual charged or the individual who has undertaken the act. The Government believes that that is the appropriate level of knowledge under section 12 and it stands by the provisions as they are printed in the Bill. Finally, I want to refer to the comments that the shadow Minister made in relation to industrial disputes. I thought he warmed to the theme, and it reminded me of his illustrious headline hunting past at the industrial bar. I could see the warmth and the enthusiasm come into him as he dealt with this particular matter. I say to him that the Bill will not apply to acts such as those which might be committed during a peaceful industrial dispute or during a peaceful protest. If, however, action taken during such protests or disputes had the effect of endangering a ship or fixed platform, then clearly proceedings could be brought under the Bill's provisions. I think that clearly resolves that particular matter. I do not wantto deal with other matters and detain the House any longer. There is a further amendment which is to be dealt with in committee. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Duncan) read a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.3) 1992 Second Reading Debate resumed from 3 November, on motion by Mr Duncan: That the Bill be now read a second time.",110
408,Mr COSTELLO,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"Higgins) (7.33 p.m.)I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, House is of the opinion that lawyers ment sector should be subject to the same regulatory requirements and regulatory costs as lawyers in the private sector"". I will expllj.in very briefly what the amendment is. It is to make the point that, when government lawyers are competing with private lawyers in the private sector, they should be subject to the same requirements and should not be given additional benefits. This is going to increasingly become an issue when the Australian Government Solicitor starts charging and when government departments are able to choose whether they send their work to a government solicitor or a private solicitor. . What worries me is that the effect of the amendments are that anybody who is the Attorney-General's lawyer or the AGS lawyer, which includes people right down the tree, will be entitled to practise as a barrister or solicitor in any court in any State or Territory; in other words, they will not have to be separately admitted. If there is a private firm that is conducting a national practice and the partners, for example, are admitted in New South Wales and they want to practise in Victoria, they all have to go down to Victoria and get themselves admitted. If they want to practise in South Australia, they have to go to South Australia and go through the whole rigmarole and get themselves admitted. That takes time, cost and licensing. They may be tendering for government work against the Government Solicitor, which does not have that written in as an overhead. In relation to the second reading amendment, let us by all means try to encourage privatisation in the Attomey-General's Department, but it has to be done on the level playing field. The lawyers in the AttomeyGeneral's Department should not be given an advantage over the private profession. The day may come-and I hope this is the great answer-where lawyers do not have to be separately admitted in all the States; there will be a common uniform right of practice. It is not here yet, but this Bill would give it to government lawyers whilst denying it to private lawyers. The second reading amendment makes sure that it is clear that we the believe that there should be equal competition in the Govern- between the two.",112

As the Attorney General's Department increasingly begins to compete in the market for government work against private firms, it may well be said that just about anything relates to its commercial activities-the number of staff, their salaries, how they cost matters and their overheads. Once one puts an exemption in the Freedom to of Information Act as wide as that, one asking for a department to remove itself from public scrutiny. We oppose that. There already is provision in the Freedom of Information Act to exempt documents, the disclosure of which could reasonably expected to have an adverse effect on the proper arid efficient conduct of an agency. There are already provisions in the Act that cover situations such as this. One is taking the whole of the agency in respect of those activities and effectively exempting it from the Act. I suppose we must take cognisance of the fact that this Bill originated in the Attorney-General's Department. What happens to be in the Bill? A very broad exemption from the Freedom of Information Act for the Attorney-General's Department. I believe this is an example where the Parliament ought really to exercise some kind of scrutiny over the legislation that is coming through. That exemption is far too wide and it should not go through in this Bill. It ought to be taken out of this Bill. If the Government wants to come up with a narrower one at a later stage, we will look. at that then.",113
411,Mr DUNCAN,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"Makin-Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (7.39 p.m.) to - The Government cannot and will not agree it with these amendments. The shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for to Higgins (Mr Costello), really must have mov- this a little tongue in cheek. Every member of the Opposition would be cheering to the fact that this Government has moved, in effect, to commercialise the activities of the Attorney-General's Department. It is quite !I. '.clear and patently obvious that, if the Australian Government Solicitor is going to act in a commercial fashion in the markets place seeking work from clients in competiwith private lawyers, they obviously have to be in a position where they can com ete. . p If clients of the Australian Government Solicitor-that is, those people who go to the Australian Government Solicitor for their legal advice-know that their business will be subject to the freedom of information legislation, then obviously, in many instances, those clients will choose not to do that and will go a private solicitor or firm of sqlicitors. That is would be a quite serious commercial disadvantage for the Australian Government Solicitor. I do not think anybody in this chamber who supports what is being done to commercialise the activities of the Australian Governbe ment Solicitor would support that. I am surprised that the shadow Attorney-General of the operations has raised that. If we wanted to set up the Australian Government Solicitor to compete effectively for Government work and other work, the inevitable corollary was that its commercial activities had to be taken out from under the Freedom of Information Act. Sunshine is a very desirable thing. It is a pity that more of the activities of the commercial sector at large are not made available for public scrutiny. But that is the nature of the beast to some extent; it does not happen. If the Australian Government Solicitor is to compete and seek clients who will give it legal work, then inevitably it has to compete on an equal footing. That means that it has to be able to provide the same level of confidentiality as a firm of private lawyers. As the honourable member knows, one of the things that the legal profession holds highest in its lexicon is its right to confidenanti-pollution tiality between itself and its clients. That inevitably has to be the case, and it has to be the case in relation to government lawyers and their clients just the same as it has to be between private lawyers and their clients.

412,Mr SOMLYAY,ADJOURNMENT,"Fairfax) (7.44 p.m.)Quite often big problems have simple and low cost solutions. Honourable members will agree that the pollution of Australia's waterways is an issue of the greatest concern to members on both sides of the House. The oil slicks and fish kills, the foul stench and the hazards to health, have become facts of life for us today, particularly for those of us who have coastal electorates or electorates containing major rivers in regional Australia. This pollution enters our rivers, estuaries and oceans as a direct result of the discharge of industrial waste water into the nation's stormwater drainage systems. The toughest laws in the world are of no avail if there is no simple, practical and costeffective way of complying with these laws. The problem has become a nightmare for authorities at all levels of government in Australia. There is a solution, and I have personally seen it. Last week I visited a small, wholly Australian-owned company in my electorate. This company has invented and developed the world's first waste water diversion system which automatically directs polluted water to its appropriate destination for treatment, such as the sewer, while allowing clean rainwater to flow to the stormwater drain. Pollution is created when vehicles such as buses, trucks, aircraft and heavy machinery are washed down and when rain falls on contaminated slab areas such as service stations, car parks, industrial bin areas, stockyards and vehicle maintenance depots. The list is endless. The Fox waste water diversion system is a simple mechanical device that automatically diverts pollution arising from the washing down of equipment or from contaminated sites to the sewer for treatment, and when at rest allows clean rainwater to flow to the stormwater drain. The potential of this product to clean up Australia's waterways and export to the world is awesome. Many of our rapidly developing Asian neighbours have a massive industrial waste water problem. This Australian company's product could well provide the answer. My constituent company does not seek government subsidies or handouts. It seeks only to be helpful to the environment; to market an Australian product here and abroad; and to create jobs and earn export income. It can save government departments, the defence forces, and various statutory authorities millions of dollars each year in solving their own pollution problems at a fraction of the cost of methods currently being employed. The potential of this company to generate employment and to earn export income for Australia is unlimited. I urge Ministers in this place to bring this product to the attention of their departments, and urge honourable members to convey this pollution solution to constituents experiencing difficulty in complying with anti-pollution legislation. I thank the House. Bougainville",114
413,Mr MACK,ADJOURNMENT,"North Sydney) (7.47 p.m.)Bougainville is part of the territory of Papua New Guinea, - hich is a sovereign and independent nation. Yet Australia has become deeply involved in the growing secessionist conflict in Bougainville. The Australian Government has a direct connection with Bougainville through the supply of equipment and material to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force and through its funding of security operations there. Iroquois helicopters used by the Papua New Guinea defence forces in Bougainville are supplied by Australia. They are flown by Australian civilian pilots under contract, and payments to these pilots are met with funds made available from the Commonwealth's defence budget. We have acknowledged that these Australian pilots are mercenaries. They were exempted. in 1989 from the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978, which would normally prohibit such activities and punish offenders with criminal penalties. If it were South Africa or some other country playing the role that Australia is in Bougainville, we would no doubt have a parliamentary delegation and editorialists around the country passing moral judgments and demanding UN intervention. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) informed the House yesterday that he had stressed in talks with the Papua New Guinea Government the need for a peaceful solution in Bougainville through dialogue and reconciliation, but the reality is otherwise. The incursion in September by Papua New Guinea forces into the territory. of the neighbouring Solomon Islands has elevated the Bougainville conflict into an international concern. Papua New Guinea commandos recently violated the sovereignty of the Solomon Islands by raiding a town and killing two people. The reaction of the Government of the Solomon Islands shows that Australia has not escaped a share of the responsibility for this violation. It was inevitable that there would be Australian casualties. An Australian helicopter pilot was wounded by gunfire while flying one of the Iroquois helicopters over Bougainville. The pilot has been flown back to Australia and is receiving treatment in the Cairps District Hospital. In its efforts to retain control of the Bougainville situation, the Papua New Guinea Government has resorted to economic sanctions and a blockade. The enforcement of the PNG national authority \ ,against rebel forces by specific· actions has now widened into a denial of the basic needs of the civilian population, including medical supplies. Members of this Parliament seem to have little hesitation in junketing around the world and making pronouncements on human rights in many countries. References to human rights have been made in this House some 526 times during the life of the current Parliament. In the Senate they are even more common-812 times. I would therefore have expected parliament to recognise a human rights violation when it saw one. The Papua New Guinea Government's Bougainville blockade is a serious violation. It should also be recognised that Australia is implicated in this through our supply of personnel, equipment and funds to put the blockade into effect. Yet there has been an almost deafening silence on the subject of human rights in Bougainville. Australia supports the national integrity of Papua New Guinea and the retention of Bougainville as an integral part of it. However, I doubt whether the policies currently being pursued by Papua New Guinea and Australia will in the end achieve that objective. It needs to be asked whether Australia, in relinquishing its colonial responsibilities in Papua New Guinea in 1975, left the nation with an appropriate structure. Was enough account taken of Papua New Guinea's regional differences in setting out the constitutional .arrangements? The picture of a centralist government attempting to impose by force of anns its will on a rebellious outlying island raises· serious doubts about that. I am conscious that Papua New Guinea is noW a sovereign nation and that it is not open to Australia to send the country back to the drawing board. It is, however, open to Australia to have some influence as we have provided some $4 billion to that country since its independence. We took such a role in Cambodia and have attempted to do so in many other places. We ought to be able to do as much in Papua New Guinea, which has much closer links with Australia. We must try to turn Papua New Guinea policy on Bougainville away from a military solution and towards a political one. Australia must also learn from its Vietnam experience and refuse to be dragged into another country's civil war. Australia's role in Bougainville is not one of which we can be proud. Funding and supplying mercenaries in another country will not pass unnoticed or without repercussions. Soccer Clubs: Ethnic Names",115
414,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I draw attention to what has been described over recent months as the ethnic cleansing of Australian soccer-in other words, the decision by the Australian Soccer Federation to order all national league clubs to drop their ethnic names and adopt local or regional names. This has been set in motion by the ASF to try to wipe the ethnicity of soccer away in order to ostensibly make it more palatable to the Australian population. Until September 1992, soccer clubs playing in the national league were free to play under whatever name was selected by their members. However, since then, no name deemed by the Soccer Federation to denote a foreign country, province, city or town, or any name with political connotations, may be used as a club name. This has effectively eliminated most ethnic names from the national league. Eight clubs out of a total of 14 were affected. For example, Adelaide City Juventus, with mainly Italian support, is now Adelaide City. Melbourne· Croatia was converted to Melbourne CSC. Heidelberg Alexander, with a mainly Greek support base, is now, ironically, Heidelberg, which is a German name. At the same time, Marconi Fairfield, with an obviously Italian connotation, is still Marconi Fairfield. Surely this in itself is selectively discriminatory and a contradiction. Some clubs agreed to change their names under protest, while others that originally refused a name change were threatened with expulsion-not only from the Australian Soccer Federation but also from the World Soccer Federation, as explained in an article by Peter Desira in the Melbourne Herald-Sun of 8 September 1992. On the purely practical side, according to Tom Anderson, writing in the Soccer Weekly of 10 November 1992, clubs are finding that their attendances have dropped 10 per cent already. It would seem that soccer crowds are diminishing rather than increasing as a result of the ASF action. Perhaps more importantly, the banning of ethnic names from Australian soccer is a violation of the civil rights of thousands of Australians who have, because of their ethnic origin, been denied the right to freely name their associations and who are now forced to identify with and assemble under names designated by others. Article 1 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, signed in  Hasluck for Australia, says: Racial discrimination shall mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. Under article 2, section (D), signatories are obligated to take measures to prevent and arrest discrimination carried out by individuals, groups or organisations. This means that the Australian Government has an obligation under international law to prevent discrimination on the grounds of ethnic origin. Why has this not been done? Article 3 of the same document also prohibits any differentiation on the grounds of ethnic or national origin, while article 5 requires that the right of groups to a separate identity be respected. Any argument that ethnic cleansing should take place because of crowd violence can be arrives. refuted by making comparisons with the hooliganism of some elements among spectain tors in certain other well-known sporting codes. Should not the Minjster for the Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) be acting positively to uphold the international agreement previously referred and forcing the Australian Soccer Federation to rescind its ruling? Regarding the renaming of soccer clubs on booklet says: the grounds of racial discrimination, imagine In in the UK, the home of rugby, how Celtic time hearts would cringe if the London-Welsh and London-Scottish rugby teams were forced to cannot change their names to, say, the Richmond an Rovers and the Richmond Rascals. Imagme the outrage in Australia if the Celtic Club, the Office. Danish Club, the Swiss Club and the myriad I of other clubs of ethnic origin were ordered to change their names for any reason whatso-1. ever. This ignominy should be redressed. I '. seek leave to table certain documents in relation to the international conventions referred to earlier. Leave granted. Sales Tax: Primary Producers",116
415,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,"In the nuddle of the busiest season for many thousands of Australia's 165,000 farmers-when they are about to be out harvesting their crops 19 hours a day, seven days a week-the Government and the Australian Taxation Office are about to hit farmers without many of these hard working men and women even noticing. The so-called sales tax simplification has run well behind schedule. I raised this matter yesterday in a media release and today the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in response to a question here was unable to provide an answer to the problems that have been brought about by this simplification procedure. By last night the Taxation Office had said that the date by which primary producers, miners and other manufacturers of exempt goods could now lodge a form seeking a registration number under the system was 31 December instead of 30 November. If they take this action, they will be able to continue quoting an exemption declaration until their new registration number The Government is claiming that it has put place measures 'to make sure no-one will be disadvantaged by the delays', as the Arts, Taxation Commissioner designate, Mr Michael Carmody, said last night in a press release. This is untrue. I will quote from a to booklet entitled Streamlined sales tax as to how it affects primary producers. In relation to business inputs for primary producers, the order to buy these goods free of sales tax, at the of purchase you must be registered so you can quote your sales tax number to your supplier. You buy these goods free of sales tax by quoting exemption declaration. For these goods, unregis. tered people must pay sales tax at the time of purchase and claim a credit later from the Tax . th t th 11 Offi' t . f t' - gree a e ax Ice s ex enslOn o. Ime will. co-er those farmers who send - application form for - new number, but It will not overcome the basiC problem. As of yes-er­ I day, only. 12,000 out of t-e 235-000 farming partnerships an? c?mpames mailed the b.rochure and application form by the TaxatIOn Office had replied. The Taxation Office told me yesterday that it will be unable to place amended advertisements in newspapers until the second week of December. Many thousands of farmers will not be aware that they need to send in the form. Even if they are, paperwork will be the last thing on their minds over Christmas and during the harvest season. For instance, my local accountant, a very efficient and sensible fellow, Mr Bernie Sinnott of Camperdown in the electorate of Corangamite, has 200 clients to whom he sent out the sales tax forms, and he has had only 20 replies to date. That gives an indication of how farmers are reacting to the sales tax forms. From 1 January many thousands of farmers will be buying harvesters, tractors, seeders, agricultural sprayers, cattle dips and washes. They will have to pay sales tax at the time of purchase. If the item costs, for example, $2,000 and it has a 20 per cent sales tax, they will have to pay an extra $400 that they were not expecting to pay. Then they will have to wait for the Taxation Office to issue them with a refund. I challenge the Treasurer to indicate whether there will be interest on the refund. When will the Tax Office actually pay the refund? How long will it take? The wholesale sales tax simplification attempt by the Government has been a total disaster. The Government rushed the legislation through the House in the last two days in May and then it had to go to a Senate committee. It was 30 September before the legislation received royal assent. The printer ran late with the booklets and forms and Australia Post did not complete delivery to the farmers of the advice of changes until about 10 November. Now we find that farmers will be hit in the hip pocket when they least expect it. There are 56,000 retailers and 135,000 others in the sales tax system who will have to be written to by the Taxation Office because of these blunders and failures to execute the documents. All in all, it is a very poor effort from the Treasurer who quite clearly needs to be called to account for his inability to get even simple administrative details correct, let alone the important matters such as whether Australians are properly informed of changes to the taxation laws. He was asked in Question Time today about these matters and his reply was, 'I do not know'. Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd",117
416,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT," I find the Garibaldian tactics of the Opposition quite mind-boggling. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) knows quite well that the delays in the sales taxation amendments were caused solely by the Liberal Party obstructing the passage of Bills through the Senate. That is what he ought to be telling his constituents. I also want to draw attention to the remarks by the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) who was bemoaning what he saw as an attack on multiculturalism. Today we find that an unelected, intellectually impaired, new class reactionary group without any understanding of Australian history has ethnically cleansed this Parliament. I refer, of course, the High Court, and I will deal with that later. Tonight I want to deal with the Big Australian. Tonganns is an eminent geologist. He works out of one of the major universities in Holland. It is Tonganns who is properly credited with the discovery of diamonds off the west coast of Africa. He has had a look around the world and he says that the greatest potential for alluvial diamonds is actually in the Cambridge Gulf in Australia. This land is in fact pegged by a company called Cambridge Gulf. I know the enormous work that Cambridge Gulf, an Australian company, has put into developing this prospect. It is a very real prospect, and it is very close to the production of diamonds. I would say that within the next month the dredges will be operating and will determine what quantity of diamonds are there. Some time ago I approached the BHP company, along with every other major Australian company, and it pooh-poohed the project. BHP said it was not interested in anything unless it could have absolute control. In any case, it said that the prospect was largely unproven. This is despite the fact, of course, that Stockdale, a South African company, has already found itself a diamond mine on the Forrest River. Stockdale would certainly give credence to the methodology adopted by Cambridge Gulf. BHP is prepared to spend $22m off the west coast of Africa at the behest of a Mr Gurney. Mr Gurney probably learnt all he knew from Professor Tonganns. Yet it was to Mr Gurney that BHP turned to do an appraisal on the Cambridge Gulf project, and it is to Mr Gurney's discredit that he was pushing his own barrow. Mr Gurney, of course, had gone broke in his own right and is only now saved by this $22.5m injection from BHP. This is for a 30 per cent equity, and BHP must spend another $60m to acquire' its control. It could have had control-or 50 per cent equity-in the Australian company for considerably less than that, probably about $5m. Cambridge Gulf has been forced to sell 50 per cent of its equity offshore to a foreign company because it could not find an Australian company prepared to participate. to We find BHP, the Big Australian, spending its Australian shareholders' money overseas with reckless abandon on projects that have nothing like the scope of Cambridge Gulf and without any consideration for the benefit of this nation. I think it is about time BHP was called to account. I will certainly be trying to get a proxy for the next BHP annual general meeting. I will be putting some hard questions to BHP about its anti-Australian attitude and its incompetence in this area. This is not the first time. I have had considerable doubts about the genuine attitudes of BHP-the Big Australian. When we look at the realities, it seems to me that we had a reverse takeover by Utah. BHP Minerals is now an Americandominated company. I have always said that it really is not a matter of ownership; what is important is control, and it seems that Australia has lost control of BHP - Exemption-1992 No.6.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Department of Health, Housing and Community Services: Employment Goals (Question No. 1492) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, upon notice, on 28 April 1992: Following the Prime Minister's pledge at the start of the One Nation strategy to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy he can muster, is the Minister's Department giving pre-eminence to the goal of growth of employment in Australia in its corporate planning and policy development; if so, (a) how is pre-eminence being given, (b) in what ways is the goal being implemented and (c) are there any departmental activities which are inconsistent with maximising employment growth.",118
417,Mr HOWE,NOTICES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a)&(b) Yes. I am giving pre-eminence to the goal of growth of employment within the context of our other goals and my Department is focusing its activities on this matter. As an employer, my Department gives high priority to programs which improve employment opportunities for various groups-including young people, through the Australian Traineeship Scheme, people with disabilities and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. My Department also has a vigorous national program of graduate recruitment, which provides a fast track introduction to the Australian Public Service for University and College graduates. Over recent years, my Department has, on average, offered permanent or temporary employment to over 500 people per year. All of this Department's programs are concerned with people caring for other groups of people and as such are very labour intensive. The potential for employment generation across the portfolio is' therefore large. The employment created covers a wide range of skill levels and training needs, ranging from medical specialists through other professionals to relatively unskilled workers like cleaners, kitchen staff and base level child care workers. The need for these unskilled workers means that expansion of Health, Housing and Communassociated ity Service programs can have an immediate NA effect on unemployment in that people can move off unemployment into a job without long-term training. There are also many entry points into worthwhile careers, for example, child care workers can enter at the base level and then are able to access TAFE courses to get qualifications to move into better paid and more responsible positions. The unskilled positions and entry level positions mean there is significant scope for further . employment of young people and some sectors, such as child care, already have a high proportion of their workforce under 21 years. Specific outcomes include: the Children's Services Program which assists families with dependent children to participate in the workforce by ensuring that child care is affordable for low and middle income families and by improving the supply and quality of child care; the Housing Program which contributes to employment growth by promoting the efficient supply of land and housing. The housing industry recovery that has been underway since early 1991 is making a significant contribution to employment generation. It is estimated that growth in the housing sector in 1991-92 and 1992-93 will create in the order of 40,000 additional jobs. This is assisted by a continued Commonwealth commitment of over $1 billion per annum under the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement to the States for new construction and other housing initiatives; the Building Better' Cities Program also provides an important stimulus for employment. Commonwealth expenditure on the Program, along with State and local government expenditure 'leveraged' by the Program, will generate around 50,000 jobs over the next five years; and the Medicare package announced in the 1992 Budget is expected to generate about 1,700 jobs in the areas of strategic planning and hospital capital investment. Funding through a range of other programs across the Department also serves as a stimulus for private sector funding, which in turn leads to the creation of additional jobs: the Assistance for People with Disabilities Program provides direct service to individuals as well as grants of financial assistance to eligible organisations for the provision to people with disabilities of a range of services including employment services. These services are designed to ensure that people with disabilities have access to, and choice of, wage generating work with job security and opportunities for job mobility and career advancement; and 4,000 new employment agency places are being created over a three year period ending in 1993-94 as part of the Program's contribution to the implementation of the Disability Reform Package. Other initiatives to promote increased access to open employment for people with disabilities include a National Employer Project which will see up to eighteen employment placement officers being employed in large national corporations to identify suitable jobs assist with placement and arranging provision of suitable supports. This will complement the work of several Employer/Union pilots designed to promote the skills and contribution of people with disabilities in the workforce. (c) There are no departmental activities inconsistent with the pursuit of Government policies. Pig Meat: Canada (Question No. 1816) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 19 August 1992: (1) Has the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service determined that the free entry of pig meat from Canada does not pose a threat from disease to the Australian pig industry. (2) Has the free entry of pig meat from Canada had an impact on the Australian industry; if so, (a) what impact and (b) was the impact greater than anticipated. (3) What quantity of pig meat was imported from Canada in each month since February 1991. (4) Is frozen pig meat imported from Canada subsequently processed and sold as an Australian product. (5) Can Canadian pig meat be identified after it enters retail trade in Australia. (6) Can Canadian pig meat be re-exported in processed or value-added form as an Australian product. (7) Is Canadian pig meat tested for levels of antibiotics, growth hormones and other chemical residues; if so, what tests are conducted. (8) What tests are conducted on Australian pig meat for (a) Australian consumption and (b) export. (9) Is he able to say whether exported Canadian pig meat is subsidised in any way by the Canadian Government. (10) Is he further able to say whether the US Government imposes a countervailing duty on Canadian pig meat; if so, why. (11) Have Australian growers suffered reduced returns as a result of the importation of Canadian pig meat; if so, to what extent has the cost to retail customers been reduced. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The entry of Canadian pig meat to Australia is not free. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) imposes pre-export and postarrival quarantine conditions and requirements to meat and meat products imported from all approved countries. Pre-export quarantine conditions applied and to Canadian pig meat include requirements that each consignment must be accompanied by corresponding official health certification that it is: derived only from pigs of Canadian origin; derived only from pigs that were subjected to ante and post-mortem veterinary inspection, were found to be visibly healthy and were fit for slaughter for human consumption; derived only from areas of each carcase excluding the head, neck and pharyngeal tissues, and internal organs (offal); derived only from pigs that were slaughtered, prepared and stored after slaughter in AQIS approved, licensed Canadian export meat establ ishments; placed in identified containers that are sealed with an officially identified container seal at the time of export; and transported to Australia without evidence of unauthorised tampering with the container, the seal or the container contents. I am advised that imported pig meat must be frozen for not less than 30 days prior to export at not more than-18 degrees Celsius to ensure that the exotic parasite Trichinella spiralis found in muscle tissue is killed if present. The head, neck, pharyngeal tissues and internal organs are not eligible for importation. AQIS approved, licensed Canadian meat establishments only are permitted to slaughter, prepare or store pigs or pig meat derived from pigs that have been born in, and continuously resident since birth in Canada. Before being eligible for release to the importer, each consignment of imported meat and meat products and accompanying documentation must pass Australian quarantine inspection after arrival. This aims to verify that the official certification is valid, that the consignment conforms with its certified description in every respect and that there has been no evidence of tampering with containers, seals or certificates during shipment. Provided no anomalies are revealed, consignments may be conditionally released from quarantine. Quarantine releases the imported pig meat for further inspection for fitness for human consumption and/or for processing by the competent AQIS or State food (meat) inspectorate. Requirements will soon be implemented enforcing additional quarantine controls over imports of uncooked pig meat in accordance with the recommendations of a scientific working party convened to advise on the exotic pig disease Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome (PRRS). The new requirements will include deboning in the country of origin and processing to inactivate PRRS virus before release of the end product in Australia. AQIS is consulting with pig .producers and pig meat processors regarding the details of the additional quarantine requirements and enforcement measures. AQIS has proposed that the new requirements should be implemented using more cost-effective quality assutance based inspection systems. Pig meat importers and processors will be required to submit a manual, which will be subject to audit, defining how they shall respectively ensure that all necessary requirements will be satisfied on an ongoing basis. AQIS will then evaluate each manual for possible approval before·importers or processors will be permitted to handle imported, uncooked pig meat from PRRS infected countries. AQIS will be responsible for conducting periodic inspections and audits of approved importers and processors to ensure compliance. The costs to AQIS of its quarantine inspection and audit procedures will be fully recovered from approved importers and processors. AQIS has concluded that appropriately controlled imports of pig meat from Canada are safe for human and animal health. They present negligible risk of introducing disease to Australian pigs. The quarantine conditions that minimise risks have been developed after several years of detailed assessment and extensive consultation. AQIS's quarantine risk assessment processes are on-going. They are based on regular review of existing import requirements in the light of the changing international trade and animal health situations and advances in relevant technology. (2)(a) The impact on the pig industry of the entry of Canadian pig meat into Australia is difficult to identify in isolation from other factors also cing price. On the supply side in 1991-92, an additional 17,700 tonnes of pig meat was available on the domestic market compared with 1990-91. Canadian imports contributed 3,000 tonnes, while increased domestic production contributed 14,600 tonnes, decreased exports contributed 700 tonnes and decreased imports of canned product from other sources offset the increase by 600 tonnes. On the demand side the economic downturn combined with competition from chicken meat, beef and lamb would have had a depressing effect on prices. (2)(b) As the extent of the impact of imports of Canadian pig meat is masked by other domestically induced supply factors it is not possible to respond precisely to this part of the question. . However, the .level of imports of Canadian pig meat has not exceeded the upper limits of the range predicted by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics prior to the decision to allow imports to proceed in July 1990. (3) The quantities, in tonnes, of pig meat imported from Canada since February 1991 are as follows: February ('91)-73 March-75 April-47 May-80 June-Ill July-240 August-281 September-257 October-250 November-309 December-162 January ('92)-404 February-243 March-327 April-508 May-696 June-327 July-229 August-130. (4) It is understood that virtually all of the Canadian pig meat is processed into products such as ham and bacon. It is further understood that it is sold as an Australian product. (5) No. Pig meat imported from Canada is not currently being identified after it enters retail trade in Australia. However, I am advised that ham, bacon and other smallgoods processed from Australian pig meat have, for many years, been influenmanufactured and marketed in Australia under ""Canadian"" style labelling by Australian processors and retail outlets. (6) Yes, but protocols for export of such products have yet to be developed. (7) No. At the end of 1991 a small survey was done to check for the presence of the growth promotant Carbadox, the use of which is no longer permitted in Australia. A non-quantifiable trace of this substance was found in one sample only. No other residues have been checked for in Canadian pig meat. There is no further testing by AQIS of Canadian pig meat on arrival for levels of antibiotics, growth hormones and other chemical residues because Canada maintains a reliable national residue monitoring program that satisfies Australian standards. The following substances are currently being checked for by the Canadian program: pesticides, including (i) organochlorines (ii) organophosphates (iii) synthetic pyrethroids heavy metals (tolerances in arsenic only) growth promotants-stilbenes and Beta-agonists (clenbuterol) antibiotics, including (i) Carbadox (ii) chloramphenicol (iii) dimetridazole (iv) nitrofurans (v) sulphonamides anthelminthics, including (i) avermectinJivermectin (ii) levamisole other chemicals, including (i) pentachlorophenol (ii) nitrates, nitrites and nitrosamines trichinella, (a parasite) bacteria, including (i) staphylococcus aureus (ii) enterotoxic E coli 0157 (iii) salmonella (iv) listeria monocytogenes. Animal species verification is also conducted. (8) Australian pig meat for both Australian consumption and for export is subjected to testing under the following programs: (a) .the National Residue Survey is a multifaceted program developed to monitor residues in Australia's agricultural food commodities. In the case of pig meat, the following substances are currently being checked for: organochlorines organophosphates heavy metals growth promotants-stilbenes and Beta-agonists (clenbuterol) synthetic pyrethroids dimetridazole antibiotics, including (i) chloramphenicol (ii) sulphonamides avermectinJivermectin levamisole (b) the National Antibacterial Residue Minimisation Program surveys pigs and cattle for antibacterial residues by urine screening. Samples showing positive to this screening are submitted for laboratory confirmation. Pig meat for export is also subjected to species testing to confirm species of origin. Australian pig meat exports are small in volume. (9) The Australian Customs Service is currently undertaking an inquiry which will determine whether Canadian pig meat exported to Australia is subsidised. A preliminary finding is expected by 27 November 1992 when the 100 day inquiry period expires. (10) There is no countervailing duty imposed by the US on Canadian pig meat. However, the US did apply a countervailing duty in 1989 but was subsequently forced to withdraw it after a successful appeal by Canada under the US/Canada Free Trade Agreement. The US International Trade Commission found that Canadian subsidies were countervailable, but there was no evidence of material injury to,the US industry. There is a duty of US$18.04 per 220 pound live Canadian hog entering the US. (11) There are no data available on grower returns but saleyard prices were depressed for a number of months around the middle of the year and in some cases were below estimated cost of production. The low prices experienced by Australian growers in 1992 are attributed to the combined effect of the various factors outlined in the response to question (2). Prices have since recovered to 1991 levels. Although there is no reliable retail price series on the various pig meat classifications, it is clear that retail prices fell in 1992 compared with 1991. Again the price falls are attributed to the combined effect of the various factors outlined in question (2). Multiculturalism: Working Papers (Question No. 1912)",120
