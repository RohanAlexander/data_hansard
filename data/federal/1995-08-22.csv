2,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Order! I wish to advise the House that on 28 July the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) raised with me as a matter of privilege actions of the Australian Federal Police in searching his electorate office on 26 July. Under standing order 97 A, members are able to bring to the attention of the Speaker matters of privilege arising during the long adjournment periods. The Speaker is able to refer such matters to the House of Representatives Standing Committee of Privileges, provided that such referrals are reported by the Speaker at the next sitting. If the House endorses such a referral, the reference to the committee stands House. and the inquiry proceeds. If, of course, a referral is not supported, the Committee of Privileges can take no further action on such a matter. In order to help me to make a decision as to whether to refer the member for Stirling's complaint to the committee, I wrote to him on 31 July seeking additional information. On 11 August I received further information from NA Hansard 1995 (EIGHTH PERIOD) 1995, adjourned to 22 August 1995, unless the of Representatives passed on 30 June 1995, the Tuesday, 22 August 1995 at 12.30 p.m. him. I concluded that it would be proper for Mr Cameron's complaint to go to the Committee of Privileges as allowed by standing order 97 A. Accordingly, I referred the matter to the committee in the following terms: whether a contempt was committed in connection with the execution of a search warrant on the electorate office of Mr E. H. Cameron MP on Wednesday, 26 July 1995. I present copies of letters from Mr Cameron dated 28 July and 10 August 1995; a copy of the search warrant provided by Mr Cameron on 28 July; copies of faxes from Mr Cameron dated 7 and 14 August; copies of letters from me to Mr Cameron; and a copy of a letter from me to the chair of the committee of privileges. Motion (by Mr Cameron) agreed to: That the reference of this matter to the Committee of Privileges by the Speaker be endorsed by the NA Message from the Governor General reported informing the House of assent to the following bills: Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1995 Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment (No.2) Bill 1995 Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 1995 Passenger Movement Charge Collection Amendment Bill 1995 Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Amendment Bill 1995 Meat and Live-stock Industry Bill 1995 Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Amendment Bill 1995 Meat and Live-stock Industry Legislation Repeal Bill 1995 Beef Production Levy Amendment Bill 1995 Live-stock Export Charge Amendment Bill 1995 Live-stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill 1995 Cattle Transaction Levy Bill 1995 Cattle Export Charges Amendment Bill 1995 National Residue Survey Administration Amendment Bill 1995 National Residue Survey (Cattle Export) Levy Bill 1995 National Residue Survey (Cattle Transactions) Levy Bill 1995 National Cattle Disease Eradication Trust Account Amendment Bill 1995 Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 1995 Exotic Animal Disease Control Amendment Bill 1995 Air Services Bill 1995 Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 1995 Customs, Excise and Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill 1995 Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995 Transport Legislation Amendment (No.2) Bill 1995 Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill 1995 Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Modification (Customs) Bill 1995 Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Modification (Excise) Bill 1995 Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Modification (General) Bill 1995 Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 1995 Transport Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 NA Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the routine of business for Thursday, 24 August 1995, being as follows, unless otherwise ordered: I. Presentation of, and statements on, reports from parliamentary committees and delegations (concluding no laterthan 10.15 a.m.). 2. Private Members' business (concluding no later than 11.45 a.m.): Provided that any division called for in the House during the consideration of private Members' business on a question, other than a motion moved by a Minister, shall stand deferred until after the conclusion of the Grievance debate. 3. Grievance debate (for a period not exceeding 80 minutes). 4. Notices and other orders of the day, government business. 5.

Matter of public importance. 10. Notices and orders of the day, government business.",11
3,Mr MCGAURAN,BUSINESS,"Whilst the opposition do not oppose the motion before the House, we do believe firmly that it is merely tinkering at the edges. Fundamental reform is necessary in order to improve the workings of this place, but the government continually ignores that fact. The first and foremost problem relates to the rostering system for ministers, which at present sees ministers coming into this House and being held accountable for their actions as the elected representatives of the people of Australia a mere two times a week. We now know that, unambiguously, it is a device by the government to shield ministers who are in trouble. And we are going to get a classic example this parliamentary week when the embattled, besieged Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) appears for questioning just once. We will have one opportunity only to ask her how she can justify spending huge amounts of taxpayers' funds-at least $10,000 a day-in a phoney defence of some concocted legal principle. It is utterly unacceptable to the opposition and to the people at large that ministers be hidden from questioning in this way. It always amuses us when occasionally we see background briefings in newspapers from members of the government's backbench expressing the wish that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) be in here every day and that some of them have approached him saying, 'You are our best parliamentary and electoral weapon and you should be in here every day to do over the opposition.' If the Prime Minister thought there was an electoral advantage in it, he would be in here. He will do anything for an electoral advantage. The reason he is not in here every day for questioning by the opposition is that he knows he has more to lose. In other words, he is afraid of daily questioning by the opposition. There is no other explanation for the Prime Minister's absence. He is, in fact, a coward in that regard. The cowardliness of the Prime Minister and his ministers has caused the institution of parliament to suffer. This place has far less relevance than it had before the Prime Minister corrupted its procedures in the way he has through the roster system-and that is a very bad thing. It is one Minister to make the major government announcements outside of the parliament and to ignore it in all of the principal policy statements and questioning. But it is another thing to choose places like the National Press Club, as he will this Thursday, to face up to questioning by unelected representatives of the media but not by the opposition. He has downgraded the importance of the elected legislature in this country. The opposition will restore the pre-eminence of the parliament in the democracy of Australia. We will have our Prime Minister Howard and the ministers in here to face any questioning the opposition may want to put up. So the motion before the House is merely procedural; it does not go to the heart of the failings of the workings of the parliament. Above all, we will ensure an independent Speaker. We will wish to preserve the independence of the Speaker by adopting the Westminster system whereby the Speaker, once chosen, is not challenged for either preselection or by candidates from other parties-they quit the party. So we are anxious that this parliament be seen to operate fairly and the rules apply impartially to all of the participants, unlike the hectoring and bullying you get from the government members, not least of all from the person who occupies that chair-the Prime Minister himself. We worry on your part. We worry for your sake. We know it is next to impossible for you to remain impartial and to apply the standing orders fairly and remain within the Australian Labor Party.",12
4,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Order! The member for Gippsland is coming very close to reflecting on the chair. I know you are trying to make a point but don't push it.,13
5,Mr MCGAURAN,BUSINESS,"On the contrary, Mr Speaker, you will find allies and supporters in your role on this side of the House in stark contrast to the government's tactics. There is a great deal that we as elected the representatives must do to make this place function better. Whether or not Australians vote for the government or the opposition, at the moment the elected representatives are not able to fully represent the interests of all thing for the Prime Australians.",13
6,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"in reply-I only rise on one point, because we have heard the speech of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) about 500 times before. There is something new in it. This is the first time. I have heard such an explanation-and it is a very original explanation-for the sacking of the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) by his Liberal Party division. The sacking of the member for Curtin is to create the possibility for him, should the coalition secure office, to be an independent Speaker. This is the first time. I have heard that interpretation. It outweighs the interpretation that we have all heard in the media to this point in time that the gormlessness of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), his unwillingness to come to the aid of his strongest supporters in Western Australia, his willingness to see them sacked from their endorsements-and that also applies to one or two of his mates in New South Wales-is to create the possibility of there being a series of Independents in the place so that, should the coalition get elected to office, they would have somebody to choose from so they could say they had an independent Speaker. Fortunately, we are not going to have to see this edifying performance. I have to say that we on this side of the House do not accept that as an explanation as to why the poor member for Curtin has lost his party endorsement. We think it is for a much more nefarious purpose than that. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA",13
7,Mr LEO MCLEAY,COMMITTEE,"by leave-I move: That the following orders of the day, government business, be referred to the Main Committee for debate: Australia's Development Cooperation ProgramMinisterial statement and paper-Motion to take note of papers: Resumption of debate; and Justice statement and Government responsesPapers-Motion to take note of papers: Resumption of debate. I reiterate to members that, because the government and the House have brought on private members' business on Thursday morning, the Main Committee will sit only on Wednesday of this week so that private members can more fully participate in the business of the House on Thursday morning. Question resolved in the affirmative. PUBLIC SERVICE (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY RETIREMENT AGE) AMENDMENT BILL 1995 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Ordered that the second reading be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA (CONTROLLED OPERATIONS) BILL Consideration resumed from 29 June. Second Reading",14
8,Mr KERR,CRIMES AMENDMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. On 19 April 1995 the High Court handed down its decision in the matter of Ridgeway v. The Queen. By a majority of six to one the court decided that, where law enforcement officials use a controlled operation during an investigation into narcotics trafficking and, as a result, commit an element of an offence with which a defendant is charged, a court should normally refuse to admit the evidence of that element against the defendant. Some members of the court indicated that if law enforcement officers are to engage in such conduct in the course of investigations, a legislative scheme authorising this conduct would need to be established. The bill that is now before the House responds to that judgment. The bill will ensure that there is a legislative base for controlled operations by law enforcement agencies and that the officers participating in such operations are protected from criminal responsibility for conduct undertaken in the course of their duty. The bill will also provide an avenue for the admission of evidence obtained from controlled operations prior to its commencement, provided the operation was conducted in conformity with established procedures. Many people, both in the chamber and in the community, might ask: why should we sanction the police participating in criminal activity? Won't this activity lead to the entrapment of people? Won't it be an inducement for the committing of crimes that would otherwise not occur? They might say that there are many dangers in sanctioning these covert operations. I will respond to each of these questions. Drug crime is peculiarly difficult to combat. Rarely are there complainants about this conduct. The importation of large quantities of drugs is a clandestine criminal activity involving complicity, or participants who will 1995 remain silent for fear of retribution. Organised crime does not tolerate complaint. As a result, the struggle against this trade involves very difficult choices for us as legislators and for the community. We are all committed to the preservation of fundamental values of equality, privacy, freedom of expression, the right to a fair trial and so on. Equally, however, there is the right of the individual to protection by the state. There is a powerful public interest in opposing the spread of illegal drug trafficking, and the official corruption it can spawn. Good law enforcement is a citizen's entitlement. It must be borne in mind that loss of confidence in law enforcement will lead governments to measures destructive of civil liberties. This is not such a bill. The choice before us is between a society prepared to accept balanced legislation to counter criminals, and a society poisoned by the conditions created by those criminals and their activities. The bill lays down a full and open system of accountability. The bill requires that the responsible minister, at present myself, is kept informed of all applications for the authority to conduct a controlled operation. In tum, the responsible minister is required to table a report in parliament providing details of the applications made under the provisions of the bill. The procedure will not lead to 'entrapment' of people. A controlled operation may be conducted only in circumstances where the targets of the operation are likely to importor export-narcotics whether or not the operation takes place. The bill will ensure that it will not be permissible for officers to procure the commission of offences which otherwise would not have taken place. The law as regards accepting or rejecting evidence obtained by improper methods will be maintained. However, controlled operations may lead to the detection of principals whose activities might otherwise never be discovered, let alone prosecuted. I should emphasise that controlled operations are an internationally accepted investigatory technique. On 14 February 1993 the Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances came into force in Australia. That convention was implemented by legislation that commenced operation that same day. Article 11(1) of the convention provides as follows: Article ll-Controlled delivery 1. If permitted by the basic principles of their respective domestic legal systems, the parties shall take the necessary measures, within their possibilities, to allow for the appropriate use of controlled delivery at the international level, on the basis of agreements or arrangements mutually consented to, with a view to identifying persons involved in offences established in accordance with article 3, paragraph 1, and to taking legal action against them. This article indicates the recognition by the international community of the need to employ specialised investigative techniques, like the controlled operation, to deal with organised and sophisticated traffickers. In Australia the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct--commonly known as the FitzGerald report-also discussed the use of new techniques in combating organised crime. Commissioner FitzGerald concluded that an effective response to organised crime is dependent upon recognition of four factors: the social changes which crime causes and the fact that it diminishes the quality of life; the fact that crime escalates if it is not controlled; recognition that there are vulnerabilities in the social order which expose it to exploitation; and the steps that are needed to control crime. In relation to the latter point-the steps that are needed to control crime-Commissioner FitzGerald stated that consideration should be given to a wide range of measures which would equip law enforcement agencies with new powers including permitting 'the infiltration of criminal groups'. Commissioner FitzGerald concluded that orthodox policing is quite unable to enforce the law. This bill will ensure that Commonwealth law enforcement agencies have available to them the controlled operation as a tool in the investigation of the trade in narcotics. I tum now to discuss briefly the key features of the bill. The central issue in the Ridgeway decision was the admissibility of evidence. The High Court held that, because of the involvement of law enforcement agents in the importation of heroin, the evidence obtained thereby was fatally tainted and should be excluded from the trial of the principal conspirator. Honourable members may notice that the bill before them says nothing about the admissibility of evidence. How then, it might be asked, does the bill respond to the decision of the High Court? The basis for the decision by the majority of the High Court was that a trial judge has a discretion to exclude evidence on certain public policy grounds. The public policy ground in question, which then triggers the discretion to exclude evidence, arises where illegal police conduct is an essential ingredient of the charged offence. In such a case there will be 'an extremely formidable case for exclusion' of the evidence by the trial judge. The High Court accepted that the legislature could sanction the use of controlled operations and that such a legislative regime could exempt the officers from the requirements of the criminal law. The court went on to say that 'in the absence of such a legislative regime, the courts have no choice but to set their face firmly against grave criminality on the part of anyone, regardless of whether he or she be government officer or ordinary citizen.' The enactment of the bill now before the House will ensure that the actions of law enforcement officials engaged in a controlled operation will not incur criminal responsibility and, as a result, the trigger for the exclusion involvement of evidence will not arise. It should be noted that the bill, whilst protecting the law enforcement officers from criminal responsibility, will still preserve the essential criminality or unlawfulness of the importation, or exportation, of the prohibited narcotics. This will ensure that the importation or exportation itself is not made lawful, thereby exonerating the targets of the operation who planned the conspiracy. It is important to describe the effect of bill upon prosecutions that are current at the time the bill commences operation. There are a number of investigations that are affected by the decision in Ridgeway. They all involve very significant participation in trafficking narcotics; for example: conspiracy to import 7kg of cocaine (one individual); being knowingly concerned in the importation of 3.8 kg of cocaine (two individuals); conspiracy to import 7kg of cocaine (one individual); and. being knowingly concerned in the importation of, and possession of, 2kg of heroin (two individuals). Controlled operations were employed in each of these matters. These operations were strictly regulated and rigorously controlled covert operations. They were not operations involving out of control cowboys riding roughshod over our laws. In each case they were conducted in purported accordance with the terms of a ministerial agreement relating to such operations and the detailed requirements of Australian Federal Police guidelines on the conduct of controlled operations. The ministerial agreement was entered into on 3 June 1987 between the then Special Minister of State, having responsibility for the Australian Federal Police, Senator the Honourable Michael Tate, and the then Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, having responsibility for the Australian Customs Service, Senator the Honourable John Button. The agreement provided that a written request was to be made to the Australian Customs Service: where certain persons, goods, ships or aircraft, suspected or known to be carrying or having an in drugs, are required by the Australian Federal Police or the National Crime Authority to be exempted from detailed customs scrutiny and control and in cases where there is to be substitution of imported goods. Once that agreement was obtained the operation was conducted in accordance with detailed requirements of Australian Federal Police guidelines. These guidelines run to 50 paragraphs and closely regulate the considerations that should be adverted to when deciding whether a controlled operation should be the conducted; the level at which operations must be approved; the procedures for a controlled delivery involving the substitution of the narcotic substance; further procedures for those operations where substitution is not in feasible or possible; the requirements for analysis of the narcotic substance; and the making of payments to couriers and informants. These operations were conducted pursuant to these guidelines. The operations were closely monitored. Each of the accused alleged to have been detected as a result of these controlled operations is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence. But without the passage of this legislation those trials will have to be abandoned. I believe the community would not see that to be a just outcome. In conclusion, I believe that the community expects that law enforcement agencies will make every effort to catch the Mr Bigs, not just apprehend couriers and the dealers on our street comers. Indeed, the community has a right to expect, to demand, that law enforcement agencies will act to protect them, and their children who are particularly vulnerable. This bill will satisfy that demand by providing a firm legislative basis for the use of controlled operations as a device in combating drug trafficking. Other aspects of the bill are described in the explanatory memorandum which was presented at the time of introduction. I commend the bill to the House.",14
9,Mr RUDDOCK,CRIMES AMENDMENT,"Berowra) (12.55 p.m.)The opposition is not opposed to the intent of the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1995. We are concerned about aspects of detail. We think some of the details in this legislation need to be considered by a parliamentary committee-preferably the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I foreshadow that there are some matters of detail that, given such an examination and review, we regard as having significant defects and we will press upon the government some amendments. Let me say before I proceed to examine the - etai-ed provisions of this bill that the oppositIon IS not opposed to the purpose of the bill outlined by the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr). He stated: ... I believe that the community expects that law enforcement agencies will make every effort to catch the Mr Bigs, not just apprehend couriers the dealers on our street comers. Indeed the community has a right to expect, to demand, that law enforcement agencies will act to protect them and their children who are particularly vulnerable: We are not opposed to endeavouring to catch those criminals who want to exploit vulnerable young people to make large sums of money. The minister in this speech, as he has done on other occasions when he has written on these matters, wants it understood that there is a need for some balance in these matters. He went on to say: As a result, the struggle against this trade involves very difficult choices for us as legislators and for the community. We are all committed to the preser:vation of fundamental values such as equality: pn.""acy, freedom of expression, the right to a fair tnal and so on. Equally however there is a right of the individual to protection by the state. There is a powerful public interest in opposing the spread of illegal drug trafficking, and the official corruption that it can spawn. In those comments he was indicating that there are some difficult questions of balance that need to be addressed. One ought not to assume, in trying to address this evil, that the government has achieved the correct balance. I hope by my comments that those points will be understood and that there will be no attempt to suggest that we lack concern to address the evil that this bill purports to deal with. We are dealing with legislation that arose from the High Court case of Ridgeway v. R in 1995. The court held that where the Federal Police break the law by committing an element of the offence for which the defendant was being prosecuted then the court should exercise its discretion to refuse to allow evidence against the defendant to be admitted against him in that instance. Ridgeway was entitled, as a result of the court's decision in that matter, to a permanent stay of proceedings. The majority of the court were deeply concerned with the illegal conduct of those who uphold the law and the effect that has on the confidence of the public in the criminal justice system. They held that if law enforcement officers were to be exempted from this law then it would be an issue for the parliaand ment and not the courts. I will quote from the decision of Sir Anthony Mason; our Governor General designate, Sir William Deane; and Mr Justice Dawson in this case. It was stated: The effective investigation by the police of some types of criminal activity may necessarily involve subterfuge, deceit and the intentional creation of opportunities for the commission by a suspect of a criminal offence. When those tactics do not involve illegal conduct, their use will ordinarily be legitimate notwithstanding that they are conducive to the commission of a criminal offence by a person believed to be engaged in criminal activity ... A finding that law enforcement officers have engaged in such clearly improper conduct will not, of course, suffice of itself to give rise to the discretion to exclude evidence of the alleged offences or of an element of it. As with the case of illegal conduct, the discretion will only arise if the conduct has procured the commission of the offence with which the accused is charged. The court was not being prudish about these matters. The court recognised that there needs to be some creativeness in the way in which the investigatory authorities undertake criminal investigations and also, as it said, some subterfuge, deceit and intentional creation of opportunities for the commission of a criminal offence by a suspect. But it was when the police or Commonwealth authorities might be party to the commission of an offence that they put it in a different context and came to the decision with which we are dealing now. Mr Justice MCHugh dissented on the basis that the defendant in this instance had not been induced to commit the offence. That appears to be the case, and it is an important part of this legislation that the police or Commonwealth authorities should not be involved in inducing people to commit an offence which they would not otherwise commit. This bill is seen as a response to the court's decision where the court invited the parliament to deal with this matter further, if it considered the matter warranted it. The bill seeks to ensure that, as a result of the Ridgeway case, the evidence of a controlled operation will not be rendered inadmissible in a court. We understand that, after the handing down of the particular decision, the South Australian parliament has passed similar legislation to that which is proposed here and that there is similar legislation in place in Victoria and New Zealand. The objects of this bill, we are told, are, first, to exempt law enforcement officers from criminal liability for conduct in the course of a controlled operation involving importation, export or possession of narcotics which has been authorised by the act; and, second, to require the Commissioner of the Federal Police and the Chairperson of the National Crime Authority to report to the Minister for Justice on all requests to authorise controlled operations and for the minister to report these matters to parliament, as outlined in the bill. The third object that is addressed is to provide that evidence of importation of narcotics, obtained from an operation before the commencement of the amendments in which the Federal Police and Customs officers cooperated to allow narcotics to pass through a Customs barrier, is not to be rejected on the basis of the unlawful conduct of officers. The bill does this through amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 by adding additional definitions, such as a definition of what is a 'controlled operation', 'narcotic goods', 'narcotic goods offence', and by the insertion of a proposed part lAB entitled 'Controlled operations for obtaining evidence about certain offences relating to narcotic goods'. Proposed section 15G details the objects of the new part. Proposed section ISH defines a 'controlled operation' as an operation that must have three elements: first, certain persons; secondly, acting for certain purposes; and, thirdly, being likely to engage in conduct that constitutes an offence against section 233B of the Customs Act or an associated offence, except for this bill. The second matter it deals with is an operation involving the participation of defined law enforcement officers who are engaging in conduct which would, apart from this part, constitute a narcotic goods offence. The third point is that the operation must be for the purposes of gathering evidence of the importation, export of narcotic goods or associated offences. Proposed section 151 is the key provision of the bill. It provides that a law enforcement officer will not be criminally liable for conduct that is, first, carried out in the course of duty; secondly, for the purposes of a controlled operation; and, thirdly, at a time at which a certificate is issued under the act authorising the operation. The officer is not prevented from being civilly liable or criminally liable for other conduct such as theft, bribery or assault even if committed during such an operation. Proposed sections 15J, K, L, M, N, 0 and P deal with the following matters respectively. The first relates to a law enforcement officer's application for a certificate for authorisation of a controlled operation. The second is the form and contents of the application-that is, it has to be in writing stating whether a previous application has been made in relation to the operation and whether it was refused or granted, and other relevant information. The third matter relates to the urgent applications where a certificate is needed quickly to have effective law enforcement value. The fourth issue relates to the grounds on which a certificate authorising the operation may be given-the authorising officer is satisfied that all information about the nature and quality of the narcotics has been given, the criminal activity would have taken place without the involvement of the law enforcement officers, the operation has a genuine law enforcement purpose, and that any narcotics in Australia at the end of the operation will be in the control of an Australian law enforcement officer. The fifth matter is the form and content of the certificate authorising the controlled operation. The sixth is the surrender of the certificate where the operation has been aborted or completed. The seventh relates to the period for which the certificate is in force-that is, it ceases on the 30th day after issue unless a shorter period is specified. Proposed section 15Q provides that the Comptroller-General of Customs must be notified in certain circumstances so he is aware of the narcotics passing through the C:ustoms barrier. Proposed section 15P proVIdes that the Minister for Justice must be notified as soon as possible of all grants and refusals for a certificate and the reasons for that decision. This information must then be tabled in the parliament yearly by the minister. There are a number of matters that are of concern to the opposition in relation to this bill. The first issue I want to raise is that of retrospectivity. Future prosecutions will be covered by this bill by retrospectively authorising conduct which has been undertaken in the past. It does not create new offences in relation to individuals, but certain prosecutions that would otherwise fail are being retrospectively ensured of likely success by the passage of this legislation. We are told that there are 10 possible individuals who may face significant charges: three of them for offences which carry penalties with a maximum of 25 years imprisonment and the other seven for offences which carry penalties with a maximum of life imprisonment. The government claims that the prosecution of those people is in jeopardy if the bill is not passed as the evidence may be inadmissible under the Ridgeway decision. The coalition, on the basis of natural justice, does have a general reluctance to support retrospective legislation especially in relation to criminal law. I want to quote one of my colleagues who will speak later in this debate about our position on this matter. It was well stated by my colleague the member for Tangney (Mr Williams) when, in dealing with certain customs legislation before this parliament in June, he said: It is a fundamental principle of our legal system that laws are made to have prospective operation and not retrospective operation. It is simply unjust and oppressive to subject citizens to a law they have no means of ascertaining simply because the law has not been conceived, drafted, debated or enacted. He continued: It is not acceptable for the government to assert, as it does in the explanatory memorandum, that the law will have effect as if for the last nine years it had meant what, in the opinion of the author of the explanatory memorandum, a so-called 'ordinary' person would have thought it meant. Under our legal system, laws mean what parliament intended them to mean. The task of deciding what parliament intended a particular law to mean, when there is any doubt about it, is entrusted to the courts. He went on to say: Our system is a democracy subject to the rule of law. If the government cannot draft its legislation properly, it must redraft it and go forward from there. This attempt to rewrite history is outrageous and should be resisted. It seems to us that this issue of retrospectivity needs to be addressed. This is criminal legislation and we ought to hear further from the government about the extent to which this legislation should be proceeded with. You have to weigh up the principles that are involved against the evil that the government says may occur if this legislation is not implemented retrospectively. The second matter I want to deal with is accountability mechanisms and judicial oversights. One of the major concerns that we have with this particular legislation has been raised by a number of organisations, including the Lawyers Reform Association and the new Ridgeway Coalition-a group of interested specialist legal practitioners representing the criminal law committees of the New South Wales Law Society, New South Wales Young Lawyers, the Law Council of Australia and representatives of the Criminal Bar Association, the New South Wales Public Defenders, the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, the New South Wales Society of Labor Lawyers, the Lawyers Reform Association and the Australian Chapter of the International Commission of Jurists. I am sure that if the minister were in the House he would recognise the very considerable reputation of all those organisations which have joined together to make submissions on this matter. The bill proposes that senior police officers may authorise the commission of a serious offence without the safeguards of judicial oversight. There is no independent mechanism by which these decisions will be oversighted under the legislation that is proposed by the government. I will, in due course, put before the parliament some of the reasoning of the minister in pressing this particular matter. The Ridgeway Coalition has suggested to the minister that certificates be issued by the Federal Court on sworn application only. This is in line with the circumstances in which other unusual conduct by police is authorised, and that is the issue of warrants for telephone interceptions which can cover a range of offences, some being quite significant, some being relatively minor. I notice that in relation to telecommunications interception laws there was an attempt to balance competing interests, namely privacy and freedom of speech on the one hand and law enforcement requirements on the other. The sorts of offences involved were murder, kidnapping, certain narcotics offences and offences which are subject to special investigation by the National Crime Authority. The second range of offences are punishable by seven years imprisonment or more and involve the loss of life or serious personal injury, trafficking in narcotic goods, serious fraud and other offences. It can be seen in relation to telecommunications offences that some of them are significantly less serious crimes than we are speaking of in relation to these controlled operations. That is the point that needs to be understood. When the Minister for Justice was asked to address this matter he tried to suggest that authorisations here were quite different from the sorts of authorisations that are required in relation to telecommunications interceptions. I want to quote from his letter to Mr Mauri Stack, the President of the Law Society of New South Wales. He said: The circumstances in which a judge or magistrate is required to act as a decision maker are those in which law enforcement objectives must be balanced against the need to protect against unreasonable invasion of civil liberties, for example, in seeking to search, arrest or telecommunications interception warrants. A controlled operation does not involve any such invasion. The decision-making criteria are operational, relating to the likely effectiveness and security of the operation. What interested me was that the minister, in his own letter and in his speech today, recognised that we are again balancing difficult issues. In the concluding paragraph of his own letter to Mr Stack, Minister Kerr said: It is always a difficult task to balance the need to allow the effective investigation and prosecution of those who break the law, against the need to maintain the civil rights of citizens, and to prevent corruption and abuse of powers by police. Another factor that might well be entertained there is the need to preserve public confidence in the integrity of the criminal justice system. With regard to the authorisation issue, I think the minister has set up a straw man to say that this matter ought to be left in the hands of the police because they are operational issues that are being addressed. Clearly in relation to this legislation we are looking at the balancing of very important issues: the need for effective investigation and prosecution of those who break the law against the need to maintain the civil rights of citizens, to prevent corruption and abuse of powers, and to preserve public confidence in the integrity of the criminal justice system. Who better to do that but the courts, as was seen as appropriate in other legislation? It seems to me that these are proper issues to be investigated in that way. The authorisation of the breach of laws does provide enormous potential for abuse. There is a strong argument to increase the accountability provisions to prevent this. This may be done by extending the information concerning the controlled operation to be provided to parliament. The bill currently provides that the minister is required to report annually on the details of an application made for certificates but that there is no requirement to report the outcomes of controlled operations. We ask additionally: are the requirements to supply information to enable a decision whether or not to grant a certificate adequate? As I said, under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act, consideration is given to whether alternative methods of investigation are capable of providing suitable evidence for the charges to be laid. With the offences of conspiracy, an attempt may be prosecuted instead. Further, maybe the seeker of certificates should be required to demonstrate the gravity of the offence, and this should be taken into account when deciding whether or not to issue a certificate. These are matters, properly, that a committee might want to review. It is not just the opposition and lawyers that are concerned about this, although it may be said that the person I am going to quote from is in fact a lawyer. I noticed that a letter was reported to have been written to the Attorney General (Mr Lavarch) by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker). He is a former attorney himself; he is a lawyer-I think I studied with him at the Sydney law school. In a letter dated 26 June, which I have not seen denied anywhere, Minister Walker wrote: I know we are in a political climate of competition to see which party can lay the most waste to civil liberties and the rule of law, and I know that ministers shouldn't interfere in their colleagues' portfolios. However, I cannot in conscience help but join the vociferous protest from the Australian legal profession at your proposed response to the Ridgeway decision. Putting aside the police state nature of the amendments, I would respectfully suggest they are guaranteed to founder in the High Court, leaving the government with egg on its face. To exempt the police from liability under the general criminal law for heinous crimes involving up to life sentences, simply because the officers were 'acting in good faith in the course of duty', is an abomination and invites a ruling by the High Court that it is an excess of executive power. The minister went on: One has only to read the daily reports of abuse of police power and corruption coming out of the NSW Royal Commission to know that it is laughable to give police officers exclusive powers to authorise 'controlled operations' and to grant them immunity from their crimes. Might I say in a personal way that since the minister wrote this there have been many more developments in New South Wales which would give those who are concerned about these matters even greater cause for concern. The minister went on: Such a step equates with the National Crime Authority's granting of immunity from perjury to their super grasses. At the root of all police corruption has been this view that they are immune from the law. This provision will do nothing to improve that problem. The potential for corruption is virtually unlimited. The provisions [also] seem to invite attack on constitutional grounds raised in Millosevic v Campbell, Leeth v the Commonwealth, Polyvkovich v DPP. Retrospective immunity for drug dealing offences is yet another outrage in the bill. Again it raises serious constitutional problems. Some politicians take the view that going to war with the judiciary and the legal profession is smart politics, but that theory is preconditional on the premise that the war will be won. My final point is that it will not be won with the current approach . . . Yours faithfully, Frank Walker. I think there is a real concern in the community about these matters, and the minister has articulated some of that. There needs to be a balance reached between limiting the powers of the Federal Police-and hence jeopardising the prospects of bringing drug traffickers to justice-and community concern about the growing problem of drugs, and whether the police should be involved in organising the commission of a crime, the argument that controlled operations may be encouraging crime due to the facilitation by law enforcement bodies of a controlled delivery, the argument that there are other crimes the person may be convicted of and the civil libertarian concerns. We note that Australia is committed to the reduction of drug trafficking. The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 does place an obligation on Australia to act against the illicit traffic in drugs. We noted Article 11 that the minister quoted from. The government says that this bill is required urgently on the basis that there are a number of cases which are in jeopardy, as at the moment the evidence is probably not admissible as a result of this particular High Court case. I ought to conclude by saying that if it is the government's view that this bill is likely to be necessary to ensure that it is successful in other prosecutions about which it is genuinely concerned then the government itself ought to propose the reference of this bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It is more likely that that committee will have time to devote to consideration of the detail of this legislation. I can only tell the government that if my amendment, which I will propose in the event that the government does not propose that reference, is lost in this chamber today then the bill will of course be the subject of such a reference in the Senate. Given the comments I have seen from some senators from minor parties, I am sure such a reference would be successful. Of course, the Senate committee has a much heavier workload and the Senate itself has a very heavy workload. It is more likely that the legislation would be delayed by the government persisting in that approach. So I would encourage the member and the minister's advisers to counsel the minister to agree to this reference. I think it would be to the advantage of those who want to ensure successful passage of this legislation, albeit in an amended form, for the government to cooperate with that committee hearing. I think it is good for this parliament and it would produce better legislation.",17
10,Mr SNOW,CRIMES AMENDMENT,"I am happy to support this crimes legislation, although it is a reflection of the failure of governments-state and federal-to look at history, particularly the history of drug law enforcement. If people and governments were prepared to look at history, a lot more problems would be solved. If the event that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) would like to see happen-a parliamentary committee dealing with this matterdid happen, maybe that committee would look at the history of drug laws in Australia and recognise that we do not need this sort of legislation. I will refer to that again shortly. My first entry into the law was as an adjunct to business. The next was in this parliament when I became a member of this government's policy committee on legal and administrative affairs. I must pay tribute to my former colleague the late Senator Olive Zakharov, who stayed on that committee for the duration of her time in parliament. That showed extraordinary patience because she was not a legal eagle, she wasn't a lawyer, but she felt that someone from the laity ought to be on that committee and stay on it. I give her full credit for that. We ought to enter into the making of laws, and the examining and altering of them, with the philosophy that laws are expedients. They can falter or be altered; they can be bolstered or abandoned. That has been happening through human history and recognises that the laws are not always relevant to a society and often have to change. Quite often, when they are changed, they are changed wrongly. I believe that is the case with the total prohibition of some drugs. A great deal of money, time, worry and legislation and a great number of court hearings, gaolings, bashings and thefts could be avoided if we had examined the history of drug laws, particularly over the last 40 or 50 years. Certainly what the legislation tries to do is not all that unusual. It is not a lot different from making certain laws where certain people have to comply with requirements that others do not have to comply with or certain people are permitted not to comply with requirements that others do have to comply with. For instance, when I was in pharmacy many years ago in Victoria, pharmacists were not allowed to see people in private consultation. Other people were permitted to see people in private consultation---even the laity could do so. A person could call themselves what is now called a naturopath-people used to call them quack doctors. They could see people in private consultation, but a pharmacist at that time could not have a room for seeing a person in private consultation. I guess that was to protect the medical profession. The honourable member for Berowra has mentioned the fact that telephone interceptions are made. Certain people are permitted to intercept conversations on the telephone. The honourable member disputed that this could be serious. He said these are less serious operations. That is wrong because telephone interceptions are often used to detect the drug barons, the people who are breaking the laws in relation to drugs. I do not know whether it is illegal or legal for a police car to speed to catch another speeding car but, if it is illegal, it ought to be made legal because the police do speed when doing that. It is important to recognise that there are a number of possible problems with the application of this legislation. One is accountability. It is difficult to apply accountability to the same extent to these sorts of operations. There is the possibility of corruption. We have seen, even within existing laws, that corruption is possible. The security of drugs is another problem. One of the matters which have come out in some royal commissions and the Winchester inquiry is that police may be involved in something which means that some drugs may not be secure. Then there is the risk to police and other people. There is the cost of the operations as well. The member for Berowra said there is a possibility that the legislation that we pass could be rejected by the courts. I am not so sure of that. I feel that the legislation has had a lot of attention. The Australian Federal Police has estimated that, if the bill is enacted, around 200 applications for a certificate authorising a controlled operation are likely to be sought each year. It is also agreed that there will be cases in which the Federal Police intercept narcotics in transit and will need an authorisation to make sure that those narcotics can continue to their transit destination. The Federal Police has estimated from past experience that a dozen or so operations a year will involve the police facilitating the importation or the exportation of narcotic goods as well. It is also estimated that the National Crime Authority are likely to be involved in an additional 10 to 20 importation or exportation type controlled operations per year. If this legislation goes through, add the cost of those needs to the problems I mentioned before that are associated with illegal drug use in this country. These include theft-the great number of thefts which involve people attacking others or stealing their goods so that they can use drugs. There are the gaol costs. It costs anywhere between $30,000 to $100,000 a year to keep someone in gaol. A high proportion of people in gaol now are there due to drug related offences. Add to that the attacks that have occurred and will continue to occur on people. Add to that the effect on the health of people-not only those who are attacked but also those who are addicted and take drugs of the wrong strength or less pure drugs. Add to that the cash economy, which is implicit in the illegal drug operations in this country. You have enormous costs going into the billions in that cash economy alone as money is lost from taxation to people who are involved. The cash economy and all those other costs should dictate that we examine the need for drug law reform in this country. Only 40 years ago it was legal for a medical practitioner to prescribe heroin and a pharmacist to dispense it. The medical practitioner prescribed oral heroin; the pharmacist dispensed sometimes linctus heroin. When the item was dispensed the patient was told very often by their doctor, 'Don't come back for another week. I'm not going to give you any more.' The patient did just that. A high proportion of the people who were addicted to heroin and other drugs such as chloral hydrate, cocaine and even betel nut were under some degree of control by their doctor. The doctor acknowledged their addiction. The pharmacist knew of their addiction. The legal authorities tended to overlook the addiction. It was illegal to be an addict, but people tended to go along with it if the addicted person was under some control. The person would not break into a pharmacy. In those days, the drug cupboard was a wooden cupboard sitting on the wall with the sort of key that one would have in a wardrobe. I-iVasno different. No-one ever came in an- _robbed it. But after the laws were chang--after the use of heroin, cocaine and amphetamines became illegal-suddenly we had to put safes in our floors and bars on our windows. We had to try to protect ourselves from people who attacked and robbed us and people who robbed others so that they could illegally buy. Drug laws have a chequered history in this country, with some products being legal in one state and not legal in another. For that reason, I have sought a review of drugs laws as they exist in Australia. One thing that is very evident-one might call it the clinical evidence-is this: the problems that exist now did not confront us 40, 50 or 60 years ago or even hundreds of years before that because one could obtain these drugs under varying degrees of control. The drug squad in the 1950s in Victoria contained two people. Those now involved in controlling drug usage through the drug squads or drug law enforcement agencies around Australia-whatever they are now called-must number well into the thousands. This is what making drugs illegal has done. One could dispense cannabis for asthma in the form of a tincture. One could dispense heroin ostensibly for a cough. But it was often used for addiction. One could dispense forms of other medical products, such as opium. Not only our government but also state governments that are primarily involved in drug laws ought to look at history and say, 'We have been trying for 40 years to make things better. There were moves by the United States through the United Nations. What have we done? We have made them worse.' Even now, people will say that people are different now. They are not really all that different. They also claim that we will continue to have crime associated with drug use. This crime is related to the fact that drugs are illegal. Organised crime has found an avenue by which to make money through dealing with something illegal. If these items were made legal, there would no longer be an incentive for people to go out in the streets and give young people free drug usage so that they are enticed into the drug culture. Those young people could go to a doctor and say, 'I have had this drug. I want to be in your program because your drug costs $25 instead of $2,000. That is all I have to pay, so I would rather that you write me the prescription. I will go on the computer and continue to get the drug. I agree to talk about rehabilitation and that sort of thing. That is what I will do. I am prepared to take the drug under control. It is a drug that is pure, properly dosed and properly administered. I am prepared to do that if I can get the drug a lot cheaper.' It would not be worth organised crime maintaining the current structures. It is important that we look at history. I am amazed that people have not been combining. For instance, in pharmacy, the reformers are combining with the conservatives. I regard as a conservative an old pharmacist friend of mine from the Bega area who has operated as far back as I have. I hope that he does not mind being described as a conservative. He applauds the idea of going back to the situation as it existed then, because he is sick and tired of the situation as it exists now. Reformers also ought to be supporting this, because reform is really not about the addict; reform is about getting rid of the organised crime structure. Even the redneck ought to support what I am talking about. The redneck believes that the person, not the weapon, should be targeted. We ought to be dealing with the person rather than the weapon. Certainly, environmentalists and people with civil liberties principles ought to be supporting it, because we are talking about privacy and ci viI liberty, and we may even be talking about the use of natural products. I can understand why we want police power to combat drugs. I agree with the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) that it is crucial that the community is aware that controlled narcotics operations have been used successfully by Australian and overseas law enforcement bodies, and that the Ridgeway decision means that we have to give legislative backing to the method, introducing a range of strict safeguards to ensure the process is not absurd. Either we recognise that or we have our hands over our faces. We chuckle at little children for trying to hide from someone by holding their hands over their faces. That is what we would be doing if we did not acknowledge that. We also need to acknowledge that controlled operations involve surveillance and sometimes active participation of law enforcement officials in the final delivery of narcotics in order to arrest key players rather than merely the couriers. We also acknowledge that the bulk of the narcotics is replaced under this proposal with a substitute to minimise the possibility of drugs entering the community. But we do not have to acknowledge that we continue to have to live with the present situation of drug laws as they operate in Australia today. Let us learn from history.",22
11,Mr WILLIAMS,CRIMES AMENDMENT,"Tangney) (1.41 p.m.)The Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1995 is to amend the Crimes Act 1914. I note that it was introduced into this House on 29 June-the last scheduled day of the last sittings. It turned out not to be the day of sittings, due to the mismanagement by the government of business in the Senate. This second reading debate has obviously been given some urgency by the government-it being the first item of government business on the first day of this final sittings for the year. The bill proposes to authorise the commissioner, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners of the Australian Federal Police and members of the National Crime Authority to issue certificates authorising a controlled law enforcement operation involving the import, export and possession of narcotic drugs. The bill provides that, subject to certain conditions being met, certain law enforcement officers are not criminally liable for offences against the provisions of the Customs Act which prohibit the importation of narcotics. The bill also requires the commissioner of the Australian Federal Police and the chair of the National Crime Authority to report to the minister on the results of applications for certificates authorising controlled operations and the reasons for the decision in each case. The bill requires the minister to report on these matters to parliament. Finally, the bill has what has been described as a retrospective aspect. It provides that the fact that law enforcement officials took part in the importation of narcotics before the commencement of this bill will not render the evidence of that importation inadmissible at trial, provided that the importation was made pursuant to a request from the AFP to the Australian Customs Service for exemption from detailed customs scrutiny. I will say more about the provisions of the bill in a moment. As has been mentioned, Australia is a party to the United Nations Convention on Illicit Traffic in Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Article 11 of that convention deals with what is termed 'controlled delivery'. Controlled delivery is defined in the convention as the technique of allowing certain narcotic drugs 'to pass out of, through or into the territory of one or more countries, with the knowledge and under the supervision last of their competent authorities, with a view to identifying persons involved in the commission of offences' under the convention. Article 11 imposes an obligation on Australia as a party to 'take the necessary measures to allow for the appropriate use of controlled delivery at the international level, on the basis of agreements or arrangements mutually consented to, with a view to identifying persons involved in offences and to taking legal action against them'. Australia thus has a positive duty to ensure that the appropriate laws are in place for a system of controlled narcotics operations to be conducted by law enforcement officials with the aim of stemming the international flow of narcotics and psychotropic substances. But this bill is not prompted by the government's duty to implement an international obligation. As the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) said in his second reading speech, this bill is the government's response to the decision of the High Court in the case of Ridgeway v. R delivered this year. The High Court decided in that case that, where law enforcement officials break the law by committing as principal or as an accessory the offence for any which the defendant is being prosecuted, then, as a general rule, a court should exercise a discretion to refuse to allow the evidence gathered in the course of that illegal conduct to be admitted. The majority judges of the High Court were concerned that, when those who are entrusted to uphold the law engage in illegal conduct, confidence in the criminal justice system will be lost. These judges said that, if law enforcement officers are to be exempted from the law, then that was an issue for parliament and not for the courts. This bill would reverse the effect of the decision in Ridgeway by exempting law enforcement officers from criminal liability for certain conduct related to importahas tion, exportation or possession of narcotics. The bill aims to ensure the evidence gathered by the police as a result of their conduct will be able to be presented to a court for consideration as evidence against the accused. To understand how the bill will operate, it is necessary to look at the grounds on which a certificate authorising a controlled operation may be given. There are four grounds. First, the applicant must satisfy the authorising officer that he or she has provided as much information as he or she possesses about the nature and the quantity of narcotics to which the operation relates. The aim of this is that, as far as possible, the certificate must accurately describe the narcotics in question. Secondly, the authorising officer must be satisfied that the suspected criminal activity under investigation would have taken place without the involvement of law enforcement officials. In the explanatory memorandum, the government states that this is to ensure that certificates are not issued to allow the police to entrap citizens who otherwise would not have been involved in the commission of a narcotics offence. Thirdly, the authorising officer must be satisfied that the operation has a genuine law enforcement purpose-that it will make it much easier to obtain evidence that may lead to the prosecution of an offence of importing narcotics in breach of the Customs Act. Fourthly, the authorising officer must be satisfied that any narcotics involved in the operation and that will arrive in Australia at the end of the operation will be under the control of an Australian law enforcement officer. As the government states in the explanatory memorandum, it is essential, no matter the route taken or the different couriers involved, that the narcotics be under police control at the end of the operation. It is vital that drugs do not go astray and enter the community. The bill provides that the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police and the chair of the National Crime Authority must inform the minister of any decision to grant or refuse to grant a certificate, and the reasons for that decision, as soon as possible after the decision been made. The bill requires the minister to lay a report about applications for controlled operations in the year to 30 June before each house of parliament. For my part, I regard the so-called retrospective section of the bill as not retrospective in any real sense. It is a part of the bill which applies only to controlled operations started before the commencement of the bill. Its effect will be that evidence that narcotics were imported into Australia in contravention of the Customs Act is not inadmissible on the grounds that a law enforcement officer mitted an offence in importing narcotics, if three things can be shown. The first is that the police officer must have been acting in the course of duty for purposes of the controlled operation when he or she committed the offence. Secondly, it must have been a purpose of the operation obtain evidence leading to the prosecution a person for a narcotics offence. Thirdly, the purposes of the controlled operation, Australian Federal Police member must have made a written request, which purported to be hand. made in accordance with the 1987 ministerial agreement relating to such requests, to a customs official that narcotics be exempted from detailed customs scrutiny, and that request must have been granted. The retrospective effect of this part of bill is to make admissible evidence that would, under the decision in Ridgeway, corruption. almost certainly be excluded from evidence against an accused in a narcotics case because of the illegality of the police conduct. On face of it, it does not affect the elements the substantive criminal offence with which the accused is charged. This therefore appears not to be a case where the parliament is by legislation retrowho spectively making illegal an act that at time it was committed was lawful. In fact, relation to the police conduct, it is making legal an act which was illegal at the time was committed. It appears not to have been, therefore, of the character of truly retrospecphone tive legislation that is anathema to the princithe ples of justice to which the coalition, and adhere. However, it is an unusual piece legislation, and the ramifications of it do require detailed examination. It is appropriate, in my view, that this examination be conany person. ducted by a parliamentary committee. While the issue of retrospectivity is not of real concern to me in the case of this bill, least at this time, the question of the authorisenior sation of controlled operations and the scrulaws tiny and reporting requirements in relation those operations is. It is of concern to me that the bill, in substance, seems to authorise police to authorise other police to conduct illegal operations in conjunction with persons comwho are believed to be criminals. The telecommunications interception laws are, in some ways, similar to the proposed controlled operations provisions of this bill. the They involve the balancing of important competing interests. In the case of the telecommunications interception laws, these are to the interests of the investigation, apprehenof sion, prosecution and conviction of people for engaged in serious organised major crime on an the one hand and the priceless rights of privacy and freedom of speech on the other The community expects and deserves high standards in its police services. One has only to look to the proceedings of the current Wood Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service to see that one need not the even authorise police to partake in illegal conduct for there to be opportunities for Unlike the telecommunications interception laws, the provisions of this bill do not include the the requirement for judicial approval or of supervision of the otherwise illegal conduct. Applications for phone interception warrants are made to an eligible judge. This is defined as a judge of a court created by parliament has consented in writing to his or her the nomination and who has been nominated by in the Attorney-General. It appears that so far only the judges of the Federal Court of it Australia and the Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia have been nominated. The interception legislation provides that judge must consider the availability of I, alternative ways of investigating the offence of and, in the case of certain offences, the gravity of the conduct being investigated and the degree of interference with the privacy of I urge the minister to consider amending the bill so that an application for a certificate to at conduct a controlled operation is made to a judicial officer. The phone interception require an application for an interception to warrant to be accompanied by an affidavit stating the grounds on which the affidavit is based, the period for which the warrant should be in force and the reason for the period, the number of previous applications made in relation to the person who is the subject of the application and the number of warrants previously issued in relation to that person. I urge the government to tighten up the requirements for the application for a certificate contained in this bill to bring them more into line with the more stringent provisions of the telecommunications interception legislation. The telecommunications interception legislation also contains provisions relating to the keeping and inspection of the interception records of Commonwealth agencies. Thus, the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority must maintain records relating to interceptions and the use of intercepted information. The telecommunications interception laws also require the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to keep a register of all interception warrants. The register shows relevant particulars, including the date of issue and period for which the warrant is to be enforced; the agency to which the warrant was issued and the judge who issued the warrant; the telecommunications service to which the warrant relates; the name of the person specified in the warrant as the person using or likely to use the telecommunications service; and each serious offence in relation to which the judge who issued the warrant was satisfied on the application for the warrant. The commissioner is required to deliver the register to the minister for inspection every three months. The register is also subject to inspection by the ombudsman to ensure its accuracy and compliance with the legislation. Perhaps more can be done using these record keeping and accountability provisions to ensure that there is ultimately better scrutiny by the parliament of the controlled operations contemplated by this bill. Another question, which in my view justifies the coalition""s recommendation for parliamentary committee scrutiny being undertaken, relates to the relationship of this bill with state laws. State laws provide for offences in relation to the possession of, the dealing in and the use of narcotics. I ask whether the relationship of this bill with state laws has been properly examined. We could have the unfortunate situation arising whereby state police are unknowingly tracking a controlled operation and are arresting and charging Commonwealth law enforcement officers for alleged offences in relation to state laws. In the speech of the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), a number of reasons were put forward as to why this bill should be considered by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That committee has a record of dealing with related matters. In recent times it has considered and reported on the child sex tourism legislation, the International War Crimes Tribunal legislation and the search warrants legislation, all of which deal with the relationship between police powers and the citizen. Because of those factors, the committee is particularly well equipped to consider this bill. Because of the urgency of this legislation, the committee should be given, and I am sure would agree to, a relatively short timetable and reporting date in relation to its inquiry. If police are to engage in conduct that would ordinarily be criminal, such as importing heroin, in order to defeat crime, the conduct must be done in a lawful way. In other words, we need legislation which lays down the sorts of circumstances in which it can be done and we need a judicial, administrative and parliamentary process to ensure that it is always lawful, always necessary and always scrutinised. It is not merely a question of closing a loophole before too many drug dealers get through. This legislation touches the heart of our criminal justice system, and public confidence in that criminal justice system must be maintained. Debate (on motion by Mr Tanner) adjourned. NA Daly, Hon. Frederick Michael, AO",25
12,Mr KEATING,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Wednesday, 2 August 1995, of the Honourable Frederick (Fred) Michael Daly, AO, Member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Martin from 1943 to 1949, and the Division of Grayndler from 1949 to 1975, and Minister for Services and Property and Leader of the House from 1972 to 1975, and records its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to family in their bereavement. It was a very sad day for most members of this House, certainly for those who knew Fred Daly, when we learned that he had died. He was a larger than life figure who gave great colour and sustenance to the Labor Party during most of the postwar years up to his retirement from the House of Representatives in 1975. He was very much a classic son of the Labor Party. He was the son of Irish parents, who came from County Clare in Ireland. He was one of 11 children. When he was 11 his father died, which must have been a dreadful personal blow to him. You could imagine what the loss of the breadwinner of a family of 11 would have been at that time, in the 1920s. Fred left school at 14 and earned some money for the family. He took his first job with a bicycle firm as a messenger. He soon became an active member of the Federated Clerks Union-an association which he was to maintain all his life. He was a young man during the Depression, and those years of hardship no doubt stayed with him right through his life and formed his social and political views. Fred joined the Labor Party, seeing the Labor Party as a vehicle of social change and also the party that protected working Australians and looked after their interests. He sought to become a member of the House of Representatives, which he did for the division of Martin in 1943. He was then a member of the Curtin government. They were, at that time, in the depths of the Second World War and prosecuting the war. I know he was very upset by Curtin's death in 1945. He then remained a dedicated member of the Chifley government up until 1949 and unerringly spoke favourably about Ben Chifley. He was, for the federal Labor Party, one of the links back to the Curtin and Chifley years. I think Fred was the last member of the Curtin government. Through him we have, in a sense, a connection back to that time. Though some other members of the Chifley administration are alive today, he was one of the celebrated people of that period. He spent all those years in opposition up until 1972. his Like a generation of Labor people, he lost, in a sense, that opportunity, that youthful experience, he had had. He had already been in public life for a very long time by the time the Labor Party was next elected to government in 1972. He had been in parliament virtually 30 years at that stage. Along with a number like him, government came a bit late in Fred's life. Though the joy that overtook him with that victory sustained him for the rest of his life, he lived through the Labor Party in the dark days of the split. Even when I came here in 1969, as a remnant of that argument some members of the caucus did not talk to others. He suffered quite substantially at that time. As the Whitlam opposition had nearly taken the election in 1969, there was a tremendous amount of goodwill between members of the party, those in factions who had looked askance at one another for a long period of time. They got themselves into a position to win in 1972. That group of people who had experienced that long period of opposition, from 1949 to 1972, were of course the core minisierial group of the Whitlam government. It was, I think, one of the things which certainly made Fred's later life. He was overjoyed by the opportunity. Fred was Minister for Services and Property and was also Leader of the House. He was always very happy when the opposition called a division. He never liked to take a vote on the ayes. He said, 'I was on the receiving end for so long, I liked to put the boot in and watch the numbers go up.' He would sit back there and chuckle away as the vote was counted. He was a great public speaker. He had huge mental agility, tremendous word flow and tremendous construction of ideas in a speech. He was humorous and mocking. He had all of the skills that the old parliamentary debate used to breed in people who had that experience. He employed those skills very effectively. He was always effective in reply: listen to an argument, see what comes your way and then put the counter case. I know it is often the job of the Leader of the House in any parliament to take the argument on behalf of the government when matters arise in the parliament, particularly at the behest of the opposition. That is true today; it was true then. He used to take the argument then and most effectively. He loved the cut and thrust of politics. There was a joviality about him. One of the nice things people think about Fred is that he was a jovial figure. He was a fun-loving, jovial character. That should not be seen to diminish the partisan side of him. He was avidly pro-Labor and he did not like defeats. He liked winning. When he made an argument, he made it effectively and it hit its target. He said in a book he wrote: I was privileged to serve in Parliament with some of the great political performers, masters of the of scorn, ridicule, satire, and humour, who used them devastatingly to win their point. Humour as practised by the masters of these skills-in Parliament or in the public forum-was not for amusement; it was to win an argument, cheerfully yet effectively. I suppose in many respects that says much about his own style. That is really what he did. He could be humorous and light-hearted. We saw much of that in his later life, when he left the House of Representatives. He, amongst a couple of others-I think of Jim Killen from the Liberal Party; they had a firm friendship-spent some substantial time talking about the House of Representatives and their shared experiences. Most members know that they would see Fred in these corridors. He used to take groups of people in Canberra around the various political shrines-Old Parliament House, the old cabinet room, the party rooms, this building-and teach them about the operation of the parliamentary system and how a democracy worked, but he would also tell them anecdotes and stories as they went along. He was very entertaining and colourful. When he was much younger-say 20 years ago, not long after he retired-he used to do the speaking circuit. He was a scream. When he was really on his form, he was outrageously funny. He had all of these skills, but he was very passionate. I often think people saw Fred Daly as a jovial, light-hearted, highspirited character, but he was very passionate about the things he believed in. The parish priest at St Brigid's in Marrickville, in his remarks about Fred at the funeral, made some telling points about Fred's connection with his electorate and his community which were all completely true. It showed that he never lost that touch with the public or his compassion for them. He felt the need to represent their interests poignantly and he did that. He was perhaps a typical Labor figure, growing up in a working class suburb, representing it all of his adult life, staying loyal to it thereafter and, which was then an unusual thing, keeping a connection with the parliament and the parliamentary party later on though he was no longer in it. On this side of the House, we all enjoyed arts him and his experiences. It is worth recording some of the positions Fred held. He was Opposition Whip from 1950 to 1956 and Minister for Services and Property and Leader of the House from 1972 to 1975. He served as a member of the Joint Committee on Social Security from 1943 to 1946, a member of the Rationing Committee from 1946 to 1950, a member and later deputy chairman of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory from 1967 to 1972 and a member of the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council from 1970 to 1973. He took a great interest in the immigration program and was very proud of the multiculturalism of Australia. Though from a classic Anglo-Irish background, he really did rejoice in the changes which Arthur Calwell introduced as Minister for Immigration in those years of government. When I first came to Canberra, the migration committee used to have tours on the migrant ships and they were a scream in themselves. We would all board in Perth, go around the coast and end up in Sydney. I remember on one occasion a tour happened during a wharfies strike. We were on one of the Greek liners-the Australis, the Patris or one of those; I cannot recall-and the wharfies would not dock it. Fred and Bert James got on the telephone from the ship to see whether we could get the ship docked. At each port, we would get the ship docked and we would move from one port to another. The company used to say, 'You'd better come more often.' On these visits Fred used to go around and talk to the migrants, trying to keep a useful understanding of the issues. He was friendly with Sir Peter Heydon, who was then the secretary of the department. He kept more than just a political eye on the migration program-he kept not only an academic interest in it but also a practical interest in it. So Fred had those particular interests. I have got to say-although my friends opposite may not appreciate the point-that Fred was broken-hearted over 1975. I think that dashed his faith in the system. He had been in opposition for so long and then, when it came his tum, three years later, like so many others he was turned out. He was quite bitter about that, but he never let that bitterness intrude upon his relations with people. Perhaps 'disappointment' is a better word than 'bitterness'-I do not think Fred was a bitter fellow, but he was exceedingly disappointed. I think the long period of Labor government from 1983 onwards meant a lot to Fred because he thought the political balance had been re-established and there was no ongoing reward for what had happened in the Senate in 1975. He put these things behind him and enjoyed an active personal and political life thereafter. He had many friends-and I am very happy to say that they were from both sides of the House-and he kept those friends right through his life. He lost his wife, sadly, in the 1970s. This was a great blow to him. It took him a long time to regain his equilibrium from it. But he had the constant companionship of his daughter, Margaret, who is in the House today, and the support of his son, Lawrence-and I think this made a great difference. Of course, he had for a while a big woolly dog he called Sir John. You don't need two or three guesses to work out whom he was referring to in naming it that. Sir John used to go around the corridors with him. Fred lived here in Canberra for most of those years with Margaret, his daughter, and then later went to Sydney. He will be missed by all of us on this side of the House. He was a substantial person, and he was a link for us back to those years of the Curtin government. I think linkages are important in public life-they give you continuity. If you look at those things which the Labor Party has as well as the coalition, as distinct from some of the other minor parties, there are those linkages and that continuity of policy experience, shared policy experiences-and, for us, you can go back then to the war years with, if you like, one personality whom we all knew. That gives you the stories, the attitudes, the articles of faith and the measuring rods, the measuring sticks, the calibrations, if you like, which have been provided by people like Fred Daly. We have always appreciated having them in the Labor family. Anyway, we have lost a favoured and favourite son, and we are very sad about it. On behalf of the government, I extend to Margaret, Lawrence, daughter-in-law Anne and the grandchildren, Kate, Clare and Michael, our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. We know how much you all loved your grandfather and father. I am sure I speak on behalf of every member of the House in saying that we share these days and weeks with you. We offer you our deepest sympathy.",28
13,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"I knew Fred Daly-not as well as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and many members opposite did, but I did serve with him for 18 months between May 1974 and 1975. I liked him immensely. He was one those postwar political figures in Australia who drew a great amount of warmth and affection from both sides of politics. I would like very genuinely to associate the Liberal and National parties with the condolence motion which has been moved by the Prime Minister. I had the privilege of attending the magnificent mass for him at St Brigid's Church in Marrickville. One of the Prime Minister's colleagues described it, as did many others on that day, as something of a great tribal gathering-and, even though I did not feel totally that I was part of the tribe, I think I could appreciate the sense of togetherness that many of the people who were there felt with the late Fred Daly. He did, of course, belong to that very special working class inner city trilogy in that he was a staunch member of the Catholic Church, he was a very great Labor man and he was a passionate follower of rugby league. That is a very special Sydney trilogy. He demonstrated that in his later life, of course, when he transferred his affections from the not so visible Newtown club to the Canberra Raiders-and it was fitting that his coffin should have been carried from that church by three of the very well-known and great members of that club. Fred Daly was a great character. He was larger than life. He did have an infectious sense of humour, and he did have that command of language of which the Prime Minister has spoken. The one-liners poured out of him, both in the House and in private conversation. I remember when I first came here just after the 1974 election, and we were grappling with the novelty of a joint sitting. Fred was orchestrating that as the Leader of the House, asserting what he always liked to assert, of course-the predominant role of the House of Representatives in these matters-and he was not going to let that go by. I remember he came up to me and said, 'Oh, you're Howard, aren't you? You've got Bennelong. Have you got that place Hunters Hill in it?' I said, 'Yes, I have got Hunters Hill.' He said, 'I used to have Hunters Hill. When I first represented the seat of Martin, it stretched right over the water. It started off in inner Sydney and went right over the water and grabbed Hunters Hill. They were terrific people in Hunters Hill, John, until they started to vote.' I will never forget what was probably the most accomplished demolition of a new member-indeed, any member-I have heard for quite a while. It was at the time of the loans demarche-whatever you want to call it-and involved that Pakistani commodities dealer Tirath Khemlani. There was a spontaneous question that came to Fred from somewhere in the back of the government benches about what this particular gentleman was up to. He described in graphic detail a media chase of Khemlani all around the back streets of Canberra. There were television cameras and there were taxis. He said, 'You know what? The poor bloke ended up ensconced in a hotel. He had a fate worse than death-he had to spend three hours with Bob Ellicott and John Howard, going over his papers.' He did it with his great charm and his great wit, and he did it in a way that did not betray a sense of bitterness. There was nothing vicious but, boy, it was consummate in its invective, its political ridicule and its political satire. I think he could teach all of us on both sides of the House a thing or two about genuine political satire, and I thought he did it very well. Fred was, as the Prime Minister said, very much the quintessential son of the Labor Party. His commitment to the Labor Party throughout his life was admirable, obvious and all-consuming. I think nobody who attended the mass for him a couple of weeks ago would have been other than greatly impressed with the very warm words that were spoken by the parish priest about the good works that he had done amongst what would have been a lot of poverty and a lot of hardship in inner Sydney in the 1940s and early 1950s. It is something to be proud of that he maintained, through his life in parliament and also in his years after parliament, a very close friendship with Jim Killen, who was a Liberal member of parliament between 1955 and 1983. They were genuine friends. They shared many jokes together; they were the butt of each other's humour in public; they debated vigorously on numerous subjects. There is not the slightest doubt that Jim Killen spoke genuinely, compassionately and from the heart when he said, when he learnt of Fred Daly's death, that he had lost a great friend. You will not see the likes of Fred Daly again-in the same way that you will not see the likes of somebody like John MCEwen again from our side of politics. They represented an era when people lived through different times, different circumstances. Their life experience from their early childhood straddled in many cases both wars, a depression, in Fred's case two significant splits in his own party-one huge, one not so big; nonetheless, it was a painful split-and, as the Prime Minister said, some long years of opposition. I remember the weekend that his wife died. It was not long before the culmination of the constitutional crisis in 1975. A number of us expressed our condolences to him in the House when it resumed. It was very obvious that he had lost a devoted wife and lifelong partner. Their faithful marriage was a great example, not only to those close to them but to many who moved in their broader community. I say very warmly, on behalf of the opposition, that he was a great Australian character with special qualities, respected and liked by his political supporters and his political opponents. I join the Prime Minister in expressing my personal condolences to the late Fred Daly's daughter, Margaret, and his son, Lawrence, and to his three grandchildren who participated in the mass for him a couple of weeks ago. I believe he has left a great legacy of affection in the Australian parliament and in political life, and we are all the richer having been touched by his life.",31
14,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"I rise to support the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in their comments with regard to the late Fred Daly, who, after all, was born at a small place called Currabubula, near Tamworth, in the electorate of New England, adjoining the electorate of Gwydir. That is one of those great little communities or towns, quite colourful in itself, that certainly produced a very colourful son in Fred Daly. In his very last speech to the parliamentperhaps this epitomised his generous spirit and his touch of humour-Fred Daly said, 'I have a soft spot for the Country Party, although it may not always be apparent. I look with great concern at Ralph Hunt and worry about how he will go in the electorate.' It is only for me to record that on one occasion, when Ralph Hunt had lost access to his accommodation arrangements in Canberra, it was none other than Frederick Michael Daly AO who came to Ralph Hunt's rescue and offered him accommodation for that period to help him out, in a way which I guess we would not see this day. It is a mark of the generosity of Fred Daly and the special bond that he had with a number of members on both sides of the House. On another occasion, Fred Daly was debating that vexed subject of aircraft noise. He said, again from the floor of the parliament: I listen to the remarks of supporters of the government who took part in the debate tonight. What a weird and wonderful collection they were. First we had the honourable member for Cowper Mr Robinsonwhom many members would rememberwho lives on the north coast of New South Wales. He is one of the people whom the aeroplanes carry over my electorate at midnight and keep half the population awake. Having to look at him in the day time is bad enough, but fancy being woken up by him in the evening! I did not know Fred Daly personally very well-he was certainly an acquaintance-as I had arrived many years after he had departed the federal parliament. He was always a for friendly and kindly person, though, when you did encounter him on the circuit in and around Canberra. He certainly was a great upholder of his beliefs in the Labor Party. In his determination, dedication and in that period when he was a minister, he was extremely active in not only going about a number of changes but, in terms of electoral redistribution, putting in a particular set of clauses which have had great ramification and influence to this day. I acknowledge the contribution that he has made to the Australian way of life, to the Australian parliament, to the communities he more directly represented and to the Australian Labor Party. In many ways, he was the very opposite of that other stalwart, Captain Sam Benson, a former member for Batman, whose death we will be noting a little later on today. Captain Sam Benson was a quiet, retiring, shy man whom I got to know as shadow minister for veterans affairs. Fred Daly was gregarious, always seemingly confident but always quite rigorous. Underneath that charming smile of Fred Daly, there was a brain ticking away, making the political points, as was his wont. I salute the contribution that he made to the parliament and to the nation. I extend, on behalf of the National Party, sympathy to his son, Lawrie, to his daughter, Margaret, to his family and to the members of the government this day on the loss of their friend, their former minister, their former Leader of the House and former Labor Party Whip. It is sad, as the Leader of the Opposition remarked-maybe it is the media, maybe it is the changing nature of federal politics in Australia in the 1990s-that it seems there will be fewer characters of the Fred Daly and Jim Killen type in the system. That it is so is a great pity, and it is all the more reason why I express deep sympathy on the loss of Fred Daly.",33
15,Mr BEAZLEY,CONDOLENCES,"One thing we can be absolutely certain about today is that today's discussion will not do Fred Daly justice. This House is not really capable of it in his absence. fore we must struggle as we may and make sure that all the important things about Fred get on the record as a continuing memorial for future generations of politicians and, of course, for his family represented here today. I have two layers of memories of Fred Daly: youthful ones, because he shared, in what was very much an odd couple relationship, an office with my father for over a decade so that the times I came to Canberra Fred loomed very large in my life; and more recent ones, since we have been in government, of Fred, as a solid supporter of the government, a solid supporter of the party, being a frequent presence here in the parliament and at major public occasions, full of good advice, wit and joy of life. The last time. I saw Fred Daly was when I was opening an exhibition on the life of John Curtin to memorialise his death. This was only a few days before Fred died. Fred came along and sat conspicuously to one side to listen to the proceedings. It was extraordinary to watch how he was treated by the very large gathering as an historical object in himself. This was something that he very much enjoyed because he pointed out to everybody who came past him--correctly-that he was the last person alive who sat in a parliament with John Curtin. That is the case. His passing means that that critical link to our past has now disappeared and there is no-one alive who served in parliament with John Curtin. He had that wonderful historical presence that went along with all the rest that he represented. I was always curious as to how my father and he would get along. Even as a young person I could recognise a difference in their personalities. Fred explained it to me this way one day: 'Your father and I get along for this reason-I am never in the office and your father is never out of it.' To some extent that summed up their personalities. Dad told me that one of the things he dreaded was to go on an electoral visit to Sydney with Fred because Fred was quintessentially a man of Sydney politics, quick-witted and knowing. That is Sydney politics-quick-witted and knowing-and part There- of that knowing is knowing everybody. A progress along a street with Fred anywhere in Sydney was a diabolically slow process. You might have thought that you would get a couple of blocks door-knocking, but you never would. You might have thought you could go a fair way down the track. You never would because Fred would stop with everybody, whatever part of Sydney you happened to be in, and engage them in quick-witted conversation and then say, 'Here's Kim Beazley. What have you got to say, Kim?' 'Oh, thank you, Fred.' The breadth and depth of his contacts was extraordinary, As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) referred to, he was of a generation of Labor politicians-which still exists-that combines a love of rugby league, a love of their faith and their church, and a love of the Labor Party. At the memorial mass for Fred there was a wonderful comment made about one of those branch members loyally supportive of Fred Daly over the years, so confused in her relationships as a daily communicant and a regular attendee of these political gatherings that she would genuflect to the chair as she came in. There is a view that that is not an unwise thing to do anyway in the politics of the branches that we operate. So there may be more to it than the priest actually understood. Nevertheless, it was a statement too about Fred. He was a wonderful puncturer of pretension. My mother recalls the story of the opening of the Snowy River scheme. She and all the other members and members' spouses were boarding a bus. At the front of the bus was seated a very obvious member of the British aristocracy who was there for the occasion. Fred, at the back of the line, was obviously a little depressed at the obvious deference that was being paid this gentleman as everybody got aboard the bus. So he got aboard himself, he was just about the last one, and he spread his arms and said, 'Here I am; Lord help us!' He had a devotion to all forms of transport and to saying interesting things on them. My memory of him is getting on a similar mode of transport-an aircraft-and coming out of Canberra with the front end of the plane loaded with current members of parliament, as is its wont on a Thursday afternoon or Friday morning, heading down to Melbourne. When Fred got on there was always an instant presence. You could hear his voice before he came into view. So there would be absolute silence as Fred moved down the corridor. He looked at us all and said, 'I'm going down the back where people pay for their own airfares.' He was down on the Senate. He did not have a great deal of time for it. He used to say-and it was not original to me, though I heard him say it; it struck me as something at the time, but it was something he said to others-that in the old members' facilities there was a billiard table and it was regularly used. He used to say, 'Proficiency in billiards-sign of a misspent youth or membership of the Australian Senate.' He had many more unkind things to say about senators as the years went by. Everybody has spoken about his absenc- of bitterness, which was extraordinary. When you look back on his life, particularly before he got a safe seat in parliament, you see that he was involved in some diabolically bloody preselection battles. He had to have a preparedness, of course, once getting a safe seat, to fight even more bloody preselection battles, or at least the threat of them, whenever an election was likely to come on. He also went through the terrible bitterness of the splits in the Labor Party of the 1950s and the great disappointment of his ejection from office along with the rest of the Whitlam government in 1975. But he could say this: 'When I was elected to parliament I was told I was a oncer. I ask those honourable members opposite who hold slim seats to remember that. Then I won a second time and I was a twicer. Then the electors made me a lifer, which made me happier still. The point about the thrust of politics is that it is a dangerous thing to make permanent enemies on either side or even in one's own party, because the fellow who is against you today may be with you tomorrow.' So his personality was entirely sunny, entirely joyful and unencumbered by the barnacles that grow on all of us in politics as the years go by for which we are never careened. He was always unencumbered by that and led that joyous life. But it would be wrong to say-and I conclude with this-that there was not an extremely serious side to him. He was deeply committed to democratic politics and deeply committed to the conditions of democracy in this country-how people got themselves elected to parliament, the basis on which they were elected and how they would be funded to get into those processes-because in that lay the essence of a fair system, in Fred's mind. He was able to do a deal about it when he became Minister for Services and Property and Leader of the House. He also took very seriously what is these days now termed the social safety net. In his first speech to parliament in the middle of the war he commented on the fact that the extraordinary centralised commitment that resulted from the necessities of federal government during the war was not to be lost when the peace came. If the nation could get its resources together to successfully fight that conflict, it could get itself together to fight a conflict which had made at least as much impact on him, and that was the conflict of trying to find a means of subsistence during the Depression. The thought of that lived with him all his political life and dominated the views that he expressed in parliament. He was an extremely loyal man to his leaders-to Curtin, to Evatt and to Calwell. Pat Kennelly said, noting that, Fred would have been an ideal deputy to Gough Whitlam. That was not to be, though he rose to very great prominence. I join in the condolences to the members of his family here: Margaret, son Lawrie, daughter-in-law Anne and grandchildren Kate, Clare and Michael.",34
16,Mr SINCLAIR,CONDOLENCES,"I, too, share in the condolences to the late Fred Daly and to join with the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley). Wherever Fred is, we can be quite sure that somewhere up there he is marking this spot and this time and taking a bus tour of his fellow angels in heaven to show what those of us still down here are saying about him. I spent some years in this place both as an opponent of Fred and, for the 18 months prior to that eventful 11 November 1975, as his opposite number as Manager of Opposition Business. Fred was a wonderful character and, as the Deputy Prime Minister has suggested, it would not be possible for any of us in this place to recap in a few words either the memory or the quality of the man or his contribution to Australian politics. Good humour, good intent, total motivation and driven purpose were all characteristic of the man we knew as Fred Daly. I was interested in turning back to Fred's maiden speech. He always had an ability to hit things where they really should be. Incredibly, that speech was made 52 years ago and he spoke very aptly of a matter which we have all been commemorating this week. It was in the dark years of World War II that he concluded his speech by saying: It shall be my object, as a member of Parliament, both inside and outside the chamber, to see that when the war is over the people of Australia at least will live as free men and women in every sense of the word, and will enjoy social and economic security which is their right. That remained his intent and his commitment. As a minister in this place, his legislative changes very much embraced what he saw as the objects of that original commitment made in his maiden speech so long ago. The origins of Fred were very much in the heartland from which I come. He was always one who looked back on that origin with some pleasure. In the comments made at the time Fred made his last speech in the House, Gough Whitlam made a few comments about Fred's Currabubula origins. He referred to the fact that it was about the only time the Northern Daily Leader-which in those days was a fairly well orientated paper politically; that is, towards the then Country Party-carried a photograph of a Labor man on the front page. Gough Whitlam continued: Not only that, I happen to have preserved the fifth page on which there are 5 photographs of Currabubula's most famous son. Fred was also quite frequent in his reference to a man called Thunderbolt, who was a bushranger in my part of the world in days gone by. I remember Fred mentioning to Arthur Fadden that his father-that is, Fred's father-knew Thunderbolt. Artie responded, 'I thought he was Thunderbolt.' I can understand in some ways that sentiment. In trying to express in a few moments something of the man I would be wrong if I did not tell every private member of this place that they may well not realise the debt they owe Fred. As has been explained, he spent 23 long years in opposition. He felt there was a great divide between the perks and lurks of office and the measures available to those who were ordinary members of the parliament. In the early stages of his administration of the then services and property portfolio, Fred made sure that there was some correction of that imbalance. He introduced a number of measures which private members of this place still enjoy today. Alan Reid suggested in an article in the Bulletin of 25 August 1973 that Fred was about narrowing the affluence gap between backbenchers and ministers. I think that is a motivation which many who are today's backbenchers might well feel very worthwhile. In looking back at that same debate on the occasion of the valedictory of Fred, I remember a couple of remarks that were made. I know that we all regarded Fred as a great master of electoral boundaries so that they would advantage, naturally, the party to which he belonged. The only trouble was that I am told that in the very early days of his own candidature he was standing for the seat of Marrickville. He made one of his very early speeches in Spring Street, Bondi, which is no doubt known to the ex-member for Phillip, who is here today. At that stage Spring Street, Bondi happened to be in the electorate of Phillip, not in the seat of Marrickville. He extolled his virtues through a slogan, which I still think is magnificent-'Give us this day, our Daly Fred'. That was his slogan for his first campaign. Looking back at those speeches, the bit of poetry that epitomised Fred most, and which I am sure appealed to him, was that of Jim Killen, who, as the Leader of the Opposition said, was not only a personal friend but a great political opponent of Fred. I will read that poem because it so epitomises the man as we all knew him. It says: 'The time has come', Fred Daly said, 'To talk of many things: Of parliamentary privilege, And how to pull the strings. Of why we travel 2nd class Though Gough still has his wings. 'As Leader of the House', said Fred, 'My works have been sublime I've guillotined Bills out of sight, To meet the stress of time. For 32 long years I've slaved And still just in my prime. 'Yet I must tell you all', said Fred, 'That I have had a ball. My Opposition friends may say I've had a lot of gall. But when I go they'll doubtless say: ""Our Fred was loved by all"".' How true that is. Fred was respected, admired and perhaps feared, but he always made his mark. He was a great parliamentarian. It is sad that the humour which he used so effectively is so rarely present in the ordinary conduct of affairs of this House. Fred and Mick Young are two parliamentarians who, in my mind, perhaps more than any others were able to totally defuse a critical situation by the apt use of a few words and the one-liner and by turning humour against themselves. Fred Daly was a great Australian. He certainly was a great member of the Labor Party. His attitude to people and to time and circumstance was not just a product of the time but very much the product of the making of the man. From very humble origins, he rose to be a very senior and well-respected minister of this place. To Lawrie and his family, and to Fred's daughter, Margaret, I would like to extend the deepest sympathies from Rosemary and me in their sad loss.",36
17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,I call the Minister for Consumer Affairs.,37
18,Ms MCHUGH,CONDOLENCES,"And member for Grayndler. Several people have already mentioned the extraordinary celebration of mass at St Brigid's at Marrickville for Fred Daly. Everyone who was there will remember it for a long time. It was not only a celebration of Fred Daly's life and work; it really turned out to be a celebration of the party and the people he represented in the seat of Grayndler, and especially Marrickville. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) could feel so strongly, it was as if you were in the heart of the Labor Party and, to be honest, the heart of the working class of the inner west of Sydney. All the important people in Australia came to Marrickville that day: the Governor General came, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) came and, indeed, several former prime ministers came. The state government was represented and the services were represented. The High Court, the judiciary and the legal profession all came to Marrickville that day. Parliamentary colleagues from across Australia from both sides of politics came to Marrickville that day. St Brigid's was already packed with the people of Marrickville, and it was a wonderful day for us all-not that it was not a sad day. We all went there in such sadness and came away with a real feeling of celebration. That happened in the church that day. The people of Marrickville were there in their hundreds. It was one of the most moving and memorable events that I have ever been to. For members of his party, members of his church, members of his football teams and members of his electorate, it was a real coming together-and it was all for Fred Daly. I think that day was like a giant thank you to Fred for giving so much and for enjoying it so much. Everyone always thinks of Fred with a smile on his face and a good story to tell. We all know how he would drop into our offices. He would see your name on the door and think, 'Oh, that reminds me of something or other' and he would drop in and tell you a good story-but always with deep acknowledgment and recognition of the Labor Party, the history of the Labor Party and what it stood for, and the people that he represented. To his family I want to say, 'No wonder you are proud of Fred, because his party-the Labor Party-and his electorate, Grayndler, are very proud of him.'",37
19,Mr DOBIE,CONDOLENCES,"I will speak but briefly, but I must speak today. Fred Daly was a great guy, and all of us who served with him in this House know he was a great guy. We also know he was a great humorist, but, above all, he was a great guy. On one occasion just after I had been elected in 1966, someone had mistaken me as having the name 'Daly', and asked me what it was like to be Fred's son. Fred never let forget that. I cannot really tell Margaret or Lawrence what he said and the House does not allow me to use the description he gave to me. He was quite a fellow. Two things have not been mentioned in the eulogies today. One affects all of us in this House. When Fred got his position as a minister, he changed the sitting rules of the House of Representatives. People forget that it was Fred who brought in the 10.30 adjournment and the 11 o'clock stop. For most of you in the House, that is a nothing, but to those few of us who are still left from those days it was magical to know that when you came back into parliament you did not have to sit here until 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock. Fred always reckoned he damaged the midnight dinners of sausages, mashed potatoes and peas which we had when we knew we were going to be here until three or four in the morning, before he brought his rules in. So all of us have a current appreciation of what Fred was about. Another thing that has not been mentioned by either side is that when Fred spoke on this side of the House-in the other building, of course-members of the government used to come and hear him. In those days-Kim's father's day-people came to hear those who they thought were entertaining and good value. People came down to hear Gough Whitlam, Clyde Cameron and Fred Daly when they sat on this side-and there were others on our side. The whole House would come down to listen to them. Can you imagine anybody today coming down to hear the good speakers on the other side of the House? It is just not on, because the mood has changed. Fred had an appeal to people in this parliament. One of the advantages of having Fred in Sydney was that you were a Sydney member. You would say to Fred, 'Fred, how should we describe you?' He would say, 'As a Gilroy Catholic.' The Gilroy Catholics did not join the DLP. He and Arthur Calwell shared a very real axis with each other on this very point. Again, it is forgotten by most people in the Labor Party, but, my goodness, it was not forgotten by the people in the me Labor Party around Australia in the 1950swhich was even before my time. I am very sorry that I was overseas when the funeral took place. I want to say to Margaret, Lawrence and the rest of the family how much I appreciated Fred personally and politically. He always had something decent to say to you. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Grayndler (Ms MCHugh), mentioned how he would knock on our doors, and he did not care which party you came from. Whenever I saw him in Sydney, he never failed to stop and talk to me, even though I am a Liberal. That says something. My sympathy goes not only to his immediate family but also to all his siblings. He must have been appreciated by everyone who was lucky enough to be as close to him as they would have been. I say quite sincerely: may God continue to give Fred his blessing.",38
20,Mr LEE,CONDOLENCES,"Dobell-Minister for Communications and the Arts and Minister for Tourism)-Like many other people in the chamber today, I first came across Fred when I tuned in and listened to the parliamentary broadcasts. The first time. I saw him was at the joint sitting that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) mentioned. I think I was in my last year at school. All good people at De La Salle College at Cronulla, who leant towards the Labor side of politics, would go up and tune into those parliamentary sittings. There was Fred Daly introducing and passing the legislation that delivered one vote, one value to Australia. One of the great achievements of the Whitlam government was achieved at that joint sitting, and it was the legislation pioneered by Fred Daly. As a result of that legislation, I got to vote at the 1975 election in the electorate of Cook, which is the electorate of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie). Despite the fact that I had turned 18 and had the right to vote, it did not make much difference in the electorate of Cook in 1975, but I did get the chance to meet Fred Daly at an election rally at which Fred was the guest speaker in the 1975 election campaign. Despite the fact that he had announced his intention to retire, he was still out there advocating and fighting for the Labor cause. And it was not just in 1975 that he did those things. As recently as early this year, Fred Daly was up in the state electorate of Peats opening Labor Party campaign offices. He was still keeping the faith, as one of the people said at the funeral mass at St Brigid's. The honourable member for Grayndler (Ms MCHugh) mentioned the large number of people from Marrickville who attended the service at St Brigid's. But they were not just from Marrickville. Some people came all the way from the New South Wales central coast. I refer in particular to the O'Connor family, who were mentioned in the priest's homily. I am not sure whether Fred was the one who nicknamed Alwyn O'Connor 'Rule Book 0' Connor', but I know that Fred certainly remembered his days of dealing with and working with people from my own part of the world. It was a very touching moment when during the offertory procession the jumpers of the Newtown Rugby League Club and the Canberra Raiders Rugby League Club were taken up to the altar. I cannot think of a more sad moment in the service than when Danny Boy was played over the church organ. Perhaps there was not a more fitting tribute to Fred Daly than hearing the words and the music of Danny Boy. Fred Daly was awarded life membership by both the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party and the ACT branch of the Labor Party, and I cannot think of a wider range of party branches throughout the scale of membership of the Australian Labor Party. For Fred to have received life membership from both of those branches says a lot about him. I bumped into Jim Killen at the airport on the morning of Fred's funeral. He was obviously very distressed and sad about the fact that Fred had passed away. Someone in my electorate mentioned the other day that it was a very touching moment to see Jim Killen interviewed on television. The fact that there was that close friendship between Jim Killen and Fred Daly says a lot about the nature of Australian politics-perhaps particularly in those days. All of us in this chamber know that there are still friendships across the aisle today, and that is a good thing. I conclude by extending my condolences to Lawrie, Margaret and all the members of the Daly family.",39

31,Mr LES SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of increases in bank charges recently announced by the Commonwealth Bank? Are they consistent with the findings of the Prices Surveillance Authority's inquiry into fees and charges imposed on retail transaction accounts? What action has the government taken to ensure that banks respond positively to the PSA report?,40
32,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen the reports from the weekend of increased bank charges by the Commonwealth Bank. I must say that I found them quite extraordinary in the context of the recommendations of the Prices Surveillance Authority, as an outcome of the report which we commissioned earlier this year. That followed concern expressed in the community around January about increased bank charges. The report by the PSA was available in July. It expressed the view that there was a need for restructuring the charges and that banks had essentially imposed these charges without too much regard to equity and fairness. In particular, the report was very critical of account keeping fees which were payable by people with amounts of less than $500 in their accounts. There was a view that this should be restructured in this regard in particular, but also in other respects. Included amongst this was the belief by the authority that there should be a removal of the inward dishonoured cheque charge. That relates to when someone hands you a cheque, you bank it and it bounces. At the moment, banks charge a fee of around $9 for that and the Commonwealth Bank has now increased that charge from $9 to $10. The view of the authority was that there was no real justification for that charge because the person was not only not getting the money from the dishonoured cheque but also getting a fee imposed by the bank. This area of bank charges is obviously one of considerable difficulty, but the report by the PSA is one which I believed the banks were going to respond to in an appropriate way. There were certainly expressions of intention by the banks following the report that they would pay close regard to the recommendations and seek to carry out its recommendations. The decision by the Commonwealth Bank is not in the spirit of that outcome. The decision by the Commonwealth Bank in respect of the dishonoured cheque charge and in respect of another item-that relates to duplicates or the reissuing of statements, for which the costs were also increased-was also the subject of a recommendation by the PSA along the lines that such charges needed to be looked at very closely in terms of their fairness. Generally, what the Commonwealth Bank has done is increase its fees across a range of items, including the two that I have mentioned but also on others which were not the subject of the PSA report. In general, they have raised those charges to about the highest level of any of the other competing banks, although in a couple of cases they have become the highest. In that respect, they have taken action which can be seen to be perhaps not in accordance with the spirit of the report. It is our intention that the banks should adhere to the spirit of that report. One of PSA recommendations was that there should be monitoring of the banks' fees and charges for the next three years. We have accepted that report and we will be formally commissioning the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to carry out that monitoring over a three-year period. That does not mean nothing happens for three years. They will monitor developments as they occur. As appropriate, the competition commission will make recommendations to us about any developments that they believe the government needs to be informed about or take action on. I have also spoken with the chief executive of the Commonwealth Bank and have expressed my concern about these actions. I believe it is unfortunate indeed that the Commonwealth Bank, still being majority owned by the Australian government, has taken action which is, as I see it, not in accordance with the spirit of the report and which in fact flouts a couple of the recommendations. I think that is most unfortunate indeed. We would expect the Commonwealth Bank, above all banks, to adhere to the recommendations of the PSA report. We will certainly be doing our utmost to ensure that that is the outcome in terms of the actions by the Commonwealth Bank in the future. Minister for Human Services and Health",40
33,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General. When you were asked about the question of the health minister's attempts to stop the royal commission, what legal advice did you seek? Did you ask if the challenge was likely to succeed? Did you ask if the funding could be justified under the guidelines? What was the advice you received? Mr LA V ARCH-In relation to being asked, I do not recall being asked by anyone in particular about the matter. I certainly recall asking my department to provide advice to me for the purposes of informing cabinet of the issues which arose in relation to the royal commission. The question was considered by cabinet-brought to cabinet jointly by the Minister for Finance and me. Cabinet the resolved to take certain actions, which members will be aware of at this stage. I think the original premise of the member's question is wrong. Telecommunications",41
34,Mr HARRY WOODS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. It refers to telecommunications post1997. What regulatory framework does the government intend to apply to the telecommunications industry from 1 July 1997? Would the minister also advise the House about the reaction to the government's announcement of this framework?,41
35,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Page for his question and for his continuing interest in this industry, which is so vitally important to micro-economic reform. When the opposition was last in government we had no competition whatsoever in telecommunications, just as we had the sclerosis of the two-airline policy and no competition at all in railways. In communications, aviation and railways, it has been this government that has opened up these areas for important micro-economic reform. Since the government has allowed the entry of Optus, the establishment of the duopoly in telecommunications, we have had prices go down by what Access Economics has estimated to be $400 million. We have had investment by the carriers almost double to $4 billion. We have had exports go up by a factor of almost four-that is, 400 per centand we have had a much wider choice of services and products for consumers. It is the government's view that, if the introduction of one competitor will deliver these benefits to business and residential consumers, by moving to full and open competition we can ensure that even greater benefits are delivered to everyone who uses telecommunications services. We will end up with the most competitive and the most open telecommunications market in the world. The way we will deliver that is, first of all, from 1 July 1997, under a Labor government, the door will be open for new carriers to come to Australia and set up shop. We want to encourage as many new carriers as possible to get out there and snap away at the heels of Optus and Telstra because we want to make sure that we do not end up with a cosy duopoly in the way that the Liberal and National parties left us with a cosy, sclerotic duopoly in aviation. Mr Costello-What was that? Say it again.",41

40,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,42
41,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Don't you remember? You extended the two-airline agreement. John Howard, Treasurer, extended the two-airline agreement before the 1990 election.",42
42,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,42
43,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Sure! Malcolm Fraser made you do it, didn'the? It wasn't you. It was Malco 1m Fraser. By 1 July 1997 we will see the door open to new entrants. We will be building on the Trade Practices Act to ensure that we have telecommunications specific regulations. We will have the same principles of the Trade Practices Act but applied in a speedier manner and a manner that ensures that we have sustainable competition in telecommunications. In fact, we will build upon the Hilmer principles to require carriers to provide undertakings to the ACCC. These undertakings will ensure that other carriers and service providers can have access to the cables and the infrastructure and, if necessary, at an arbitrated price. This will be the first occasion on which service providers will be able to get arbitration on that interconnect price. This regime will be the most competitive and the most open in the world because nowhere else in the world do the service providers get arbitration on price. This is a very important principle. In New Zealand and in Britain they do not get that. In the United States they are still arguing about how they go about making their communications market more competitive. In Europe they are saying that in 1998 all member countries of the European Union must be in the position that Australia was in in 1992 when we allowed Optus to enter the market. So by 1998 the Europeans will be where Australia was six years before. The reason open access is important is that we want to ensure that we are encouraging the people who will add value in telecommunications. We want to encourage the people who will establish these new interactive multimedia services. We want to have that content creation taking place here in Australia. The only way businesses will invest in generating the content in Australia is if they can sell that product to Australians; if they can use the infrastructure that Telstra and Optus Vision are rolling across the country to deliver services to Australian customers. It is for that reason that we will ensure that we have that commitment to open access; that we have that commitment to continue to encourage the development of Australian made telecommunications equipment. We will ensure that we have that commitment while also protecting the rights of business and residential consumers. While the government has made those commitments that will ensure that the price caps are toughened so that the benefits for residential consumers are guaranteed, and while we have ensured that there is a cap on local call prices until at least 1999, the opposition, in reaction to that, has simply said that the government's 1999 principles are too vague. So, while all these conversations are going on opposite, we are dealing with one of the most important micro-economic reforms that this government will implement this term. So that reform is taking place, but the opposition says it is too vague. That is its reaction. But Optus has welcomed the policy framework for its many policy outcomes in supporting sustainable competition. Telstra has said that it is a most important basis for the development of a competitive and innovative telecommunications industry. The Consumers Telecommunications Network has welcomed the important safeguards for consumers. The Telecommunications Industry Association says it is a visionary policy that is supported by all of the equipment manufacturers. The Australian Telecommunications Users Group says that the reforms will make the industry more competitive. So all of the stakeholders in this industry support what the government is trying to do-lower prices, make the industry more competitive and lift exports. Members of the opposition are the only ones who are saying that it is too vague and that they are not happy with it. We say that our two aims are more competition and open access. The only person in public life in Australia who is against those two principles is Senator Richard Alston, the opposition spokesman-the man who said that he wants closed access, not open access, on the cable, and the man who said that he wants regional monopolies, not more competition in broadband roll-out. Is it any wonder that the opposition's only reaction to this important micro-economic reform is to say, 'It's too vague.' We know who is too vague. Minister for Human Services and Health",42
44,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. I ask him: did you or another minister suggest that there should be a limit on the amount of taxpayers' money which could be spent on the health minister's legal costs, or was she given a blank cheque? What is the total bill for taxpayers likely to be?",43
45,Mr LA VARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no blank cheque in relation to the funding of these proceedings, as there is no blank cheque in the funding of any proceedings which involve Commonwealth ministers.  the taxpayers.",43
46,Mr LA VARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The review mechanism, if you like, or the certification mechanism is that any bill submitted to the Commonwealth has to be certified as fair and reasonable by the Australian Government Solicitor. Undertaking that task, the solicitor will be acting, as the office does, using the same approach as that which applies in the defence of proceedings against ministers when private solicitors are involved. Private counsel has been briefed, so the same approach is applied. In doing so, they will look at not only issues relating to the actual charges which are being applied but also to the reasonable commercial practice being applied. ",43
47,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Sturt!,43
48,Mr LA VARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member then goes on to ask, 'What is the likely cost of the matter?' The starting point, of course, is that the Western Australian government, having established this commission, is responsible, in my view, for meeting the costs which flow from that royal commission. Of course, there is ample precedent for such an action.",43
49,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,43
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,43
51,Mr LA VARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Dr Lawrence, as I understand, has been in correspondence with the Western Australian government about its responsibilities in relation to meeting these costs. The Commonwealth has paid nothing whatsoever in relation to this matter; it will not do so, unless and until there is advice from the Western Australian government that is failing in the responsibility which flows to it for having established this royal commission-and, of course, it is the same responsibility which the Commonwealth accepts when it has established royal commissions: to those whose interests are affected by the calling of the commission, legal assistance is provided. A current example, of course, is the Seaview royal commission looking into the Civil Aviation Authority. The parties before that are receiving assistance from the Commonwealth. If there were any sort of decency in relation to this, the Western Australian government, of course, would apply the same standards. Indeed, the Western Australian government does have guidelines which, if they apply fairly, again in my view, will see it meet this expense. So, until such time as that answer is given from the Western Australian government, no money will be paid by the Commonwealth. Real Wages",43
52,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of reports that real wages have fallen in Australia since 1983? Can the Treasurer confirm whether these reports are accurate?,44
53,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. Yes, I have seen reports; various spokesmen for the opposition have claimed that real wages have fallen since this government has been in office. In answering this question, I think one needs to go back momentarily to what happened prior to this government coming into office. Members may recall that, as part of the total failure of industrial relations policy at the time of the Fraser government, there was a wages explosion in 1981-82 which meant an 18 per cent increase in wages in the 12 months to September 1982. Of course, that meant that there was a level of wages which were totally unsustainable. In real terms, there was a big increase in inflation. By the time we came into government, we had doubledigit inflation and double-digit unemployment. That was our inheritance. It was our first duty to try to get the economy back onto a growth path. That meant some control of the wages situation through the Accord, which brought us to a growth path quite quickly and then to dramatic increases in employmentwhich was what everybody wanted to see. In terms of the increase in wages since that time against that background, there was some reduction in real wages at the start but then we got onto a growth path. There has been an increase in real wages of some 7.4 per cent over the period that we have been in office for those on average weekly earnings; that is, for real adult average weekly earnings. That 7.4 per cent itself understates the real increase in the welfare of workers because, in addition to that, half of the work force have achieved superannuation entitlements that they previously did not have. For those who gained from award superannuation and subsequently from the superannuation guarantee, there has been an additional six per cent payable to them as of now. That amount will move to up to nine per cent by the year 2002. It is six per cent for large employers and five per cent for small employers this year. Eventually, all of them will be at nine per cent by the year 2002. With the other measures in the budget, there are even further benefits coming by way of the government's co-contribution for employees' own contributions. To this point, on top of the 7.4 per cent real increase in real adult average weekly earnings, we have, for those who had no superannuation entitlement, a further six per cent increase in superannuation, giving them a 13Y2 per cent increase in real earnings. Six per cent of that is being put aside for them. For those who had their superannuation first payable when the award superannuation began in 1987, this would mean that they would have accumulated in the order of $10,500 to this stage through these superannuation entitlements, and that amount of money will grow more rapidly in the future. It is a complete furphy to say that under this government there has been a reduction in real wages. What we have had under this government has been a sensible wages policy-a policy under the Accord, which has been economically responsible, which has given us good wage outcomes in terms of getting overall growth, and which has resulted in a much faster rate of growth under this government than the previous governmentabout a 3\12 per cent average compared with a 2Yz half per cent average under the previous government. There has been far greater growth in employment-about three times the growth of employment in the number of jobs per year during our period of office compared with the Fraser government's period of office. In association with that, as I have just explained, there have been real improvements in wages and, through superannuation, even further increases in real wages for those who previously did not enjoy any superannuation entitlement. Minister for Human Services and Health",44
54,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Treasurer, is it the case that the taxpayer funded legal defence of the minister for health if, as you maintain, relates to her employment, would be a fringe benefit and taxable under the fringe benefits tax? Did you seek any advice as to its taxability prior to the decision to grant her unlimited taxpayer defence? Will you be seeking any contribution to that tax from the beneficiary, Dr Lawrence?",45
55,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Whether any FBT would be payable is something that I cannot say at this stage becauseMr Costello-When are you going to get a contribution from her?,45
56,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,45
57,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But if it were payable, it would be payable by us to us. So I am not sure what the concern is. Mr Costello-Hang on; you agreed to them.",45
58,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"FBT is payable by the employer, dummy. So, if there is FBT liability, it is on the government back to the government. So I do not see what the concern about the FBT issue is.",45
59,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,45
60,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,45
61,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Whether any FBT is payable will depend on matters which are yet to be decided-firstly, whether there is any payment made by us. As has already been explained by the Attorney-General, the primary responsibility for payment of Dr Lawrence's fees is undoubtedly with the Western Australian government. It is its responsibility to make that payment. But if it is not paid by it, then it would be paid by us, as we have decided. Of course, there may then be some FBT payable, but the amount of any liability could be reduced to nil if the expenses are deductible if paid by the minister herself. So, under the principle which normally applies, there mayor may not be a tax liability which would come into place. That is a matter for the Commissioner for Taxation to decide. Mr Costello-You are the Treasurer; you should have the advice.",45
62,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If he did decide that FBT was liable on some part of the payment, then it would be a payment made by the government to itself. Therefore, there would be no imposition on taxpayers and no imposition on the government. Telecommunications",45
63,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. I refer to the arrangements for the telecommunications industry after 1997. Is the minister aware of other proposals for regulation of the industry post 1997? Is the minister aware of assessments of those proposals for the value of the Telstra Corporation? What would be the implications of these assessments?,45
64,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Back in 1991 when the government was making decisions on telecommunications we had to make a choice: would we aim to protect the shareholder value in Telecom-or Telstra as it is known today--or would we try to get the most competitive economic regime possible to benefit business and residential consumers? That is the basic choice we have got. If you go down the path of the New Zealand government or the British government, or some other governments in the region, and decide to sell the former monopoly telephone company, suddenly the entire frame of reference changes. Once you make that decision 36 REPRESENTATIVES to sell part of the telephone company-it may be the former monopoly telephone company-you then set out to maximise the sale price rather than maximise the benefits for consumers. That is why I can assure the honourable member for Werriwa that this government is committed to Telstra remaining 100 per cent Australian owned, remaining 100 per cent in public ownership. That can be contrasted with the comments that were made on Meet the Press by the honourable member for Mackellar, who was pressed on a number of these issues and, quite naturally, repeated the promise that had been made by the Leader of the Opposition that they would sell Telecom, that the opposition-the Liberal Party-believes that Telstra should be sold. When the member for Mackellar was asked what value she believed would be got for Telstra, she said that she had consulted widely with the financial community and had arrived at a sale price. Is that correct? Mrs Bishop-Correct.",45
65,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"She cannot remember what she said, but she did say on Meet the Press on Sunday that she had arrived at a sale price. But she would not reveal it, I have to tell the member for the Northern Territory who is trying to interject. She had arrived at a sale price. I am not sure whether she got the sale price from the Leader of the Opposition, but she would not reveal it on the program. Mrs Bishop-That is right; I have a figure.",46
66,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I got it in one, did I? Mrs Bishop-You have got it in one; you are quite smart there.",46
67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Mackellar will not interject, and I invite the minister not to respond.",46
68,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So you po have a sale price? The member for Mackellar said that I have got it in one. She has got a sale price, a value for Telstra. This is pretty good. Mr Downer-Have you? Can you tell us?",46
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I give the same advice to the honourable member for Mayo.,46
70,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can tell you that Senator Alston has put an estimate on it. Senator Tuesday, 22 August 1995 Alston is allegedly not the spokesman on the privatisation of Telstra; he is only the spokesman on telecommunications. The member for Mackellar has appropriated responsibility for the sale of Telstra, and this is her responsibility. But Senator Alston says that, in his view, Telstra is worth more than $30,000 million. The member for Mackellar and Senator Alston are saying that they will keep Telstra in majority Australian ownership, they will keep Telstra at least 50 per cent Australian owned. What they are saying is that at least 49 per cent is going to be owned by foreigners-$15,000 million will be up for grabs for foreign shareholders or foreign telephone companies.",46
71,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about Qantas?,46
72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister will wait for a moment. Those on my left will be quiet, particularly the member for O'Connor. I know you are here, I can see you. I do not want to hear you.",46
73,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If they are saying that 49 per cent of Telecom can be sold to foreigners, and Senator Alston says it is worth $30,000 million, that is a $15,000 million transfer to foreign shareholders, a $15,000 million selloff, the largest sell-off of Australian assets to foreigners in the history of the country. Mr Beale-Tell us about the Qantas deal.",46
74,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Bruce!,46
75,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So, if Mrs Bishop, if the member for Mackellar, has been able to arrive at a price, a value, for Telstra, we are entitled to ask one or two questions. These are the questions: would a Howard government maximise the sale price of Telstra by removing many of the Labor government's procompetitive principles-we have set out to ensure that we have the most competitive and open telecommunications regime in 1997and will they be up for grabs so that Mr Howard and Mrs Bishop can maximise the sale price? Are we entitled to ask, alternativelyMr Dobie-The minister should observe the correct forms of the House",46
76,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister has the call.,47
77,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Or are we entitled to ask: will the proceeds of the sale go to fund some of the Leader of the Opposition's election gimmicks? The member for Mackellar gave it away again on the Meet the Press program on Sunday. She said that she would even use some of the money to pay for the member for Mayo's election promises last year. So they are really desperate. They are saying that is the way they are going to fund their election promises-from the proceeds of Telstraespecially since the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Higgins and the member for Mackellar were flaying the government at the time of the budget when they said it was outrageous for the government to use any asset sales in the budget figuring. But it is right for the Liberal and National parties to use the same asset sales-bigger asset salesto fund their election promises! Then there are other questions. This government made a commitment to freeze the price of local calls until 1999-frozen from 1992 to 1999-and that does not help Telstra, it does not maximise the sale price for the Liberal PartyMr Bruce Scott-It is free in New Zealand.",47
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Maranoa!,47
79,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What that does is deliver benefits to business and residential consumers. What we want to know is: will you be deciding to help the consumers or to maximise the sales price for you, for your government, for your election promises. Mr Costello-Our government?",47
80,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So you are going to maximise the price for your government, are you? There we have it, the member for Higgins saying that the highest priority is to maximise the sale price if he gets to be Treasurer. Does that also mean that the people in the bush who now get the cross-subsidies under the community service obligations are in danger too? Are they going to be brought on budget, so that every budget period as we go through the ERC we are going to see, with a Howard government, the subsidies for the people in the bush up for grabs? Is that also how they are going to maximise the sales price? Mr Ronaldson-Why don't you get on the hotline, you fool?",47
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Ballarat!,47
82,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will only ever know the answers to these questions if the member for Mackellar tells us: what is the value she has placed on Telstra and what assumptions has she made in deciding what the share value is? Finally, we are entitled to ask: if Telstra ceases to be 100 per cent Australian owned, and a company like British Telecom or AT&T owns 49 per cent of Telstra, why would they let Telstra be up in Asia winning export all dollars for Australia, becoming a communications hub for the region? Why would they let Telstra keep on doing the hard work in Asia, creating jobs and investment for Australia for years to come? They will not. Companies like British Telecom and AT&T would rather have the parent company up there in Asia winning the orders rather than their part-owned Australian subsidiary. For all of these reasons, Mr Speaker, we are totally opposed to the Liberal and National parties' attempts that would result in the biggest transfer of Australian assets to foreigners that we have ever seen. Minister for Human Services and Health",47
83,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is to the Minister for Human Services and Health. I ask the minister: do you stand by your statement made to the National Press Club that you only learnt the detail of the Penny Easton petition and its general thrust upon its tabling in the Western Australian parliament?",47
84,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,On a point of order,47
85,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,47
86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the House is entitled to take a point of order.,47
87,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do this not in anticipation that the minister has any difficulty in answering the question at all. Opposition members-Ha, hal",47
88,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,47
89,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The House of Representatives Practice is quite clear on this. You cannot, under the House of Representatives Practice, go into the detail of consideration of royal commission matters, which have not quite the same level of protection that court matters have, but have liberality only in the areas where they go to dealing with great matters of national policy and national issues of that nature.",48
90,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Kim, you want her seat.",48
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,48
92,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When they get into the issues that are directly related to a person's situation in matters before a royal commission, they have commonly been regarded in this House as sub judice--not because the minister cannot answer that question but because it is against every form of practice that we have operated in this House.",48
93,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the point of order, I do not believe that my question is struck down by the sub judice rule for the very simple reason that I am asking the minister to confirm a statement she made at the National Press Club. The minister cannot have it both ways. She cannot hide behind the sub judice rule and at the same time roam around Australia traducing the royal commission. She cannot do both. I submit to you, Mr Speaker, and I draw upon the House of Representatives Practice, and I particularly draw your attention to the point on page 491, that says: Proceedings before a royal commission or judicial inquiry shall not be referred to in motions, debate or questions where the matter inquired into concerns issues of fact or findings relating to the propriety of the actions of specific persons. I am not asking about the proceedings before the commission. I am not asking questions about the evidence given by anyone. I am asking about a statement made by the minister to the Australian people at the National Press Club. It is clearly not struck down by the sub judice rule.",48
94,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the point of order, at page 494 it says specifically this: Where the proceedings are concerned with issues of fact or findings relating to the propriety actions of specific persons the House should be restrained in its references. It is quite clear that that issue is central to the reference to the royal commission. It is subject to matters which are now being heard in the royal commission. For that reason it is ultra vires.",48
95,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I want to draw your attention to the precedent quoted on page 494 under the heading, 'Matters before a royal commission' and the ruling of Mr Speaker Archie Cameron in 1954 which I think bears upon the point I made.",48
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In relation to this particular matter of the royal commission, its terms of reference, what it is established to inquire into and so on, it would not be unexpected that this issue would not be raised in this place today. The question which the Leader of the Opposition did ask I think sought to have verified a statement made by the minister in a public forum. The issue itself is the subject of intense scrutiny at the present moment. To the extent that the Leader of the Opposition, however, has asked to verify a statement made in a public forum, that question therefore is in order.",48
97,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank-apart from anyone else-the Leader of the House not for attempting to protect me, because I need no protection, but for establishing matters of principle here. I have said on many occasions that my recollections of these facts stand and I have repeated that in many places.",48
98,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,MCGinty bailed out on you.,48
99,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No doubt I will have further opportunities to do so in this House, outside this House, in the royal commission, because it is actually the central question being addressed by the royal commission in Western Australia. It is the central question.",48
100,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Do you repeat it today?,48
101,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have just affirmed that my recollection is my recollection, and I have affirmed that on many occasions. Mr Costello-Say what it is.",48
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,48
103,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I would say is of the that the opposition here is treading on very dangerous ground because they know as I do that amongst the community there is a very deep cynicism about this royal commissiona very deep cynicism indeed. It is of interest to me that the opposition have seized on the one issue they believe is problematic for the government, and that is funding.",48
104,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Your own people are dumping on you; they are ringing me up.,49
105,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for O'Connor to be careful.,49
106,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They have chosen not to go on the attack except on the airwaves in some places about this question, because this royal commission established by the government in Western Australia is an exercise designed for one purpose only, and that is to destroy my political career. It has a secondary purpose, and I point here not to the commissioner-I'm very careful that I point here not to the commissioner-but to the Court government. The secondary purpose is to try to drive a wedge between members of the Labor Party. The fact that it has not succeeded in doing so must be a matter of considerable concern to members opposite. I think members opposite will in the long run be embarrassed by this matter because there are matters of important principle hereprinciples of cabinet confidentiality, for example-which they may well regret are not properly tested in the long run. I, as a Western Australian member, am amazed that there has not been more scrutiny of the matters that this was designed to hide. You have on your back bench right now members who are under threat, members who are being thrown out, and the same motives that led to the ment of the royal commission have led to the problems in the Liberal Party in Western Australia: branch stacking, driving out the decent people and you cannot demonise Senator Crichton-Browne. Those problems are endemic in the Liberal Party in Western Australia, and no amount of manoeuvring will hide that problem. You might get rid of Senator Crichton-Browne but the problems are still there in the Liberal Party. Twenty years of activity cannot be removed by removing one man. It is a chronic problem. The malice that drives the Liberal Party in Western Australia is driving this royal commission too. Competition Policy Reform",49
107,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs. The minister would be aware that some states are already responding to the COAG agreement regarding the micro-economic reform of public utilities. What is the minister doing to ensure maximum benefits are delivered to consumers throughout this reform process?,49
108,Ms MCHUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The governments of Australia did agree in April to the competition policy reform. There will be great benefit for consumers under these reform policies as long as there is a balance between suppliers and consumers-exactly the sort of thing that the minister for communications talked about earlier-in our implementation of competition policy reform. Unfortunately, not all governments are carrying out implementation of this policy in the proper manner. I have recently been a few times to Victoria. Some most unfortunate things are occurring there. An example from Victoria of how not to protect consumers comes from the restructuring of the water authorities in that state. I discovered, for instance, in one recent visit that in one town in Victoria people are paying three times as much for their water as people in a nearby town and that the water is in fact undrinkable. In Daylesford, a car ride from Melbourne, you cannot drink the water and you are paying three times as much for it as you are in the establish- nearby town of Ballarat.",49
109,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister might wait for a moment. I remind all members of the House of the provisions of standing order 55.,49
110,Ms MCHUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I also discovered that bills for gas and electricity have risen to beyond the reach of many consumers. People cannot get information from anybody. If something goes wrong-the power goes off or people are disconnectedor they want to talk to somebody about their accounts or means of paying their accounts if they have difficulties, they have to ring Geelong but the people at Geelong know nothing about these people's circumstances. The Victorian government claims that it is hitting consumers in this way because it has to conform to a competition program laid down by the federal government. That is totally false and totally gutless. The only government responsible for what is happening to consumers in Victoria is the Victorian government. By contrast, the policy and principles laid down by the federal government are absolutely clear. Competition works when demand and supply are on equal footing in the market-exactly the consideration for consumers that the minister for communications talked about. To avoid the sorts of things that are happening in Victoria, I have set in place a series of programs to ensure that consumers achieve a status they need and the benefits they can get from competition policy. We are going to make sure that we have what I call consumer protection obligations implemented. Consumers will get the sorts of benefits they have normally expected under the current delivery of services by public monopolies, things like freedom of information mechanisms and information disclosure, means of complaint and redress, guarantees of safety and quality-these are normal things that consumers have to demand-compliance with consumer protection law and protection of privacy. I have a series of papers coming out describing all of these basic consumer rights. I am calling them consumer protection obligations. The papers are coming out regularly and are leading up to a conference that I will be convening in October in Victoria where everyone involved in this issue, particularly those people from the utilities, will be able to discuss the reform in a way that will benefit consumers. I will say once more that competition policy succeeds when consumers are equal partners in the implementation program. Minister for Human Services and Health",49
111,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Human Services and Health. Minister, will you affirm to this House that each of your statements to the National Press Club on 19 April 1995 on what you knew about the content and tabling of the Easton petition was true?",50
112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I call the Minister for Human Services and Health, but consideration should be given to the comments I made earlier with respect of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition: no answer should prejudice any inquiry which is presently under way.",50
113,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It would appear that the opposition wants to run a parallel inquiry.,50
114,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, no, no.",50
115,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Aren't you confident of the one in Western Australia? As I have said on a number of occasions, I have always been more than happy to say to the commission in Western AustraliaMr Costello-Answer the question.",50
116,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will answer this question in the way that I see fit. I will address the question because I have on many occasions indicated that I have done my best to recall events that took place 2Y2 to three years ago. Mr Costello-Do you affirm they were true?,50
117,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fullest version of that is the one I gave at the press club. I will be asked to answer the same questions in the royal commission in Western Australia. I have been asked the same questions on many occasions by members of the media. On every occasion I have given my recollections as best as I was able. I will continue to do that in this and every other arena. Mrs Bishop-Go on, Carmen; give us a yes or no.",50
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Mrs Bishop-Come on, yes or no.",50
119,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Mackellar!,50
120,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the other hand, the royal commission in Western Australia will not be asking some of the pertinent questions; they are not in the terms of reference. Who, for instance, raised these matters for the first time in the Western Australian parliament? Who in 1986 first raised these matters? The current premier of Western Australia. Following that, who asked the first questions surrounding this matter? The Hon. Ross Lightfoot, a member of the Liberal Party. Who put submissions to parliamentary committees in 1992? Not a member of the Labor Party. So the Liberal Party has. from the outset, had involvement in this matter, and these things are not matters, apparently, to be discussed before the royal commission. How did Mr Court get hold of the documents that he provided to Mrs Easton? How did that happen? What were the circumstances in which those documents were handed over? Why did she claim that he had done it and he subsequently denied that? There are a lot of questions that I would like to know the answers to too. There are a lot of questions that the people of Western Australia would like to know the answers to. But they will not be answered in the royal commission because, surprise, surprise, they are not in the terms reference. The whole matter is not to be investigated.",50
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,51
122,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is not sub judice because it is not referred to in the terms of reference, Mr Speaker. I think it is most important that people understand that these matters were first raised by the Liberal Party in 1986. That material was handed over to one of the parties by the Liberal Party and they now want to escape scrutiny for this matter, to scapegoat other individuals and to use this parliament as a second line of inquiry. At the same time, they are again causing the taxpayers of Western Australia to meet unnecessary legal costs. My estimate is $100,000 a day. If you are concerned about the possible costs of an individual's legal representation, ask about the cost of running that commission. Ask what that might do in Western Australia. Add to that the costs of the Mabo legal challenge. Look at what the government is doing in Western Australia. Look at Court, the Crichton-Browne crony. This whole government has been set up by the people who set up this commission and they are beneath contempt.",51
123,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister, representing the Minister for Defence. Has the Deputy Prime Minister seen reports concerning the adequacy of our defence effort in Western Australia? In light of these reports, is it the intention of the government to take additional steps to enhance the defence of Australia with particular focus in the west?",51
124,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen reports along the lines that the honourable gentleman suggests. They were made by the Premier of Western Australia, I thought most ungraciously, when he suggested, after the VP celebrations, that I bore some responsibility for what he considered was an inadequate defence effort in the west. I recollect that when I became defence minister, of course, what constituted Western Australian defence was a complete absence of bases in the north. There were a couple of patrol boats stuck at what of was described as a forward facility in Cockburn Sound in Western Australia, and that was about it. That was the legacy of the Liberal Party to Western Australian defence for 30-odd years after the war. They also had the SAS-and Pearce air base, of course, which continued. What have we got there and what have we put there since? What we have decided to do is to base half the navy-and virtually all of the submarines-in Western Australia. The navy, however, was having some difficultyMr Anderson interjecting Mr Snowdon interjecting",51
125,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Prime Minister will wait for a moment. The Deputy Leader of the National Party and the member for the Northern Territory will not conduct a debate across the chamber.,51
126,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In other words, most of the punching power of the navy has been put in Western Australia. As I understand it-at least from the reports that have come to methere has been some reluctance on the part of the Western Australian government to settle exercise areas that the navy needs. That also bears some reflection. If there is a bit of concern on the Premier's part that something Defence more ought to be done for Western Australian defence, he might look to his own efforts. In addition to that, of course, and I think in a very fine tribute to a great Australian, John Curtin, we constructed the Curtin air facility, near Derby, a very substantial air base with considerable command facilities that are making our aircraft employable across the entirety of the north. When linked up with what is at Scherger in North Queensland and with Darwin and Townsville, we now have for the first time an effective defence of the north of Western Australia. In addition to that, whereas there is virtually no substantial presence other than reserve army presence in the Northern Territory, we have put up there the 2nd Cavalry Unit from Sydney, to become part of the 1st Armoured Brigade, with the tanks from Puckapunyal. They, of course-demonstrating the fact that defence of the Northern Territory and the north of Western Australia is indivisible-are exercising in Western Australia. It is obviously far more sensible to conduct the defence of that area from Darwin than it is from either Perth or Melbourne, where, effectively, they were before. There has been a massive improvement in defence capabilities in Western Australia and in the north, and in defence capabilities overall, since we came into office. I thought it was rather ungracious of young Richard not to acknowledge it. Minister for Human Services and Health",51
127,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Human Services and Health. Isn't it a fact that you refused to give a direct answer to the last question from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition because you knew that, if you were to confirm the contents of your press club speech and that was subsequently to be repudiated by certain other events, you would have been demonstrated not only to have misled the Australian people",52
128,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,A point of order! That is front and centre into the deliberations of the royal commission.,52
129,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is not. That is not. Mr Costello-Let him finish the question.,52
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I was waiting for the Leader of the Opposition to finish his question, but I did have some concerns about it before the Deputy Prime Minister rose to his feet to take a point of order. I will hear the question.",52
131,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will ask it again. I ask the Minister for Human Services and Health: isn't it a fact that the reason you declined to answer the question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was that you knew that, if you affirmed what was in your National Press Club speech and that recollection was subsequently repudiated, you would be demonstrated not only to have misled the Australian public but also to have misled this parliament? Haven't we therefore reached the situation that even you are no longer prepared to attest to your own honesty?",52
132,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say to the Minister for Human Services and Health that I will allow the question, provided it does not go to any of the issues that are before the royal commission.",52
133,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think I was remarkably direct in my answer-I am surprised the member thinks otherwise-and I will continue to be. As I said, I will answer questions wherever they are put to me to the best of my recollection. I stand by my recollections. Mr Costello-Were they true?",52
134,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have no reason to do otherwise. Mr Costello-Were they true?,52
135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,52
136,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-I would think that if members opposite who have come from the legal profession want to go back to that profession they should find a place that is actually a court. This is a parliament, not a court. If you want to go and assist the royal commissionMr Costello-You should tell the truth here as you do in a court too.",52
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,52
138,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are some matters on which they could certainly do with some education in relation to parliamentary procedure. So, if members here want to assist the commission, I am sure the commissioners would welcome them. Domestic Violence",52
139,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. Can the minister report on the success of the domestic violence campaigns which the government has been conducting since 1987.,53
140,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Some members will be aware that today I released a detailed survey that shows a very significant changeMr Les Scott interjecting Mr Tuckey interjecting,53
141,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Oxley and the member for O'Connor!,53
142,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a matter that the member for O'Connor might well listen to. It is a very important matter relating to Australian citizens and changes in their attitudes towards violence. The government policies are on the right track. Our community education campaigns are working. Eight years ago, when the government asked Australians what their attitudes to domestic violence were, the picture that emerged was sadly closer to myth than reality. In 1995, as a result of community education, we as a community have a much deeper and broader understanding of violence, particularly domestic violence. I was very pleased to release today the report on community attitudes to violence against women. The survey recently conducted by ANOP found that the majority of people-some 93 per cent-regard domestic violence as a crime. That compares with only 79 per cent of people in 1987 who thought it was a crime. I am pleased to say that 94 per cent of respondents say that alcohol is not an excuse for domestic violence and 85 per cent know that wealthy neighbourhoods are not immune from it. I am pleased to say that 80 per cent agree that domestic violence is not a private matter. So it is no longer a taboo, but a lot of people are still saying that they will vene and they will not assist in the matter. In 1987, one in five Australians were prepared to condone domestic violence in some circumstances; they were prepared to make excuses for it. But I am pleased to say that this survey found that the number had halved. Fewer than one in 10 Australians believe that physical force is justified when a man is 'provoked' by his wife. I am also pleased that most people recognise that tougher laws and harsher penalties are not the solution-something that I hope members opposite listen to, because most of their state governments appear to want to reach for these solutions-and that education and counselling should be given a higher priority. We have established a series of campaigns which are clearly working, and we will continue with those. A lot of the funds have gone to local community agencies throughout the country to develop campaigns, training materials and resources. But that is no reason to be complacent. Violence and the fear of violence are still of major concern to Australian women and, of course, to many men. Some 80 per cent of women are worried about violence and increasing violence. So it is very important indeed for us to address this issue. As I mentioned earlier, sadly we do continue to be judgmental of victims. Some 77 per cent of respondents do not understand why victims do not leave violent situations. Sadly, a significant minority feel that women make false claims of rape, which suggests a reluctance to believe victims. Those figures outline the areas in which we still have further work to do. The government will continue to lead the way in developing a better understanding of domestic violence.",53
143,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders",53
144,Mr REITH,AND HEALTH,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Flinders moving forthwith that this House is of the opinion that the Minister for Human Services and Health should stand aside forthwith from her ministerial duties pending the completion of the Marks Royal Commission in Western Australia. Nothing more graphically demonstrates what is fundamentally wrong about this government than the Carmen Lawrence affair. Nothing could demonstrate more clearly to the Australian public the arrogance displayed by this government, particularly the arrogance of this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his senior ministers. The Prime Minister is the very person who is not in the House today because of the contempt with which he treats the Australian parliament; the very same person who told-I thought this was a classic-his backbench to get on to the radio yesterday after his incredible performance with John Laws just a week before when he made that memorable comment 'what are they on about' when people were complaining about the state of the Australian economy; the very same person who said of question time that it was an indulgence given by the government for the benefit of the opposition; the very same person who calls the people's representatives in the Senate 'unrepresentative swill'; and the very same person who made the incredible statement yesterday that his government deserved to be re-elected. We contest that statement. We say that the failure of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) to step aside and/or for the Prime Minister to require her to step aside is a classic example of the rotten, corrupting, contemptible arrogance which is at the heart of this government, at the soul of this government and which the Australian people are so sick to death of. Our basic point is that she should now step aside. There are basically four reasons. The first is one that she herself would now understand as a matter of common sense. I call it the 'you can't hold a doorstop without being pressured' syndrome. The reality is that this is a minister whose ability to perform her ministerial abilities has been totally prejudiced and compromised by the Penny Easton affair. The second matter-and it is related to that-is that we now have a range of interest groups interested in the matters for which she, particularly as the minister for health, is responsible, saying and making clear publicly that she is incapable of performing those duties for which she is assigned as a member of the government. I have here as a reference to this an extract from the Canberra Times from only yesterday, which states: . . . the disability sector, the Australian Private Hospitals Association and the Australian Medical Association all issued strong statements criticising Dr Lawrence and government health policy. The report went on: Dr Lawrence clearly does not enjoy the confidence of the three health lobby groups which chose the beginning of the first week of the Spring session of Parliament to launch their attacks. There is a pertinent quote in the Canberra Times from the editor of the disability magazine Link, Jeff Heath, who said: Dr Lawrence was the most elusive and disinterested minister since the magazine was first published in 1980. He is quoted as saying: This is a minister who always seems to be available to discuss women in politics, but is almost totally inaccessible to organisations representing the interests of aged or disability groups. I think that is a very strong statement of condemnation from that group and clear evidence that the minister is unable to perform her duties which obviously are essentially the reason for holding down that task. Recapping the first reason, the minister is clearly incapable of performing her duties. The second reason is that we now have a range of persons and interest groups from the health industry who are expressing their views to the effect that she is unable to continue in her portfolio. A third reason is that there is ample precedence for ministers under pressure similar to that which the current minister is under to step aside pending an investigation. In fact if you refer to House of Representatives Practice you can go back to the 1940s when Eddie Ward was subject to a royal commission inquiry into the Brisbane Line. Eddie Ward, again, in 1949-this is a relevant example and precedent because he was from the Labor side of politics-stepped aside and was relieved of his administrative duties during the royal commission inquiries into allegations of corrupt allocation of timber licences in Papua New Guinea. More recently, during the Fraser administration, in 1978 the Minister for Finance, Eric Robinson, was given leave from ministerial duties during royal commission inquiries into electoral redistribution in Queensland. Back on the Labor side, we have precedents not just at the federal level but also at the state level. Again more recently, this time in the 1980s, Neville Wran, when he was Premier of New South Wales, stood aside during the conduct of the royal commission headed by Sir Laurence Street into allegations of interference in the running of New South Wales Rugby League. He stood aside; he did the right thing. There was no question in his mind, given the fact that the royal commission went to activities with which he was associated, that it was right and proper for him to step aside. A third, quite compelling reason is that there is ample precedent for a minister to step aside under these circumstances. Also at the political level, I do not think there is any doubt that, from a Labor tive, there is an assessment now that the Minister for Human Services and Health is extracting a very high price for her continued position in the ministry. Let us face it: in politics, the assessment of political damage your own side is a legitimate basis upon which ministers have stood aside in the past. There is a very clear case to step aside. For that reason, the standing and sessional orders ought to be suspended so that that motion can be put to the House. The truth of the matter is that the minister is a liability, obviously going to the matters which are before the Marks royal commission in Western Australia. I do not go to those matters. I am conscious of the sub judice rule. It is our basic position that those matters properly before the commission. They ought to be properly addressed in the commission and the commission in due course will come to its own conclusions. But you cannot deny that there has been an avalanche of evidence in recent days, all of which has contradicted a statement which the minister herself has made.",53
145,Mr SPEAKER,AND HEALTH,The member for Flinders is heading into very dangerous territory.,55
146,Mr REITH,AND HEALTH,"I say no more than that. I refer to question time today. I am sure that will not be sub judice. When the minister was actually asked to reaffirm her own statements, she was unable to do so. In fact, only yesterday she was asked on morning radio about the state of her recollections. She was saying, 'Maybe I was and maybe I wasn't.' Out of her own mouth she is condemned as to the evidence which is piling up against her. The other matter which I think is critical and should be taken into consideration is the allied controversy about the processes which the government adopted to fund this minister's legal costs. I think it is an absolute outrage that this government has just abandoned all precedent. They have abandoned the ministerial guidelines, which establish the basis upon which ministers are funded, and have set up a process by which her legal costs will be funded on a discretionary decision of the Minister for Finance, a senior Western Australian whose political interests it is to perspec- serve by promoting her defence. The fact of the matter is that she was not at the time of these matters a member of the federal cabinet, let alone a member of the federal parliament. These matters go well to beyond, and are beyond, her current ministerial responsibilities and there is absolutely no basis for justification for the funding for this minister of those costs. That brings me to this conclusion: this is a classic cameo performance from the Labor Party. When it comes to legal costs, as usual they cannot distinguish between the national interest and the interests of the Labor Party. For that reason, the standing orders ought to be suspended to allow the motion to be put.",55
147,Mr SPEAKER,AND HEALTH,Order! The honourable are member's time has expired. Is the motion seconded?,55
148,Mr SINCLAIR,AND HEALTH,"I second the motion. I do so because there are three reasons this matter is fundamental to the preservation of the status and quality of this place. Unless standing orders are suspended so that we can canvass the matter of the present Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) standing aside, I believe the integrity of this place is at risk. I will look at the two legal reasons first. Section 44(v) of the constitution says: 44. Any person who(v.) Has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth otherwise than as a member and in common with the other members of an incorporated company consisting of more than twenty-five persons: shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. While I know the advice taken by the government will ensure that there is no direct contract, in my view a benefit in kind is a benefit by way of a pecuniary return. Legal aid given to the minister in the prosecution of a casenot in the defence of a case-relating to her performance as Premier of Western Australia fits within those provisions. The second legal case relates to a view expressed by a legal academic who is a reader in law at Melbourne University specialising in constitutional law, Mr Geoff Lindell. He has questioned whether the cabinet decision fell foul of a High Court ruling in 1989, when the High Court ruled that the power of appropriation reposed solely in parliament. Our constitution assures to the people the effective control of the public purse through parliament. The government's answer to that is that the money has been provided through the Advance to the Minister for Finance, but the guidelines for the Advance to the Minister for Finance say that moneys under that item should only be used: ... in an emergency such as a natural disaster, an unforeseen overrun of payments, a change in payment priorities or a transfer of spending from one approved purpose to another, or where some spending has been inadvertently omitted from the annual budget. While my colleagues suggest that it may well be a national disaster, it is a national disaster for the Labor Party and for the integrity of parliament. The third reason-the political reason-is more fundamental. The political reason why the minister should stand aside is that successive prime ministers and premiers have accepted that, when a minister misleads a parliament, the minister has committed that fundamental political sin and should no longer occupy the position of minister. Neville Wran laid down that principle; Gough Whitlam accepted it; Bob Hawke accepted it; and Malcolm Fraser certainly pursued it. Remember Ros Kelly and the whiteboard incident? Paul Keating applied that dogma. Why should that doctrine not apply to the Minister for Human Services and Health? Because the matter is in Western Australia? This royal commission was constituted to determine whether or not the minister committed that fundamental political sin-whether or not she as Premier misled the Western Australian parliament. That is what the royal commission is all about-why, and on what basis, is the Advance to the Minister for Finance being used to fund that prosecution? Why, when successive cases launched by the minister have failed, should legal expenses still be paid? Mind you, the plot thickens, but I have not got the time to go into all the detail. It is interesting that the firm representing the minister is the same one that Senator Loosley, a former senator for New South Wales, has joined. It is of interest to note that the case seems more and more to be one which rouses the ire of the public. In the latest Herald MCNair poll, 77 per cent of the public disagreed with funding by the government. It is also of interest that the government is not prepared to fund similar sorts of action being launched by Brendon Kelson and Michael MCKernan with respect to the War Memorial. Each of those men are distinguished public servants. Their matters were launched in quite extraordinary ways by the Merit Protection and Review Agency, with the minister responsible, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), not even being advised of the prosecution. All in all, the matter is one which I believe goes more and more to the very integrity of this government. High-handed, inappropriate expenditure of public money does not enhance the stature of democracy in this country. The minister should stand aside. (Time expired)",55
149,Mr BEAZLEY,AND HEALTH,"In so far as there is any sincerity in the remarks of the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), let me set your mind at rest on a couple of things. In relation to the last point you made as to whether or not those two public servants have been funded, I am assured by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) that they have been. That is something you can consider. The other legal matters that you raised were also matters that were considered by the government. The government believes that it has acted on advice safely on all of the points that you have made. So in relation to your concerns about whether or not we have confidence in the situation of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) under that section of the constitution that you referred to-in so far as that is a sincere inquiry on your part-let me set your mind at rest: our view is that the way this has been done conforms with that particular requirement and that was a matter of consideration for us. On the question of whether or not this constitutes a vast waste of public funds, I am prepared to concede the point that it does. There is no question about that. This entire royal commission is a vast illegitimate waste of public funds, and in the first instance the bill for the representation for our minister is being sent to the Western Australian government which has announced, but not yet responded to us, that it is prepared to meet legal expenses. We await a response from the Western Australian government in that regard before it activates any decisions made by the government in support of our minister. The fact of the matter is that you have been wandering around the press gallery and in public saying that the royal commission is costing $10,000 a day and that you have an objection to the waste of taxpayers' funds of $10,000 a day. Try somewhere between $50,000 and $100,000 a day, which is the cost of that royal commission-an absolutely outrageous cost imposed upon the people of Western Australia by the government. So, if your concern goes to the costs of these matters, I suggest that you ring them up. If your concern is about whether or not people ought to be supported in appealing against particular activities of a royal commission or like bodies, then I suggest that you have recourse to whether or not you are guilty of hypocritical cant on your own part when you look back at precedents which you have had no trouble with. When, for example, Premier Greiner, as he then was, decided that he would take the ICAC-which effectively is an ongoing royal commission-to the Supreme Court of New South Wales, did you all stand aside and say, 'Nick, you carry the costs yourself?' Of course, you did not. You supported him being funded in that operation. When ex-Premier Gray of Tasmania found himself appealing against the activities of the Rouse royal commission in Tasmania, did you all stand and say, 'Premier Gray, you should pay your expenses?' No, you did not. You got stuck right in and paid them. Mrs Bishop-And we paid Neville Wran's too.",56
150,Mr BEAZLEY,AND HEALTH,You paid for the expenses on his appeal on that. Mrs Bishop interjecting,57
151,Mr SPEAKER,AND HEALTH,Order! The member for Mackellar has been warned this afternoon.,57
152,Mr BEAZLEY,AND HEALTH,"The fact of the matter is that, before all royal commissions, the normal course of events is for people who are principals, who have been involved in some way or another in government activity, to be appropriately funded-and we believe that we have set the proper basis for appropriate funding in this instance. So, in so far as you are sincere on that, set your minds at rest; in so far as you have a political difficulty or some form of difficulty with that, have recourse to your own past. The question of whether or not people stand down during proceedings before royal commissions is one where the precedents go both ways, as you well know. You cited some precedents where people did stand down. There have been others who chose not to stand down-for example, your colleague Mr Nixon, even though matters concerning him were matters of substantial interest at the time.",57
153,Mr HOWARD,AND HEALTH,He did. He did. He stood aside.,57
154,Mr BEAZLEY,AND HEALTH,"But whether or not the Minister for Human Services and Health stands down goes very much to the question of what sort of regard you have for the motives underpinning this particular royal commission. The fact of the matter is that this royal commission has been established for political reasons only. No other royal commission has ever had a political reference like this. Just imagine if, when we came into office, we had decided that there was an advantage to us in finding out what the cabinet's deliberations were on the bottom of the harbour schemes-and particularly if, having decided on finding out what the cabinet's deliberations were on the bottom of the harbour schemes, we had married that to an investigation of party political contributions. Given the serious damages that royal commissions can do unjustifiably to people's reputations and that they have a great propensity to take two and two and make five, what would have been left of the reputations of just about anybody who served along the Liberal Party front bench had that matter been the subject of a royal commission if we had decided to politically have a go at you for those particular considerations? If we had decided to do that, where would you have stood? Absolutely nowhere. Mr Moore-An inquiry into John Dawkins would have been a good one.",58
155,Mr SPEAKER,AND HEALTH,Order! The member for Ryan!,58
156,Mr BEAZLEY,AND HEALTH,"Your reputations-and probably unjustifiably-would have been mud. Do not kid yourself about the functions of a royal commission in that regard. So that is one thing that you ought to notice about the terms of reference for this particular royal commission. Royal commissions are very serious institutions indeed. They are set up to examine issues such as corruption, issues where there has been an almost terminal breakdown in public administration because there is no capacity for an element of that public administration to investigate itself. There has an outside process that comes in after it. To go to what a person thought they were doing at the time, the state of their mind, on a matter of pure politics, is an extraordinary thing for the terms of reference of a royal commission. When you take it a point further than that and say, 'Okay, what the person was thinking about was a matter of some seriousness'which of course it was not, it was pure politics that produced that, but let us just accept that for a moment-not to incorporate in the terms of reference of the royal commission all the matters that had been raised in that regard over time in Western Australian public forums, because all that petition which is the subject of the royal commission was was a rehashing from a different angle of matters that had been raised in parliament by Mr Court and successive other Liberalsexactly those matters-if your concern was the fact that those matters canvassed in the parliament ought to have been the subject of a royal commission, what you ought to be up there doing is demanding that the royal commission's terms be open. But you will not do that, because the simple fact of the matter is that this is an extraordinary political exercise. Mr Moore-But there was a suicide.",58
157,Mr BEAZLEY,AND HEALTH,"The honourable member for Ryan interjects on me that there was a suicide. Mr Moore-Yes, there was.",58
158,Mr BEAZLEY,AND HEALTH,"That is a matter obviously of the deepest concern and worry to all people who would be associated with the person. But let me say this: the royal commission is not inquiring into that. When those matters were raised, quite sensibly, the royal commissioner got up and said, 'This is not a matter for .ne to inquire into.' So even though there is this constant juxtaposition in the media-this set of events occurred and then the suicide occurred-the fact of the matter is that there is no light to be thrown on that issue by the operation of the royal commission, and it is deliberately excluded. There was no coronial inquiry; there was an inquest which, as you to be know, is a very different matter indeed. If you want to know, either extend the terms of the royal commission or put in place a coronial inquiry, which might go to establishing those facts; but they are not there. There are so many Banquo's ghosts at this particular feast in terms of the terms of reference of that royal commission that you could fill Glamis Castle where for centuries on so many of Banquo's ghosts are missing at this feast-a narrowly defined set of terms of references to target a Commonwealth minister. Do you think for one minute this royal commission would be in place were she not a Commonwealth minister? Of course it would not. Do you think for one minute that, if some advantage had been perceived at the time by the Liberal Party, in the two years after he became Premier before he instituted this, when he had ex-Premier Lawrence before him in the parliament, if he thought it were serious he would have failed to have had the courage to raise it? Of course he would not. The simple fact of the matter is that politics drove him to do it. Politics underpins WilJiams, D. R. the terms of reference in this royal commission. We do not respect the political motives that Adams, D. go into the underpinning of this royal commission. We reject the view that one of our ministers ought to be targeted by that royal commission. We seek appropriate means of supporting her while not resiling from the fact Crawford, M. C. that we believe the funding of her arrangements is 100 per cent the responsibility of the Deahm, M. J. Western Australian state government.",58

162,Mr BRADFORD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"-- Mr Speaker, about 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon there were a number of huge explosions, obviously in close proximity to Parliament House. I made some urgent inquiries and found that this was a 21-gun salute to welcome President Ramos. I wonder whether, if this is to occur in future, you might send a note around warning us.",61
163,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I will take on board your concerns. NA Minister for Human Services and Health,61
164,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The decision by the Government to fund the legal action taken by the federal Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Cannen Lawrence, in relation to the Marks Royal Commission, particularly in view of the fact that the Royal Commission and the legal action taken by Dr Lawrence are not directly related to the exercise Dr Lawrence's Parliamentary or Ministerial responsibility. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number a/members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",61
165,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker, I have raised this matter of public irnportanceMotion (by Mr Beazley) agreed to: That the business of the day be called on. NA Daly, Hon. Frederick Michael, AO",61
166,Mr RUDDOCK,CONDOLENCES," Mr Speaker, I wish to be associated briefly with this condolence motion. I noticed in reading an item in the Sun-Herald of 17 May 1992 that, in writing of Fred Daly, Elisabeth Wynhausen had this to say: Though it is difficult to imagine, there was a time when even Fred Daly was young. First elected to Federal Parliament in 1943, he was so raw, he said, that he took people who visited him in Canberra to the cafe in the main street for bangers and mash. He didn't know politicians were allowed to take visitors to Parliament House for lunch. I thought that was an interesting observation to make about a person who took a great deal of time to help those who came to the parliament to get to know their way around. When I arrived here as the member for Parramatta in 1973 it was quite interesting that, although he campaigned vigorously against me-I even know at what booth I saw him on the day of the by-election; it was the Epping School of Arts-he was one of the first to welcome me to Parliament House. As I was elected in a by-election, he, along with then Speaker Cope, arranged a small function for people to meet me and to make me feel very much at home. I must say that he did say to my wife that, while welcoming us, he did not wish me a long stay. That sense of humour was well understood as I was holding what was seen of then to be a marginal seat. I guess that he really did not wish me a long stay but, while I cannot say I am rivalling him, 20 years having passed, I feel I have in some way proved him wrong. In a sense I followed what he did as a minister quite closely because he had responsibility for electoral matters. I note that he was the member for Martin and the member for Grayndler and at times had to contest a number of ballots, even after redistribution, to remain in the parliament as long as he did. Many of us who have suffered the vagaries of redistribution will have noted how adroitly he managed to achieve that and it is an example that some of us have tried to emulate. Fred Daly was a person of remarkable skills and remarkable humour. He was one who did have a life beyond this parliament, which many politicians do not have. I noticed in my mail this week that I received an invitation to a function here at Parliament House organised by the aged-care community in which they, having printed their invitations some weeks ago, had included Fred as a principal speaker. Having known Fred for a long time both in and out of the parliament, I wanted to be associated with this condolence motion and extend to his daughter, Margaret, and son, Lawrie, my commiserations and those of my family at this time of their loss.",61
167,Mr LEO MCLEAY,CONDOLENCES,"I guess one of my earliest political memories was when I was about 10 or 12 years of age helping my father hand out Labor how-to-vote cards at the Globe Kindergarten in Perry Street, Marrickville, for Fred Daly in a federal election. As I got a little older and went to high school I was in the same class as Lawrie Daly. I remember as a young lad at that school-De La Salle, Marrickville-that the nicest and most consistent person who worked on the school tuckshop was Mrs Daly. At Fred's funeral, which was certainly not so much a time of unhappiness but a genuine celebration of a good person's life, the things that were said by Terry Sheahan, the President of the Labor Party in New South Wales, and the parish priest, Father Tom, were genuine heartfelt things about Fred Daly, who had been the local member for that area from 1949 to 1975. Fred was very much an old-fashioned member of parliament. He worked hard in his constituency. Members of parliament in those days probably did a lot more electioneering than we do now. They did not have all the electorate secretaries that members now have. They did not have all the telephones, direct mail, faxes and all that. What they actually did was what members of parliament probably should be doing now, which was getting around the local area and providing a service to the people who lived in that area. Electorates in those days were a lot smaller and the Grayndler electorate was basically the suburbs of Marrickville, Enmore, a bit of Dulwich Hill and that area. Fred Daly was a byword in the area. As Father Tom said at the funeral, the Labor Party and the Catholic Church in Marrickville were pretty much one and the same. The story told about a woman called Mrs O'Connor, who mistakenly genuflected when she came into a meeting of the central Marrickville branch, is probably true, because when I arrived at the church and walked in the door on the morning of Fred's funeral I was met by one of the church wardens handing out the order of service who happened to be a fellow called Claude Danzy, who had been a long-term vice-president of the Central Marrickville branch of the Labor Party. Of the people who were there at the funeral-the local people as well as the people who knew Fred both in politics and in other parts of his public life-the local people were the ones I think Fred would have been most glad to see there. It is a credit to the thoughts of his family that they had what has been the largest state funeral in Sydney in recent years not in the cathedral, where those things are usually held, but in Fred's local parish church, St Brigid's at Marrickville, because Fred Daly saw his role as the member for Grayndler as probably more important than any other job he had done in his life-other than maybe rugby league. I think I ought to set the record straight in one small way. There has been a lot of alluding here today and in the press earlier to Fred's love of the game of rugby league, which is certainly very true. People mention how wonderful it was that three of the pallbearers at his funeral were people who play for the Raiders-Laurie Daley and two other Raiders players. What they forget is that there were three other pallbearers at the funeral who were former players for the Newtown Rugby League Club. One of those pallbearers who was a particularly fond friend of Fred's was Frank Farrington, who was a long-term secretary of that club. It is an interesting point for members to know that Fred, on the day he died, had come down to Sydney from Canberra to attend a fundraising function for the Newtown Rugby League Club, which was held that night down at South Sydney Leagues Club because Newtown is a much smaller club than it was in Fred's day and plays in the Metropolitan Cup competition. Fred still maintained his contact with that club, and a book they put out that night talked about the leagues club and its connection with the Labor Party. So the three things in Fred Daly's public lifethe church, the Labor Party and the football club-are very much intermingled. Fred's family were very active at the grassroots level. Fred's son, Lawrie, rather interestingly followed me as the assistant secretary of the Labor Party in New South Wales, as I had followed his father as the member for Grayndler. Since the division of Grayndler was formed in 1949 there have been only five members for Grayndler. Fred Daly was the member from 1949 to 1975; Tony Whitlam, from 1975 to 1977; Frank Stewart, from 1977 to 1979; me, from 1979 to 1993; and the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Mrs MCHugh, from 1993 until now. Fred had 26 years as the member for that division and 30 years in the federal parliament. I do not think many of us here will do 30 years in the federal parliament and I doubt whether there will ever be another member for Grayndler who does 26 years as the local member. In that time Fred became an institution both locally and nationally. As other speakers on this condolence motion have said, Fred was someone whom we will not see the likes of here again. I that is a sad thing in a lot of ways, because those of us who have been here for a little while probably miss the characters that there were in the parliament who do not seem to be here now. I know that if Fred were still a member of parliament he would not like this chamber. It certainly does not have the same intimacy as the chamber in the old building had which I think allowed that cut and thrust that made those great debaters perform better than this chamber allows us to. Fred Daly is a person who is missed most particularly by the people who knew him down in Marrickville and by the people in the party in his area. Some of the people who were his lieutenants in the party-I got to know them as I grew up in Marrickville and as the local member-were people who stuck to Fred through thick and thin and were absolutely loyal to both him and the Labor Party: people like Reg Willard and a terribly interesting fellow, who probably in the past I have never called an interesting fellow, by the name of Jimmy O'Halloran, who had been the returning officer for Fred's electorate council for many years. O'Halloran always used to boast that no-one was ever going to beat Daly as long as he was the returning officer. Daly's enemies never quite knew whether they should try to get rid of O'Halloran first or Daly first. Fred was a fellow who, over the years, showed young people in the party such as me that he had seen the hard times of the Labor Party. He had a brief time as a minister, when he achieved some of the things he looked forward all his political life to doing. Unlike a lot of us when we retire from this place, Fred was able to make the transition to retirement very well and was able to come back here and pass on to people some of the things that he had learnt as a member. Fred was also always able to pass on some good humour. As a couple of people have mentioned, he would burst into your office with people on his interesting tour and say, 'This is so and so. I have known him all my life. You really want to meet these people, don't you?' You would think, 'My goodness, of course I want to meet them, Fred. They are think obviously your relations too.' He had that infectious ability to put people at ease and to impart, through humour, a very good message. As I said earlier, Fred's funeral was a celebration of his life. I do not think his funeral could have been better if he had organised it himself. Some people suggest he probably was orchestrating it from heaven anyway. Fred Daly was certainly in that great tradition of Irish Catholic Labor members of parliament who have enriched both our party and this country. He will be missed"" by all those who knew him. Gone with Fred Daly's passing is not only a link with the history of Australia, with his link with the Curtin government, but also the little bit of light that used to shine into our lives as he went around the building from time to time. I used to argue with him and fight with him, and I will miss him terribly.",62
168,Mr CONNOLLY,CONDOLENCES,"Fred Daly will never die, at least not until the last person touched by his life has passed on. I think all of us who were present a few days ago at St Brigid's for the requiem mass would appreciate the significance of some 600 to 700 ordinary Australians being present. Sure, at the top of the church there were former prime ministers, the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Governor General, a squad of ministers and numerous other mere mortals like us. But the hundreds of people that were there were not there to honour Fred Daly, former minister; they were there to honour Fred Daly, their friend, their mate and their supporter. As we have been told, throughout Fred's political life, some 30 years in parliament, he lived through, as did many of his constituents, some of the most difficult days that Australia has ever known-the Depression, the Second World War and the need to reorganise the nation that followed it. In all of that, Fred had 23 years in opposition. Having had nearly 13 years of my own in opposition, I sympathise deeply with people who have had that experience. Throughout those years Fred demonstrated a degree of sagacity, determination and reliability which is quite unique in political terms. There are very few of us in the chamber now who have any personal experience of working either alongside or opposite Fred Daly, member of parliament, minister, Leader of the House and colleague. I am one of those fortunate enough to say that I have been touched by Fred. He often gave us harsh medicine, but he did so with a smile and a joke. While many of us had to bear the brunt of his tongue on occasions, I do not recall anybody ever doing it without a smile. That is a very rare trait which he was undoubtedly able to demonstrate. As has been pointed out by the government whip, the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), at St Brigid's the other day, when we sawall those people, there was a celebration of Fred's life. It was indeed. One could go a little further and say it almost had, shall we say, the characteristics of an Irish wake about it. As the parish priest told us, in Ireland on that very same day a requiem mass was also being said for Fred, again to emphasise the linkage between his past, his present and no doubt his future. Fred was indeed an Irish Catholic of which the church could be very proud. He did in tum give of his best for his God, his faith, his party and his football team. All the things that were important to him, to his community and to the people he represented Fred stood for as well. What touched me in the eulogy from the altar was the emphasis given to his wife, who, throughout the years which they lived together, was simply known as ' Mrs Daly'. The respect shown to her epitomised in a very real sense the love and the devotion of that married couple on the one hand, and on the other the way in which both of them together had managed to forge in a political environment a relationship with their constituents which reached its fulsome totality at that mass at St Brigid's on that day. lowe much to Fred. He was always a friend to me, even though I was on the other side. Last May, when I faced my political Garden of Gethsemane, if I may use that term, Fred rang me up twice before the event and he phoned me once afterwards, which I thought was an extraordinarily kind, generous and sympathetic gesture from a fellow human being who understood the realities of political life and its ups and its downs-and for all of us ultimately it is a down. There he was, lending me his support and his hand at a time when I certainly wanted it. The point has been made, and I just want to reiterate it, that in the context of parliament Fred was a great reformer of parliament. He did certainly change the sittings of parliament and the conditions under which members of parliament have had to work since. I want all of those who have come in since Fred was here to remember that he was the person who made the changes from which we have all benefited. The conditions of parliamentary service were significantly improved because Fred realised, after having spent so many years here and seen what the benefits of ministerial service were on the one side compared with the obvious penury of being on the back bench on the other, that there needed to be a rebalancing, and he carried it through. In those two acts, while at the time he was criticised for them-of course, every time there is a parliamentary salary increase there is always criticism-nevertheless he realised that for the benefit of service of the parliament it was necessary that those who worked within it did so under reasonable conditions. Fred was also the 'King of Canberra'. He was loved in this his adopted town. His Canberra tours, especially to Parliament House, became popular for visitors to this city. If you came to Canberra and you didn't get in the bus and go with Fred on a tour of Canberra, you had obviously missed out on something. There were also his books, his speeches. Fred demonstrated that he had a very real and a very full life after politics. As I said, who remember him were undoubtedly touched by his life and we are the richer for it. I thank his daughter, Margaret, his son, Lawrence, and his grandchildren for the contribution they made to the parliament by being part of Fred's family. I join everyone else who has spoken on the condolence motion on this occasion.  support the expressions of condolence and sympathy to the Daly family that were made earlier in the day and by the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who has just resumed his seat. To me and to your father, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, when he was here, Fred Daly was a true Labor man. He was a man of great commitment, of great humility and, at times, of excessive humour. To many of us, when we first came to this place Fred Daly was a guide and a teacher. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat referred to Fred making assistance available to members. I came into this parliament as one of the Whitlam team in December 1972. When we first met in February 1973, there was none of the assistance available to members, particularly to new members, that is available to members and new members today . We were parcelled into a room, given a pad, some writing implements and a telephone and that was it. There was no guide for getting around the house. It was a feat to find your way around Old Parliament House. I asked for a map or for some sort of chart to find my way around the house because it was much more of a labyrinth than this place is, but there was no chart or layout of the parliamentary building available. We were just thrown in the deep end and sank or swam on our own efforts. The only persons who took an interest in new members at that time were Fred Daly and Rex Connor. Fred Daly had a general approach to politics: what he wanted in the chamber, as he told a number of us, were generalists--people who could rise to their feet at any time and participate and support the then government in debates that may arise. He did not have much of a brief for the narrow specialists who were around at that those time. He wanted more people with a generalist background who could support any issue that arose on any subject that arose. Having been thrown in the deep end, in the evening after the tea break often Fred Daly and Rex Connor, separately, would invite a number of us, including the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who was already here when the rest of us came, to their ministerial offices to give us some clues on where to find quite simple stuff, where to gather information from, what was expected of us in trying to put together a speech and how to find our way through the caucus committee system. They were the very basic things we needed to know to carry out the work that we were sent here to do. Those of us who were involvedJohn Kerin, me, the Prime Minister and Joe Berinson-and had that support and guidance benefited from it very much. We appreciated it very much because there was no other way. There were no word processors, as are provided now. You wrote everything in longhand and you did it by yourself. You did you not have the luxury of typists. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bradfield, said, in Fred's time he brought in the assistants, who were paid the princely sum of $8,000 per year to provide us with some sort of assistance around the chamber when we were down here. Fred Daly played a very important role in his great love; his great love was the parliament. He had a wonderful belief in the parliamentary process-the practising of parliament itself. Many members who came through this place have a great deal to thank Fred Daly for. I put it down to the fact that he had experienced hardship himself. He knew what it was like to start off without anything and he was passing on the benefit of his experience to those who followed. One of the wonderful aspects of Fred's character was that as a Labor man he never forgot his roots. He never ceased to be a humble Australian. As a former member of parliament, he kept a very active interest in the political scene. It was not unusual to get a phone call or a visit from Fred in the old House or in this House and be told what was going on. I admired his faculty, his sharp grasp and his distinctive feel for what the public were thinking, what was a good issue, what was being handled well and what was not being handled well. Right to his last days, he retained that capacity. I thought that was a wonderful trait of character and he had a wonderful aptitude. It was part of the political life, because it was his life. Fred Daly maintained that strong interest political events. He loved the parliamentary scene, as I have referred to. You had to really see his humour in the old House to understand it. If you are looking for a speech that would be the most uproarious speech ever made in parliament, it was the speech he made in May 1973. I will go over the background of that speech made in the old House. The opposition had attended some kind of dinner or function during the tea break. We broke from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m. The debate before the break had been a bit hot and a bit vivid. Fred came in after 8 o'clock to settle things down. Some of our colleagues on the opposite side of the House in the old chamber were a little relaxed. They were not tired and emotional, but a number of them were certainly a bit flushed faced and a little relaxed. When Fred came into the debate it was the most uproarious 20 minutes that one would ever hear in the parliament. In it he described the courtship of Vince Gair by Doug Anthony. Only he described it as the courtship by the National Party of the DLP. That was happening at that time. Fred managed to translate it and describe it as the courtship the old whore by this shiny young man with this great blonde tuft of hair. What a handsome young man he was. During the debate, he became so agitated that he almost finished on the wrong side of the table as he walked up and down the chamber describing all of these events that were taking place. He said what a wonderful wedding it was going to be when finally the old whore was churched by this shining young man. I recommend reading that speech very strongly. I was sore from laughing during that speech. It was Fred Daly at his absolute best. It is probably the classic of how humour can be used in a fun way. Underneath that humour of Fred Daly, there was an underpinning of serious business. He had a debate to cool down and an argument to cool down. He did it with humour, but undermined it completely in a way that nobody could take offence at. Both sides of the House were in continuous laughter at the argument that he put and the his love for descriptions he made to it. I also wanted to say that Fred Daly went to in the electorates of a number of us over the years in which he participated in fundraising exercises. He came along and told the gatherings-he was a very positive speaker-about his experiences and parliamentary life. On the last occasion in which he spoke in my electorate he talked about the ghosts of Parliament House. I am quite sure that the spirit of Fred Daly will long inhabit the old Parliament House down the hill. He used to tell us about the ghosts that haunt the corridors as he related all the strange events that had taken place over the many years that he had been there. I suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that if you walk around the provisional Parliament House and you catch that infectious laughter in the distant corridor, you can be sure that will be Fred as he walks around the building keeping check on the spirits and ghosts there. That building and the events in that building were very much part of his life. At the funeral at St Brigid's that most of us attended, I spoke afterwards with Jim Killen. Jim Killen said that Fred Daly stole his lines and his jokes. Fred Daly was sure that Jim of Killen stole his jokes. I suppose I can say now-I am sure Jim Killen will not mindthat there was an occasion when I had a brilliant idea. I thought what a wonderful night it would be if we got both of them together on the one platform. They could regale the gathering with their reminiscences of their funny times and funny experiences of political life. But I learnt after that that was mission impossible. I learnt why it was impossible to get both of them together on that kind of platform. They had that rivalry and good humour between political opponents that we do not see in this place today. Today it is a much more dour parliament, a much more bitter parliament, a parliament without humour and certainly with much less of the goodwill that was the parliament of the time of Fred Daly and Jim Killen. At the funeral I said to Jim Killen afterwards, 'Jim, you've lost your partner.' He said, 'No, I've got an advocate in the place that you haven't got one.' That was the ultimate in Jim Killen and Fred Daly; that he had an advocate in the place that I did not have one. I want to say to Lawrie Daly, his sister Margaret and to all the members of the Daly family that this nation has been fortunate to have had Fred Daly as a member of its parliament. It has been fortunate for the contribution that he has made over many years. As I said earlier, it is not just what Fred Daly did himself as a member of the parliament and as a minister of the government of Australia; it is the contribution that he made to the careers of so many other members of parliament in the parliamentary process, both in the provisional building and in the current building because that guidance and advice carried on. Fred, whilst you are down there in the old House, those of us that are around will all be thinking of you. To Lawrie, Margaret and the rest of the Daly family, thank you for a wonderful Australian and thank you for your sacrifices. We know, as members of parliament, that you would have been without your father and grandfather on many occasions when you would dearly have loved to have him with you. We thank you for that and we revere the memory of Fred Daly and appreciate the contribution he has made to our Australian way of life.",63
169,Mr ROBERT BROWN,CONDOLENCES,"The special qualities of Fred Daly endeared him to three generations of Australians. He was elected first of all to the federal parliament in 1943 as the member for Martin, and he retired from the federal parliament as the member for Grayndler in 1975. He died in 1995, at the age of 83. Fred Daly was 31 years of age when he was elected to the federal parliament. He remained a member of the federal parliament for 32 years. Very few people have the opportunity to serve their constituents, their electorate and the wider community for as long as that. Fred Daly's great mate Jim Killen often referred to the fact that Fred used humour as a political weapon. There are very few who have the capacity to do that. Fred Daly had a magnificent repertoire of anecdotes and quotable quotes. Some of those quotes were his own; other quotes belonged to other people. One I would like to refer to is this. Fred said, 'If you want to be an expert you don't need to have gone to school; you just need to have outlived everybody.' He sought to do that himself, I am sure. He clearly pursued that objective. He was the last surviving link with the Curtin government but, even within his own family, he outlived eight of his 10 siblings. Only Hilda and Cannice have seen him out. Others have referred to the fact that Fred Daly had three great loves-his family, his church and the Labor Party. Some have included a fourth-football. Perhaps Fred could be absolutely sure what order he placed them in but very few other people-if anycould. Some believe that to Fred his family, his church and his Labor Party were synonymous. I want to refer to Fred's funeral notice. I noticed that it included the words 'I have kept the Faith'. The particular thing that I noticed about that was that 'Faith' was spelt with a capital F. That means that either Fred asked that that be included in his funeral notice or those people who knew Fred best included that expression and spelt 'Faith' with a capital F with the intention of having that statement 'I have kept the Faith' refer to both his Catholic faith and to his faith in the Labor Party and the Labor movement. Let me say to Lawrie, Margaret, Anne and the children-the grandchildren-that Fred Daly did keep the faith. Fred Daly was elected in 1943. He came up for re-election the first time for Martin in 1946. His opponents then used the slogan 'Be healthy, be Liberal, be clean; change Daly.' They crossed out the 'i' in 'daily'! Fred countered that slogan with his own: 'Give us this day our daily Fred.' He was re-elected. Fred and I campaigned for his son Lawrie in New England in 1983 against the right honourable Ian Sinclair. Ian Sinclair contributed to this condolence motion with goodwill and affection. I remember that Ian sent Fred a message while we were up there campaigning against him on behalf of Fred's son Lawrie. It said something like 'Welcome to my electorate, Fred. I would prefer a different motive for it, but you are always welcome.' That was a gracious gesture of goodwill by Ian Sinclair towards a person campaigning against him in his electorate. I was up there, amongst other things, to officially open Lawrie Daly's campaign rooms. I suggested that if I were to open the rooms it would be like one of those newspaper headlines 'Dog bites man'. Fred had a great old English sheep dog that he called Sir John-after Sir John Kerr. I said that we would get more public attention and more media coverage if we got Sir John to officially open the campaign rooms. I said the headlines then were more likely to be 'Man bites dog'. So we did that. Fred had a very special relationship with that dog. The dog performed admirably. The campaign rooms were opened and we got the headlines. Jim Killen-as I say, his great mateduring the Whitlam years referred to Fred Daly in connection with his then responsibility for electoral matters. He said, 'Behind cheerful, engaging countenance there lurks a vigorous regard for that vital ingredient in wielding political power: numbers.' Fred, of course, was a great advocate of the importance of numbers. Fred became Leader of the House in 1972, after 23 years in opposition. We had 23 frustrating years in opposition and then we came into government in 1972. Fred became Leader of the House. I do not know whether it was on one of the first procedural motions or later that he moved a motion when it was not necessary or called for a division. I think it was probably the latter. The Leader of the House calling for a division? Someone said to him, 'Fred, you don't have to call for a division on that; the government has the numbers.' His response was something like this: 'I've been here for over 23 years, and for the last 23 years we didn't have the numbers. I just want to savour it.' I think he called the division himself. Among Fred's publications was The politician who laughed. What a great title for a book by a person like Fred Daly. In Who's who Fred lists his first recreation as talking. He follows it up with 'sport-football'. He represented a Sydney electorate but loved Canberra-and Canberra loved him. He was patron of the Australia Day celebrations in the national capital, he was patron of the Labor Club and he was patron of the Canberra Raiders. For two years-1981-82-he was King of Canberra. I would like to refer to some particular anecdotes, because without the anecdotes we would not have Fred Daly. Fred Daly went to school at Waverley College. He said, 'At Waverley College I got 10 out of 100 for Latin and they kept the class into see who I had copied from.' That a person could treat himself so lightly and with such humour as that indicates the measure of the man. Fred could take a rise out of others but, better still, he could always take a rise out of himself. He said also, 'A Dunedoo convent teacher told me and a classmate, ""You have no brains; you'll both end up in politics.'"" Fred claimed that Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen would ring Dial-a-prayer each day to see if that there were any messages. He claimed as well that, on the first day he attended the old parliament, when he was elected in 1943, he was climbing the stairs at the front of the building when one of his colleagues said to him just as he was about to enter the building, 'Fred, you're about to enter the only mental hospital in the world where the inmates are in charge.' Fred said, 'Politics is the art of the possible. Almost anything can happen, and nearly anything does, but in the end it's the numbers that count.' Fred Daly held the seats of Martin and then Grayndler for 32 years. He said on one occasion, 'Whoever had the books had the numbers, and I kept the books under my arm.' It is possible that Fred had the books under his arm when he attended mass on a Sunday morning. Tony Stephens, a political journalist with the Sydney Morning Herald, said he asked Fred only last month what his greatest achievement was, and Fred replied, 'To last.' I want to refer briefly to some remarks made by Fred Daly in his maiden speech in the House of Representatives in October 1943. Of course, these comments were made in the middle of the Second World War when, by any measure, massive sums of money were found by government to conduct that war. Fred said: Never again will a government dare to say to the people that it cannot raise money to do the things that urgently need doing in times of peace. I that we shall not need so much money in peace as we now need in war. A portion of the amount which is being expended on the war by this country would be sufficient to keep the entire population in employment and security for many years. An essential of the new order must be full-time employment for all those who are able and willing to work. He went on to say: We must do all in our power to win the war, but, at the same time, we must lay the foundation of a better social and economic order. Gough Whitlarn paid a great tribute to Fred Daly. He urged that Fred be remembered as being more than just an amusing public speaker. He referred, as have people who have contributed to this condolence motion, to a lot of those innovations, initiatives, improvements and developments that were brought into the parliament by Fred Daly to assist with the operation of the parliament and the operation of the electoral system. Who reduced the voting age to l8? Fred Daly. Who was responsible for all votes being of equal value? Fred Daly. Who was responsible for regular redistributions of electorates? Fred Daly. Who was responsible for senatorial representation for the territories? Fred Daly. He was responsible for many other things as well. Gough Whitlam said, 'In Canberra, he was a great contributor to the city's two industries: parliament and tourism,' and he was. St Brigid's Catholic Church in Marrickville was full of people. They spilled out around the church on Wednesday, 9 August for the service for Fred Daly. As has been indicated, the Governor General, the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), former Prime Ministers, present and former ministers, present and former members of the opposition, Sir James Killen and so on were all present. But, basically, those people did not represent the important presence. The important presence was represented by those people who related to Fred Daly; it was represented by those people whom Fred Daly sought to serve and to represent for so long. I extend to his daughter Margaret, to his son Lawrie, to his daughter-in-law Anne and to his three grandchildren Clare, Kate and Michael my realise sincere and deep sympathy and the sympathy of my wife, Joy.",67
170,Mr BARRY JONES,CONDOLENCES,"I rise as the member for Lalor and also as the National President of the Australian Labor Party to pay tribute to somebody who devoted his entire life to the Labor cause and to the Labor movement. I endorse the words of my friend the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). It was significant that Fred Daly's funeral notice said that he 'kept the Faith'. That is absolutely correct. Fred Daly was the 13th longest serving MHR, having spent 32 years and three months in this place. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) indicated earlier, Fred Daly was the last survivor of the last parliament that John Curtin served in. As honourable members would know, when John Curtin died his seat was taken by Kim Beazley Sr. Fred Daly was the last person to have served in this House with Curtin. As has often been said, Fred Daly was originally regarded as a 'oncer'. He won the seat of Martin in 1943 under extraordinary circumstances. The Labor Party had a quite unprecedented swing in its favour. Soon after, Fred went away on an overseas study tour. In those days, MPs generally travelled by ship. It was a very lengthy procedure. It was regarded as very hazardous for an MP in a marginal seat to go away on a long excursion. Because of this excursion, he acquired the sobriquet of 'Dilly Dally Daly', which took him a long time to live down. That was used against him in the 1946 election, but it did not seem to hurt him too much; he was able to hang on. Of course, with subsequent redistributions he certainly had a better seat. He was Whip during that very difficult period when Dr Evatt was the Leader of the Opposition during and after the Labor Party split of 1954-55. I echo what the Prime Minister said earlier. There was an extraordinary period of bitterness in the party. Many people did not speak to each other, as is the case with some parties at the moment which shall remain nameless. At that time, there was a great deal of bitterness in Labor. Dr Evatt, it has to be said, was not the world's easiest leader to serve. I wish to tell one of Fred Daly's favourite stories. I am sorry that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) is not in the House to hear it because he would enjoy it. In those days, people actually listened to the parliamentary broadcasts. It was a long time agobefore television. Dr Evatt said to Fred Daly, 'I want you to go down and see Les Haylen'-a prominent member of the Left'and tell him that there's a big foreign debate coming on tonight. I won't lead for the opposition. It's on at 8 o'clock, which is the best time for listeners. I want you to go down and tell Les Haylen that he is to lead for the opposition.' Fred Daly said, 'Well, I thought Les was a bit on the nose with you, Doc?' Dr Evatt said, 'No, that's all right. Tell him all is forgiven and that I want him to give the speech of his lifetime.' Fred Daly went down to see Haylen. When he came back, Evatt asked. 'How did you get on?' Fred said, 'It's all right. He was very excited. He said to say thank you, that he'd never forget it, that he was very grateful and that he would indeed make the speech of his lifetime.' Evatt said, 'Good. Now I want you to go and see Kim Beazley and tell him the same thing.' The task of the Whip was not easy in such circumstances. Of course, he was referring to Kim Beazley Sr. I first met Fred back in 1955 when I stood as the Labor candidate for the then seat of Isaacs, different from the current boundaries. I always remember meeting Fred Daly and the late Frank Stewart at the Commercial Travellers Association in Flinders Street, Melbourne. They came accompanied with a Gladstone bag which was filled with a roll of bank notesno doubt provided by the New South Wales branch of the party. They made a very useful contribution to the Isaacs campaign funds. So, as you can understand, right from 1955 I have always had a very deep sense of gratitude to Fred Daly. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said this morning, there was a kind of tribal quality about his funeral. There was a very real sense of the fact that Fred Daly and the professional life that he led was integral to his community. It was not something externally imposed. It was integral. It grew out of that community. The parish priest has been mentioned a few times today. I thought his best line-which he said with a very straight face-was that there was a very large representation of people of the Catholic faith in the branches around Marrickville. He told the story of an elderly parishioner who went to a Labor Party branch meeting for the first time. She saw so many Catholics there that she automatically genuaffairs flected when she went in. Fred Daly's life reminds us that obviously politics has become far more professional. There are far more members in this House with degrees than there ever were before. Far more members have come in from professionthat al activities. There are both strengths and weaknesses in this. We certainly cannot do without the professional skills, nor can the Liberal and National parties. On the other hand, we lose something if we ignore the importance of being integrated with the community. It is very difficult to keep that balance, but we know that it has to be done. Fred was an extraordinary communicator because he understood how the minds of traditional Labor Party voters worked. He had come up the hard way. He knew that many of the people who vote for our party had come up the hard way as well. In 'keeping the faith' he recognised that the Labor Party of 1995 was dramatically different from the party he had joined back in the late 1930s. He recognised that the changes were inevitable. He participated in many of those changes, but he recognised the importance of maintaining that community base. That is what political activity is all about; it is its whole rationale. He touched all our lives on our side of the House and, I like to think, many on the other side. I was pleased to see not only Jim Killen at the funeral but also John Gorton, Bob Hawke, Paul Keating and Gough Whitlam. Fred Daly made a great contribution to our party, to the parliament and to Australian public life. What can one say, except: requiescat in pace.",69
171,Mr LATHAM,CONDOLENCES,"I join this condolence debate out of a sense of appreciation and admiration for Fred Daly, his life, his service to this parliament and to the Australian Labor Party and, most importantly, from my experience with him, his interest in and encouragement for those seeking to follow him into politics. I came to know Fred in the mid-1980s when I was working with Gough Whitlam in a research capacity and then, of course, as a member of this place, seeing Fred around Parliament House leading his tours. I also came to know him and his son Lawrie through Labor Party forums. It was that sense of interest in younger people that always impressed me about Fred Daly. I suspect after a lengthy period in this place there must be a temptation for all ex-members to walk away and never put back in. That certainly did not apply to Fred Daly. I remember one time in the late 1980s I was sitting towards the front of the Speaker's gallery watching question time trying to pick up the feel of the place and learn a bit about federal politics and Fred had one of his tours towards the back. I walked out up the aisle and he leaned over and whispered to me, 'Did you learn much today?, It was nice that he remembered me. He knew my aspirations in politics. He was always offering those words of encouragement and keeping in touch with people who hoped to follow him into federal parliament. That was one of the great things-he returned his knowledge, his insight and his sense of humour to the generations that hoped to keep up his work in the Australian Labor Party. He also passed on the lessons of our lengthy time in the wilderness-the bitterness of the Labor Party split in the 1950s, the character and folly of Doc Evatt and Fred's experience through that period. Looking at the service book from his funeral, it is very interesting in his biographical details that he was opposition whip from 1949 to 1956 and a member of the federal parliamentary ALP opposition executive from 1967 to 1972. Between 1956 and 1967, for 11 years, he held no formal position with the Labor Party opposition, not as whip, not as a member of the executive but as a backbencher-more or less in the opposition group during a period of Labor in oppositionbecause of that bitterness, the falling out with Evatt and the controversy that followed. There is a lesson there for the Labor faithful who have followed Fred to understand how much we should value government and how much we should value years in power and to make best use of those opportunities. Fred's career, while certainly one that brought great credit to him, was not without its periods of long opposition and long periods in the wilderness-opposition in opposition. Most remarkably, from the time. I knew Fred Daly, he was one of those extremely rare people in Australian public life who enhanced his reputation post-I975, after his departure from the parliament. That is not to say that he was not an effective parliamentarian. In fact, he was a truly great member of parliament in the proper sense, but Fred contributed so much in the last 20 years of his life. In fact, as Gough Whitlam pointed out, he never truly left public life. He was always putting so much more back in, back into the Labor Party. He was willing to campaign anywhere for anyone at any time and willing to help younger people in their schooling of Australian politics. In trying to pick up the flavour of his approach to politics and parliamentary debate, I have come from the Whitlam school of Australian political history, so I take my reference from Graham Freudenberg's book A certain grandeur: Gough Whitlam in politics. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) earlier today made reference to Fred Daly's telling contribution during the loans affair at the end of October 1975. The member for Bennelong remembers this well because Fred was explaining how Tirath Khemlani had been brought to Australia by the Liberal Party: He was pushed into the Commonwealth car along with two sinister bearded staff members and taken on a high speed car chase through the back streets of Fyshwick, reaching speeds of 100 kilometres per hour, turning down side streets and doing sudden V-turns before coming to a sudden stop at his destination-a $23 a night room at the Hotel Wellington. Fred pointed out that Mr Khemlani was still using the car and the men then disappeared into room 49, the room adjoining the motel shoe shine box. Fred continued: An hour later Khemlani's briefcases were lugged into a lift at the $33 a night Lakeside Hotel where Mr Khemlani usually stays, but he was not booked in there last night. Last night Mr Khemlani was locked up with two opposition frontbenchers, Mr Bob Ellicott and Mr John Howard, going through his suitcases full of documents. As if he was not in enough trouble without being locked up with them. I come back again to the use of the Commonwealth car. Poor Mr Khemlani. He had come all the way from Singapore at his own cost and without a visa to clear his name and he had all that excess baggage with him. What must he think of Australia? His life was endangered by high speed car chases in Commonwealth cars, his bags were searched by bearded investigators-as far as we know they were not false beards-and he was booked into a $23 a night room next to a shoe shine box, yet his bags were booked into a $33 a night international hotel. I think that is a very good passage that gives great memories of the flavour and the colourful character of Fred Daly and the sort of contribution he made in this place. I take a lesson from that, as I am sure all members of parliament do, that Daly's use of humour and ridicule with goodwill were very important. It gives an important lesson for today's parliamentarians. Reflecting further on Fred Daly's life, one of the things I have tried to follow in my life-and I think members would relate to this-is the ideal of service to family, community and nation. Fred Daly did these three things so effectively, but he did so much more. This is the message I took from his state funeral in understanding his life-the faith, the loyalty and the service he displayed not only to family, community and nation but also to his party, the Australian Labor Party; to his union, the Federated Clerks Union; to his church, the Catholic Church; and to his football teams, Newtown and the mighty Canberra Raiders. He led a big life-a life that was full of faith, full of loyalty and full of service to each of those seven institutions. We now associate with Fred Daly all the best features of Australian parliamentary debate-the sharp wit and the goodwill. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) mentioned that wherever Fred is right nowand by his faith it is with his maker-he would be taking great interest in these proceedings. In spirit, he is sure to take great interest and pride in his son Lawrie's career, as he has always done in the past. I hope and trust, as do many other members, that Lawrie will soon enter the New South Wales parliament. The Daly legacy in Australian politics is full of good spirit, public interest and goodwill for his community, his party and his nation. Fred Daly was a tremendous person and a great contributor to the reputation and proceedings of the House of Representatives. On behalf of my wife, Gabrielle, I convey our sympathy and condolences to Lawrie and Margaret Daly and their families.",71
172,Ms HENZELL,CONDOLENCES,"I feel very privileged to participate in this condolence motion for Fred Daly and to extend my condolences to his family. It was a wonderful moment in my life when, on the opening of this parliament in 1993, I found myself being introduced to not only Gough and Margaret Whitlam but also Fred Daly. I was able to introduce my family-my husband, my mother-in-law and my two daughters. To come face to face with an icon, someone I felt privileged to listen to all the time. I was growing up, and meet him was such a privilege. A couple of days later I referred to this in my first speech. Some time subsequently, Bray Gray, the widow of former member for Capricornia George Gray, visited Canberra and went on one of Fred's tours. Most fortunately, Fred was taking the tour personally, as we know he did on so many occasions. Fred's comment to Bray was, 'I knew you weren't dead because the little girl from Capricornia mentioned you in her maiden speech.' I took it as a great compliment that he had remem-ered me at all. Whereas I might bridle at hmes at comments such as that from some of my colleagues, from Fred, who I found to be an absolutely darling man, it was a great compliment. I feel quite sure that there were hundreds of women in love with Fred because he was the sort ?f man th-t wOI?en of all ages absolutely fell In love wIth wIthout being able to help themselves. Certainly, whenever I would meet him around the parliament, he was always so delighted to meet you and he would say to his group of visitors, 'We have finally found a member. They are so hard to find in this b-ilding.' He was making some comparison w.Ith the old parliament house, where you trIpped over members. I really enjoyed those encounters. The other thing I am very sad about is that Fred had agreed to try to come up to my electorate to speak at a special dinner we had planned to honour the memory of Frank Forde, a former member for Capricornia who had been Acting Prime Minister and Minister for the Army during the Second World War. The most recent communication I had from Fred was a faxed letter on 28 July confirming his phone call to say that he was not able to come up to our proposed dinner because his health had not been so good. In this letter he said: I - ould i-deed like to be able to join you all on this occasIOn to pay tribute to Frank. He was of complete integrity, loyal and dedicated to the ALP-a real true believer. I.guess that is what we could say about Fred hImself. It has been a privilege to hear so many expressions, from both sides of the House, about the nature of Fred Daly. One of the things I was also very disappointed about was my inability to attend his funeral. It was something I would love to have done, but I had already a number of very important commitments in my electorate that related to issues such as the Australia Remembers program. I thought to myself that I know Fred would have valued the fact that I was putting off a personal need to attend what was obviously a marvellous tribute to him, his funeral service in Marrickville, to do what he would expect a Labor member to do; that is, be with my constituents and continue representing the Labor Party and continuing its finest traditions. I had to content myself with that thought when, personally, I would love to have been there to pay personal tribute. His passing is a great sadness to us all. I - hink we. tended to feel that he was quite mdestructIble and would be with us forever. That, of course, has proven not to be true. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, he was that last link with the Curtin government. We will all be diminished by that loss, but for all t-at he gave to all of us personally-his wit, hIS good humour, his compassion, his humanity-we have all been enriched. I am sure that his family feels very proud by the contribution he has made to Australian public life. I am delighted and pri vileged to be able to contribute to this condolence motion.",72
173,Mr NEHL,CONDOLENCES,"I wish I didn't have to speak on this condolence motion, but Fred Daly is gone so there is no alternative. That being the case, I must say that I speak with an enormous fund of happy memories of Fred, not of here in the parliament but in other circumstances. I suppose most people in the parliament are not aware of what that was. Mr Ruddock-Bananas.",73
174,Mr NEHL,CONDOLENCES,"Bananas indeed. I had the happy circumstance of being the inaugural El Presidente of the Banana Republic-not the one that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has a man spoken about from time to time, but the real Banana Republic, which was the tourist promotion of Coffs Harbour some years ago. The special relationship with Fred was that he was my Raving Ambassador and Minister Plenipotentiary. We had a whale of a time together. He came to Coffs Harbour many times, particularly for the launch of the tourist promotion, which was a surprisingly successfulone. The very first time we got together officially was on the day of the launch. I can recall driving with my head sticking out of the cabin of a World War II truck with a lion draped across the roof of the cab of the truck as well. Mind you, it was only a 19-monthold lion and was very friendly and absolutely loved and adored me. I can assure honourable members that unless you have had your face licked by the sandpaper tongue of a 19month-old lion, you ain't lived. It is quite an experience. Fred and I were involved in that. Of course, he was at his wonderful witty best in doing that. We did a number of promotions together. We both wore a funny sort of uniform-green and yellow with little plastic banana medals hanging off us. I can well remember the time we went into radio station 2UE in Sydney both wearing our banana medals and wearing these silly uniforms. The receptionist said, 'Are you the two Ronnies?' I don't know which one was supposed to be which. Fred was a wonderful man. Like the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), who spoke before me and who was not able to go to his funeral, I was unable to attend his funeral. I would very much like to have attended. I do assure the member for Capricornia that Fred would have been happy that I was looking after my constituents, just as she was looking after hers. On the night of his funeral, we did hold a wake for Fred in the Coffs Harbour Yacht Club, which was one of the venues where we used to have many exploits in the period of time we were working together to promote the tourism of that area. Quite a number of stalwarts who were involved in that promotion got together and we all had a drink or three. I didn't have very much; I only had soda water because I had to go back to a meeting at Macksville that night. The mob got together and said farewell to Fred. He had the capacity to generate enormous affection for himself. He was well liked and loved everywhere he went. I will not tell all the stories; I will tell only one story. He gave me advice from his background. He said, 'Of course, Garry, this is what you have got to do when the election is on and you have got a polling place where there is more than one entry or more entries than you've got workers to go and be at the gate. What you do is go out very early with your piece of chain and your padlock and you chain them up so that nobody else can get in.' I have never had to follow that advice because I have always had plenty of workers there to man the gate. That was just one of those wonderful little bits of advice that Fred gave out. He was a very warm human being, a wonderful Australian. I really am thrilled that I had the opportunity of working with him so closely. I can remember his dog, Sir John, who used to come to Coffs Harbour, too. He used to hop in and out of the back of our Nissan Patrol. I also remember meeting Margaret, his daughter, who came to Coffs Harbour at that time, too. I send her the good wishes of all of the people of Coffs Harbour who were involved in that particular promotion. We benefited enormously from the wit and the warmth of Fred Daly, a great Australian who will be missed by all of us. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. NA (CONTROLLED OPERATIONS) BILL 1995 Second Reading Debate resumed.",73
175,Mr TANNER,CRIMES AMENDMENT,"I also add my tribute to Fred Daly. I was fortunate to be a member of the national executive of the Federated Clerks Union which awarded Fred life membership of that union. That was probably the best and most entertaining meeting we have had of the national executive of the clerks union, certainly while I was on it-not that some of the others were all that entertaining. Fred was a great Australian and a great advertisement for Australian politics. That was very much the impact he had in the community. I was very pleased to be able to be part of bestowing that honour upon him. I tum now to the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1995, which emerges from a case known as the Ridgeway case, which was recently determined in the High Court. Essentially, as I understand them, the facts were that a person, a Mr Ridgeway, was in prison for other matters and he met there another person who, I believe from memory, was a Malaysian national. They entered into a scheme to import heroin from Malaysia into Australia. Unknown to Mr Ridgeway, the person with whom he entered into the scheme was in fact a police informer, who, on his return to Malaysia, informed the Malaysian police of the scheme. They, in tum, informed the Australian Federal Police, who then entered into a scheme to import heroin into Australia to, in effect, enact the intended parts of the crime in order to ensure that Mr Ridgeway could be apprehended and charged with the relevant offences. What followed was that the matter ended up in the High Court, where the court determined that the existing administrative arrangements that applied to giving exemption to police conducting these sorts of activities in order apprehend an offender did not provide sufficient basis for immunity, nor did they effectively enable evidence to be admitted that was illegally obtained. Therefore, the obvious consequence of this decision was that a legislative basis needed to be established to ensure that activities of this nature could continue to be conducted by the police in order to ensure, ultimately, that people could be apprehended. The bill proposes that the Australian Federal Police commissioner, deputy commissioner or assistant commissioner, or a member of the National Crime Authority, can provide a certificate of authorisation which would permit members of the Australian Federal Police to engage in activity, which would otherwise be criminal, in order to bring about the arrest and conviction of a person engaged in, or intending to engage in, activities in contravention of section 233B of the Customs Act 190 I-in other words, the importation of prohibited substances. A number of tests apply with respect to the provision of this certificate. It is only available, obviously, if all relevant information is provided to the decision making party. It applies only where the person concerned is 'likely to commit an offence against section 233B of the Customs Act 1901 or an associated offence whether or not the operation takes place,' the operation being, of course, the police intervention. The third limb of the test is that the controlled operation will make it 'much easier to obtain evidence' with respect to that offence. Finally, it is required that the illicit substances that are the subject of the operation will at all relevant times remain under the control of the police officers involved. Under the legislation, the Minister for Justice must at the earliest practicable opportunity be notified of the operation that is proposed and he or she is also required to table annually in parliament a report specifying all certificates that have been issued and all of the relevant details. Obviously, the details would be included in this report only after the full conclusion of a particular operation, including charges having been laid, a to trial having been completed and convictions having been obtained or acquittals having been arrived at. It is no secret that this situation caused some interesting debate within the government about the appropriate response to the dilemma that had been raised by the Ridgeway case. I was an active participant in that debate. There were a number of concerns about how the government should proceed. I still share some concerns about this legislation; I will get to those in a moment. But I do not believe that some of the concerns that have been raised have any great foundation, and I would like to comment on a couple of those. Firstly, I concur with the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) who in his earlier contribution said that retrospectivity is not really a concern. Although there is a technically retrospective aspect to the legislation, it is not such that it would give rise to concern of the usual type which most of us do raise when issues of retrospectivity are involved. Secondly, there has been some suggestion that in some way this legislation may be unconstitutional. I do not accept that suggestion. I see no basis on which this legislation could be challenged in the High Court as being in breach of the constitution. Thirdly, it has been suggested that, rather than the Australian Federal Police commissioner, deputy commissioner or assistant commissioner having the responsibility for issuing certificates authorising the relevant behaviour, it would be better if it were performed as a judicial function. I have some serious concerns about that suggestion. First, it would have to be handed over to the states, because chapter III of the constitution would prevent the federal judicial bodies from conducting that sort of activity because it is a non-judicial activity, and there would be significant problems in making arrangements with the states to do that. But, more importantly, it starts to blur the role of the judge, the role of a court, and it almost tends to drift into the area of giving advisory opinions, so that, in effect, what you would be doing would be asking a judge to give a preliminary opinion about whether certain types of conduct by the police would be within or outside the law with regard to a particular drug operation. In my view, to take these sorts of things to the courts to obtain certificates appears at first glance to be very good protection against potential abuse. But we need to keep in mind that ultimately the role of the courts is to make judicial decisions; to decide actual cases, live matters. If you start loading up the courts with administrative functions of this nature, a gradual perversion of the role of the court potentially threatens. So I do not have concerns about those matters. As I indicated, there are some concerns that I would like to raise. The first is the question of entrapment. In my view, the Australian legal system, in the various state guises and federally, has always on balance got the issue of entrapment reasonably right. It is a very difficult and complicated legal issue. Clearly, at one end of an extreme spectrum we do not want to have a situation where virtually the whole of an offence is committed, caused or provoked by a police officer, undercover or overt, in order to obtain a conviction. Equally, at the other end of the spectrum we do not want to see obvious wrongdoers getting off scot-free because of some technical exclusion of a piece of evidence because it is seen to be entrapment. The view that the Australian courts have adopted generally on this issue has been reasonably balanced and accurate. The difficulty in the Ridgeway case, on my understanding of the facts, is that, had the police not intervened, the crime could not have happened. The reason it could not have happened was that the co-conspirator was a police informer and his role was essential to the commission of the crime because he was to obtain the heroin overseas and bring it into Australia. So, without the intervention of the police, the offence concerned would not have been possible; it could not have happened. To give an analogy, if you want to look at this from another angle, consider these circumstances for argument's sake. Suppose I express an interest in committing a bank robbery and the police then say, 'Well, okay, we'll give you a gun, we'll provide you with a getaway vehicle and here's a map of the layout of the bank; we'll give you a bit of help to make sure that we can then get there and bust you for that particular crime.' Obviously people would be extremely unhappy if the police were engaging in that sort of thing. There is a serious public policy question here: to what extent should the police intervene in such a way that, even if there were to be an apprehension at the end of the process, their intervention actually causes something to happen which otherwise would not have happened? The critical test or issue in providing a cover for police to conduct illegal acts is that question of whether or not the offence still would have occurred. There is an old problem in criminal law with these types of things: at what point do you intervene? The equivalent problem, for example, may be found in the law of attempts: the issue of impossibility. The most classic illustration of that is the fact that you cannot charge with murder somebody who stabs a corpse because, even though they clearly have intended to kill the person, it was impossible to do so because they were already dead. If this legislation is read broadly and is intended to cover the specific situation that prevailed in the Ridgeway case, then the criminal offence which would never have occurred will, in effect, be extended as a result of police intervention to actual eventuation. There is a critical issue involved in this, and that is in what circumstances where you have little more than an expressed intent and, ultimately, what otherwise would have been a frustrated attempt to bring that intent into actuality should police intervene to ensure that the crime actually happens so that the perpetrators can then be apprehended? It is not clear in my mind how far the bill goes and whether it really does cover this particular situation. Clause 15M(b) specifies that an authorisation certificate can only be given where: (b) the person about whom it is intended to obtain evidence through the operation is likely to commit an offence against section 233B of the Customs Act 1901 or an associated offence whether or not the operation takes place ... The critical question is: does this mean any offence of this type or does it mean this particular offence? Using the heroin importation example, does it mean that in order for this certification to apply the police have to convince the commissioner, deputy commissioner or whomever that, even if they do not intervene, this particular contemplated offence will still happen? Or does it mean that all they have to do is convince the commissioner et cetera that, even if this particular offence will not happen, an offence of this nature will happen at some future time? In other words, the person concerned is clearly somebody who has a long-term agenda of importing heroin and, if this scheme does not come off, they will be back in a few months with another scheme with somebody else doing roughly the same thing. If read broadly, this provision would ultimately, in my view, lead to prosecuting people in effect for exhibiting a propensity to commit a criminal offence. In other words, by initiating one attempt to import heroin which otherwise clearly would have failed at first base, that person has demonstrated a propensity to engage in that sort of criminal behaviour. Therefore, what the police will do is conduct a pre-emptive strike, intervene, to make sure that what otherwise would have failed will actually happen in the case of the original scheme, and they will then apprehend, charge and convict the person concerned on the basis that, if they had not done so, the person would have gone ahead and attempted to do that sort of thing at some other time. The question we have to ask ourselves in this issue is: how far should this extend; to what extent should police take the role of flushing out likely offenders? If you have lost your licence, for example, and have been placed on a bond which includes a requirement not to drink, would it be appropriate for the local cop to go down the pub with you and shout you a few beers to try to get you to break your bond so that he or she could then go to the magistrates court and say, 'Well, look, they've broken their bond, they shouldn't be allowed back in a car.' This goes dangerously close to deeming criminality and then orchestrating events to produce the anticipated criminal outcome. If, on the other hand, clause 15M(b) is read narrowly, then it is a different and much more appropriate story. But we should remember that if it is read narrowly then, in my view, the facts in the Ridgeway case are not covered-that in that particular situation, a certificate would not be available. The explanatory memorandum, which is attached to the legislation, says: . . . the authorising officer must be satisfied that the suspected criminal activity to which the investigation relates would have taken place without the involvement of law enforcement officials. That to me suggests that the narrower interpretation of that particular limb of the test is probably the correct one. I suspect that this ambiguity will probably end up in the High Court as subsequent litigation of the Ridgeway situation. But if it is the narrow limb that is involved and, in effect, the whole scheme of controlled operations has effectively been wiped out by the Ridgeway decision, and the government is endeavouring to resume that scheme but not specifically to target the Ridgeway type situation, then I have no problem. The second issue where I have a concern about this, particularly if the broad interpretaprinciple tion of that provision will apply, is the question of police corruption. Obviously none of us needs to say very much about this issue; is a substantial problem not only in this country but in many other countries. There a big risk that, by extending to the police scope of controlled operations to include exclusive control over virtually the entire process of drug importation, a number of opportunities for corruption will be opened up. For example, when drugs are purchased, particularly overseas, a police officer decide to siphon off some of the purchased drugs, falsify the amount purchased and then sell the difference and continue with controlled operation. They could set up a drug running operation under the cover operations. They could even go into collusion with an alleged suspect in order to run such an operation. As the current New South Wales inquiry indicates, police corruption is a major lem and it is vital that we pursue prevention strategies as well as retribution strategies dealing with police corruption. This means police being well trained, well paid, under independent scrutiny, and also having approwith priate powers which do not unnecessarily Various create opportunities or temptations for police corruption. My final comment is on the broader issue, which ultimately is the cause of being a problem for the government in the first place-and that is, the so-called war on drugs. This is yet another example of long established principles of criminal law being altered in order to fit with the imperatives the so-called war on drugs-the prohibition framework to try to stamp out the use of illicit drugs in our society. It is not the circumstance in which those sorts of changes occur-motor vehicles is the other prominent area-but it is still the major area of perverover sion of the criminal law. A classic example that is the issue of deeming of trafficable quantitIes so that the onus of proof is reversed: if you have a certain quantity of a particular drug in your possession, you are deemed to be trafficking, unless you can prove otherwise-a clear perversion of a basic of the criminal law which is there for very practical reasons. We have to come to terms with the fact that it the prohibition model has failed and that it has produced massive organised crime probis lems and substantially increased police corthe ruption. The major problems of drug abuse tend to have a connection with the prohibition model-impurities and variable quality-and also widespread middle-level and petty crime, robberies and things of that nature to fund the very high prices that a black market in drugs may produces. There are enormous costs to the government through policing and to the real economy, the legal economy, because of the the diversion of huge amounts of consumer dollars out of the real economy into the black of such economy to buy drugs. There are signs in the communityincluding those coming from the other side of politics, which I applaud-that a rethink is proboccurring. I certainly applaud the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory for his in recent decision with respect to the reduction in the criminalisation of cannabis and the Chief Minister of the ACT for the proposals respect to controlled heroin use trials. other figures in the coalition, I think, have been quite courageous in adopting some strong positions on this. I also applaud the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) for taking some very constructive and worthwhile positions on this situation these issues as well. Ultimately, this will be a test of our maturity as a community and as political parties. Unfortunately, in this House it seems to be of very difficult to talk about drugs without getting either redneck knee-jerk reactions or sniggering schoolboy reactions. Every time in only question time there is even any vague sense of marijuana being mentioned you get the sort of public schoolboy sniggers bursting out all the place-and not only on the other of side. It is long overdue that we tackle these issues in a serious way. They are major problems in our community in a lot of respects. I do not favour full legalisation. If we allowed the advertising industry to get its hands on many of the drugs that are currently illegal, consumption would increase, which would be a problem. Somewhere between the current war on drugs and the prohibition model, which clearly has not worked and is causing enormous problems, at one extreme and full legalisation at the other is an appropriate model which ensures that we can tackle the health problems, minimise consumptionnot criminate people for basic things that affect only them and hurt only them-and also get rid of some of the outrageous problems we have with organised crime and the massive costs to the community. I would certainly urge members on the other side to give serious consideration to this issue. (Time expired)",74
176,Mr LIEBERMAN,CRIMES AMENDMENT,"The Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1995 has my full support in spirit. I hope that members on both sides of the House will work as hard as possible to ensure that legislation is agreed upon and put in place urgently. I say that for a number of reasons, and I will try to keep them simple and short. The first reason is that the illegal drug trade is an insidious evil trade. No-one would dispute that. The second reason is that it has destroyed and is destroying many lives and has had a serious impact on many areas of society in the world, including in Australiathankfully, not so much in Australia but, as far as we know, it is still a very serious problem in certain quarters. We must never close our eyes to that. We must never relax in respect of that. We are aware that in some countries the illegal drug trade has been used for political purposes-for example, in connection with the transportation of illegal drugs from South America to the United Statesand is used for political purposes with a view to fomenting disruption in society and for other agendas. The other point I would like to make is that the police force often works in very dangerous circumstances to try to stop the illegal drug trade. It is a fact of life that members of the police force work under cover in certain circumstances, in very dangerous circumstances, and sometimes their lives are lost as a result of their working in this area. It is also a fact that since the Ridgeway case, as I understand it, a number of very serious charges have been laid and trials are to proceed against people who allegedly have been involved in the illegal transportation into Australia of drugs of substantial quantity. If legislation is not agreed upon in this parliament quickly, it is possible that those trials may not proceed and that people who are alleged to have committed serious crimes, if the evidence is there to establish those crimes, will walk free. So let us keep that in context. That is what this is all about. The coalition, obviously, is very keen to see the law clarified and appropriate procedures put on the statute books to enable the fight against this evil, abominable criminal activity to continue and to succeed. That is the issue. Therefore, it should be possible for us to work together to resolve the problem. The problem is that the legislation has in it a procedure which is designed to enable police to enter into undercover operations, if I may call them that, in order that the necessary evidence eventually is available on the arrival of the drugs into this country. I might be oversimplifying it, but that is roughly the issue. It seems to me that there is a divergence of views among some members as to the procedures that need to be undertaken in order that all the necessary safety controls and measures are available as far as is reasonably possible to achieve by legislation. It is always very difficult in legislation to dot every 'i' and to get it right, but goodwill should be the paramount factor between us all. The member for Tangney (Mr Williams) and the shadow minister for social security, the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), on behalf of the coalition, have foreshadowed that we would like this legislation to be quickly referred to an appropriate all-party committee of this House in order that the legislation can be quickly assessed and certain concerns discussed, with a view to coming in with a very urgent report so that the parliament can then resume the debate and get on with passing the legislation. Then it can go into the other house, having gone through this House, with whatever changes have been achieved, I am sure, with bipartisan cooperation. Mr Ruddock-And they can consider the important points made by the honourable member for Melbourne as well.",79
177,Mr LIEBERMAN,CRIMES AMENDMENT,"Exactly. The comments made by honourable members, including the last speaker, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), can also be taken into account. Mr Cleeland-Anything for a reason.",80
178,Mr LIEBERMAN,CRIMES AMENDMENT,"I for one would be particularly interested to hear the comments of the member for MCEwen, who will speak after me, because of his unique position as the chair of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. So I see a valuable process being open to us, and I think it is very important that that process be facilitated as quickly as possible. Can I also say that I honestly do not think-and it seems that it is not an issue any longer with anyone in this House anywaythat this legislation is retrospective legislation. The offence of importation of drugs that are illegal is not in any shape or form altered by this legislation. For those people in the 10 or so cases in Australia that I understand are awaiting trial, the offence that they are charged with is in no shape or form altered by this legislation. So I see no retrospective alteration to the nature of the offence. If it were retrospective, then all of us would be wringing our hands because of the concern that we have, in the system of justice that we all support, that retrospective legislation creating a criminal offence in that area is to be resisted unless there is the most overpowering evidence. Thankfully, we are not being asked to consider that. I do not look forward to the day when we are, quite frankly. This legislation attempts to put into statute law an appropriate authorised controlled operation procedure that is a step in the way in which the criminal enforcement agencies can cope with the insidious criminal activity that we know exists in the world. It is in that area that I have noted the comments of other members and the concern of the member for Melbourne about the involvement of judicial oversight. I for one at this stage, subject to the consultation and advice and input that would come from a parliamentary committee, lean towards having judicial function because of a number of factors. I will spell those out now, but not exhaustively, just to give an indication of some of the areas that I am attracted to. Firstly, regrettably, the present operation of police enforcement in the drug area of Australia is subject to very serious public concern. Without in any way wishing to pre-empt the New South Wales royal commission into the New South Wales police force and certain activities, it is a matter of grave concern that we see evidence being reported in that commission involving, allegedly, a large number of serving officers of the police force in New South Wales and the alleged acceptance and payment of bribes in connection with the trafficking of drugs. In particular, one alarming piece of evidence has alleged that, as a consequence of an officer being killed in the line of duty in the drug enforcement area-I choose my words carefully because I do not want to transgress the orders of the House in respect of royal commissions-the officers investigating the murder of the investigating police officer were allegedly persuaded by bribes to abandon those investigations. I cannot think of anything more stark or frightening than that sort of allegation. I do not in any way wish to reflect on the integrity or the efficiency of the federal commissioner, who I think it is proposed in this bill will be the one responsible to deal with the proposed authorised controlled operation procedures. I do not do that. I know honourable members will understand that I am not doing that. I am talking generally about the community concern and perception that exist. I cannot prove this, because I have not actually asked any serving officer of the police force about this, but I have a gut feeling that good, honest police officers-and there are many of them, thank goodness-in the state and federal police forces of Australia would welcome this parliament spending a bit more time, through a joint parliamentary committee, to scrutinise the authorised control operation proposals and would welcome the suggestion that there be judicial involvement and even perhaps that some evidence be taken as a matter of urgency at the committee level from officers who are serving in this area by asking them what they think. I have a gut feeling that a good, honest police officer involved in this war against those who are involved in bringing these drugs into Australia would welcome the appropriate mechanisms involving judicial function oversight. I know there are problems with it. I know that some schools of thought advance the view that judges increasingly involved in this function take on an administrative role and that that is not their role. As a lawyer, I do not want to see anything occur at all which undermines the judiciary or in any way makes it more difficult for it. Above all, I would to see that the separate functions of the judiciary are maintained. It is a fact of life that the issuing of warrants-to use a simple example-is part of the legal process and is sanctioned by judiciary. The permission to issue a warrant is often obtained as a result of a judge or a magistrate being involved at the first level. Under the telecommunications interceptor law, as the member for Tangney has outlined, there is involvement of the judicial function in connection with gaining the right to intercept telecommunications signals. Of course, that right is an invasion of privacy, and judicial involvement is accepted as necessary because of this parliament's concern about the right to privacy, the fact that it is precious and it is not to be interfered with lightly. If it is to interfered with, then let us make sure that it is done with great care and only where there is satisfactory oversight at the first level anyway. This legislation appears to involve those who are involved in the law enforcement side, who are then involved in the very delicate setting up of operations-undercover and overseas operations and with undercover people-being satisfied amongst themselves that the process should be authorised. It seems to me-again, I am oversimplifying it; never mind, I think I am right-that a joint committee of this parliament should have a look at that to see whether it is desirable to allow, if I may say, Caesar to Caesar type operationsthat is, the initiation, the authorisation and the supervision-or whether to add to the strength of the whole procedure and to provide necessary safeguards to have some judicial function at that level, because of the benefits that that judicial function would bring. It may be that the judicial issue can also be tested at the joint committee level, and it may be that one of the judges could give evidence to guide the committee in matters as important as this. So for that reason, firstly, I hope the legislation can be enacted quickly-I think it is urgent legislation-and, secondly, I urge the minister to consider the suggestion of the coalition that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and like Constitutional Affairs be asked to urgently report on it. I realise that if the minister does not accept that then the matter will go to the Senate and, without wishing to pre-empt what our colleagues in the Senate will do, it is pretty clear that the Senate would carry out its own investigation and refer. I am not sure about the workload of the Senate committees; I have heard of these magical Friday committees, and I understand that the Senate Friday committees are very burdened with work at the moment. I think that we really ought to have a joint discussion; I have said this before when I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and we did an inquiry into labelling here and reported. Then the Senate be had its own inquiry into the same legislation. I have said what a pity it is that in this House in 1995 we have got this rather odd, strange situation where the two houses cannot meet informally to decide whether it is necessary to have two committees to look at the same piece of legislation. Why can't we set up a joint committee, by motion of either house, initially, to look at the legislation for both houses, rather than have the process of two? That is not in any way to diminish the work of the Senate. I support the work of the Senate. But it seems to me that we could get a little bit more with it, streamline the procedures and have in place a situation that would enable the ministers, such as in this case, to deal with their legislation. In other words, as I read it, both sides of the House want the legislation to go through quickly. Both sides of the House have got some concerns about the legislation. Both sides of the House seem to be agreeing that an examination by a committee is appropriate provided it is done quickly. This side of the House says, 'Why not do it by a House of Representatives committee because it can be done speedily?' I think the government minister has said, 'No. Do it in the Senate because the Senate will want the inquiry anyway and, if you do it here, the Senate will still want its own inquiry.' If I were the Prime Minister for the dayheaven forbid!-I would adjourn the debate for half an hour and call in the minister, the shadow ministers and the leaders in both houses and say, 'Right, within half an hour, I want you to resolve this. I want one joint committee or one committee to deal with this situation, and I want you to decide which one it is going to be.' Then I would go back and inform you, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - I hope you are still presiding-that we had reached an agreement. Then we could get on with the job and do what we should be doing-that is, bringing in legislation quickly and accommodating the police and the prosecutors, who must be terribly concerned about this hiatus that exists as a result of the Ridgeway case. And for ordinary John Citizen-imagine the anger and concern of the ordinary citizens of Australia when they hear that 10 people, who might be guilty, are facing alleged serious offences and trials in Australia and they might walk free because this house of parliament and the Senate could not quickly deal with the matter-they both agree on it; it is only a matter of the detail. I hope that something will happen quickly. If it does not, we will persevere. The coalition wants to help the government get this thing right.",80
179,Mr CLEELAND,CRIMES AMENDMENT,"MCEwen) (6.30 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, you would think, listening to members in this House debating the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1995, that we have a large document in front of us with lots of words and lots of complex issues to be resolved. It is 10 pages long. It is a small bill. It is in language which even non-lawyers could read and understand without difficulty. It introduces the concept of a controlled operation in proposed section 15H. It has only three subsections in the definitional part which applies to section 3(1) of the Crimes Act and it is not very complex. Yet we have heard a whole lot of reasons why it should be delayed and a committee should examine it. Most of the arguments for delay seem to be based on a proposition that, rather than a serving police officer with senior rank authorising a controlled operation, it should be a judicial function. It is seen by some members as similar to the issue of a warrant for search, arrest, or telephone intercept under the telephone interception provisions, yet it is not. We are talking about an administrative, not a judicial, function. It is an operational function, not a judicial function. Warrants are issued by courts because they involve the taking away of liberty of individuals. They involve a judicial decision to take away those rights to allow a police officer to do something which is unlawful without the warrant because of the privacy or private rights of the individual. Police officers of senior rank make operational decisions on a daily basis without recourse to judges or magistrates. They are fundamentally very different matters. Indeed, there are arguments for the fact that, should it be the will of the House that it be a judicial function to authorise operations known as controlled operations, it could well be a breach of the separation of powers because it involves two totally different functions. In this respect I draw the attention of the House to a 1994 Federal Court decision in the case of Grollo v Bates, reported in 125 Australian Law Reports at page 492, where Justice Einfeld held that certain functions conferred on judges and magistrates by Commonwealth legislation are administrative and not judicial. He held that those functions could not validly be exercised by judges or magistrates because of the separation of powers required by the Commonwealth constitution. The provision in question was a Victorian provision allowing the extension of time for which a suspect could be held prior to Commonwealth investigation under Commonwealth jaw. It is not a simple answer to say that we should refer this matter to a committee so that it can look at whether a warrant should be issued by a judicial person before a controlled operation can take place. There is a case right on that point already in the law reports and, to me at least, there are some major complications in going down that track. There are other things that maybe only those of us who have had the privilege of serving in the police force can say about this type of operation, and that is that the bulk of crime is detected and convictions secured by the use of information obtained other than by brilliant detective work. Very few major cases appear before the court because the police are brilliant detectives. Major prosecutions and convictions occur because there is an informer somewhere who leaks information to police officers, who then set up an operation to drag in the evidence based on the information provided and get the brief together to secure a conviction. The bulk of policing occurs like that. They are operational decisions and operational matters. The bulk of convictions secured on major importations of drugs into Australia are achieved because of information received from our overseas posts. Australian Federal Police officers in listening posts around the world, cooperating with overseas police forces and sharing intelligence, hear of operations to import into Australia. But, unless they can operate to allow that transaction to take place, they will never get the people into Australia and be able to charge them before Australian courts. It is not much use, frankly, stopping operations in some countries where the intelligence is gathered, because you can buy your way out of those situations in most of the drug source countries. It would seem to be much more satisfactory, if we are really going to do something about this major drug trade, to get the offenders into Australia and make sure they are properly dealt with by decent laws and go where they belong-into Australian gaols. You have to understand that that is the way it works. Last Christmas I spent some time in the United States looking at organised crime and that country's position on crime. I met with a number of Australian police officers who work from our embassies in the United States and I met with many major US police bodies, including the FBI and the DEA. I spent an engrossing four weeks looking at the American situation and the problems it faces with drug importations. This House also has to understand that we are not dealing with amateurs. Today, the importation of drugs around the world is controlled by a very intelligent corporate-type organisation. The methods being devised to get through Customs and the very tight controls the world is getting over target countries are very sophisticated. Some of them are so sophisticated that I do not want to talk about them in this House and tell people just how easy it is with the sophistication now available to breach the Customs barriers. If we are going to be successful, if we are going to be really serious about getting these people and slowing down the trade-in my view, it is impossible to slow down because the profits are too high-and making any dent at all on the trade, we will have to be as devious and clever as they are. We will have to be more so, if possible, if we are going to get them. We are not talking about kids committing street offences; we are talking about the second largest trade in the world. It ranks with the defence trade, which is huge. It is a multibillion US dollars business. The profits are enormous. You could go to Bangkok tomorrow and it would not be difficult to buy one kilo of No. 4 heroin, pure white, the highest grade you can buy on overseas markets. Its price varies but with anywhere between $10,000 and $12,000, given the state of the market and supply at the time, you can buy yourself a kilo of pure heroin. If you can get it past the borders and into this country, you have got yourself $250,000 in cash. That is the market we are talking about. No matter what laws we pass there are people who will try to get $12,000 converted into $250,000 tax free in cash. Our laws just have to get cleverer. We have to do things which might go against the grain for civil libertarians and which otherwise I would not agree with. But, when you look at this measure, which really is not much of a breach of individual liberties, you must remember that we are talking about people who are intending to import into Australia a drug. This legislation permits a police officer, properly authorised by senior command, to assist in a surreptitious wayan already determined activity to import into Australia in order to ensure that evidence of importation is obtained by the police so that, one, the drug does not get into the marketplace and, two, the offenders are put before a court with the evidence necessary to convict them. This legislation operationally allows the police force to set up a sting, as the Americans would call it. It is not entrapment because the offenders already have the intention to import. There is nothing complicated about it. It is simple legislation. I suppose it is easy enough to say that we can refer it to a committee. I listened with interest to the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) talk about what he would do if he were Prime Minister for a day. He would get the minister, he would put them all together and he would get the Senate to agree. You only have to read what the Clerk of the Senate, Mr Evans, says. I do not think you could ever expect any agreement out of the Senate on anything to do with this House. So joint committees set up so quickly are an impossibility. If it goes to other committees, you are simply delaying the passage of the bill for no legal or sensible reason, as much as you say otherwise. As has been clearly demonstrated with Grollo's case, it is a no-no. So I do not accept in any way, shape or form that there is a legitimate reason presented so far to this House why a committee should be put up to look at the legislation when any member of this House can go and read Grollo's case, have a good look at the law for themselves, come back and vote and support it. The other thing we should look at is the matter raised by the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). Like the member for Melbourne, I have long been a member involved in trying to get more sense into the whole drug debate in this country. The member for Melbourne and I agree on this particular area. My view is clear: until we take a pragmatic, sensible approach about the illegal drug market in Australia, we are not going to solve the problem. The reality is that any person who wants to buy an illegal drug in Australia can do so. I do not care how many laws this parliament or a state parliament passes, they are not going to change that very simple fact. It has been 40-odd years or more since the UN, through American pressure, forced the rest of the world into creating an illegal drug regime on drugs which were once not unlawful. Up until 1953, I think it was, heroin was not unlawful in this country-a drug which was widely used in childbirth; a drug which has an enormous number of human factors to it. For example, we deny terminally ill cancer patients access to one of the best analgesics known in the world. We are saying in Australia, 'So what? Put up with the pain,' because some people use it unlawfully. I cannot wear that argument. I find that a nonsense argument. With the experience I have had and the years I have spent on the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I have come to the conclusion that we are talking about a social health problem. Those who use illegal drugs have a health problem-no more or less than an alcoholic and no more or less than those people who are addicted to legal drugs. We should not forget in this House that the biggest drug problem in Australia is the abuse of prescribed drugs. There are more people addicted to tryptanol, serepax, valium, rohypnols and mogodons. More people present themselves to casualty centres in Australian hospitals because of poly-drug abuse of the legal drugs than because of illegal drugs. We treat those people as a health problem, quite properly; yet if you happen to use cocaine or heroin you are a criminal. The logic escapes me. It is a matter which we really have to talk seriously about in this country, because until we get to the stage of removing the demand we will never control supply. I can say to this House that my experience in looking at this problem around the world has been very simple. The Americans have spent billions of dollars. They have gone down to South America with the CIA, they have used aeroplanes and they have had operations of dubious legality in trying to stop the problem. They have failed. There is as much cocaine in the world today as there has ever been and the growth of the product is growing. We know that in South America today the Cali cartel people, the Columbians, the Peruvians, the Chilians and now the Mexicans are growing heroin as well. There is a new source of heroin coming into the United States, which is one of the problems we now see in Australia. There is an oversupply of heroin. Our young users of heroin are getting purer doses and overdosing and they are dying. That is our fault. We should all take the blame for what is occurring in the street. The fact is that in South America heroin is now being grown, is coming into the market and is competing with the Asian and the Pakistani heroin growers, so the price is dropping. I heard about a horrible reality when I was in the United States. The San Francisco narcotics squad were telling me that they had a seizer of cocaine in San Francisco several years ago. They seized six tonnes of pure cocaine-six tonnes! The mind boggles. They thought they had a great success, a major breakthrough. They had got six tonnes of pure cocaine. So they watched the street prices, which is the only way to measure the success in these areas, and the street price of cocaine did not vary; it did not blip. In other words, the supply of cocaine was greater than the six tonnes they got. If that does not tell us something about the nature and the size of this trade, then it does not tell us anything. So we have to be clever, and I really want to get these people. Whilst I want to see changes on the street and treat people who use drugs as a so-called health problem, not a criminal problem, it does not mean to say that we need to stop the attack on international organised criminality, which the drug trade now is and which corrupts right around the world. That brings me to the issues about corruption that the member for Melbourne raised. He said that one of his concerns was that if you have controlled operations there is the potential for police corruption. He said that that could allow police to siphon off part of the shipment and it could allow police to use a controlled operation to be importers of illegal drugs in their own right. They can do that now. This legislation will not make that any easier or any more difficult than it is now for any corrupt police officer in this country to do. You can get a corrupt Customs person and a corrupt cop and you can do it now. This legislation is not going to create corruption by itself. Corruption is created because of the nature of the trade. As I said, you can go to Thailand and for $12,000 buy yourself a kilo of No.4. You can ship it in and make a quarter of a million bucks. That is where the corruption comes from, not because of this sort of legislation. As long as people can do that, there is going to be corruption. We ought to admit that and understand that that is the problem we face with corruption-the sheer profit, the sheer greed of the people who are involved in this trade. I have listened carefully. I have heard nothing, frankly, that convinces me that this House should not pass the legislation now. I have heard no reason why this House should not pass the legislation rather than try to defer it to a committee which will be told about the Grollo case and which will be told that there are difficulties in separating administrative and judicial functions. They will agree and it will come. back to this House. It will be a waste of time. We in this House cannot control what the Senate does. We cannot control the views of Mr Evans, as much as I wish I could. There are those in the Senate who believe that they are the functioning house, that they can have as many committees as they like and that they can delay the government's legislation. That is a fact of life that this House has to live with. We all know that Senate committees are chock-a-block with reports. The Joint Comnarcotics mittee on the National Crime Authority that suffers because we cannot get senators to There is not one joint committee at the moment in this place that is not suffering because senators are overworked. There is nothing I can do about that and there is nothing we in this House can do to make Senate become more efficient in the way it processes legislation. Having an inquiry this legislation in this place will not help, because the Senate will still do what it wants to do, no matter what we do in this House. Even if we do have an inquiry, the Senate will still have its own inquiry because the Democrats and the Greens are all trying important in functions and the NationalLiberal Party coalition is trying to play its own politics with the Democrats and the Greens. So let us get the legislation through. Let not let those people who are currently ing hearings before a court on controlled importations into Australia off the hook. The longer we delay, the greater people will not face justice in the courts. The longer we wait, the greater the risks are that nolle prosequis will be issued. I have heard nothing in this debate today to convince me of any logical or legal reason why we should delay the passage of this bill. I urge the House to do the right thing and get it up the Senate as quickly as possible.",82
180,Mr KERR,CRIMES AMENDMENT,"in reply-I thank honourable recorded. members for their contributions in the debate operation. on the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill. There are a number of points which have been raised, and I should respond to a number of those. Firstly, there is the question of retrospectivity. I am happy that the honourable member for Tangney (Mr of Williams) has put that in a proper context. The bill does not impose any retrospective criminal liability . The rationale for the principle that laws should not be retrospective is that a citizen should be entitled to rely on the law as it stands so that they can conduct their affairs accordingly. On that basis there is nothing repugnant about this bill, unless it is supposed that traffickers were entitled to assume they could import narcotics without being it. prosecuted. The transitional provisions have been drafted as narrowly as possible without jeopardising the 10 outstanding prosecutions which rely on evidence obtained as a result of an importation which would otherwise not be the able to be established on the Ridgeway principles. The transitional provisions apply on to only future cases. Cases in which a court has already decided to exclude evidence are not affected. Without the transitional provisions, the evidence available to prosecute a number of pending cases relating to allegations of serious narcotics trafficking offences to be will be in serious jeopardy. I also should discuss briefly the issue of judicial authorisation. There has been some discussion regarding the view that operations should be authorised by the court. This bill us has been structured, in my view, to appropriawaitately balance broad questions about law enforcement, accountability, preventing abusive powers by police and maintaining the the risk that these rule of law. When it comes to the decision in a specific case regarding an authorisation of a police operation, that is a quite different matter than the issuing of a search, arrest or telecommunications interception warrant. In those latter to cases, an individual's liberties are being balanced against the interests of the community as a whole. Their house is being searched, their liberty restricted or their conversation In other words, there is a balancing In the case of a controlled operation, there is no civil liberty to import narcotics free of police involvement. The decision whether to authorise an operation rests on an assessment the likely effectiveness and security of the operation and a judgment about whether or not that person would be likely to have pursued that course irrespective of the operation. These are essentially operational questions and require judgments addressing the whole issue of what resources are available to law enforcement and the capacity of that operation to protect the community as a whole from any diversion. All those issues are ones which are simply not appropriate to pass from the person who has the correct responsibility of making a judgment to a court official. I think it is very important to have a system in which responsibility rests with the person who takes a decision. When it comes to whether or not a particular police operation is to be commenced, the decision is one in which we would expect the blame for any failure to be attached to that person responsible for taking the decision. It is hardly appropriate to place such law enforcement possibilities into the hands of courts, which are essentially charged with an adjudicative function rather than a function of operating as part of the executive. For that reason and the issue of the separation of powers, there are real constitutional reasons why operations should not be authorised by judges and magistrates. Courts have made it clear that it is contrary to the separation of powers and hence constitutionally invalid for judges and magistrates to perform administrative functions. Already in the Grollo and Bates litigation the Commonwealth's reliance on Victorian provisions that required a magistrate's authorisation to extend a period of a suspect's detention have been held invalid. So far the Commonwealth has managed to steer around these constitutional problems. We have done that by conferring on persons, as persona designata, powers of this administrative nature on persons who also hold judicial office. But the powers in this bill, were they to be conferred on a court, would move very substantially further from traditional notions of judicial function than any previously conferred on judges. It is quite possible that they would cross the line, delimiting the kinds of functions that judges might validly exercise. I make one final point on this issue. There has been a tendency in Australian law enforcement to load functions onto judges and magistrates. Judges and magistrates in both state and federal courts have bitterly complained about the workload that this has created and that they are becoming law enforcement adjudicators instead of judicial officers. At best there would be lengthy delays in securing the agreement from states and territories to allow their judges to perform these functions. In the interim, federal judges would face a significant workload in this area if it is appropriate as a matter of principle to confer that responsibility on the court. I simply do not believe that that is a desirable outcome. As to decision making criteria, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has suggested two additional decision making criteria. The first is that an operation should be a last resort where other methods of investigation are not open. The second is that the seriousness of the offence should be taken into account. The first point is already covered by the bill. Proposed section 15M will require that the authorising officer be satisfied that the operation will 'make it much easier to obtain evidence' leading to the prosecution of a Commonwealth narcotics offence. In other words, where other methods of obtaining evidence are reasonably available the legislation will not facilitate a controlled operation to be authorised. As to the suggestion that the seriousness of the offence be taken into account, an operation can be performed only to obtain evidence of a narcotics trafficking offence against section 233B of the Customs Act 1901, or aiding and abetting, attempting, inciting or conspiring to commit such an offence. In a rare case where the trafficking concerns a very small quantity of narcotic goods, it is hard to see what incentive there would be for law enforcement officers to devote to a minor instance substantial resources that would be required. That is particularly true given that senior officers whose authorisation is required are also responsible for making the most of the law enforcement budget. Might I say too in respect of the argument that safeguards have not been adequately built into this legislation, I think it is instructive to contrast this legislation with that passed by the South Australian parliament and introduced by the South Australian Liberal government. Any person who suggests that this bill is not hedged with an appropriate regard to the matters that are appropriate by way of safeguards needs only look to the South Australian legislation to see a manner of addressing the Ridgeway decision, which builds in remarkably fewer safeguardsindeed, none of those which have been counselled by members in this debate. Might I just mention a couple of other points. The issue of risk for arrest by state police has been raised. I would say to the member for Tangney that we are seeking to continue the close coordination between state and federal agencies in a wide range of matters. Controlled operations have existed a number of times under the administrative arrangements which were thought to authorise them adequately in the past. Cooperation between state and federal agencies will be necessary, as again they have always been. I would add, however, that the bill will make one significant difference: in an instance where an authorisation has been granted under this scheme there will be a clear and available certificate which will demonstrate on officer's bona fides in the unlikely event that an officer is arrested in some other jurisdiction. Turning to the issue of the committee: I do accept that it is inevitable that this matter will go before a parliamentary committee. I believe, however, that it is in the interests of this parliament that we move it through this process quickly and now. The government has given this bill category T status, which means the most urgent status which legislation can be given in the parliament, in view of the significance of the issue and the importance of it being passed by the House and the Senate as rapidly as possible. I am aware of substantial interest in this legislation in the Senate. I understand that interest is not confined to the coalition parties and is also an interest which is held by the Australian Democrats and other members of that chamber. In that circumstance, it seems to me not improbable that whatever course was adopted in this case the Senate might revisit the issues. It seems to me, given the need for this matter to be dealt with as a matter of genuine urgency, it is wise to accept the reality that the matter will be addressed in the Senate and proceed in that way. The member for Berowra ought to be aware of my views in relation to those matters. A similar process has happened in the past where I have indicated to the member for Berowra that, where legislation is timed urgent, I would normally seek an assurance that there will be an undertaking across the Senate that the matter would not be revisited. Whilst that may be the case of the coalition parties, I have certainly not had it in a general sense that would extend to an undertaking that the Senate would not revisit it in those circumstances. Whilst I will not decline leave for the member for Berowra to move the motion that he proposes, we will be voting against it. Question resolved in the affirmative, Mr Mack dissenting. Bill read a second time. Reference to Committee",86
181,Mr RUDDOCK,CRIMES AMENDMENT,"-by leave-I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Berowra moving a motion to refer the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1995 to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report as soon as possible. I will not detain the House by reiterating my arguments again, save to say that I have not been persuaded. I encourage the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) to read the thoughtful speech of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) on his side in relation to the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill because it raised some additional matters that I had not covered. I thought it demonstrated the nature of the submissions that might well be received on this legislation. I accept that there may be a basis for argument on some of the issues that I pressed, even though you did not persuade me. I was particularly interested in the honourable member for Melbourne's comments because they were not picked up in your comments by your advisers. They put a new dimension on it and showed the way in which members of this House can contribute. While I am not in a position to say that the Senate would not revisit the matter, I can certainly say that, so far as my colleagues are concerned, our view was that an inquiry by a committee of this chamber of the parliament would suffice. I recognise that there may well have been views by others in other parties over whom we have no influence, but it would certainly give great credit, particularly to the House of Representatives, if the government was prepared to acknowledge that good work can be done in this chamber. I noticed in the legislation dealing with paedophiles that the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs considerably improved the government's bill. My recollection is that the Senate did not seek to revisit that particular legislation after it been improved. I would certainly counsel the government, even at this late stage, to reconsider its position and support the amendment. My colleague the shadow Attorney-General (Senator Vanstone), who is in the other place, indicated that, even though we appreciate the urgency that the government attaches to the Senate, the Senate committee does have a very heavy workload. It was more likely that a prompt consideration would be possible in this place. While we would not be seeking to impose any capricious delay in the Senate, the workload it has is more likely to lead to a delay that the government says it does not want than if we were to proceed with the matter before this House's committee.",88
182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CRIMES AMENDMENT,Is the motion seconded? Mr Lieberman-I second the motion.,89
183,Mr KERR,CRIMES AMENDMENT,"I thank the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). Firstly, I do accept that this House and its committees can playa very valuable role. I think the legislation that I as minister referred to the committee is the first instance in the history of this parliament under the new standing committee arrangements where that did occur, and I think it can work very well. I simply reiterate that where a time limited matter of some urgency is before the parliament and where there can be no assurances that the Democrats will not raise this issue and where there is an arrangement known to the government where either the Democrats or the coalition parties seek to have a reference to a Senate committee, that will be supported by the other parties unless we do have an assurance that we will not be duplicating a hearing process, both in the committee of the House and in the Senate. Obviously then the risk of great delay is inherent, as the honourable member for Berowra concedes must be a real factor in this instance. I thank the honourable member for Berowra for his constructive contribution. I thank the opposition for its general support for the direction of this legislation. I am encouraged by that and I hope that that same positive and constructive approach leads to this legislation had being given proper attention in the Senate as soon as practicable.

186,Mrs SULLIVAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Moncrief!) (7.08 p.m.)All public opinion polls on issues of public moment indicate very clearly that law and order is an issue of very high priority with the general pUblic. More and more people are becoming victims of crime, in particular of break and enter offences. Only those who have experienced this can know the anguish it causes. In the case of my own electorate, which has a large number of elderly people, I have heard stories where the consequence of break and enter of an elderly person's home has been nervous breakdown, subsequent admission to a nursing home and, effectively, the end of that person's life. Homes have become fortresses, and it is insurance company requirements that have partly caused this. It is very common for insurance companies to require that all doors have deadlocks, that all windows have security screens, as well as other similar requirements before they will renew insurance policies on homes. The fact that these may enhance a building's safety from break and enter but reduce personal safety from fire is something that nobody seems to be prepared to come to terms with. More recently, there has been a growing fear in the community on the subject of home invasion. In Queensland, within the last few days, we have all learned of a horrendous crime where a man of 59 was attacked in his own home-it appears by two people-and stabbed to death. A few weeks ago an elderly lady in a nursing home was murdered for the contents of her purse-the princely sum of $20. Whilst these home invasions may be relatively few in number, the great fear that they are invoking in the community is very real. In my experience, without a doubt, the greatest deterrent to crime is the fear of caught. These days there is plenty being said in the newspapers and on the airwaves on the subject of the leniency of the legal and sentencing system. I appreciate that that is a responsibility of the Commonwealth government. However, I have been dismayed to learn that the Commonwealth government denies cooperation to state law enforcement agencies and is effectively assisting perpetra- them. tors of crime. Specifically, suspected offenders for whom an arrest warrant has been issued are sheltered by the Commonwealth government from detection and apprehension. I have been told by police officers that warrants for arrest have been issued-for example, in the state of Queensland-for people who are suspected of mUltiple offences. These people skip off interstate. It is suspected that they are receiving social welfare. But the Department of Social Security, by not providing the information as to where these people may be living, absolutely denies cooperation to police forces. The police may suspect that offenders are living in a particular state. They may be able to say to the Department of Social Security that they have good reason to believe that these offenders are receiving social welfare benefits and are in a particular state, but the department refuses to give the police addresses for the service of arrest warrants. I find this absolutely incomprehensible, and I think the average honest citizen would do likewise. Surely it must be the ultimate offence to honest, hard working members of the community who have been victims of crime-who, for example, have had savings stolen or who have had stolen from them goods they have worked hard to pay for-to have to pay taxes which provide social welfare benefits for the very people who committed those crimes against them. I urge the government to look at this issue with a high degree of priority. All too often the Commonwealth government says that law and order is an issue that it is not properly involved in-or, if they are involved, only at the fringe. Surely this issue goes to the heart of the possibility of apprehending, and therefore stopping, criminals. One can surely being imagine the lark for these people who must think the rest of the community are fools: not only are these criminals being sheltered behind provisions of an act which were meant not to protect innocent people, but they can go on robbing their victims by claiming social welfare, secure in the knowledge that the police force in the state in which they have committed their crimes simply cannot reach Japanese Encephalitis",91
187,Mr DODD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak on the outbreak of Japanese encephalitis on Badu Island, in the Torres Strait in my electorate. In April this year, the first reported cases of illness from Japanese encephalitis were identified on Badu. Three members of the community of Badu presented with this disease. Tragically, two of these people, one a young boy, later passed away as a result of this infection. I extend my condolences to the community and particularly to the families of these people. The virus has been isolated from the mosquito Culex annularostris, the common mosquito for this region. The preferred breeding habitat for this mosquito is ponded stagnant water with high organic content-for example, decaying vegetation or animal or human faeces. A study of the island revealed prolific breeding sites for these mosquitoes, particularly along the esplanade and the foreshore. The virus is borne by animals, and pigs are known to be the amplifying hosts with the spread of the disease. All the pigs on Badu Island were identified as carrying the disease. Of a control group of approximately 200 people tested on the island, about 35 were identified as having been infected with the virus-although only three presented with symptoms. There are about 800 people living on Badu, so as much as a quarter of the population may already have been infected. However, Badu Island is not the only place the disease has been identified in the Torres Strait. All northern islands-Boigu, Dauan and Saibai-have had infection in both people and animals. People have been infected in Badu, Mabuiag and Moa, and the disease has been identified in animals on Yorke, Stephen and Darley islands. There are a number of environmental health determinants that should not be understated in the spread of this disease. Badu Island and the other Torres Strait islands have a unique environmental, social, cultural and economic structure that is found nowhere else in the world where this disease has been identified. Of particular concern is the concentration of vectors-that is, mosquitoes-amplifiers-that is, stagnant water-and housing and people in small areas confined by beaches and hills. That is exactly the Torres Strait terrain. The Badu Island community is built over soils with a high water table. There are indications that this water table is between seven centimetres and 70 centimetres beneath the surface. This is a serious concern for two reasons. Firstly, water ponding within swampy surface areas and within existing defective drains gives rise to numerous breeding sites for mosquitoes. Secondly, this high water table increases the opportunity for surface pollution from household septic tanks and subsequent breeding sites from surface ponding of nutrient-rich water. Several septic tanks and effluent disposal systems situated around the community were inspected and found to be defective, also resulting in surface ponding of nutrient-rich breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Irrespective of Japanese encephalitis, this ponding of partially treated human sewage should not be acceptable in the 1990s. There have been a lot of reports and discussion about the lack of infrastructure such as sewerage in the Torres Strait. The pigs and horses that currently live within the community also present a large problem. Pigs, particularly, produce a large amount of manure and effluent which will promote potential breeding sites during the wet season. It is believed that the disease may have first entered the Torres Strait either through birds or on wind-borne mosquitoes from Papua New Guinea. There is no indication at the moment as to when the disease, which appears to be a natural phenomenon, as opposed to an imported problem, will again re-enter the Torres Strait, but the likelihood of the problem recurring during the wet season creates a need for urgent action. During the current sittings, I will be speaking to my parliamentary colleagues the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) to assess the level of assistance that can be provided for this medical emergency. The responsibility lies with all levels of government. I know that the Badu Community Council-and I have spoken to the chairman, Joey Nona, and his deputy, Jack Ahmat-is willing to help in any way, but the resources of such. community councils are limited. I must praise the community council for its concern in the matter and its vigilance in raising the problem, which is definitely a concern for Badu and also a concern right throughout the Torres Strait. The responsibility for primary and preventive health care clearly lies with the Queensland government, and the Queensland tropical health unit is certainly on the job, but all levels of government will need to act as soon as possible to ensure that the people of Badu do not suffer any more tragedies such as this. The disease has already led to the dreadful loss of two members of this tight-knit community.",92
188,Mr CLEARY,ADJOURNMENT,"On 31 March 1995 I wrote to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) concerning allegations in a report, 'The hidden cost of fashion', that the use of exploitative outwork was rife in the fashion industry in Australia. The report, commissioned by the Department of Industrial Relations, cited a figure of 300,000 outworkers and painted a picture of Dickensian dimensions. Accordingly, I asked the minister to: . . . investigate the level and extent of sweated outwork, determine whether any government industries were using outworkersthere were plenty of claims accordinglyand reassess the effects of tariff cuts on industry. It came as no surprise when the minister responded with claims that his data implied that there were around only 30,000 persons employed in outwork and that he did not consider that an independent inquiry would help in dealing with what he described as a complex matter. If it is such a complex matter, why is the state member for Pascoe Vale-five months after I wrote to the minister and raised the issue in the parliament-running around the place claiming that TCF outworkers are being exploited, essentially because of the abolition of state awards? I know that the member for Melbourne would not believe that. The reasons are obvious. The facts are that right-wing Labor apologists such as 'Toady' Thomson are too scared to point the finger at the federal government and demand an industry policy designed to help the unemployed in the old heartlands with real employment. To claim that exploitative outwork is the product of the abolition of state awards when neither the union nor the minister for industry believes it to be the case is fraudulent. Even Joan Kirner, despite the fact that she was Premier at the time, had enough courage to tell the Keating government that its tariff policies were opening the way for an increase in TCF imports and a decline in employment in that sector. Funnily enough, the member for Pascoe Outworkers Vale is the same bloke who, prior to the Wills by-election, was saying privately, as he chewed on my ear, that tariff cuts were a big issue locally and the reason why TCF workers were being retrenched in their droves. It shows what an opportunist the member for Pascoe Vale is and how little he cares for the working people of the northern suburbs. He knows that the real reason why TCF workers are being exploited is that their jobs are diminishing and that the government has failed to provide alternative employment for those who have lost their jobs . The facts are that, although TCF exports have increased, imports have increased to record levels and factory based employment has decreased while outwork has increased. If the TCF the member for Pascoe Vale is going to be nothing more than an obsequious apologist for free market policies and the excesses of free trade, he has no right to represent working people. I hear the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) saying, 'Hear, hear.' Furthermore, if he is so concerned about outwork, why is he not taking up the issue with the federal minister and telling him that his figures of 30,000 are wrong? If the jobs in the TCF are not going to come back, apologists like the member for Pascoe Vale and the right-wingers ought to stop deceiving working people and demand federal policies designed to give people secure work. The reason Mr Thomson does not take a more critical and objective position on the developments in the TCF sector is that he does not want to raise the ire of the party bosses. In the 1988 state election campaign, Mr Thomson went on record as saying that tariff reductions would only make the industry more competitive. Surprise, surprise! He should try telling that to a retrenched textile worker. It is no wonder that he wants to blame Jeff Kennett for unemployment in the TCF sector. It is no wonder that Jeffrey Kennett is the best thing the Labor Party has going for it in Victoria. It is no wonder that Jeff Kennett gets blamed for absolutely everything. I agree with the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) that Jeff Kennett is terrible and shocking and is doing great harm to Victoria-his Tower of Babel on the Yarra is an absolute disgrace-but, dear me, the federal Labor Party has to take some responsibility for unemployment in the TCF sector and take some serious responsibility for putting those people back into serious work. National Association of Forest Industries",94
189,Mr TANNER,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to raise what I consider to be a very dubious use of public money. It involves funds contributed by the Commonwealth government which appear to have been partly used for political purposes by the National Association of Forest Industries. The funds consist of a grant from the Forest and Wood ment. Products Research and Development Corporation of $25,000 to NAFI for research on 'public perceptions of independent certification', which involves labelling timber with respect to environmental sustainability criteria. With NAFI to provide $23,000, the overall project costs roughly $48,000. The objectives of the Forest and Wood ly released. Products Research and Development Corporation are to invest in research which may develop or enhance sustainability, stimulate value adding, enhance market opportunities, improve technology and promote best pracIt tice, et cetera. They are all perfectly reasonmarketing able. It is funded by an industry levy and from the Commonwealth for every $2 raised from that levy. The corporation funds projects on a joint venture basis, usually providing 30 to 60 per cent of the total cost. This project is entitled 'independent certification' and is described thus in the corporation's annual operational plan: The corporation is supporting a project to look at the form such a certification system might take to maximise the advantage of the outcomes from sustainability indicators project. The certification project is being managed through the NAFI Certifiare cation Committee. In fact, thus far, the project has consisted one major opinion poll on attitudes to forest issues. I have a copy of a report on the outnot comes of this poll which was presented to the NAFI board on 16 May. Most of the questions which it refers to are purely broad political questions designed to elicit information to assist NAFI in campaigning against the environment movement. I will give some examples. Some 83 per cent of those questioned said that the government should come out publicly with a balanced forest policy and implement this policy. Some 67 per cent responded that the government should set up an independent inquiry into forest issues headed by a prominent Australian. Some 52 per cent said that most forest management in Australia is better than what happens in other countries. Some 52 per cent said that the Commonwealth government should take over the prime responsibility for forest conservation manageSome 36 per cent said-no doubt this is even more alarming for NAFI-that environmental groups should be given the responsibility of managing Australia's forests. Perhaps those last two responses give some indication as to why the results of this opinion poll have not to the best of my knowledge been publicThe definition of 'research and development' in the act allows funding to be spent on activity that is incidental to the primary focus. includes things such as marketing and analysis. However, the detailed $1 project application of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation specifies that the project must be of net benefit through cost savings or general economic benefits, through the provision of new export markets or environmental improvements, or through a reduction in land degradation. That is something which I do not think the opinion polling to which I have referred really has much connection with. The connection is very tenuous at best. the Even if the opinion polling was only about the specific purchasing of timber products that labelled in a particular way-which it was not-the connection is obviously a little bit of remote from the primary purpose of the corporation. One could well ask why it did deal with the real issues associated with certification, such as ISO 14,000, the Montreal process and the Forest Stewardship Council-all of which are very worthwhile initiatives relating to the question of timber from sustainable sources. Even though a minority of Commonwealth funds are involved in the project-roughly about $8,000-and clearly some of the quesvery tions do have some tenuous connection with the charter of the research and development corporation, it seems clear to me that the Forest and Wood Products Research and The Development Corporation funding has in and enjoy life. effect been used to bolster political opinion polling by NAFI. Given that NAFI is repreto sented on the board of the corporation which makes the decisions and which approves funding, this in my view is a very dangerous commingling of puhlic and private moneys Australia and may constitute a possible misuse of government money. The Worldwide Fund for Nature and I have written separately to the Minister sources (Mr Beddall) asking him to investigate and to ensure that this sort of thing will not happen again and that these sorts of things are clearly separated. People who support the timber industry often attack the environment movement when it gets funding to undertake research, but in this case we have a situation where funding, in my view, has been misdirected and misused by NAFI in order to assist its political purposes. I on the minister to ensure that this situation properly investigated and that these things not occur again in the future. Cystic Fibrosis",95
190,Mr LIEBERMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to raise a matter on behalf of the people in Australia, especially the children, who suffer from cystic fibrosis. As you probably know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Cystic Fibrosis Association has been endeavouring to perWednesday suade the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), the government the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to include on the available health care pharmaceutical benefits list a drug that having a dramatic and beneficial effect in respect of the treatment of this disease. It particularly helpful to children. The drug is known as pulmozyme. If you have any knowledge of cystic fibrosis, you will know that the average life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis is 30 years of age. Children with the disease spend an enormous amount of time in hospital. They develop pulmonary infections and pneumonia. This is disruptive to their education and their lifestyles. I am not an expert, but I am told by families with children who have used the drug that the effect on their lifestyle is dramatic. children are able to stay out of hospital The current cost of this drug is prohibitive most families. In fact, regrettably it costs $1,300 per month. The fact is that the pharthe maceutical board has not issued any new medication for cystic fibrosis sufferers in in the last 30 years. The sufferers of cystic fibrosis have been endeavouring to have this drug considered and approved by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Comfor Remittee for a long time. The reason I have been anxious to raise this issue tonight is that I understand the committee is meeting on Wednesday this week. I am hoping that the committee and the minister for health will at last make a decision that will support the inclusion of this drug on the list and help these kids who deserve help. I am quite sure that the cost of $1,300 a month call would not be begrudged by Australian taxpayis ers. I have spoken to a lot of people about do this. I am sure there is an enormous amount of support on both sides of the House. I plead with the minister for health to devote her time tomorrow to talking with the chairman of the committee and to make a statement indicating any problem at all so we will know why the committee cannot approve this drug and, hopefully, overcome that problem before the committee meets on . We can then bring this drug into the available stream for the children who will and particularly benefit from it.",96

The following answers to questions were circulated: Australia Council (Question No. 1092) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Comdefined munications and the Arts, upon notice, on 3 Lettable May 1994: What projects did the Australia Council fund the Sydney metropolitan area in (a) 1989-90, (b) 1990-91, (c) 1991-92 and (d) 1993-94 and what was the (i) expenditure, (ii) location and purpose of each project. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australia Council has provided a list relevant projects for 1989-90, 1990-91, 1991-92, 1992-93 and 1993-94 with details of each grant. this list is voluminous, a copy has been provided separately to the honourable member. Department of Administrative Services: (Question No. 1780)  istrative Services, on notice, on 17 November 1994: (I) What are the details including the (a) value, (b) use, (c) tenant or occupant, (d) office floor (i) leased or occupied and (ii) vacant and (e) rental rate per square metre of each office , comconfidence mercial or industrial property owned by the effect Minister's Department and each agency, statutory authority or government business enterprise which the Minister has portfolio responsibility. (2) What are the details including the (a) pant, (b) total floor area leased, (c) total floor vacant and (d) base rental rate per square metre of sheets. each office, commercial or industrial property leased by the Minister's Department and each agency, statutory authority or government business enterprise for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility.",97
193,Mr WALKER,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable to member's question is as follows: (I) Details on Commonwealth owned office, commercial and industrial properties managed Australian Estate Management, a part of my conclusions Department, are contained in the attached spreadthe NA sheet. They include information on leases by other portfolios in these properties. For your information, the floor area of a property as vacant consists of all parts of the Net Area not currently exclusively leased to a specific tenant. The rental per square metre is an in average derived by dividing total building income by the total occupied area. Total building income includes rent received for office and storage space, (iii) some common areas, car parking and signage rights, but excludes payments received from tenants for outgoings. You will note that there are no capital valuations for the Terrica Place and Kununurra offices. These of buildings have only recently been completed and valuations are under way. Furthermore, in a number As of single-tenanted buildings the average rent has not been provided where the tenant considered that the disclosure of that information might have an adverse effect on current or future property dealings by the Commonwealth. Property That reason for withholding of information is fully in accordance with the ""Guidelines on the Disclosure of Commercially Sensitive Property which I have recommended to all departments and agencies. The Guidelines are based on the principle that details of rents paid by Commonwealth agencies and information on capital area valuations of specific Commonwealth-owned base properties should be withheld as commercial-inwhere disclosure might have an adverse on current or future property dealings by the Commonwealth. They identify particular circumfor stances where that principle may apply. (2) Details on properties leased by my Departoccument and portfolio agencies from non-Commonarea wealth owners are shown in the attached spreadThe details are provided in an aggregated format at building level because of the commercial-inconfidence nature of the property data. Where a building is occupied by a single Commonwealth business unit, the rental rate is withheld in accordance with the Guidelines referred to in my answer Part 1 of the question. The particular circumstance applicable in these cases is that where disclosure of rentals paid by Commonwealth by businesses would allow competitors to draw about cost structures, thereby placing Commonwealth at a commercial disadvantage. , ;; Tuesday, 22 August 1995 I';' PART (1) Address NA NA DepotADFA 310,000 Depot Duntroon 200,000 Depot Fyshwick 2,800,000 Depot Jervis Bay 280,000 Dairy Flat Road Complex 8,000,000 Depot Kingston 1,000,000 Nth Canberra Archive Re- 5,000,000 pository Printing Office-Kingston 8,000,000 Royal Australian Mint 10,300,000 Sth Canberra Archive Re- 2,680,000 pository 3-5 National Circuit 21,800,000 0 Acton House 5,400,000 0 Administrative Building 53,000,000 0 Albemarle Building 15,500,000 0 Alexander Building 15,250,000 0 ANZAC Park East 19,800,000 0 ANZAC Park West 23,500,000 0 ANZAC Park West Cafeteria 450,000 0 Benjamin Offices 65,000,000 0 Borrowdale House 5,000,000 0 Cameron Offices 65,000,000 0 Campbell Park Offices 67,000,000 0 Casey House 940,000 0 Chandler Building 40,000,000 0 Deakin Offices 21,000,000 0 East Block 8,100,000 0 REPRESENTATIVES 91 NA NA A.

(2) Is it also a fact that the planned date for the commencement of Radio JJJ transmission to the mid-north coast of New South Wales has been abandoned; if so, why. (3) When will the mid-north coast of New South Wales receive Radio JJJ. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. After the facility was substantially completed, the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) advised the National Transmission Agency (NT A), which has installed the FM radio transmission facility, that a frequency suitable for widecoverage transmission in the GraftonlKempsey area is not available. (3) The NT A facility will be able to begin transmitting to the GraftoniKempsey area shortly after the ABA makes a suitable frequency available. This will depend on frequency planning processes for which the ABA is responsible. Ross River Fever (Question No. 1937) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 2 February 1995: (1) How many persons suffered Ross River Fever in each year since the disease was first diagnosed. (2) What is the geographic spread of the cases referred to in part (1). (3) What progress has been made on research into the disease.

194,Dr LAWRENCE,AECTOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Outbreaks of Ross River virus disease have been reported throughout Australia since the isolation of the virus in the 1960s. However, no accurate records on the number of affected persons were available until 1991, which was the time the disease became notifiable on a national basis. In 1991 there were 3420 reports of the disease Australia wide, 5790 in 1992, 5360 in 1993 and 3838 reports in 1994. In 1995 there have been 988 reports of disease up until 11 May. (2) Major epidemics of Ross River virus infection have been reported in all States and the Northern Territory predominantly in areas associated with large bodies of water that provide suitable breeding grounds for mosquitoes. In northern Australia, particularly in coastal regions, the virus is active throughout the year. Elsewhere in Australia, virus activity tends to be epidemic following summer rains and/or tidal inundation. (3) In recent years, progress has been made in documenting the variable nature of the clinical symptoms of disease as well as the interpretation of relevant blood findings. This has enabled general practitioners to better diagnose the disease. Since 1991 national surveillance of Ross River virus has been useful in alerting public health authorities to impending epidemics and outbreaks so that preventive or control measures can be instituted. Research into establishing which mosquito vectors are most important for the transmission of the disease has enabled better preventive measures to be formulated. Research into the development of vaccine(s) for Ross River virus is continuing. (4) The treatment of patients with acute Ross River virus infection is non-specific and aimed at relieving painful symptoms such as muscle and joint pain. Specific antiviral agents presently available have not been evaluated for use in the treatment of this condition. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport Curfew Hours (Question No. 2068)",121
195,Mr CONNOLLY,AECTOTAL,"the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 27 February 1995: Have any aircraft been authorised since January 1994 to arrive at or depart from Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport outside curfew hours; if so, in each case, (a) what was the make of the aircraft, (b) which company did it belong to, (c) what was the date and time of each arrival or departure, (d) were all arriving aircraft requested as a condition of landing not to use reverse thrust and (e) why was arrival or departure outside curfew hours authorised.",122
196,Mr BRERETON,AECTOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It is assumed that the question refers to aircraft movements at Sydney Airport during the hours of 23:00-06:00, ie, movements that occurred within the curfew period. The curfew arrangements at Sydney Airport are set out in the Air Navigation (Aerodrome Curfew) Regulations made pursuant to the Air Navigation Act 1920. The provisions of the curfew regulations are in force every night from It.OOpm to 6.00am the following morning. The main features of the curfew are: (1) only runway t6R can be used for take-offs and 34L for landings (ie, over Botany Bay). If those runways are not operationally suitable then the aircraft must either divert or remain on the ground; (2) these restrictions do not apply to aircraft in emergency conditions or the Air Ambulance aircraft operating as Urgent Medical priority; (3) no domestic passenger aircraft are permitted; (4) international passenger aircraft are permitted a maximum of t4 movements (landings or takeoffs) per week, with 4 on anyone night, between 11.00pm and midnight; (5) international passenger aircraft are permitted a maximum of 42 landings, with a maximum of 8 on anyone night, between 5.00am and 6.00am; (6) noise certificated propeller aircraft and small Chapter 3 jets which have been gazetted in accordance with the Curfew Regulations are permitted to operate without restriction on numbers of operations; and (7) large jet aircraft carrying freight are permitted to operate, subject to the following quotas: Ansett Australia Ltd is permitted 28 BAe 146 movements per week; Mayne Nickless Limited is permitted 12 DC9 movements per week. However, this aircraft type is to be phased out by 30 April 1996, and from 1 May 1996, Mayne Nickless will be permitted 18 BAe146 movements per week; and National Jet Systems Pty Ltd is permitted 28 BAe146 movements per week. There is provision in the Regulations for aircraft operators to seek a special dispensation for operations in exceptional circumstances during the curfew hours by applying to one of the three CAA officers who have Ministerial delegation. There have been 12397 movements at Sydney Airport during the period 1 January 1994 to 28 February 1995 during the hours 23:00--06:00. (a) Records of the curfew movements for the period 1 January 1994 to 28 February 1995 are available, but as the information is too lengthy for incorporation in Hansard a copy has been provided to the honourable member. Additional copies are available from the House of Representatives Table Office. (b) See (a) (c) See (a) (d) The Air Navigation (Aerodrome Curfew) Regulations have specific rules in relation to operators using reverse thrust during curfew hours. Regulation 10(1) states ""Where an operator of an aircraft is aware that the aircraft would, on landing at the Aerodrome, require the use of reverse thrust that is greater than the idle reverse thrust, the operator must not, in the flight plan lodged in respect of that aircraft, plan to land that aircraft during a curfew period."", and Regulation 10(2) states ""If an aircraft uses reverse thrust at greater than idle reverse thrust while landing at the Aerodrome during a curfew period, the operator of the aircraft must, no later than 7 days after the land; 19, give a reverse thrust return in respect of the landing to the Secretary or an authorised person."" (e) The regulations allow for movements by certain categories of noise certified aircraft. Details of those categories are set out in the introduction to this answer. Logging and W oodchipping (Question No. 2079) Mr Jones asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 27 February 1995: (1) How many (a) compartments and (b) coupes were logged in Australia in (i) total and (ii) each State and Territory in (A) 1990, (B) 1991, (C) 1992, (D) 1993 and (E) 1994. (2) What details are available of the tonnage logged in each State and Territory in (a) 1990, (b) 1991, (c) 1992, (d) 1993 and (e) 1994. (3) What percentage of the total tonnage of trees logged in each State and Territory in (a) 1990, (b) 1991, (c) 1992, (d) 1993 and (e) 1994 was converted to woodchips. (4) Is there a significant variation among the States and Territories in the proportion of the harvest converted to woodchips; if so, to what aspect of forest management can the variation be attributed. (5) What percentage of total woodchip production was exported in (a) 1990, (b) 1991, (c) 1992, (d) 1993 and (e) 1994. (6) What percentage of Australia's total timber production came from plantations in (a) 1990, (b) 1991, (c) 1992, (d) 1993 and (e) 1994. (7) What percentage of woodchip production came from plantations in (a) 1990, (b) 1991, (c) 1992, (d) 1993 and (e) 1994. (8) If the bulk of timber harvested in any State or Territory is woodchipped, can it be described as residual harvesting. Q2 Total Roundwood removals The figures used in the table above are expressed exclude firewood removals, sawmill residues used of woodchips and recycled waste paper. Sawmill residues collected waste paper at 928 kilotonnes for the year 1993-94 are preliminary only. Q.3 Woodchip Production (a)! Total Production Q.5 Woodchip exports! Woodchip production (a) Q.6 Plantation production (b)! Total production Q.7 Plantation woodchip (d)! Total wood chip production (a) (a) Woodchip production is defined as pulpwood for the paper and paperboard, particleboard, (availability of sawmill residues is estimated at sawn timber removals [GRWE]). (b) Assumes that currently as the quantity of removals from broadleaved plantations 94 are based on ABARE's estimates of production. (9) What was the average selling price per tonne of (a) woodchips and (b) saw logs in (i) 1990, (ii) 1991, (iii) 1992, (iv) 1993 and (v) 1994. (10) Is it a fact that there are high rates of woodchip production relative to saw log production despite a significant price discrepancy; if so, what is the economic rationale for the situation. Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)-(3) and (5)-(7) The information sought in each of these questions relates to the responsibility of State and Territory forestry agencies rather than the Commonwealth, and is generally not readily available in either the national or disaggregated form that has been requested. I would note however, that the Commonwealth, and in particular, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) publishes nationally aggregated statistics relevant to questions (2), (3), (5), (6) and (7). This information is drawn from a range of sources including the Australian Bureau of Statistics, state and territory forest services, ABARE estimates and private industry sources. These follow: 1989-90 1990-91 1991-92 1992-93 1993-94 ('000 m3) ('000 m3) ('000 m3) ('000 m3) ('000 m3) 17,563 16,590 16,650 17,633 na in gross round wood equivalent (GRWE).

Korean War: Medals and Decorations (Question No. 2089) Mr Martyn Evans asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 28 February 1995: (1) Were any national servicemen awarded medals or decorations for service in Korea.  member's question is as follows: (1) The Army and Air Force did not send National Servicemen to Korea. (2) Navy personnel serving under the Royal Australian Naval Reserve (National Service) often spent various periods overseas. Navy is unable to confirm from available records whether National Servicemen served in RAN Ships in Korean Waters 1951-1957. To identify such personnel would require a manual examination of each service card as well as the ship's ledgers for the period. This task would involve substantial staffing resources with associated costs, the expenditure of which cannot be justified. The honourable member may be interested to know that 4 784 Naval personnel; 10 657 Army personnel and 905 RAAF personnel served in the Korean conflict-a total of 16 346 Australian personnel. Of those personnel, 67 Naval personnel, 263 Army personnel and 142 RAAF personnel (tota! of 472) were awarded honours and awards of various types ranging from the George Cross through to Mention in Despatches. sawmill residues (availability of sawmill residues is sawn timber removals [GRWE]). not readily available on a State by State basis from of woodchips taken from any area for export will policies and forest management practices, the determine the proportions of sawlogs and non-saw log conditions in woodchip markets. used to describe State and Territory harvesting of operations intended to produce sawlogs.

197,Mr CONNOLLY,AECTOTAL,"the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 28 February 1995: Did the Minister's Department pay Business Retreats Australia for courses or conferences; if so, in each case, (a) what was the reason for the event, (b) on what date was it held, (c) what was the venue, (d) what was the itinerary and program, (e) will the Minister provide an itemised list of the costs as they appear on each account for (i) conference facilities, (ii) accommodation, (iii) associated travel and (iv) other expenses (f) how many, (i) officers and (ii) spouses attended, (g) what was the branch and level of each officer who attended, (h) what sum was paid on travel allowance to attendees and (i) what was the (i) sum involved and (ii) reason for any other costs associated with the events. Mr Baldwin-The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Yes. Details in relation to the remainder of the questions are as follows: (a) The reason for the event was an Induction Course for fifty-two new case managers who commenced in the Onshore Refugee Program of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs on 10 November 1994. (b) From 14 November to 22 November 1994 (excluding week-ends) and from 30 November to 2 December. (c) The course was conducted at the Wesley Centre, 220 Pitt Street and participants were accommodated at the Golden Gate Hotel, 169-179 Thomas Street, Sydney. (d) The course commenced each day (Monday to Friday) at 8.45 am and concluded at 5.00 pm. The three week course was Phase 1 of a seven phase training program designed to provide case mangers with the skills and knowledge required to assess and determine applications for protection visas. The program was structured in such a way that five major themes were developed throughout the content of the course. These themes were linked to the Key Result Areas of the Corporate Plan and the Program Management Plan. Each interrelated theme covered all aspects of case management, departmental policies and best practice procedures. The program was presented by a range of people from the Department, UNHCR and non-Government organisations.

UNESCO Convention on the Recognition (Question No. 2115) Mr Jones asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 2 March 1995: (1) Which states were represented at the International Conference of States with a View to Adoption of the Regional Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and Degrees in Higher Education in Asia and the Pacific which was held in Bangkok from 12 to 16 December 1983. (2) On what date and in what context did Australia last raise the question of ratification or accession with each of the states referred to in part (1) which have not become parties to the Convention. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Member States; Australia, Bhutan, China, Democratic Kampuchea, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, India, Japan, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Turkey. Non-Member States: Holy See, Brunei (2) Australia has not formally raised the question of ratification or accession with each of the States referred to in part (1) which have not become parties to the Convention, since 1990. Flying Fruit Fly Circus (Question No. 2138) Mr Lieberman asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 7 March 1995: (1) Is it a fact that the Flying Fruit Fly Circus has not obtained a funding commitment from the Government for 1995-96 and beyond and that funding will be reduced by 60 per cent. (2) Will the Government fund the Circus from cultural funding allocations to replace funding withdrawn by the Department of Employment, Education and Training; if not, why not. (3) Is the Circus a significant national cultural asset worthy of the same recognition as flagship companies attracting Commonwealth cultural funding. (4) Has he or his Department discussed the future of the Circus with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and their Departments; if so, (a) who was involved, of Studies (b) what issues were canvassed and (c) what was the outcome. (5) What action will the Government take to ensure the Circus continues. (6) Is it a fact that in 1994 the Australian Opera performed before approximately 300 000 persons and received Commonwealth funding of $7.7 million and that the Circus performed before approximately 248 000 persons and received Commonwealth funding of $90 000. (7) Will the Government fund the Circus on the same basis as other national arts training institutions; if not, (a) why not and (b) is he able to say by what other means it can be funded. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. The Flying Fruit Fly Circus has been allocated Commonwealth funding for 1995 by the Australia Council for its performing activity and by the Department of Employment, Education and Training for its training activity. In addition, my Department has provided a one-off grant of $30 000 to the Circus in 1994/95 to enable an independent review of the Circus to be undertaken. This review will include an analysis of all funding options available to the Circus, including private sector options, and will result in a report to the company and the Commonwealth by September on an appropriate long term financing structure for the company. At this stage few cultural organisations have guaranteed commitments to funding for 1996 and beyond. It is therefore premature to state that funding for the company will be reduced by 60 percent. (2) Future funding arrangements for the Circus will depend partly on the outcome of the review mentioned in the answer to question (1) above. (3) Assessment of the company's artistic achievements is carried out by the Australia Council, at arm's length from Government. I am advised by the Australia Council that the Flying Fruit Fly Circus is an important institution of artistic standing that carries out significant work in circus performance and training. (4)(a)-(c) I have met the company's Artistic Director, Mr Charles Parkinson, twice in recent months for discussions of the company's funding position. I  matter with members of my staff and officers of my Department, members of the Prime Minister's staff, and officers of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. The matter has been further discussed by these officials, staff of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, and officers of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. (5) See answers to questions (1) and (2) above. (6) No. Commonwealth funding for the Flying Fruit Fly Circus in 1994 was $230 850, of which $113 580 was provided by the Australia Council, $80 000 by the Department of Employment. Education and Training, and $37 270 by Playing Australia. (7) No. (a) It would be a major jump for the Circus to be funded on the same basis as institutions such as NIDA and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School. These are tertiary bodies which have been developed through an exten3ive educational accreditation process, have a national focus and draw from the best students nationally. and provide a range of courses targeting students in differing stages of development, including mid-career, specialist and outreach programs. (b) See answers to questions (1) and (2) above. LEAP Program (Question No. 2231) Dr Kemp asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 27 March 1995: (1) Is a person required to be receiving either the Job Search or Newstart allowance before entering the LEAP program. (2) What is the target for commencements in LEAP in 1994-95. (3) How many commencements were there in LEAP during 1994. (4) How many commencements in LEAP have there been in 1994-95 to the date of answering this question. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) At the time of the Government's White Paper on Employment and Growth, Working Nation, a broad indicative level of 12,700 LEAP places was set for 1994-95. However, under the case management approach to client assistance, the actual final level of commencements will depend on client needs and decisions by case managers on the type of assistance required by clients. (3) 9,277. (4) There have been 10,887 LEAP commencements during the period 1 July 1994 to 26 May 1995. Based on contracts now signed with LEAP brokers, the number of commencements in the full financial year will exceed 12,000. Methadone (Question No. 2249)  Services and Health, upon notice, on 28 March 1995: (1) Is she able to provide the numbers of deaths attributable to methadone in each State and Territory in each year since 1989. (2) Is she further able to say what percentage of the deaths referred to in part (1) were of persons undergoing methadone treatment. (3) How many methadone clinics are operated (a) in total, (b) privately for profit and (c) at public expense, in each State and Territory. (4) How many clients are registered at methadone clinics in each State and Territory. (5) Is a person applying for methadone treatment as a heroin addict required to (a) obtain a doctor's referral confirming the addiction and (b) undergo testing at a clinic to confirm the addiction; if so, what tests are conducted. (6) Is it possible for persons not addicted to heroin to be accepted into a methadone program. (7) What qualifications are required by an authorised methadone dispenser to vary the dosage. (8) Are the qualifications referred to in part (7) consistent with standard medical practice. (9) Do nurses vary the dosage of methadone administered under methadone programs. (10) Was a takeaway methadone program introduced; if so, (a) when, (b) has it been evaluated; if so, (i) when and (ii) with what outcome, (c) after what period from registration can a methadone user graduate to the takeaway program and (d) what auditing is conducted. (11) Can methadone users register at a number of clinics; if not, what safeguards prevent it. (12) What is the (a) maximum quantity and (b) median dosage of methadone dispensed at clinics. (13) Is she able to say whether the street price for methadone is one dollar per mil. (14) Has the quantity of methadone dispensed by clinics which is ultimately sold on the streets been investigated; if so, what percentage of dispensed methadone is ultimately sold; if not, why not. (15) Has her Department recommended that takeaway programs be abandoned. (16) Would the abandonment of takeaway programs significantly reduce the quantity of subsidised methadone sold on the streets. (17) Has the success of methadone programs in Australia been studied recently; if so, (a) when and (b) with what outcome. (18) Is it a fact that methadone is administered orally but clients are provided with syringes; if so, why.",124
198,Dr LAWRENCE,AECTOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. The numbers of deaths attributable to methadone are available for the following States: South Australia-38; Tasmania-5 The figure for South Australia includes those whose deaths could be attributed to either methadone syrup or methadone tablets. (2) No. The percentage of the deaths referred to in part (1) being persons undergoing methadone treatment is available for Tasmania: Tasmania-20% Such percentage analysis is available for South Australia for the years 1993 and 1994. In those two years, there was a total of 24 deaths attributable in part to methadone and of those 12.5% (3 victims) were known to be on methadone treatment. (3) Total number of clinics in each State or Territory: New South Wales--4I; Queensland-9; South Australia-2; ACT-2; Tasmania-2; Western Australia. I; Northern Territory-O Total-57 Victoria did not provide any information. Number of private clinics in each State or Territory: New South Wales-IS; Queensland-O; South Australia-O; ACT-0; Western Australia-O; Tasmania-O; Northern Territory-O Total-IS Victoria did not provide any information. Number of public clinics in each State or Territory: New South Wales-26; Queensland-9; Tasmania-2; South Australia-2; ACT-2; Western Australia. I; Northern Territory-O Total--42 Victoria did not provide any information. In addition to clinics, NSW has 290 community pharmacies which participate in the NSW Methadone Program. Queensland has 22 General Practitioners who are authorised to treat clients and prescribe methadone at their private practices, although dispensing of the prescriptions is by community pharmacies. The ACT has a number of community pharmacies which are authorised to administer methadone according to prescriptions which have been issued by an authorised General Practitioner within the ACT Methadone Program. Tasmania has no private clinics, only private General Practitioners who are authorised to prescribe methadone. The Northern Territory does not have a methadone program. The Victorian methadone programs make use of private General Practitioners and private community pharmacies. (4) The number of clients registered at methadone clinics in each State and Territory as reported in the week 10-13 April 1995: New South Wales-5475; Queensland-2071; Western Australia-901; South Australia-739; ACT-325; Tasmania-I13; Northern Territory--O Total-9624 Victoria did not provide any information. (5) (a) In all States and Territories where methadone maintenance treatment is available, any person who applies for such treatment is initially assessed by an appropriate registered medical practitioner as being suitable for commencing a methadone treatment program. Procedural details differ slightly within and between States and Territories, who are responsible for the supervision and administration of services. (b) The National Policy on Methadone does not require separate testing at a clinic to confirm a medical practitioner's assessment of a client's drug dependent status. (6) The National Policy on Methadone includes guidelines for admission into methadone treatment and notes that methadone treatment is suitable only for those individuals who are dependent on opioids, including heroin. The States and Territories use the National Policy as a basis for their own program guidelines. However, administration is a matter for the States and Territories and I do not have details on individual service admission procedures. (7) Methadone is listed under Schedule 8 of the ""Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons"". According to the ""Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons"" (October 1994), Schedule 8 drugs are poisons to which the restrictions recommended for drugs of dependence by the 1980 Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs should apply. Appropriate individual Acts and Regulations apply in each State and Territory. In all States and Territories where methadone treatment is available, methadone can be prescribed only by a registered medical practitioner (a methadone prescriber). In all States and Territories where methadone treatment is available, methadone can be dispensed, or administered, only by a registered medical professional. This includes medical practitioners, pharmacists and nurses. Medical professionals who dispense methadone are not permitted to vary the dosage without appropriate instructions from an appropriate methadone prescriber. (8) Yes. (9) Yes, in some clinics, but only under special circumstances. In some clinics, when clients commence on methadone treatment, protocols exist whereby the authorised prescriber includes on the prescription a daily dose which allows for variations of up to 20 mgs during the period of treatment stabilisation. In these circumstances, nurses responsible for dispensing the methadone may decide to vary the dose only within the limits specified on the prescription. (10) Each State and Territory has its own policy on takeaway methadone doses, except the Northern Territory which does not have a methadone program. The takeaway programs operate according to the guidelines set out in the National Policy on Methadone, and within the legislative requirements of each jurisdiction. (a) A national takeaway program has not been introduced. Such programs are a State and Territory responsibility. However, in 1991, National Methadone Guidelines were distributed for use by the States and Territories in formulating their policies and programs. Included were guidelines for the provision of takeaway methadone doses. (b) No, there has not been a national evaluation of methadone takeaway programs. The National Methadone Committee is currently coordinating a review of the guidelines for takeaway dosing in the National Policy on Methadone. New South Wales is undertaking a specific review of the takeaway methadone program in that State. Tasmania is reviewing methadone policy applicable in that State, including the policy on takeaway dosing. (i) The National Methadone Committee review commenced in 1995. The NSW review commenced in 1995. The Tasmanian review commenced in 1995. (ii) None of the reviews has yet been completed and no results are available. (c) The National Policy on Methadone specifies that clients should have been in treatment for at least two months before takeaway doses are provided. Jurisdictions have adopted varying periods before clients can graduate to takeaway programs. However, it is my Department's understanding that jurisdictions generally comply with the guidelines included in the National Policy on Methadone. (d) Generally, the 'auditing' of takeaway doses is conducted according to the normal requirements for Schedule 8 drugs. State and Territory legislation requires records to be kept of the issuing of any Schedule 8 drugs. (11) Concurrent registering at more than one clinic is not permitted. A range of controls safeguard against such practices, including the maintenance of centralised client records in each jurisdiction. However, in special circumstances, a prescriber may authorise a client to collect daily methadone doses from more than one site. Such circumstances include where the client is an itinerant worker and will not be able to collect doses from one site on all occasions. In such cases, the prescriber will specify the days and sites for the collection of doses. (12) (a) Maximum single dosage of methadone dispensed, according to each State and Territory: South Australia-No absolute ceiling, although dosage is rarely greater than 150 mgs per day New South Wales-No absolute ceiling Queensiand-IOO mgs ACT-IOO mgs Tasmania-Three separate regions Northern Region-160 mgs Southern Region-140 mgs North West Region-120 mgs Western Australia-lOO mgs In Queensland, ACT and Tasmania, application can be made to the relevant authority for an increase in maximum dosage on an individual basis. Victoria did not provide the information. The Northern Territory does not have any methadone programs. (b) Median dosage: Median daily dosage of methadone dispensed at clinics: South Australia-65 mgs New South Wales-59.6 mgs Queensland-50 mgs Tasmania; Three Regions: Northern Region-60 mgs Southern Region-70 mgs North West Region-50 mgs Western Australia-50% of clients dose between 30 mgs and 50 mgs ACT and Victoria did not provide the information. The Northern Territory does not have any methadone programs. (13) There are anecdotal reports that methadone can be purchased at this price. (14) There is no information available to answer this question. Determining the amount of methadone which is being sold illegally in any jurisdiction would be as difficult as determining the amount of heroin which is being sold illegally. Statisticians in many jurisdictions both here and overseas have not been able to develop a reliable instrument for making such a determination. (15) No, my Department has not recommended that takeaway programs be abandoned. The National Methadone Committee is currently coordinating a review of the guidelines for takeaway dosing in the National Policy on Methadone. The outcome of the review is not yet available. Reviews of methadone policies, including takeaway dosing, are also under way in New South Wales and Tasmania. (16) It is not possible to answer this hypothetical question for reasons similar to those in part (14). To date, there has been no definitive link between the provision of takeaway methadone doses and any movement in the availability of black market methadone. (17) (a) During 1993 and 1994 several studies were conducted which examined aspects of methadone maintenance treatment programs in Australia. One study currently under way is examining the criminal behaviour of clients of one Australian methadone program. (b) The studies did not examine the effectiveness of methadone maintenance programs; however, they did examine specific outcomes of methadone treatment: survival rate, continued opiate use, and retention in treatment. According to the studies, participation in methadone treatment increases the survival rate of heroin dependent people by a factor of three; also, that people who participate in methadone treatment programs do significantly reduce their opiate use; and that people who remain in methadone treatment do progressively reduce their criminal activity. Although the current study on criminality is not yet complete, preliminary results indicate a marked decrease in criminal at;tivity among methadone maintenance participants. Between 1969 and 1991, various studies were conducted in other countries including the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, Hong Kong and Bangkok. These studies consistently showed that methadone maintenance treatment does produce positive outcomes for participants by having a substantial impact on the drug use (including injecting drug use and the sharing of injecting equipment), criminal behaviour and mortality of opiate dependent people. It is reasonable to translate these results to Australian programs, particularly where treatment procedures are consistent with those overseas. (18) Yes, methadone is administered orally, both in syrup and tablet form. Some clinics provide a needle exchange service to injecting drug users. In keeping with the strategy of harm minimisation, some clinics dispense syringes to those clients who may otherwise be exposing themselves to harm through continued unsafe injecting practices. The syringes are not provided in order that clients may inject methadone. Such practices are strictly discouraged by all clinics as being extremely dangerous. General Practitioners Rural Incentive (Question No. 2284) Mr Anderson asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 9 May 1995: (1) How many doctors have been relocated to regional centres or rural towns under the general practitioners rural incentive program. (2) Where is each doctor referred to in part (1) located. (3) How many doctors have (a) received training grants and (b) received or had approved remote area grants under the program. (4) Where is each doctor referred to in part (3) located. (5) How many doctors relocated under the program no longer reside in the town to which they relocated. (6) What is the average period for which doctors relocated under the program have resided in the towns to which they relocated. (7) What sum was (a) allocated to and (b) spent on, the program in each financial year since its inception.",127

(3)(b) As at 17 May 1995,27 remote area grants have been approved. There are also a further two applications being processed. (4) Doctors referred to in 3(a) are located in the following communities (by State): NSW Kempsey VIC Leongatha; Warragul; St Arnaud; Foster; Mildura; Traralgon QLD Atherton; Townsville SA Orroroo; Wudinna WA Australind; Karratha; Newman; Kununurra; Broome; Esperance; Busselton Collie NT Nhulunbuy; Elcho Is; Alice Springs Doctors referred to in 3(b) are located in the following communities (by State): NA Balranald; Brewarrina; Collarenebri; HillstonILake; Cargelligo NA Omeo; Ouyen NA Cherbourg NA Leinster; Leonora; Mt Magnet; Norseman; Ravensthorpe; Southern Cross; Tom Price; Wiluna NA Kimba; Peterborough; Cummins; Karoonda NA Dover Year 1992-93 1993-94 1994-95 1995-96 Withdrawal from Treaties (Question No. 2285) Mr Slipper asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 9 May 1995: Further to the answer to question No. 1330 (Hansard, 19 October 1994, page 2341), what procedures exist for withdrawing from treaties which contain no provision for withdrawal. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The situations in which a party may withdraw from a treaty which contains no provision for withdrawal are set out in Section 3 of the Vienna NORTHERN TERRITORY (TOP END) Borroloola; Numbulwar; Galiwin'ku (2 grants); Nguiu (2 grants) NORTHERN TERRITORY (CENTRAL AUSTRALIA) Ampilatwatja; PintupilKintore; UrapuntjalUtopia NB: The number of grants and the number of communities may not necessarily correspond because some of the grants are split between GPs. (5) There are four doctors who no longer reside in the town to which they received funding for relocation. (6) The GPs who are approved to receive a relocation grant agree to remain in the rural practice for a minimum of two years on accepting the grant. The GPs who received the first grants are only now completing this two year commitment period. Most of the applicants claim that they intend to stay for longer periods. As stated in the answer to question 5, only four of the applicants have left before this two year period. (7) In establishing a comprehensive program such as this one, there is always a lag in allocating the funding while the vital planning takes place to ensure that the implementation will achieve the desired outcomes. The changing of the Budget from August to May shortened the period for Program expenditure in 1993-94. These figures represent expenditure for all the components of the Program. Allocation Expenditure $8m $O.4m $15.1m $1.7m $15.3m $9.0m (Year to date-31 May 1995) $15.2m o Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969) (Australian Treaty Series, 1974 number 2). A party may withdraw from a treaty which contains no specific withdrawal provision where it is established either that the parties intended to admit the possibility of denunciation or withdrawal, or where a right of denunciation may be implied by the nature of the treaty. A party withdrawing from such a treaty is required to give at least twelve months' notice of its intention to withdraw from the treaty. This procedure covers so-called unilateral withdrawal from a treaty. The Convention also provides for withdrawal where all the treaty parties have been consulted and consent. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties also deals with certain exceptional cases in which a party may claim that it is not bound by the treaty. Those cases relate principally to situations where there was a defect in the party's consent to be bound, or where the party alleges the treaty is invalid. In such cases, the Convention requires the party wishing to withdraw to notify the other parties of its claim to the right of withdrawal. If no objection to the claim is raised within three months, the party may withdraw from the treaty in question by communicating an instrument indicating its intention to the other parties. If another party does object, the parties are required to seek a solution to the issue in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. Martin, Mr Francis (Question No. 2294) Mr Sharp asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 9 May 1995: Is Mr Francis Martin an employee of the Civil A viation Authority; if so, (a) what are his duties, (b) what overseas travel (i) has he undertaken and were: (ii) will he undertake in 1995, (c) with respect to each instance of travel (i) undertaken or (ii) to be undertaken, what are the (A) points of origin, (B) destinations, (C) flight numbers, (D) class of ticket booked, (E) class of seat travelled and (F) cost travel for each flight and (d) what was or purpose of each overseas trip.",130
200,Mr BRERETON,TASMANIA,"The answer to the honourreference able member's question is as follows: The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has advised that it has no record that Francis Martin is, or has been, an employee of the CAA. Training and Operational Manuals (Question No. 2295) Mr Sharp asked the Minister upon notice, on 9 May 1995: (I) How many different operating manuals were Boeing. used for training and operational purposes by Ansett International for Boeing 747 crew in the months between the commencement of flight Training training and an incident involving an Ansett Boeing 747 aircraft on 19 October 1994. (2) Was the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) aware of (a) changes to operating procedures used in Boeing 747 cockpits at Ansett International during the 3 month period and (b) allegations that changes were being notified to crew members by placing them under their hotel doors during periods; if so, what action did the CAA take. (3) Were the training courses which were ed to Boeing 747 crew condensed to allow for rapid introduction of the aircraft. (4) Were the manuals approved for Boeing 747 crew training the same as those under which the crew were operating on 19 October 1994. (5) Were approved check and training manuals being used at the (a) commencement of training and (b) time of the incident on 19 October 1994. (6) Was the CAA aware of deficiencies in the training given to Ansett Boeing 747 crews; if so, what action did it take. (7) Were concerns raised within the CAA about the preparation and training of the Ansett Boeing 747 crews.",132
201,Mr BRERETON,TASMANIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Civil Aviation Authority has provided the following advice. (1) Two manuals were prepared for training and operational purposes by Ansett Australia over the 3 months period between the commencement of flight training and an incident involving an Ansett Boeing 747 aircraft on 19 October 1994. These (i) Operations Manual-Vols 1 and 2. The Operations manual, which was originally supplied by Boeing, was progressively updated by of Ansett in the 3 months prior to 19 October 1994. is the The amendments were made to reflect Ansett Australia's operating philosophy. Other parts of the Operations Manual were amended to include to Boeing 747 aircraft. Operations Manuals are living documents and, as such, it is normal for manuals to be regularly amended. During flight simulator training it was necessary to use some sections of the Qantas Operations Manual for the reason that Ansett Australia's aircraft are fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines and the ground/endorsement training was being conducted by Qantas in flight simulators configured for for Transport, Rolls-Royce engines. (ii) Flight Crew Training Manual issued by As well as referring to this manual, it was 3 necessary to refer to some sections of the Qantas Manual during simulator training because the Qantas flight simulators have a different engine configuration to Ansett Australia aircraft. 2(a) The CAA was aware of the changes to operating procedures during the 3 month period. (b) The Authority is aware of one occasion only on which changes to operating procedures were duty placed under the hotel doors of Ansett crew members. This occurred in September 1994 during the ground conversion training of Ansett pilots by providQantas. Personnel attending the course were the accommodated at the Sheraton Sydney Airport hotel. Ansett developed new operating procedures related to push-back, starting and taxiing of aircraft and associated checklists. Ansett intended to hand the new procedures to the trainees for their use at the next session of training. As some trainees were not available to receive the procedures, the documents were placed under their hotel doors. The CAA does not consider this incident to be an act of negligence as the entire course was aware that the procedures were to be changed and were waiting for their issue. The only action taken by the CAA in relation to this incident was to verify that the procedures, which were not published on Ansett Australia letterhead, were approved by Ansett Australia. (3) No. (4 ) Yes. The manuals used for crew training were the same as those under which the crew were operating on 19 October 1994 although the content of the manuals did change over this period as mentioned in the answer given to Part 1. (5) Yes. (6) The CAA was not, and is not, aware of deficiencies in the training given to Ansett Boeing 747 crews. (7) Yes, there was some initial concern within the CAA that insufficient time had been allocated by Ansett Australia for flight crew training prior their planned commencement of operations on 4 September 1994. Flight crew ground conversion training commenced on 20 June 1994 allowing only 2.5 months to complete this training. However, the concern was allayed when Ansett announced its decision to use former Qantas and Air New Zealand Boeing 747 captains under contract to conduct the line training of Ansett crew and to act as training captains on flights for the first few months of line operations. NA New South Wales Albury Armidale Ashfield Auburn Ballina Balranald Bankstown Barraba Bathurst Baulkham Hills Bega Valley Bellingen Berrigan Bingara Blacktown As an additional safeguard, it was agreed that the CAA would supervise the first of the line check flights given to Ansett Australia crews by the check captains. Road Funding to Local Government Authorities (Question No. 2299) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 9 May 1995: What sums were allocated by the Commonwealth for local roads to each local government authority in Australia in (a) 1988-89, (b) 1989-90 and (c) 1990-91.",132
202,Mr BRERETON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Commonwealth did not allocate sums for local roads directly to local government authorities in 1988-89, 1989-90 or 1990-91. The Commonwealth allocated sums for local roads to States and to the Northern Territory for distribution pursuant to principles submitted by the State and Northern Territory Governments after consultation with local government authorities and approved by the Commonwealth Minister. The attached tables show the amounts of these funds allocated by the States and the Northern Territory to each local government authority based on information provided by the States and the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth Department of Transport.

203,Mr WILLIS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has produced, for many years, annual estimates of labour productivity on the basis of the Australian 1988/89 1989/90 1990/91 Total $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 21 21 37 37 45 45 101 101 63 63 67 67 183 201 360 744 54 54 38 38 47 47 35 35 54 54 80 80 46 46 86 95 295 475 18 18 52 52 70 70 37 37 75 75 55 55 59 59 86 86 109 109 128 128 26 26 Standard Industrial Classification for the following industry divisions: Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting Mining Manufacturing Electricity, gas and water and capital producConstruction Wholesale and retail trade restructurTransport and storage Communication Recreation, personal and other services In addition, annual estimates of labour productivity for sub-divisions of manufacturing have been prepared and made available on request. These comprise: Food, beverages and tobacco Textiles Clothing and footwear Wood, wood products and furniture Paper, etc., printing and publishing Chemical, petroleum and coal products Non-metallic mineral products Basic metal products Fabricated metal products Transport equipment Other machinery and equipment Miscellaneous manufacturing Estimates of capital productivity are not prepared by industry type because it is necessary to have constant price input-output tables, which the ABS does not compile. Accordingly, multifactor productivity estimates (which measure the combination of capital and labour productivity) are prepared only at the aggregate level for the market and non-farm market sectors. There is a wide range of information available to Government on industry in addition to that provided by productivity measures. The research and analysis undertaken by the Bureau of Industry Economics, the Bureau of Communications and Transport Economics, the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and the Industry Commission mean that Australia has a wealth of information to draw upon in formulating industry policy.

(2) Do other ASC commissioners serve on boards of major business enterprises. (3) Does the Government restrict persons serving the ASC from holding external directorships.",156
208,Mr LAVARCH,FUNDING FOR WORLD HERITAGE AREAS,"The answer to the honourindicate able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) I am advised that no other members ASC serve on boards of major business (The Commission consists of members, not commissioners.) (3) No. The possibility of appointees holding such corporate. positions was envisaged by Parliament in enacting the disclosure provisions of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989. Section 124 of the Australian Securities sion Act 1989 requires that members (other than the Chairperson) of the ASC must disclose interests they have, which could conflict with the proper performance of their function in relation to determembers mining a matter, to the Chairperson. On any occasion when a member facing a conflict of interest does not abstain from participatSecurities ing voluntarily, the Chairperson is empowered direct the member not to take part or not to continue to take part in determining the matter. member must comply with the direction. Even when the Chairperson does not so direct, the munity. member may not take part or continue to take part unless everyone concerned in the matter consents. If the member facing a conflict of interest situation is the Chairperson, then he disclose the interest to the persons concerned and may only take part or continue to take part if everyone in the matter consents. The interests to which section 124 refers are direct or indirect pecuniary or other interests. In addition, the Chairperson is required by section 123 of the Australian Securities CommisMay 1995: sion Act 1989 to give written notice to the Attorney-General of all direct or indirect pecuniary interests that he or she has or acquires in, or body corporate carrying on, a business carried on in Australia. If a member of the Commission, when performments ing a function as a Commission delegate, is quired to consider a matter in which he or she has a direct or indirect pecuniary or other interest, then he or she must forthwith notify the Commission in accordance with section 125 of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989. Contravention of section 123, 124 or 125 without reasonable excuse is a ground for termination of a member's appointment. Examination of the ""Who's Who"" entries of the original appointees to the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC), the regulator under the co-operative companies and securities scheme, during the administration of the Fraser Government that two considered their occupations to be ""Director"". In fact, both were directors of significant public companies. One was a managing director while the other had a successful career during of the his term as a member of the NCSC, becoming enterprises. Chair of some of the companies. The Australian Securities Commission is not the only current regulatory body, the members of which may retain their positions as directors of bodies As to State regulatory bodies, section 110 of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 of New South Wales, for example, expressly makes provision for officers of the Commission to Commiscontinue to hold positions in corporations. In the case of the Securities and Investments Board of the United Kingdom, almost all of its retain public company directorships at the same time as their membership of the Board. In Canada, part time members of the Ontario Commission may hold office as a to Director, after written notice to the Chairman. Thus the Australian Securities Commission is not The alone in the approach taken to the continued involvement of its members in the business comIt is this Government's view that this is the appropriate approach if we are going to be in a position to appoint suitably qualified people to or she must serve on regulatory bodies. Australian Service Medal 1939-45 (Question No. 2340) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 11 (1) Did all Australian service personnel who served during the World War II qualifying periods in a receive the Australia Service Medal 1939-45. (2) Is it a fact that since 1975 all Australian service personnel who met the eligibility requirehave received the Australian Active Service reMedal, the Australian Service Medal or both. (3) How many Australian service personnel who served on active service between 1945 and 1975 have not received the Australia Service Medal. (4) Where did the persons referred to in part (3) serve. (5) Did the criteria for awarding the Australia Service Medal change for personnel serving after 1975, if so why. (6) Is it a fact that service medals have been awarded to some personnel but not others solely on the basis of the times and operations in which they participated; if so why.  member's question is as follows: (1) All Australian Service personnel who have met the qualifying conditions of 18 months full time service, or three years part-time duty by members of the Volunteer Defence Corps, in Australia or overseas, between 3 September 1939 and 2 September 1945, and who have claimed their awards, have received the Australia Service Medal 1939-1945. (2) All Australian Service personnel post-1975 who have met the eligibility criteria to qualify for the Australian Active Service Medal, the Australian Service Medal or both, and who have claimed their awards have received them. The honourable member may be interested to know that following the Government's acceptance of the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards (CIDA), approval for the establishment of the Australian Service Medal 1945-75 (ASM 1945-75) was received from the Queen on 22 February 1995. Its purpose is to recongise service in certain non war-like military operations during the period 1945-1975 where recognition has not been previously extended through an award. The ASM 1945-75 will fill the gap between the ASM 1939-45 and the current Australian Service Medal (1975 onwards). (3) No Australians have received the Australian Service Medal 1945-1975 for active service as this medal will be awarded for non-warlike operations only. Approximately 74,506 personnel served in the Korean War 1950-1953, in South East Asia (Malaya, Borneo etc) 1948-1966 and in the Vietnam War 1962-1973. The total number of Service personnel is approximate as the figures have been distilled from a number of sources which themselves contained inconsistencies. (4) Active Service during the period 1945-1975 where eligibility for Imperial Awards are applicable are Korea 1950-1953, South East Asia (Malaya, Borneo etc) 1948-1966 and Vietnam 1962-1973. (5) No. The Australian Service Medal 1945-1975 was instituted after recommendation of the recent Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards to recognise retrospectively nonwarlike service for this particular period in line with the current Australian Service Medal post1975. Both these medals are awarded for service in non-warlike operations. (6) Personnel are awarded medals in recognition of their service provided that they meet the qualifying conditions applicable to each award. The recent Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards, accepted by Government, notes .... ""there will always be people who just miss out on awards because they fail to meet the qualifying criteria, whether on the basis of designated time, area of operation or because of some other factor."" Department of Employment, Education and Training: Geelong Office (Question No. 2346)",157
209,Mr MCARTHUR,FUNDING FOR WORLD HERITAGE AREAS,"the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 11 May 1995: Does his Department lease office space in Geelong which was unoccupied throughout 1994 and part of 1993; and if so, (a) what is the address of the premises, (b) for what period was the office space unoccupied, (c) what is the area of the office space, (d) what sum was paid on the lease while the office space was unoccupied and (e) was the office space being refurbished; if so, (i) why, (ii) what did the refurbishment cost and (iii) does some of the refurbishment need to be redone. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department leases office space in Geelong that was unoccupied during 1994 and part of 1993. (a) 129 Meyers St, Geelong (b) 1 June 1993 to 9 January 1995. Fitout works commenced on the premises on 30 September 1994. (c) 2,120m 2 (d) At Geelong the Department made lease payments of $201,237 in addition to those reported in the supplementary information to the 1993-94 Annual Report, before the occupation of the building in January 1995. (e)(i)(ii)(iii) The office was fitted out to provide for an effective working environment for the clients and staff, incorporating job seeker servicing (including case management and Employment Assistance Australia), employer servicing, program and operational support services, a Youth Access Centre, a Careers Reference Centre, AUSTUDY lodgement facilities, and accommodation for two regional trainers.

These works are scheduled to be completed by end July 1995. New Work Opportunities Scheme (Question No. 2347)",158
210,Mr MCARTHUR,FUNDING FOR WORLD HERITAGE AREAS,"the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 11 May 1995: (1) What total sum (a) has his Department out laid on projects under the New Work Opportunities Scheme since its commencement and (b) was estimated to be outlayed when the scheme commenced. (2) Was the scheme intended to operate in remote and rural areas and not within metropolitan and major provincial centres. (3) Would proposed projects in the Geelong region qualify for assistance under the original eligibility rules for the scheme. (4) Has his Department altered the eligibility rules to include proposed projects in regional centres such as Geelong; if so, how was the decision publicised. (5) Are proposed projects in the Geelong region eligible for funding under the Operation Restoration program. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) and (b) The New Work Opportunities (NWO) program began in 1994/95 and as at 26 June 1995, a total of $80.68m has been spent on the program. Contracts totalling $199.2m have been signed for 624 projects (some 16,250 work experience and training places). When the program was announced in Working Nation, it was estimated that expenditure would increase to $495m a year by 1996/97. With the introduction of case management and a focus on achieving individual client employment outcomes, through both subsidised and unsubsidised placements, this level of funding is an indicative figure only. (2) NWO is one means of enabling the Job Compact to be delivered to eligible jobseekers, especially in areas where employment opportunities are limited, including rural and remote areas. NWO operates in metropolitan and major provincial centres as the assistance offered under the program may be the pest option for meeting the needs of jobseekers who are unable to obtain mainstream employment. (3) Projects in Geelong would qualify if they meet the following criteria. The project must: be only for Job Compact clients or other eligible clients, provide 26 weeks work experience and training for each participant, provide additional places (and not replace existing jobs), include suitable training, accredited where possible, be located in regions where Job Compact clients live, be of worthwhile value to the Community, and provide adequate structures for the supervision and monitoring of participants. (4) No. The Department has not altered the eligibility rules in relation to the location of NWO projects. (5) Funding for New Work Opportunities Australia Remembers projects (also known as Operation Restoration) is available across the nation. Women's Health: Surveys (Question No. 2359)",159
211,Mr CAMERON,FUNDING FOR WORLD HERITAGE AREAS,"the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 29 May 1995: (1) How many surveys on women's health has her Department undertaken since 1992. (2) With respect to each survey referred to in part (1), (a) who conducted it, (b) what were they paid, (c) what was the survey's name, (d) why was it conducted, (e) what were its results, (f) what was its total cost, (g) what action was taken by her Department as a result and (h) what was the cost of that action.",159
212,Dr LAWRENCE,FUNDING FOR WORLD HERITAGE AREAS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Twelve surveys on women's health have been undertaken by the Department of Human Services and Health since 1992. (2) Developmental research (April 1994) (a) Stancombe Research and Planning (b) $116,565 (c) Developmental research for the communication strategy for the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer. (d) Qualitative and quantitative research to explore attitudes, behaviour and knowledge of women 30-70 regarding breast cancer screening as well as exploring these issues among GPs and other health professionals. (e) Almost all GPs (over 90%) claimed to be using each of the three main methods for breast screening, with 98% claiming to encourage selfexamination, 97% using clinical examination and 93% preferring mammograms. It was not determined how active they are with each method nor of which they are a proponent. More women aged 30-70 were concerned about breast cancer than any other major health issue. Despite two thirds of women (69%) being able to identify the fact that the risk of breastcancer increases with age, their knowledge of what age groups are most at risk was limited. Less than one in five (17%) were able to correctly identify women over 50 as most at risk with the largest proportion (34%) believing it to be women over 40. (f) $116,565 (g) A communications campaign aimed at increasing awareness of the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer and encouraging women 50-69 years to screen for breast cancer was developed and launched in February 1995. (h) The budget for the campaign was $2.54 million in 1994-95. This included research, development of campaign materials and a media buy of approximately $2 million. Benchmark Survey (February 1995) (a) Woolcott Research (b) $24,800 (c) Benchmark survey for the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer Campaign (d) Before the launch of the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer campaign, a national telephone survey of women aged 25-69 was conducted to gain a measure of attitudes, intentions and behaviours to use as a benchmark. The primary target for the campaign is women aged 50 years and over, with a secondary target market of women aged 25-49 years. (e) Of those surveyed, 43% named breast cancer as a major health problem. It was perceived that women over 40 years were most at risk of developing breast cancer (31 %). A majority of women aged 25-69 reported that their personal risk of developing breast cancer in the future was either 'none at all', 'very slight' or 'slight'. Fifty one per cent of the target audience (women 50-69) reported that they are currently having breast xrays/mammograms. (f) $27,500 (g) This survey provided a base against which to monitor the impact of the campaign. (h) The budget for the campaign was $2.54 million in 1994-95. This included research, development of campaign materials and a media buy of approximately $2 million. Breast cancer Tracking Research (April 1995) (a) Woolcott Research (b) $32,500 (c) Tracking research for the National Campaign for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer. (d) To monitor the progress of the campaign against the stated objectives. (e) Key differences between the benchmark and tracking survey were: An increase in awareness of recent information on breast cancer screening mammograms (56% to 69%). An increase in agreement that 'breast cancer increases with age' (70% to 78%). An increase in awareness that women aged over 50 years were most at risk at developing breast cancer (18% to 28%). An increase in unprompted awareness and prompted awareness of the National Program For the Early Detection of Breast Cancer (45% to 53% and 70% to 83% respectively). An increase in perception that the National Program is about early detection (15% to 21%) and encourages women to have regular mammograms (5% to 15%). (f) $32,500 (g) Results will be used to develop strategies for phase 2 of the campaign (1995-96) (h) The cost of the second phase is approximately $2 million. National Screening Attender Survey (a) The survey was conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in conjunction with an officer from the Department of Human Services and Health. (b) $30,800 to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (c) National Screening Attender Survey 1993 (d) The survey was conducted to assess the extent to which participants are satisfied with services provided under the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer, as part of the formal evaluation of the first phase of the Program. (e) The survey collected information on the following dimensions of satisfaction: convenience and accessibility of service; physical surroundings; perceived technical competence of staff; information transfer; staff interpersonal skills; and general satisfaction. The results indicated that the levels of satisfaction were very high (over 90%) on all of the above dimensions. (f) $35,394.61 (g) Public reporting of the results as part of the Interim Evaluation Report, 1 July 1991-30 June 1994; and the results have been used to provide feedback to the Screening and Assessment Services on consumer satisfaction with Program services. (h) The cost of (g) was minimal. NA UNDERTAKEN SINCE 1992 Service Providers Research (February 1992) (a) MSJ Keys Young (b) $35,000 (c) Evaluation of an Education Strategy Targeting Service Providers of Cervical Cancer Screening (d) To assess the effectiveness of the booklet ""Screening for the prevention of cervical cancer"". Qualitative research found that most service providers had received a copy of the booklet and were positive about it as a means of presenting the cervical cancer screening policy. (e) The quantitative research showed that 25% of service providers interviewed had changed their cervical cancer screening practices in the last 12 months. Among this group, 34% of females and 11 % of males reported screening less often (as recommended). The major reason given for a change in screening practice was exposure to the information booklet. The proportion of providers recommending biennial screening (in line with the policy guidelines) has increased from 45% in 1991 to 59% in 1992. (f) $35,000 (g) A communications strategy was developed and as a result the Screening for Cancer of the Cervix Campaign was implemented. The Campaign aimed at increasing awareness of the Pap Smear Test, and encouraging women between the ages of 18-70 years to undergo screening every two years. The campaign included the distribution of educational materials to GP's. Television and magazine advertisements, posters and brochures all aimed at women aged 18-70 years were also produced. (h) The cost of the action undertaken included $277,180 from the 1991-92 Budget. The 1992-93 campaign budget was $1,752,800. This sum included research and development of campaign materials as well as the media buy. Research to assess attitudes toward frequent cervical cancer screening (May 1992) (a) Stancombe Research and Planning (b) $25,000 (c) Qualitative research into factors leading to annual (or more frequent) cervical screening among women aged 18-70. (d) This qualitative research explored reasons why women currently screen more frequently than the cervical cancer screening policy recommends. (e) Women have previously been told that this test should be carried out annually and for many it has become an habitual part of regular yearly health checks. There was, however, a large degree of misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the test. Few participants were aware that cervical cancer screening may prevent and not just detect cancer, and many believed that a pap smear will detect other problems such as sexually transmitted diseases. (f) $25,000 (g) A communications strategy was developed and as a result the Screening for Cancer of the Cervix Campaign was implemented. The Campaign aimed at increasing awareness of the Pap Smear Test, and encouraging women between the ages of 18-70 years to undergo screening every two years. The campaign included the distribution of educational materials to GP's. Television and magazines advertisements, posters and brochures all aimed at women aged 18-70 years were also produced. (h) The cost of the action undertaken included $277,180 from the 1991-92 Budget. The 1992-93 campaign budget was $1,752,800. This sum included research and development of campaign materials as well as the media buy. Purchase of data from the national health survey (August 1992) (a) Australian Bureau of Statistics (b) $2,850 (c) Cervical Screening Practices of Australian Women Aged 18-64 (d) To identify the cervical screening practices of Australian women aged 18-64 to determine the influence of factors such as age, cultural background and occupation on screening rates. (e) 86% of women aged 18-64 years of age reported having ever had a pap smear test. Of these, almost half reported having a test in the last 12 months. 33% reported having a test 1 to 3 years ago and 17% had not been tested in the last three years. Of those women who had not had a pap smear, 30% reported they had not heard of the test. (f) $2,850 (g) A communications strategy was developed and as a result the Screening for Cancer of the Cervix Campaign was implemented. The Campaign aimed at increasing awareness of the Pap Smear Test, and encouraging women between the ages of 18-70 years to undergo screening every two years. The campaign included the distribution of educational materials to GP's. Television and magazines advertisements, posters and brochures all aimed at women aged 18-70 years were also produced. (h) The cost of the action undertaken was $1,752,800, the 1992-93 campaign budget. This sum included research and development of campaign materials as well as the media buy. Pre-testing Research to evaluate creative concepts for the Screening for the Cancer of the Cervix Campaign (October 1992) Phase 1 - a) Stancombe Research and Planning (b) $29,500 (c) Pre-testing research to evaluate creative submissions for the Screening for Cancer of the Cervix Campaign. (d) Provide qualitative information on the effectiveness of creative materials submitted by four advertising agencies.

(2) On what dates were the reports submitted. (3) Will the most recent report be presented to Parliament.",165
216,Dr LAWRENCE,CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING RESEARCH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Article 18 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women {'the Convention') requires State Parties to undertake to submit a progress report to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women {'the Committee') within a year after the Convention enters into force in the relevant State and thereafter every four years. As the Convention entered into force in Australia in 1983, Australia's first periodic report was technically due in 1984 and every four years thereafter. (2) The Committee accepted Australia's first periodic report in 1986. Due to delay in the Committee's consideration of this report, Australia submitted a supplementary report in 1987 and the full report was considered by the Committee in 1988. Australia submitted its second periodic report in 1992. Again, due to the Committee's delay in considering this report, a supplementary report was prepared in 1993. This report was accepted as Australia's third periodic report in 1994. Australia's fourth periodic report is due in 1998. (3) Periodic reports will henceforth be tabled in Parliament immediately after submission to the Committee. The most recent report will shortly be publicly available. Committee on the Rights of the Child (Question No. 2378) Mr Melham asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 30 May 1995: (1) What was the due date for the submission of Australia's initial report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child. (2) On what date will the report be submitted.",165
217,Mr LAVARCH,CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING RESEARCH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 16 January 1993 was the due date for the submission of Australia's initial report to the Committee. (2) My Department has prepared a final draft report which has been sent for comment to relevant Commonwealth Departments and State and Territory Government authorities. The report will be submitted in the near future. Convention on Biological Diversity (Question No. 2379) Mr Melham asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, upon notice, on 30 May 1995: (1) Were New South Wales and Western Australia sent the final draft of the national strategy developed through the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council task force on biological diversity on 19 November 1993. (2) Have (a) New South Wales and (b) Western Australia endorsed the report since the answer to question No. 1727 (Hansard, 31 January 1995, page 135); if so, in each case, when.",166
218,Mr BRERETON,CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING RESEARCH,"The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The final draft of the National Strategy for the Conservation of Australia's Biological Diversity was sent to each State and Territory member of the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council, including New South Wales and Western Australia, on or about 19 November 1993. (2)(a) New South Wales advised its endorsement of the Strategy in a letter dated 20 January 1995. (b) Western Australia has yet to endorse the Strategy. Bilateral and Multilateral Treaties (Question No. 2380) Mr Slipper asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 30 May 1995: (1) Which international (a) conventions, (b) treaties and (c) agreements have not been implemented by federal legislation. (2) Following the High Court decision on the Teoh case, is he able to say what impact the instruments referred to in part (1) have on Australfor Ian domestic law.",166
219,Mr LAVARCH,CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING RESEARCH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am infonned that Australia is currently a party to over 920 bilateral and multilateral treaties (some of which have other titles such as 'convention' or 'agreement'.) These treaties are given effect through Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation and also through executive action. Given the number of treaties, obtaining the information sought by the honourable member would involve considerable resources and time. I am not prepared to authorise the time and resources entailed in collecting this information. However, I draw the honourable member's attention to the answers provided to questions No. 3910 (Hansard, 16 September 1986, page 640), No. 1553 (Hansard, 24 May 1989, page 2882), No. 540 (Hansard, 11 March 1991, page 1743) and No. 1792 (Hansard, 7 October 1992, page 1676). Those answers identify the Commonwealth legislation implementing treaties which has been passed between March 1979 and 14 July 1992. I am also infonned that the information necessary to answer the further similar question No. 2351 is currently being gathered. That question seeks identification of the federal legislation implementing treaties since 14 July 1992. I also draw the honourable member's attention to the material which I am informed was provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in response to a question from Senator Troeth on 29 November 1994 in the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, additional estimates hearing. I am infonned that it contains a list of Commonwealth Acts passed since 1974 which implements Australia's treaty obligations. In relation to the decision of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh, attention is drawn to the joint statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and myself on 10 May 1995. The joint statement provided that entering into an international treaty is not a reason for raising any expectation that government decision-makers will act in accordance with the treaty if the relevant provisions of that treaty have not been incorporated into Australian law. The High Court in the Teoh case made it quite clear that any legitimate expectation arising out of Australia becoming a Party to a treaty could only arise if there had been no executive or legislative indications to the contrary. The joint statement of 10 May constitutes such an executive indication and since that date no treaty to which Australia is a party should give rise to a legitimate expectation the administrative law purposes identified in Teoh's case. The effect of the 10 May statement would be reinforced by the passage of the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1995 which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 28 June 1995. Migration Program: Location Factor (Question No. 2381) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 31 May 1995: (1) In each year for which figures are available, what proportion of new arrivals within each category of the migration program received location factor points. Financial year 1989/90 1990/91 1991/92 1992/93 1993/94 1994/95 Note: figures have been rounded to nearest 100. (2) Preliminary data from the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants in Australia (LSIA) has revealed that 93 per cent of relevant Concessional Family migrants live in the same area as their sponsor some 6 months after arrival. Disability Support Pensions (Question No. 2389)",166
220,Mr RUDDOCK,CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING RESEARCH,"the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 1 June 1995: (1) How many state wards in each State and Territory have been placed on the disability support pension or its predecessor. (2) How often does his Department perform, or have performed, medical reviews of the persons referred to in part (1). (3) What provisions exist for exemption from medical reviews. (4) Are medical assessments made available to the persons assessed; if so, on what basis. (5) What steps does his Department take to review whether state wards have been correctly assessed. (2) Does the Minister's Department monitor the propensity of location points recipients to remain residents of a designated area for a given period; if so, what has the monitoring revealed. Mr Baldwin-The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's Points question: I am advised that: (I) The Concessional Family migrant category is the only points-tested category that has points allocated specifically for location. The following table provides Concessional Family statistical data for each year in which figures are available from the Migration Program Management System (MPMS data base), ie from 1989/90. No. of persons awarded No. of concessional location points and family visas percentage of total visaed 22600 1000 (4.4%) 22500 2100 (9.3%) 18100 2200 (12.2%) 7700 1000 (l3.0%) 9400 l300 (l3.8%) 7700 1100 (14.3%) (6) What provision is made for a second opinion of the assessment if requested by an applicant or his Department. (7) Has Mr Shane Nicholls undergone a medical review since 30 March 1995; if so, have the full details and results of the assessment been provided to him. (8) Is it a fact that Mr Nicholls has received a formal apology from Commonwealth officials for the treatment he has received as a disability support pensioner and an undertaking that action would be taken; if so, what action has been taken in response. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Invalid pension and disability support pension claim forms have never asked if the claimant was a state ward. Therefore it is impossible for the Department of Social Security (DSS) to identify th{' number of former state wards who may be receiving a disability support pension. (2) Persons granted disability support pension since November 1991 are medically reviewed at either 2 or 5 year intervals. Prior to the introduction of the Disability Reform Package (DRP) in 1991, Invalid Pensioners were reviewed at intervals suggested by Commonwealth Medical Officers. Following legislative amendments in the Senate to the legislation covering the DRP only those invalid pensioners with a medical review scheduled were covered by the 2 and 5 year review cycles. (3) Provisions exist to exempt pensioners from medical review who: were granted invalid pension prior to 12 November 1991, and who had no medical review scheduled; have a terminal illness; are in a comatose state and whose prognosis for recovery is poor; are permanently confmed to a nursing home or a nursing home ward of a hospital; suffer an extreme psychiatric or intellectual impairment; or are suffering from another medical condition that means a medical review is clearly unnecessary. (4) Medical assessments may be made available under the Freedom of Information Act. In certain circumstances, such as where it appears that the disclosure of information provided by a medical practitioner might be detrimental to the applicant's physical or mental health or well-being, direct access is not given, but is instead given to a qualified person of the same occupation. A psychiatric report may be withheld where there appears to be a likelihood that release of the report will result in the recipient taking actions that will endanger the life or physical safety of the report provider, his or her staff, or any other person. (5) Former state wards are assessed and reviewed in the same manner as any other customer. This includes not only medical reviews, but also periodic reviews of their income and other circumstances. (6) If the applicant disagrees with a Departmental decision, that applicant is advised of their review and appeal rights which are to: have the decision explained; have a senior, independent, and expert officer take a fresh look at the case; appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal; or see their file under the Freedom of Information Act. (7) Mr Shane Nicholls underwent a medical review by a Commonwealth Medical Officer on 28 April 1995. This review was organised by the Australian Government Health Service, following direct representations to them by Mr Nicholls. A copy of the specialist's report was provided to Mr Nicholls on 2 June 1995. The review has not yet been finalised and Mr Nicholls has not been provided with any further advice or documentation at this stage. (8) See answer to Question (7). Questions about action taken by the Australian Government Health Service should be directed to the appropriate portfolio. Human Rights Committee (Question No. 2392) Mr Hollis asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 1 June 1995: (1) On what dates were Australia's reports to the UN Human Rights Committee (a) due and (b) submitted. (2) Further to the answer to question No. 282 (Hansard, 27 September 1993, page 1174), in what terms did the third report address the decision in the case of Mabo and Others v. Queensland [No. 2J.",167
221,Mr LAVARCH,CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING RESEARCH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) and (b) Australia's first report under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was due in 1981 and was submitted in November 1981. Thereafter, Australia's reports are due every five years. Australia's second report was due in 1986 and was submitted in February 1987. Australia's third report was due in 1991. This report is currently being finalised and is expected to be submitted in the second half of 1995. (2) As I have indicated, the third report is not yet finalised. It will address the Mabo decision. Price Watch (Question No. 2396) Mr Truss asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 5 June 1995: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 906 (Hansard, 20 September 1994, page 1179), what resources were provided in (a) 1993-94 and (b) 1994-95 from federal funds for the operations of Price Watch (i) nationally (ii) in each State and (iii) in each federal electoral division. (2) What sum has been budgeted in 1995-96 for the operations of Price Watch. (3) Who is the Price Watch co-ordinator (a) nationally, (b) in each State and (c) in each federal electoral division.",168
222,Mr WILLIS,CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING RESEARCH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Responsibility for Price Watch was transferred from the Treasury portfolio to the Attorney General's portfolio in August 1993. The Attorney General's Department through the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs (FBCA) provides funding to the National Prices Network Inc (NPN) which functions as the national coordinator of Price Watch activities. The funding provided for NPN in 1993-94 and 1994-95 was $39,000 and $39,800 respectively. These funds were provided to finance the services of the national coordinator based in Canberra and not for the Price Watch Network in any State or Territory. The resources and activities of the Price Watch Network, operating in the States and Territories, is the responsibility of the Minister for Administrative Services. (2) The FBCA's funding allocation for National Prices Network Inc. in 1995-96 is $40,167. (3) (a) The NPN national coordinator is Ms Saras Narsy. (b) The coordinators in the Statestrerritories are: Mr Allan Morris MP, Member for Newcastle, NSW Mr Gavan O'Connor MP, Member for Corio, VIC Mr Wayne Swan MP, Member for Lilley, QLD Senator the Hon Rosemary Crowley, Senator for SA Hon George Gear MP, Member for Canning, WA Hon Duncan Kerr MP, Member for Denison, TAS Hon Warren Snowden MP, Member for the Northern Territory, NT None in the ACT at present, formerly the Hon Ros Kelly MP (c) As mentioned in the response to Question 906 of 10 February 1994, there are no coordinators in each federal electoral division. Consultants: ACTU Guidelines (Question No: 2397) Mr Vaile asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 6 June 1995: Has the ACTU circulated guidelines for unions on the use of consultants engaged in workplace change projects; if so, will he take action to ensure that the independence of industrial consultants used by Australian companies is protected.",168
223,Mr BRERETON,CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING RESEARCH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Neither I, nor the Department of Industrial Relations are aware of any ACTU guidelines for the use of workplace change consultants. The Department's practice is to encourage companies to choose their own consultants when implementing workplace change. It makes no recommendations about which consultants they should use. Fire Brigades: Universal Couplings (Question No. 2399) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, upon notice, on 6 June 1995: Further to the answer to question No. 1379 (Hansard, 21 September 1994, page 1357) has (a) his Department or (b) Standards Australia received advice from the Australian Fire Authorities Council on the latter's willingness to support the development of standardisation of standpipes and male and female couplings; if so, what is the nature of the advice. Mr Lee-The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Australian Fire Authorities Council has not yet advised that it is willing to support the development of the standardisation of standpipes and male and female couplings to either my Department or to Standards Australia. Partner Allowance (Question No. 2404) Mr Wakelin asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 6 June 1995: (1) Will persons receiving the Partner Allowance be (a) classed as unemployed and (b) counted in the official Australian unemployment rate. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) produces official unemployment statistics using definitions of labour force status, which conform to international standards. Classification of a person's labour force status depends on responses to the ABS labour force survey rather than whether an individual is in receipt of income support. Consequently, it is not possible to accurately predict how any individual who is receiving the Partner Allowance will be counted in the labour force statistics. The new Partner Allowance is designed to assist spouses of Social Security Allowees who are aged 40 years or over as at 1 July 1995 and have little or no recent work experience. Recent work experience refers to employment for at least 20 hours per week for a total of 13 weeks or more in the previous 12 months, or 20 hours per week during the week prior to the claim. (Clients who are receiving the existing Partner Allowance prior to 1 July 1995 will not be required to meet the test of no recent work experience). It could be expected that most people who are eligible for the Partner Allowance will be neither working nor looking for work, and hence would be classified by the ABS as not in the labour force. It is possible, however, that some recipients of the Allowance may be employed part-time or unemployed and looking for part-time work. These persons would most likely be currently classified as employed part-time or unemployed and looking for work. Introduction of the new Partner Allowance could be expected, therefore, to have little impact on the ABS labour force statistics. (b) See the answer to (a) above. Any recipients of the Partner Allowance who are classified by the Australian Bureau of Statistics as either full-time or part-time unemployed will be included in the official Australian unemployment rate. Partner Allowance (Question No. 2405) Mr Wakelin asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 6 June 1995: How will his Department list recipients of Partner Allowance in its statistics. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Partner Allowance is identified as a discrete payment category in the Department's statistical publications. The number of partner allowance recipients is shown in the quarterly publication 'Recipients of Pensions, Benefits and Family Payments in Postcode Districts' and in the Department's yearly statistical overview publication. Partner Allowance is not included in the publication 'Monthly Job Search and Newstart Allowance Statistics.' It should be noted that recipients of Partner Allowance, introduced in September 1994, have never been included in JSA/NSA statistics. Partner Allowance is not an activity tested payment and, prior to its introduction, no activity test applied to the partners of unemployed people. Funding to Conservation Groups in Western Australia (Question No. 2408) Mr Campbell asked the Attorney-General, on notice, on 7 June 1995: (I) What total sum has he, his Department or agencies for which he has portfolio responsibility contributed to conservation groups in Western Australia since December 1993. (2) With respect to each instance of funding referred to in part (I), (a) what sum was paid and (b) for what purpose was it paid. (3) What commitments other than those referred to in part (I) has he, his Department or agencies for which he has portfolio responsibility made to fund Western Australian conservation groups until 1997-98 and for what purposes are the funds proposed to be used.",169
224,Mr LAVARCH,CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING RESEARCH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I have been advised by my Department and relevant portfolio agencies as follows: (I) $ 15,000. (2)(a) $ 15,000. (b) Assistance was approved on 16 June 1994 to the South West Forests Defence Foundation Inc (the Foundation). The grant of assistance to the Foundation was in relation to a specific case which satisfied the Guidelines for Financial Assistance in Environmental Cases. This scheme, administered by the Department, enables assistance to be authorised in matters which affect the national interest or such substantial public interest as to be of national concern. (3) None. Office of National Assessments: Budget Allocation (Question No. 2409) Mr Langmore asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 7 June 1995: (I) What was the total budget allocation to the Office of National Assessments (ONA) in each year since 1980-81. (2) What was the (a) increase in, (b) percentage increase in, (c) real increase in, (d) proportion of total budget outlays of, and (e) proportion of GDP of, the total budget allocation to the ONA in each year since 1980-81. (3) What was the increase in the (a) actual allocation to the ONA and (b) real value of the allocation between 1980-81 and 1995-96.",170
225,Mr KEATING,CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING RESEARCH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) & (2) (a), (b) & (c) The total Budget allocation to the Office of National Assessment in each year since 1980-81 is: 80-81 1,595,000 81-82 2,175,000 580,000 82-83 2,274,000 83-84 2,536,000 262,000 84-85 2,733,000 197,000 85-86 2,975,000 242,000 86-87 3,312,000 337,000 87-88 3,543,000 231,000 88-89 3,681,000 138,000 89-90 4,833,000 1,152,000 90-91 7,257,000 2,424,000 91-92 6,332,000 (925,000) 92-93 6,082,000 (250,000) 93-94 6,472,000 390,000 94-95 6,584,000 112,000 95-96 6,690,000 106,000 (2) (d) & (e) The proportion of total budget outlays and GDP is currently estimated at approximately 0.005 and 0.002% respectively and does not vary significantly from year to year.

(2) What were the non-narcotic uses of hemp grown in Australia. (3) Is the Minister's Department cooperating in research into the commercial production of hemp for non-narcotic uses; if so, what are the details. (4) Do Commonwealth laws prevent the commercial production of hemp for non-narcotic uses; if not, what other reasons prevent the commercial production of hemp. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question. As the issues raised in the later parts of the question impact on the earlier answers, he has addressed the question in the following sequential order: (4) In accordance with its international obligations as a party to the Single Convention on Narcotics Drugs 1961, Australia is required to exercise certain controls over trade, cultivation and use of cannabis (or hemp). Whilst the Convention specifically exempts the growing of cannabis for industrial purposes from its control, parties to the Convention are obliged to adopt such measures as may be necessary to prevent the misuse of, and illicit traffic in, the leaves of the cannabis plant. The State Departments of Health are responsible for authorising persons to possess and cultivate cannabis. It is expected that these Departments would do so in consultation with other relevant Departments. The Commonwealth, through the Department of Human Services and Health is responsible for the issue of licences and permits to import and permits to export cannabis including seeds and resin. These controls apply irrespective of the Jet Non-jet Total Jet Non-jet Total arrivals arrivals departures departures departures 311 1020 1669 1125 2794 808 4401 2748 1763 4511 1056 2148 0 0 0 48 77 17 17 34 8 8 0 3 3 5423 4171 9594 5584 4008 9592 Hemp level of active constituents and licences and permits cannot be issued without evidence of compliance with the relevant State or Territory legislation. (3) As outlined above, matters relating to the production of hemp are a State responsibility. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth, as a general rule, is supportive of value adding activities and is funding, through the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC), research into the prospects for a viable hemp industry in Australia. RIRDC is currently finalising details for a feasibility study aimed at providing accurate technical information and an assessment of the agronomic, industrial and marketing potential of an Australian Indian hemp industry for fibre, oil and biomass production. The study will concentrate on the Australian context and will involve extensive consultation with other interested groups. In particular, it will explore how hemp will compete with, or complement, other traditional fibre sources. It will also be looking closely, in a commercial sense, at whether returns are likely to cover the substantial costs of establishing facilities to extract and process the new fibre. The RIRDC study will complement research being carried out in the States. Until recently, licences to cultivate hemp had only been issued in Tasmania where two crops totalling around 2 hectares per year have been grown on a trial basis. The University of Tasmania is responsible for the majority of production with the Tasmanian Hemp Company also involved. These licences include a stipulation that, inter alia, plantings would be used to test viability for production for fibre for both paper and clothing manufacture. The South Australian Minister for Health has now also authorised Primary Industries South Australia and the South Australian Research and Development Institute to grow hemp under strict security on 3 small sites to evaluate several imported cultivars which are deemed to have the best potential under South Australian conditions. Plantings have just commenced and are expected to continue until around September. I am also aware of media reports signalling interest by other States in conducting hemp trials. (I) and (2) As outlined above, the cultivation of hemp is prohibited, apart from small quantities for research purposes, and has been for many years. I am, therefore, not in a position to provide accurate information on production levels or non-narcotic uses of hemp grown in Australia. Canberra National Sculpture Forum (Question No. 2419) Mr Bradford asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 8 June 1995: (1) Did the Commonwealth provide direct or indirect funding to the (a) Canberra National Sculpture Forum '95 and (b) creator of the sculpture entitled Down by the Lake with Liz and Phil. (2) Has he responded to complaints that the sculpture was insulting and offensive to Australia's head of state, her subjects and the other Commonwealth countries of which she is head of state; if so, what was his response. (3) Is he able to say who chose the sculpture for exhibition. (4) Is he further able to say whether any action has been taken against the person or persons who chose the sculpture for exhibition; if so, what action. (5) Will he ensure that further exhibitions do not contain subversive or insulting objects. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) and (b) No. I understand that all funding for the Forum came from the ACT Government. The Forum received no funding from the Commonwealth either through the Australia Councilor the Department of Communications and the Arts. (2) No. (3) The artists and works for inclusion in the exhibition were chosen by the exhibition manager, the Canberra National Sculpture Forum. (4) No. (5) For exhibitions of sculptures and paintings, the Government considers that decisions on the contents of such exhibitions should be left to the exhibition managers. World Conference on Women in China (Question No. 2420) Mr Bradford asked the Minister assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, upon notice, on 8 June 1995: (I) Is she able to say whether compulsory abortion and sterilisation are imposed in the People's Republic of China (PRC). (2) Does the Government support the holding of the World Conference on Women in Beijing; if so, why. 1995 (3) Is the Government making representations to the UN and the Government of the PRC seeking accreditation of organisations which have been denied attendance at the conference, including delegations from Tibet and Taiwan; if so, what are the details. (4) Will Australian delegations attend the conference and non-government organisations forum; if so, who will be selected for the delegations.",173
227,Dr LAWRENCE,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Implementation of China's one-child policy at the local level can result in coercive practices which the Australian Government does not in any way condone. Such coercive practices are however, on the whole, rogue applications of the one-child policy by over-zealous officials at the local level. Through provincial regulations, fines are commonly applied as a sanction to families with more than one-child. But application of the fines, and the onechild policy, is becoming more difficult as social controls in China ease. China's new Maternal and Infant Health Law which came into effect on 1 June 1995 includes provisions that couples with certain medical conditions may not marry unless they undertake long-term contraceptive measures or agree to sterilisation. In the case of certain prenatal diagnoses the physician may advise the parents to terminate the pregnancy. However, the law stipulates that any termination requires the signed consent of the person concerned. The need for consent is welcome although the way the law is implemented is clearly critical. The Australian Government has made clear on many occasions that coercion has no place in family planning programs. We support the provision of safe, voluntary family planning services in the interests of women's health and family well being. Australia will uphold these principles at the forthcoming World Conference on Women as we have done at previous international forums. (2) Yes. The People's Republic of China is a Member State of the United Nations and has equal rights with other Member States to host a United Nations Conference. (3) The Australian Government supports the right of all women, including Taiwanese and Tibetan women, to attend the Fourth World Conference on Women. The Australian Government has made representations to the United Nations to ensure that the process of accreditation of NGOs, for which the United Nations has responsibility, is a transparent one and that the criteria are applied consistently to all organisations seeking accreditation. At the 39th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (MarchiApril 1995), Australia cosponsored a resolution calling on the United Nations to ensure that its NGO accreditation process was transparent. Later, the General Assembly, with the support of Australia, passed a similar resolution. The United Nations' Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is formally responsible for accrediting NGOs to the Conference. The ECOSOC is currently meeting to consider NGO accreditation. Australia will continue to pursue at ECOSOC its support for the right of all women to attend the conference. Once ECOSOC has made its decision, the Government will consider what further action, if any, would be appropriate. (4) The Australian Government will send a delegation to the Fourth World Conference on Women. The composition of the delegation was announced on 26 June 1995. The delegation includes government officials and representatives from NGOs, peak bodies, the government's advisory body for the Conference and Federal and State parliamentarians. A list of delegates is attached. The Government will not send a delegation to the NGO Forum as the Forum is a meeting of nongovernment organisations and individuals. However, it is expected that many Australian women and NGOs will participate in the NGO Forum. AUSTRALiAN DELEGATION TO THE BEIJING NA Ministerial Representation 1.

Beijing based DFAT officer Agreement on Social Security with Greek (Question No. 2421) Mr Cadman asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 8 June 1995: Has there been a delay of five years in signing a mutual agreement on social security with the Greek Government; if so, (a) what is the reason for the delay, (b) when will the matter be resolved, (c) what are the major points of difference between the Australian and Greek Governments and (d) what steps is the Government taking to resolve them. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the 'honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian and Greek Governments have been discussing a social security agreement periodically over the past five years, during which both sides have been working hard to assess whether an agreement is possible. There have been four rounds of talks during this period. At these meetings Australia has expressed its concern about the lack of reciprocity of benefits and the limited social insurance coverage of GreekAustralians under the Greek social security system. Reciprocity is one of the fundamental principles on which our agreements are negotiated. The type of agreement that we are able to offer Greece depends on the extent to which these principles are met. At a meeting in Athens in May 1994, the Australian delegation presented the Greek delegation with the text of a draft agreement. (a) The negotiations have been protracted for a number of reasons. Greece conducted a survey of former Greek-Australians in Greece and Australia in an attempt to determine the extent of coverage by the Greek scheme. The results of the survey and its 'interpretation' took two years to complete. Negotiations were delayed when talks scheduled for July 1994 in Canberra, following the meeting in May, were postponed by Greece at short notice because the leader of the Greek delegation became ill. Australia agreed to resume talks in October 1994, again in Canberra. However, these talks were again postponed by Greece at short notice because the leader of the delegation was required for parliamentary duties in Greece. When negotiations finally resumed in April 1995, the Greek side informed the Australian delegation for the first time that it had difficulty with a fundamental provision in the Australian draft agreement; that is, the draft agreement presented almost one full year before in May 1994. The provision in question concerns the rate of pensions Australia would pay to people who already live in Greece. It does not affect people who live in Australia or pensioners who have already returned Government to Greece with their Australian pensions, or who will return to Greece in future with their pensions. The Greek side was informed that the provision was fundamental and it agreed to re-examine its position. (b) I hope the matter will be resolved when Greece appreciates that the proposal that we have offered recognises the imbalances between our social security systems and is an attempt to address them in a fair and reasonable way. (c) The major point of difference is, as I have mentioned earlier, the issue of the rate of pensions payable in Greece under the Agreement. Each Australian agreement is different because it must recognise the particular features of the different social security arrangements in each country. The Australian proposal took into account the level of Greek payments into Australia, both before and after a proposed agreement, the population flow between the two countries and the nature of the two countries' social security systems. The Agreements with overseas countries do differ and there are substantial differences between the Agreements with, for example, the United Kingdom (Australia does not grant its pensions in the UK); New Zealand (where each government has agreed to mutual reimbursement for pensions covered by the Agreement); the Netherlands (where currently only age pension is included); etc, which reflect the differences in the social security systems and the capacity of the respective countries to reciprocate. The proposed formula on the rate of pensions payable in Greece is considered appropriate for an agreement with Greece because it protects Australia to some extent from the imbalance of payments under the two existing systems. Australia already pays over 8,000 pensions into Greece at a cost of close to $60m a year. With an agreement along the lines preferred by the Greek side, this would increase by some $50m a year. At present, Greece pays very little pension into Australia (some 100 pensions). I do not believe that this figure will increase by much under an agreement because of the basic nature of the Greek pension system. This is borne out by information we have received from one of Greece's other agreement partners. Australia is nevertheless prepared to have an agreement with Greece based on the formula proposed by Australia which itself adds some $18m to the cost of pensions paid into Greece. While the proposed model is different to some other existing agreements, that difference will not affect people who go back to Greece taking Australian pensions that have been granted in Australia under the normal provisions in the Social Security Act 1991. It could only affect those people who are already living in Greece when they claim a pension under the agreement. I must emphasise that, with or without an agreement, Australia will continue to meet its obligations to Greek-Australian residents and those who have returned to Greece with their Australian pensions. (d) The Government is waiting for Greece to come back either accepting our proposal or putting forward an acceptable counter-proposal. Disposal of Radioactive Waste (Question No. 2425) Mr Wakelin asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 19 June 1995: (1) Is the Government developing plans for a heavily engineered facility for the disposal of radioactive waste; if so, when will the facility be operational. (2) Is radioactive waste being stored on land owned by the Commonwealth; if so, (a) where and (b) what are the exact contents of the waste. (3) Did the first discussion paper released Department of Primary Industries and Energy's National Information Resource Centre state that the total annual quantity of radioactive waste from industrial gauges, exit signs, smoke detectors and medical sources comprised between 5 and 10 cubic metres a year; if so, (a) what proportion was derived from medical sources and (b) of what materials by isotope and weight or volume did the waste from medical sources consist. (4) What steps has the Government taken to encourage or enforce radioactive waste avoidance or minimisation by Government and private enterprise radioactive waste producers in Australia. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Government is developing plans for a national repository for low and short-lived intermediate level radioactive waste. The final repository design, including the nature of barriers used to isolate waste from the environment, will be influenced by the characteristics of the selected site. Identification of a site for this facility has been suspended pending consideration of the report of the Senate Select Committee into the Dangers of Radioactive Waste. (2) Yes. (a) The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the Australian Radiation Laboratory, the CSIRO, and a number of defence sites around the country have holdings of radioactive waste. Waste is also stored at the Woomera Rangehead in SA. (b) Descriptions of the nature and contents of this waste are provided in the National Radioactive Waste Repository Project Phase 1 discussion paper 'A Radioactive Waste Repository for Australia: Methods for Choosing the Right Site-A Discussion Paper' (NRIC 1992) and the Phase 2 discussion paper 'A Radioactive Waste Repository for Australia: Site Selection StudyPhase 2' (NRIC 1994). Waste holdings are classified in categories consistent with the National Health and Medical Research Council's Code of Practice for the Near-Surface Disposal of Radioactive Waste in Australia (1992). (3) The figure mentioned refers to State-generated wastes using information provided by State and Territory Government agencies. Details of origin and isotopic composition of the wastes was not provided by all agencies nor are they required until a repository has been established. Acceptability of wastes for disposal will be determined in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council Is Code of Practice for the NearSurface Disposal of Radioactive Waste in Australia (1992). (4) The principal action by the Commonwealth by the Government is the national radioactive waste repository project. It is proposed that the facility will operate on the basis of full cost recovery thus providing an incentive for radioactive waste avoidance and minimisation. Aboriginal Australians: Unemployment (Question No. 2427) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 19 June 1995: Has his attention been drawn to an Australian Bureau of Statistics report which indicates that (a) Aboriginal Australians are twice as likely to be unemployed as others, regardless of qualifications, (b) few Aborigines are self-employed and (c) most Aborigines who are in work are employed in unskilled jobs in the public sector or community service; if so, what actions has the Government taken to improve the employment of Aboriginal Australians. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Occasional Paper entitled ""Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People in the Australian Labour Market 1986 and 1991"" was released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in early June 1995. The figures in the report showed that, at the date of the 1991 census, indigenous Australians were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as other Australians and had a lower self-employment rate. The data also indicated that indigenous Australians were more likely to be working in unskilled occupations and that 44 per cent of those employed worked in Public Administration and Community Services compared with 23 per cent of other Australians. The report noted the fact that between 1971 and 1986 there was a four-fold increase in the proportion of indigenous people who were unemployed but also pointed to a reversal of this trend between 1986 and 1991. Between 1986 and 1991 the proportion of the indigenous population of working age recorded as employed rose from 31.3 per cent to 37.1 per cent while the proportion unemployed fell from 17.1 per cent to 16.5 per cent. The paper also noted the effects of the Community Development Employment Program (CDEP) and labour market programs in improving the employment to population ratio for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people between 1986 and 1991. (ABS Census data show an increase of over 16 per cent in the indigenous working age population over this period.) (2) The Government is concerned about the disadvantaged labour market status of indigenous Australians. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have received benefits from policies aimed at increasing control over their own affairs and from substantial increases in funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs over the past decade. As well as priority access to regular labour market programs under which the majority of program assistance is provided indigenous people receive special assistance under TAP-the Training for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders Program. Extra mainstream program places have been provided under the Government's Working Nation strategy. The TAP budget for 1995-96 has also been increased significantly (from $44.8 million in 1994-95 to $5004 million in 1995-96). In 1995-96 TAP will be funded from the main Labour Market Program appropriation, thereby increasing the funding flexibility and program options available to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients. Service levels in excess of Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) register share are being achieved for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients under Working Nation. To the end of May 1995 4.5 per cent of job placements were for the client group, compared to their 3.7 per cent share of the CES register. Around 6 per cent of clients under case management and 504 per cent of case managed outcomes were for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients, compared to a 4.2 per cent share of the register of long term unemployed clients. Some 504 per cent of all labour market program places were for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over the same period. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status is one of the characteristics used during the CES registration process to identify clients at risk of long term unemployment. Such clients are then assessed in more detail to determine the severity of their disadvantage and the need for case management and other forms of assistance. To assist indigenous people in remote areas with limited employment prospects, additional funding has been made available for CDEP places. Indigenous Australians are major beneficiaries of the Remote Area Field Service (RAFS) which provides employment and training services to remote area employers and unemployed jobseekers with limited or no access to a CES office. RAFS teams operate from 30 CES offices, mainly in northern and central Australia, providing employment and training assistance to an estimated 16,500 unemployed jobseekers, including 11,500 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander jobseekers. The RAFS teams are cooperating with other Commonwealth agencies servicing remote communities to streamline servicing arrangements and to maximise the employment opportunities available to remote jobseekers through infrastructure projects. Through the use of Mobile Office Information Technology and satellite telephone and communications equipment, the RAFS teams are able to match the client service standards provided by CES offices. In mid 1994 the results of a review of the Aboriginal Employment Development Policy were released. Following extensive consultations during 1995 the Government will be considering revisions to the policy. Working Nation also established 62 Area Consultative Committees (ACCs) to increase local community input to the delivery of programs and services to employers and jobseekers by the CES. Membership of ACCs is drawn principally from industry to enable ACCs to fulfil their role of generating employment initiatives, increasing the responsiveness of the CES to regional labour markets and linking Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) programs with regional development. A typical ACC comprises employers, unions, community and regional organisations, government representatives and major education and training providers and is chaired by an industry representative. Two ACC chairs are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and there are a total of 45 members of ACCs who are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representatives. In areas where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues are prominent, the ACC must have Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander membership. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Regional Councils are consulted when ACCs are planning or developing projects that might be of special interest to their community, or may provide opportunities for training and employment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Government has also taken steps to increase self-employment opportunities for Aboriginal Australians. A Program Service Agreement under the auspices of the DEET and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSIC) protocol, relating to DEET's New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NElS), ATSIC' s Business Funding Scheme (BFS) and ATSIC's Community Economic Initiatives Scheme (CEIS), was signed on 19 April 1995. NElS is designed to help jobseekers to set up self employment ventures through the provision of a comprehensive package of assistance. The package includes training in business plan development and small business management skills, income support for up to one year, and ongoing business advice through mentor support during the first year of business operation. The Program Service Agreement establishes a framework for cooperative working arrangements to promote and improve access to full NElS assistance for eligible Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It will also provide NElS training to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients who do not meet NElS eligibility requirements on a fee for service basis, funded by ATSIC. The BFS and CEIS will provide management support and advisory services, and start up capital through a grant or loan, for eligible Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander individuals and communities. Together these measures show the Government's strong commitment to improving employment outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Australian Defence Personnel: Military (Question No. 2430) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 19 June 1995: (1) Is it his objective that all service Ian personnel in various theatres of war be recognised by the Australian people. (2) Does the Government impose different qualifying periods for military awards on the service of navy, army and air force personnel; if so, why. (3) Is it a fact that a member of the RAN must have served for 28 days within 100 nautical miles of Vietnam to be eligible for the Vietnam Medal but that Australian Army personnel qualified after a single day's service in Vietnam and RAAF personnel for a single sortie over enemy territory; if so, why. (4) Will he review anomalies in Australia's military honours system.  member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Government has always maintained a policy of recognising eligible service by members of the Australian Defence Force and other entitled persons or groups by the awarding of an appropriate medal. Prior to 1975, this recognition was through the medium of the Imperial system of honours and awards. Since 1975, indigenous Australian awards have been available. (2) No. Since the end of World War II subsequent campaign awards under the Imperial System for service in South East Asia, including Vietnam, have been common to all three services, that is, service afloat, service ashore and service in the air. Entitlements are, therefore, determined by the environment in which members operate rather than the service to which they belong. This means that a RAAF pilot would become eligible under the same conditions as those for a Naval pilot and RAN clearance divers would be under the same qualifying conditions as other ground forces. (3) As indicated in the response to question 2, the conditions applying to the Vietnam Medal are common to all three services; that is, entitlement to the medal is determined by the environment in which members operated rather than the service to which they belonged. Those conditions were: (i) service of twenty-eight days, continuous or aggregated, in ships or craft employed in operations on inland waters or off the coast of Vietnam: (ii) service of one day or more on the posted strength of a unit or formation on land in Vietnam: (iii) one operational sortie over Vietnam or Awards Vietnamese waters by aircrew on the posted strength of a unit allocated for direct support of operations in Vietnam; or (iv) service of thirty days, continuous or aggregated, for official visits, inspections or other occurrences of a temporary nature on duty in Vietnam, or in ships or craft engaged in operations by Australoff the Vietnamese coast. (4) The Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards (CIDA) recently conducted an extremely comprehensive review of awards for defence and defence related activities. The Government believes the Committee achieved a remarkable result considering the range of awards reviewed and particularly as recognition for some periods of service has been achieved after many years. For example, the changes in eligibility for the award of the World War II medals, the 1939-45 Star and the Africa Star have resulted in many Australians being granted these medals in time for ANZAC Day 1995-some fifty years after the event. However, the Government appreciates that, even with such an extensive review, anomalies will and do occur. To ensure adequate review of such matters, the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Honours and Awards chaired by the Department of Administrative Services has, and will continue to review anomalous situations brought to its attention. Widowed Person Allowance (Question No. 2432) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 21 June 1995 (1) Who is eligible to receive the Widowed Person allowance. (2) What entitlements does the allowance provide. (3) How many persons receive the allowance. (4) What is the cost of providing the allowance. (5) What is the estimated additional (a) number of recipients of the allowance and (b) cost to the Commonwealth of lowering the age qualification to (i) 45 and (ii) 40 years. (6) Will the Government consider lowering the age qualification to 45 or 40 years; if not, why Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Widowed person allowance provided short term assistance, usually up to 14 weeks, for both women and men without children in the period immediately following the death of their partner. The allowance was renamed bereavement allowance in January 1995 to avoid confusion with widow allowance but otherwise remains unchanged. The allowance does not have an age qualification. As part of the honourable member's question relates to age qualifications, it is assumed that he is referring to widow allowance which was introduced on 1 January 1995. Therefore, the following answers relate to this allowance. (I) To be eligible for widow allowance, a woman must: be aged 50 years or more; no longer have a partner and have become widowed, divorced or separated (including separated de facto) after turning 50; be an Australian resident and have lived in Australia for the last 26 weeks (certain exemptions to this rule apply); and have no recent workforce experience. (Recent workforce experience means work of at least 20 hours a week for 13 weeks or more, at any time during the 12 months before claiming widow allowance.) (2) Widow allowance is paid at the same rate and under the same income and assets tests as apply to job search allowance (JSA) and news tart allowance (NSA) but is not activity tested. Widow allowance recipients have access to labour market assistance to find work including the Jobs, Education and Training (JET) program, but are not eligible for assistance under the Job Compact. Widow allowance recipients are eligible for a Health Care Card. However, if they are aged 60 years or more and have been in receipt of social security payments for at least 12 months they receive a Pensioner Concession Card. (3) As at 23 June 1995, the number of widow allowance recipients was 8,912. (4) Women in receipt of widow allowance would otherwise qualify for JSAINSA or another social security payment. Additional costs would only arise if persons on widow allowance did not find employment as a result of not being activity tested. The Department is not able to estimate this cost. (5) (a) The Department of Social Security does not have data available to provide a reliable estimate of the number of additional recipients or not. the cost of lowering the age qualifications as indicated. However, based on latest available ABS survey data, the number of recipients could increase to around 28,000 if the qualifying age was lowered to 40 years. No equivalent estimate is available for lowering the qualifying age to 45 years. (b) If women who become eligible for widow allowance because of a lower qualifying age transfer from JSNNSA or other social security payments there would be no additional cost. However, providing earlier access to a non-activity tested payment could be expected to reduce the incentive for these women to participate in the workforce. This may ultimately result in increased expenditure on social security income support payments. (6) The Government is not considering lowering the age qualification for widow allowance to 45 or 40 years. The Government considers that women who lose the support of a partner at a younger age will generally be more able to participate in the workforce and would benefit most from other measures designed to assist and encourage their workforce participation. For this reason, JSAlNSA remains a better option than widow allowance for these women because it provides access to a full range of labour market programs including the Job Compact. The Government is committed to encouraging and supporting women to participate in the paid workforce to best ensure their financial security. (Question No. 2438) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 22 June 1995: What visits has the Minister made to officially inspect drought affected properties in New South Wales since becoming Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Minister has made visits to Narrabri and Boggabri on 16 May 1994 and the Cooma and Bega areas on 17 February 1995. In addition, the Minister has met with delegations of farmers from the Wellington and Mudgee areas on 29 November 1994, Ariah Park farmers on 8 March 1995 and representatives from the Merriwa and Mudgee Rural Lands Protection Board areas on 22 June 1995. Furthermore, the Minister has been in regular contact with representatives of the National Farmers' Federation and other farm related organisations throughout the drought. (Question No. 2439) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 22 June 1995: What visits has the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council made to officially inspect drought affected properties in New South Wales since its inception. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Members of RASAC have made field inspections on three occasions for the purpose of assessment of requests for drought exceptional circumstances in New South Wales. Members visited properties at Mudgee and Baryulgil on 28 November 1994 and held meetings with the local farming communities at Wagga, Hay, Temora, Dubbo and Scone on 2930 April 1995. A further meeting of farmers and representatives of the Casino, Grafton, Kempsey and Gloucester Rural Lands Protection Boards was held at Kempsey on 3 May 1995. Arrangements are presently being made for RASAC members to undertake a visit to the Drought Condobolin, Cobar, Nyngan, Dubbo, Merriwa, Mudgee and Bathurst RLPBs as part of their assessment of a further application by the NSW Government for the extension of drought exceptional circumstances areas. Drought (Question No. 2440) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 22 June 1995: Has Division B of the Dubbo, NSW, Rural Lands Protection Board been excluded from receiving exceptional circumstances drought assistance; if so, what are the detailed reasons. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Division B of the Dubbo Rural Lands Protection Board was not included in the area declared to be in drought exceptional circumstances on 29 May 1995, because it did not meet the threshold meteorological criterion. Under this criterion it must be established that the drought is a 1 in 20 to 25 year event of greater than 12 months duration. The assessment of rainfall in Dubbo Division B Drought was based on information from two official rainfall sites-Dubbo and Wellington. At both sites, rainfall in autumn 1995 exceeded that consistent with a 1 in 20 to 25 year event extending over three consecutive seasons. Drought (Question No. 2441) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 22 June 1995: (1) Is it a fact that Divisions B, C and D of the Nyngan, NSW, Rural Lands Protection Board were included for receipt of exceptional circumstances drought assistance. (2) Is it also a fact that Division A was Classed by local experts and farmers as the worse affected division. (3) Has Division A been excluded from receiving exceptional circumstances drought assistance; if so, what are the detailed reasons. (4) Has the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council (a) inspected the properties in Division A or (b) visited the Nyngan district. (5) Will the Minister make a special provision for the inclusion of Division A for receipt of assistance; if not, when will the decision to exclude the division be reviewed. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Yes. (2) The assessment of drought exceptional circumstances in NSW was based on a submission from the State Government which did not indicate that conditions in Division A were worse than in the other Divisions of the Nyngan Rural Lands Protection Board (RLPB). Indeed the NSW State drought declarations for all divisions of Nyngan RLPB were lifted at the end of March 1995. (3) Division A of Nyngan RLPB was not included in the area declared to be in drought exceptional circumstances on 29 May 1995, because it did not meet the threshold meteorological criterion. Under this criterion it must be established that the drought is a 1 in 20 to 25 year event of greater than 12 months duration. The assessment of rainfall in Nyngan Division A was based on information from two official sitesNyngan and Girilambone. At both sites, rainfall in autumn 1995 exceeded that consistent with a 1 in 20 to 25 year event extending over three consecutive seasons. (4) Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council members have not inspected properties in Division A of the Nyngan RLPB, but farmers from the district attended the meeting held by Council members at Dubbo on 30 April 1995. (5) The Minister is unable to make a special provision for the inclusion of Division A of Nyngan RLPB. Applications for drought exceptional circumstances support are considered against nationally agreed core criteria and must satisfy the threshold meteorological criterion. However, the New South Wales Government has made a further application for support to be extended to this area. That application will be assessed in accordance with the agreed process. Community Development Employment (Question No. 2442) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 22 June 1995: (I) Did the Government intend that participants in the Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) scheme be excluded from eligibility for the Parenting Allowance. (2) Which low income groups other than CDEP participants are deliberately excluded from receiving the allowance. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Section 909 (1) of the Social Security Act provides that Parenting Allowance cannot be paid to a person receiving income from a Commonwealth funded employment program. The Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) Scheme is defined as such a program. This provision is based on the multiple entitlement exclusion principle which provides that it is not possible to receive more than one income support payment at any given time. It also provides consistent treatment with the exclusion from the CDEP that operates with Job Search Allowance, Newstart Allowance, Youth Training Allowance, Partner Allowance, Widow Allowance and Mature Age Allowance. The exclusion from Parenting Allowance only operates when a person is receiving income from the CDEP. (2) Groups, other than CDEP participants, excluded from receiving Parenting Allowance, are listed in s. 909 (I) of the Social Security Act. They are people who are receiving a payment under certain educational schemes (AUSTUDY, ABSTUDY and the Student Financial Supplement Scheme); people receiving payment under a Landcare and Environment Action Program (LEAP); people who are subject to a newly arrived resident's waiting period; people who are subject to an unused annual leave waiting period; people who are subject to a non-payment period for Job Search Allowance or Newstart Allowance; people who are in gaol; and people who are subject to a compensation preclusion period. In addition, people receiving another social security benefit (eg Job Search Allowance, Youth Training Allowance) cannot receive Parenting Allowance. Taiwan: Visit to Australia by President Lee (Question No. 2444) Mr Bradford asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 22 June 1995: Projects (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the (a) sister city relationship between Gold Coast City, Qld, and Taipei, Taiwan, (b) significant investment being undertaken by Taiwanese investors in the Gold Coast and (c) fact that a number of Taiwanese students are attending universities on the Gold Coast. (2) Is it a fact that the Mayor of the Gold Coast formally invited President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan to visit the Gold Coast to attend the first international exhibition of art treasures from Taiwan and the celebration of the sister city relationship between Taipei and Gold Coast City on 24 June 1995 but that President Lee was refused a visa; if so, why does the Government oppose President Lee's visit. (3) Will the Government grant permission for President Lee to visit the Gold Coast; if so, when. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a) Yes (b) Yes (c) Yes (2) I understand that the Mayor of the Gold Coast was interested in inviting Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui. However, I am not aware of any visa application. (3) The Government is not contemplating a visit, whether official or unofficial, to the Gold Coast or anywhere in Australia by Mr Lee. Australia's relationship with Taiwan cannot be separated from the fact that Australia recognises the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the sole legal government of China. So while the Government encourages the development of our economic, trade and other interests with Taiwan, we do not have official contacts. It has been the policy of the Australian Government to agree to private visits to Australia by high level officials from Taiwan whose visits are directly related to the promotion of our strong and expanding economic and trade interests. However, a visit by Mr Lee, even if private, would be of a political nature, not consistent with the current state of our unofficial links with Taiwan. Social Security Payments (Question No. 2450) Mr Wakelin asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 26 June 1995: (1) Did he inform the House on 6 June 1994 that recipients of social security payments could apply for an advance lump sum, interest free, payment. (2) Will the Government introduce an interest free loan for employed low income earners; if so, when; if not, why not. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. On that day I advised the House that unemployed people will be able to get a 'lump sum payment advance on their allowance'. This is not an additional payment but rather an advance of future income support payments which must be repaid. (2) No. However, recipients of Basic Family Payment are able to apply for a lump sum advance on a six monthly basis of half the amount payable for one child, currently $141.05. Electoral Commission Enrolment Forms (Question No. 2452) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 27 June 1995: (1) Are all students who receive Austudy sent Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) enrolment forms through the postal service; if so, (a) why and (b) how many students have been sent the forms. (2) Are students who do not receive Austudy sent AEC enrolment forms, if so, how many students have been sent the forms. (3) What measures will the Government take to ensure that all students are provided equal access to AEC enrolment forms.",176
228,Mr WALKER,CONFERENCE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) AEC enrolment forms are included in application kits which are mailed by the Department of Employment, Education and Training to all continuing Austudy students. (a) Australian Electoral Commission surveys show that a significant number of 18-24 year olds are not enrolled to vote. Non-enrolment is more significant in this age group than for any other in the Australian community. The mailout of enrolment information with Austudy material is just one activity undertaken by the AEC to facilitate enrolment by young people. (b) Since the AEC began this direct mail program in 1992/93, approximately 600,000 enrolment forms have been distributed as part of Austudy kits. (2) Only students who receive the continuing Austudy kit receive enrolment cards by mail. (3) The AEC conducts a number of on-going enrolment and education activities aimed at young people, of which the use of the Austudy direct mail campaign to continuing students is but one. Others include advertising in youth-oriented magazines (with reply-paid enrolment coupons), including campus publications; visiting senior high schools; and undertaking enrolment promotional activities at T AFE and University orientation weeks. Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet: Private Security Services (Question No. 2453) Mr Langmore asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 27 June 1995: What sum did work undertaken by private security services cost the Minister's Department in 1994-95.",185
229,Mr KEATING,CONFERENCE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Taking ""private security services"" to mean guarding, the answer to the honourable member's question is nil. Department of Defence: Private Security (Question No. 2456) Mr Langmore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 27 June 1995: What sum did work undertaken by private security services cost the Minister's Department in 1994-95.  provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The question has been further defined by Mr Langmore as 'guarding and any other duties that would be the responsibility of the police if private security firms were not contracted'. The answer is nil. Treasury: Private Security Services (Question No. 2457) Mr Langmore asked the Treasurer upon notice, on 27 June 1995: What sum did work undertaken by private security services cost the Treasury in 1994-95.",186
230,Mr WILLIS,CONFERENCE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: $326,838.24 Department of Housing and Regional Development: Private Security Services (Question No. 2458) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, upon notice, on 27 June 1995: What sum did work undertaken by private security services cost the Minister's Department in 1994-95.",186
231,Mr HOWE,CONFERENCE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department of Housing and Regional Development spent $31,961.00 on private security services during 1994-95. Department of Industry, Science and Technology: Private Security Services (Question No. 2459) Mr Langmore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, upon notice, on 27 June 1995: What sum did work undertaken by private security services cost the Minister's Department in Services 1994-95. Mr Lee-The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Nil. Department of Social Security: Private Security Services (Question No. 2463) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 27 June 1995: What sum did work undertaken by private security services cost the Minister's Department in 1994-95. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department's national expenditure for private security services in 1994-95 was $837,690.84. This cost includes the services of full time security guards; guards employed to safeguard premises prior to occupation of buildings; and the remote monitoring of premises. None of the guarding services listed above would otherwise have been the responsibility of the police if private security firms were not contracted. Department of Industrial Relations: Private Security Services (Question No. 2465) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 27 June 1995: What sum did work undertaken by private security services cost the Minister's Department in 1994-95.",186
232,Mr BRERETON,CONFERENCE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: $44,472.03 Department of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs: Private Security (Question No. 2474) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 27 June 1995: What sum did work undertaken by private security services cost the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission in 1994-95. Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the following information: $52,739.79 Livestock Export Inspection Services (Question No. 2477) Mr Hawker asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 28 June 1995: (1) Has the Government received reports on the contracting out of livestock export inspection services; if so, (a) how many, (b) when was each report received and (c) what action has been taken to implement the findings of each report. (2) Was 1 July 1995 agreed in early 1995 to be the starting date for contracting out livestock export inspection services; if so, is the date achievable; if not, (a) why not and (b) on what date will contracting out commence. (3) Is it a fact that Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service inspectors are charged out at the rate of $55 per half hour including travel time. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1)(a), (b) & (c) The Government has not received a report on the contracting out of livestock export inspection services. A paper on the subject was prepared by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and circulated to industry and State Departments of Agriculture for comment. Consideration of the issues is continuing. (2) (a) & (b) Timing of implementation depends on industry responses and on the need to modify subsidiary legislation. (3) Yes. However, a rebate of $35 per half hour currently applies to the fee to remit to industry over-recovered funds from earlier years. Men Against Sexual Assault: Grants (Question No. 2480) Services Mr Campbell asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 28 June 1995: Did an organisation called Men Against Sexual Assault receive funds in (a) 1994-95 or (b) any other year from (i) the Office of the Status of Women or (ii) any other source within his portfolio; if so, what sum.",186
233,Mr KEATING,CONFERENCE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) No (b)(i) Yes.

(b)(ii) No Funding to Employee Bodies (Question No. 2482)",187
234,Mr CAMERON,CONFERENCE,"the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 28 June 1995: Has the Prime Minister or his Department provided funding to the: (a) Australian Services Union, (b) Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union, (c) Australian Meat Industry Employees Union, (d) Australian Tramway and Motor Omnibus Employees Association, (e) Australian Council of Trade Unions, (f) Australian Railways Union, (g) Australian Workers Union, (h) Automotive, Metals and Engineering Union, (i) Builders Labourers Federation, G) Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, (k) Canberra Tradesmen's Union, (I) Communication Workers Union, (m) Electrical Trades Union, (n) Federated Clerks Union, (0) Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees Union, (p) Health and Community Services Union, (q) Maritime Union of Australia, (r) National Union of Workers, (s) Printing and Kindred Industries Union, (t) Communications, Aviation and Broadcasting Union, (u) Seamen's Union of Australia, (v) Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, (w) Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia, (x) Transport Workers Union, and (y) Waterside Workers Federation of Australia their State organisations or subsidiaries thereof; if so, in each case, (i) what sum was provided, (ii) what was the reason for the funding, (iii) how was the funding used and (iv) was the funding properly accounted for.",187
235,Mr KEATING,CONFERENCE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The only funding that has been provided to the above mentioned bodies, their State organisations or known subsidiaries during 1994-95 financial year was: (e) Australian Council of Trade Unions (Queensland Branch) (i) $68,250 (ii) and (iii) The funds were used, in accordance with the terms and conditions as set out in the written agreement between the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the ACTU (Queensland Branch), for a project to publicise and promote nationally the experience and outcomes of a Queensland-based project aimed at promoting the participation of workers from non-English speaking backgrounds in workplace reforms. (iv) Yes Students with Disabilities (Question No. 2491) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, upon notice, on 28 June 1995: (1) Is the Government committed to ensuring that students with disabilities are not disadvantaged by lack of wheelchair access to educational institutions. (2) Has the Government implemented programs to help State and independent schools upgrade their classrooms and libraries to ensure wheelchair access via ramps or lifts. (3) Have northern Sydney schools sought federal government help to obtain better access for the disabled; if so; (a) which schools have sought help, (b) which have been given help and (c) with what sum was each provided. (4) Which northern Sydney schools will the Government help to improve disabled access in time for the start of the 1996 school year. Mr Free-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commonwealth Government demonstrates its commitment to ensuring that students with disabilities are not disadvantaged by lack of wheelchair access to educational institutions through two programs-the Special Education Component of the Access Element of the National Equity Program for Schools (NEPS) and the Capital Grants program. The objectives of the Special Education Component are to improve the educational participation and outcomes of young people with disabilities through the provision of targeted assistance. The Component supports the provision of capital facilities, such as wheelchair access, which are integral to providing educational and therapeutic services for students with disabilities. The primary responsibility for special education rests with State and Territory governments, the Commonwealth's contribution to special education is a supplementary one only. In the Administrative Guidelines for the Commonwealth's Capital Grants Program for schools, the Government states that it expects all new buildings (and where possible, all buildings being refurbished) to be designed to facilitate access by people with disabilities. (2) The Government has implemented programs to help State and independent schools upgrade their classrooms and libraries to ensure wheelchair access via ramps or lifts. Under the NEPS Special Education Component it is usual for priority to be given to physical access ramps. Significant numbers of government and non-government schools are being made more wheelchair accessible using Commonwealth funds. (3) Responsibility for the administration of NEPS funds and the implementation of programs rests with the schooling authorities. Representative committees determine spending priorities based on student needs at specific schools and within the policies of the schooling authorities. Under the Capital Grants Program block grants are made to both the Department of School Education and the Catholic Education Commission in New South Wales. Each Block Grant Authority sets priorities for capital projects and forwards recommendations to the Commonwealth for Ministerial approval. The Commonwealth ensures that funding guidelines, including the provision of access for persons with disabilities, are followed. The following schools have sought Federal Government funding: Department of School Education (DSE) (a) State schools are made more accessible using a combination of Commonwealth and State funds for capital works. Therefore access improvements at a specific State school cannot be attributed solely to its seeking identifiable federal funding. All new NSW State schools and schools undergoing major upgrading and refurbishment are designed to provide access for staff, students and community members with disabilities. Such works involve the use of Commonwealth funds. Other schools are dealt with on a request basis (fully State-funded). (b) and (c) Note: ""northern Sydney"" is understood to take in the administrative zone of the NSW DSE's Metropolitan North region, West to Ryde, East to the Pacific, South to the harbour and North to Gosford. Each of these schools will have provision made for access but ramps or lifts form only a small part of the overall project. Access-related capital works were carried out as part of the following capital works projects at northern Sydney State schools: Bradford College, North Sydney-$1.2 million75% Commonwealth Eastwood Primary-$l.O million-53% Commonwealth Epping Boy's High School-$700,000 78%Commonwealth MCKellar Girls' High School, Manly Vale$250,000 73%-Commonwealth Tumbi Umbi High School near Gosford-$4 million 64%-Commonwealth In the case of non-government schools the following information is provided: Catholic Education Commission (a) 1994 Funding year The only school which sought 1994 funding, Corpus Christi School, St Ives, was successful. 1995 Funding year Both Our Lady of Good Counsel School, Forestville and St Pius X College, Chatswood sought 1995 funding and are likely to be successful. (b) and (c) Funding Year 1994 Corpus Christi School, St Ives-Grant paid $10 000 Funding Year 1995 Our Lady of Good Counsel School, ForestvilleGrant paid $9 975 St Pius X College, Chatswood-Grant recommended $95 256 Association of Independent Schools of New South Wales (a) 1994 Funding year Both Arden Anglican School, Beecroft and SCEGGS, Redlands sought 1994 funding and were successful. 1995 Funding year All three schools which sought help are likely to receive funding in 1995. They are: Knox Grammar School, Wahroonga; Arden Anglican School, Beecroft; St Ignatius' Riverview, Lane Cove (b and c) Funding Year 1994 Arden Anglican School-Grant paid $17 379 SCEGGS Redlands-Grant paid $15 000 1995 Funding year St Ignatius' Riverview-Grant recommended $10 000 (4) The Government will help fund improvements to disability access for all Schools mentioned in Question 3, in time for the start of the 1996 school year. Other projects may have involved improving disability access, but as it is a standard provision of Commonwealth funding it is often not identified in larger project descriptions. Disability Support Pensions (Question No. 2493) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 29 June 1995: (1) Are disability support pensions paid directly to the recipient. (2) Under what circumstances would disability support pensions be paid to an employer. (3) Will he provide a list of all disability employment services provided for in section 13 of the Disability Services Act which receive disability support pensions on behalf of their employees. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Disability support pension payments are paid directly to the pensioner's account unless the pensioner is paid under a group schedule arrangement or has elected to have their pension paid to a nominee. Group schedule arrangements operate where the management of a Business Service (formerly sheltered workshop) or nursing home receives a number of pension payments in respect of employees/residents and is responsible for distributing individual pension payments to the pensioners themselves. However, this arrangement is no longer offered to Business Services and customers currently paid by this method are being encouraged to convert to direct credit or nominate a person to receive their pension on their behalf. (2) Payments of disability support pension may be made to an employer via a group schedule, or where a customer nominates their employer as the person to whom pension payments will be made. (3) A list of Business Services which had group VICTORIA schedule arrangements in place attached. However, this does not include pensioners who elect to have their pension paid employer under individual nominee arrangements.
