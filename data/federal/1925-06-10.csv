5,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Flinders-Prime M in ister) [3.40] - It is with, profound regret that I rise to refer to the death of a great Prime Minister of our sister. Dominion of New Zealand. I feelsure that every member of this House will j o in in paying homage to the memory of one whose sterling qualities and unremitting efforts on behalf of New"" Zealand and the Empire have made his-, name a. household word wherever the English tongue is spoken. Mr Massey's long political career is a record of personal success, combined with sound democraticlegislation. For 32 years he sat as a represenSTAFF. tative in the Parliament of his adopted country, and the outstanding evidence of his own personality; and the affection and esteem in which he was held by his' fellow citizens, is the fact that for 2.9 years of - that: period he wasreturned continuously as a representative of one constituency. Leader of his party since i903, and Prime Minister since 1912, his name is inseparably associated with the most important period in the history of New Zealand. Immediately war broke out in 1914, Mr Massey, with characteristic vigour, and directness of purpose, pledged his country to the Empire's common cause. To all the calls he made upon the patriotism and self-sacrifice of his people, they responded with a liberality and readiness which spoke more eloquently than words of their faith in his leadership, and their confidence in his policy. In repeated visits to Great Britain as a member of successive Imperial Conferences, he proved himself to be, not only a great Prime Minister of his own Dominion, but an Imperial statesman of sound judgment and broad vision. He will ever be held in grateful memory as one who served his country and the Empire with ability, loyalty, and unselfish zeal - But, perhaps, even greater than his public achievements is the fact that by his courage and integrity he won the well-deserved love, respect, and trust of all with whom he camp in contact. He was essentially a democrat, and one of the finest representatives which modern democracy has produced. To his country he has left a long record of public service, and to future generations an outstanding example of what a man of character and capacity may achieve by the pursuit of high ideals. He died as he lived, a simple man devoted to the service of his country and his Empire, and we, who, in our different ways, strive to follow the path he trod to the heights he scaled, incline our heads in respect and admiration. I move That the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia expresses its sorrow at the loss which has befallen the Dominion of New Zealand, by the death of the Prime Minister of New Zealand, the Right Honourable William Ferguson Massey, records its appreciation of his distinguished services to the Empire, and extends its sympathy to the Parliament and to the people of the sister Dominion. Question resolved in the affirmative, members standing in their .places. Motion (by Mr Bruce) agreed toThat the Speaker be requested to convey resolution and a copy of the speech delivered thereon to Mrs Massey and the Government of the Dominion of New Zealand.

I would remind the House that the Government is not prepared to entertain an offer from anybody, and, therefore, it is not fair that it should be published to the world that certain persons have taken action in connection with the matter.

The Committee appointed to prepare the Address-in-Reply having presented' the proposed address, which was read by the Clerk,",23
93,Mr COOK,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"Indi) [5.43] - I move That the following Address-in-Reply to His Excellency the Governor General's Speech be agreed to: MAY iT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENXT-, Wo, the House of Representatives of. the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the speech you. have 'been .pleased address to Parliament. I appreciate very much the honour that has been conferred upon me by the Government in asking me to move the adoption of the Address-in-Eeply. I am pleased to find in His Excellency's Speech references to a large number, of very important matters closely affecting the welfare of the Australian people. Early in the Speech, mention is made of the forthcoming visit of the American Fleet. I feel sure that, in accordance with the Australian characteristics of fair play and good sportsmanship, the visitors will be accorded a most hearty welcome. The friendship between Australia and America is of immense importance to the people of the - Commonwealth, and. augurswell for the maintenance of peace in thePacific. It augurs well for the peace of Europe. I note from the references in the speech to the currency of Great Britain, the Dominions of the Empire, and a number of other nations of the world, that we have reverted to a gold standard the effect of which has been to reduce the cost of exchange with England from £3 10s. per £100 to 15s. This represents a very great improvement in our financialposition, and I trust that, in the near future, even the charge of 15s. will be wiped out altogether. I am pleased to see mention of the Government proposals for defence, and that preparations are to be made for strengthening our naval, military, andair forces, as well as for the erection of munitions factories. With rather less than 6,000,000 people in Australia, with an empty north, and-with approximately 14,000 milesof coast-line to defend, our position is not at all satisfactory. Eor many, years, we have had to depend upon the British Navy. Should anything happen to destroy its prestige, the position with regard! to the White Australia policy, which we all prize, will be very serious. It is gratifying, indeed, to know that, as the result of investigations .by the royal commission into the administration of the War Pensions Act, grievances have been considerably minimized. Our liability for war pensions, interest, and sinking fund is approximately £28,000,000 a year. Whilst I would liketo see greater consideration given in conto. nexion with certain aspects of administration, it must be admitted, I think, that we have treated returned soldiers better than any other nation in the world, though there is room for a great dealmore to be done. H-onorable members interrupting",26
94,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"Rt. Hon..W. A. Watt). Order ! I am unable to say whether the interruption emanating from certain honourable gentlemen in the chamber isexpressive of their approval or of their disapprobation of the remarks made by the honourable member for Indi, but in either case it is disorderly. It is customary to allow the mover and. ithe seconder of the Address-in-Reply to speak freely, and to be heard in silence.",26
95,Mr COOK,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"Our liability in connection with, soldier settlement inns into many millions of pounds annually, and whilst the Commonwealth may not be directly concerned financially in the soldier settlement schemes of the variousstates, it is indirectly, if not closely, affected; because-if State Treasurers cannot secure repayment of interest and principal from theirsoldier settlers; they are not in-the position to repay Commonwealth advances. In this matter, there should be a stocktaking. I was pleased to notice from the remarks of the Prime Minister some weeksago that the Government is prepared to meet the states in. thisall-important matter with a view, I take it , to widening the scope of the act, and extending the term for repayments which, under the present arrangement, are falling so heavily upon a number of soldier settlers. If this can be done, I am sure that it will be greatly to the advantage of the scheme generally, because it will put heart into the settlers'themselves. The present arrangement creates a situation, in a sense, like that of a man who gives I.O.U's. for financial assistance received and then "" We l l , thank God that's p a i d ! "" At present many ex-soldiers cannot carry on. I know that certain blocks have changed hands many times, and many blocks are unoccupied, so the more quickly we get to the bottom of this trouble the better it will be for the Commonwealth generally. The Government proposals for the development of the Northern Territory are of very great importance, but care will have to be taken in the appointment of the proposed commission. It is generally admitted that the Northern Territory cannot be administered from Melbourne, and, important as Canberra may be in the eyes of some honourable members, I doubt whether it will be possible to administer the Northern Territory even from there. But if we select men of wide experience, and arm them with statutory powers for administration, we shall, I believe, be taking one of the most important steps ever attempted for the settlement of that immense area of country which under existing conditions is a menace to the Commonwealth. Already we have ample information about the possibilities of the Northern Territory, taken on oath from witnesses before many royal commissions, and I feel sure that, if members will only unite on this issue, and not make it a party question, we shall be able to do much for the development of that portion of Australia. The Government proposals for road construction, as enunciated in the Governor General's Speech, are somewhat indefinite. The House and the country have the right to expect a bold, comprehensive policy. Since motor vehicles are now almost in universal use, attention must be given to road construction. Whilst some people may think that this is not a matter for the Commonwealth Government, I maintain that it is, because, for defence and other purposes, the Commonwealth is a large user of the roads, and, therefore, it should contribute to their construction and maintenance. The motor industry pays in Customs duties on motor vehicles, petrol, and requisites, somewhere about £3,000,000 a year. Not one penny of this sum Mr Cook. should be spent in other than road construction. If we launched out on a comprehensive policy involving the expensays, diture of £1,000,000, or even more, a year over a period of ten years, providing the states did likewise, making in all £2,000,000 a year, we would provide interest and sinking fund at about 8 per cent, on a loan of £25,000,000, and could go ful l speed ahead with one of the most important developmental, schemes, repaying the whole of the capital expenditure in 25 years. Sir George Buchanan, a recognized authority on ports and harbours, has been carrying out certain investigations for the Commonwealth, particularly in the Northern Territory. I compliment the Government upon having secured aman of such eminence. From my knowledge of Sir George Buchanan I am convinced that he is the man for the job. The centralization in Victoria, where the great bulk of the products intended for export are brought for shipment to Melbourne is lamentable, because nature has provided so many convenient ports for the shipment of our primary products overseas. The pioneers of Queensland should be congratulated upon the magnificent decentralized system existing in that state today. In that state ports and natural harbours have been developed to an extent that has been beneficial both to the primary producers and to the state. I trust that the recommendations of Sir George Buchanan will provide honourable members with food for thought. The Federal Capital Commission has been appointed, but is as yet in its infancy. It is too early to pass judgment upon its labours, but after what 1I have heard and seen of its members, I congratulate the House on the selection of such capable men. My view of Canberra has not changed. The project is premature by about 25 years; but while I hold that opinion, I recognize that the establishment of a Federal Capital is desired by a majority of members of this House. I am prepared to assist in making the Federal Capital what the people desire it to be. To be fair to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Sir Austin Chapman), I admit that the reports published in the press regarding heavy flood damage at Canberra are most unfair. The flood damage has been infinitesimal, although the water was 5 feet higher than in any previous recorded flood. The recent floods should be regarded as a blessing in disguise, because they will provide data that will obviate the misspending of large sums of money on works that might otherwise have been proceeded within the flooded areas. The Works and Railways Department very wisely sent two engineers to the Territory as early as possible after the floods to make observations. The report of the royal commission on the effects of federation upon the finances of Western Australia will open a big question. While federation has been an undoubted blessing to some of the states, it has not been so to Western Australia, which is largely a dumping ground for the products of well-equipped factories in the other states. 1 hope that the royal commission will be able to recommend a remedy for the supposed evil effects of federation and the tariff in that state. Assistance is promised to settlers for the erection of vermin-proof fences. To my own personal knowledge, as a primary producer, this promised assistance has been too long delayed. The losses caused by dingoes and rabbits aro suffered not merely by the individual, but also by the nation. The individual suffers directly, and the nation indirectly, to at least an equal extent. Australia has lost more by the ravages of dingoes on sheep and calves, and by the encroachment of rabbits on areas that should carry stock, than'would pay interest and sinking fun d charges on a sufficient number of millions of pounds to provide all the vermin-proof fences required. I trust that a measure of such far-reaching importance to the rural development of Australia will receive the united support of all political parties. I now come to the subject of the tariff. I have been a member of a municipal council for over twenty years, and we have a hardy annual as "" noxious weeds."" Parliament also has its hardy annuals, and the hardiest of them is the tariff. I always have been a firm believer in protection, but respect the views of other men. It is generally admitted that secondary industries must be protected, but while we protect them, we should insist upon them being efficient, and manufacturers should be compelled to "" p l a y the game."" Primar y and secondary industries should advance together. Bounties should be granted to provide implements for primary products. As a bounty is paid for the manufacture of wire netting, which is essent i a l for the development of this country, similar assistance should be given to provide machinery for primary producers. A bounty is a fair compromise for both protectionists and free traders. I cannot accept the view that we should throw down the tariff wall, and have indiscriminate importations. I subscribe to the views of the Tariff Board. Although that board is not held in high esteem by some people, it has done valuable work. It is faced with a very big problem, and has statutory power to seek any advice that it may require. The reports of the board are valuable, and I hope that, in future, it will be able to shed a little light on the darkness that surrounds us. I hold no brief for any member in this House, including the Prime M in ister, but I am prepared to say that no Prime Minister has done more for the rural development of Australia than has the present occupant of the office. Vigorously, honestly, and consistently, and with great knowledge and determination, he fought for Imperial preference. W h at is the value to Australia of the preference principally on dried fruit s granted, as a result of his efforts, by the Imperial Government? On dried f r u it s, sugar-of which there will be large exportations this year-and wines, the value of the preference granted is £700,000 a year. Rural Australia benefits to that extent on those, three commodities, and also enjoys preference in many other directions. Services like that are of immense value, and irrespective of party and political views, should be recognized. The boards appointed under the legislation of last session to control the exknown portation of dairy produce and dried fruits have been in existence for too short a period to enable one to pass judgment on their usefulness, but I am satisfied that when they have been in operation for some time very great benefit will be derived by the primary producers concerned. Already the Dair y Export Control Board has been instrumental in obtaining for the "" Kangaroo"" brand of butler a price equal to that given for the first quality New Zealand article. For the first time in the history of Australia this price has been obtained, and great credit is dne for what has been done in the producers' interests. The board having, been given statutory power to control licences for the export .of butter and cheese, it will be able to eliminate a large number of unnecessary middlemen, and by keeping in touch with marketing conditions abroad its services will be most beneficial to the dairying industry. Mention was made in the Governor General's Speech of a proposed measure to provide "" adequate financial machinery."" to enable the to carry out ' their work, and . I take that to mean that a bill for the establishment of a rura l credits system will be introduced. This was a very live subject in the House last session during the debate on the Commonwealth Bank Bill . The Treasurer (.Dr Earle Page) gave an assurance, I think, that he would bring the matter forward at a later stage, aud the Government is apparently about to carry out its promise - to' bring a measure before the House to enable this important problem to be discussed: The time is due for the introduction of a rural credits system, because a considerable number of industries in the country require financial backing against losses. In the f r u it industry, for. instance, an effort is being made by the producers to. establish their own canneries and other factories, and the work should be supported'heartily by Parliament. The producers will need reasonable financial assistance, and I imagine that' they will be able to receive it from the proposed rura l bank. At the present time the fruit-grower is ordered by the court to pay a fixed wage for pruning, ploughing, and the whole of the work necessary for the cultivation of his orchard - It seems to me to be a most one-sided arrangement,' and the establishment of a board on which the f r u it growers are represented should be of the utmost value to them. The migration agreement mentioned in the Governor General's Sjieech. It seems deplorable that there should be such apathy as has been displayed by the states on this ant matter. Provision has been made for the advance, over a period of ten of £34,000,000 for land development reproductive works generally. Mr Cook. state has not enough room for further land settlement, surely it can carry out developmental works. If it needs developmental works of any importance, the chances are that it has plenty of' land. I have had the pleasure, in the course of my parliamentary duties, to travel fair l y extensively over Australia, and one is surprised to note the extent of the unoccupiedareas. H a l f the population is' to be foundi n the capital cities, and the country side seems practically empty. I trust that the states will grasp the opporboards tunity afforded them to carry out a brisk policy of land settlement. If they do not, the chances, are that there will be a move in the direction of unification. That would mean an alteration of the Constitution and the granting of increased powers to the Commonwealth.. If the states refuse to welcome immigrants of the right type, it will be the duty of the - Federal Government to do this work for them. I have met many immigrants from Great B r it a in , and the majority of them are people with whom one might well feel proud to be associated. There are black sheep in every flock, but, generally speaking, the immigrants are a credit to the Old Country. Mr CuififiNGHAM - But they cannot obtain work. Mr COOK. - I could provide work, in shires with which I am associated, for 500 men tomorrow, and I venture to say that provision could be made for the employment of 25,000 men on road con? struction, for. which there ismuch difficulty in obtaining suitable labour, on clearingand fencing land, and on bridge construction throughout Australia. But while men can obtain short hours of work and high pay in the cities, they will not go into the country districts. I hope yet that the states will recognize the requirements of the situation, and give united' assistance to the Federal authorities in pushing on with the migration scheme. It should be seen has been that there are unlimited opportunities in the way of developmental works. If we do not avail ourselves of them the chances are that some other Power will all-importstep in and develop this country for us. years, ' The Government proposes to amend and the Insurance Companies Act. No Act If any on the statute-books of either the Commonwealth or the states requires such drastic amendments as this one. New companies seem to be springing up almost ; weekly. The deposits companies are required to lodge are not nearly sufficient. They are not 25 per cent, of what should be required. No deposit at all is necessary in some of the states, and that fixed by law for Victoria should be substantially increased. More attention should be given to the calibre df the men who float these companies. They should be obliged to show that they have some public standing before they are allowed to sell shares indiscriminately. I feel sure that many of the companies which have been i floated recently will come to grief in the not distant future .unless they are amalgamated with, or absorbed by, the well established companies. If the states will not legislate to protect the public ngainst these unstable companies, the Federal Government certainly should step in and take action; aud I am pleased indeed that the Government intends to bring down a measure with this object in view. The Government is to be commended for its intention to do something to promote the manufacture of power alcohol in Australia. Every endeavour should be made to establish an industry which will provide Australia .with her own power. At present we are spending £15,000,000 annually on American petrol. I was speaking to an expert in the north some little time ago, and he assured me that an excellent raw .material for the manufacture of power alcohol was sugar cane. Seeing that we shall have an exportable surplus of 200,000 tons of sugar this year, and that my expert friend advised me that sugar cane would be worth almost as much for the manufacture of power alcohol as for the manufacture of sugar, it ought to be possible to develop a valuable power-alcohol industry in this country. It can be easily understood that such an industry would be of enormous importance to Australia as a whole. We should certainly do everything we can to keep within Australia the £15,000,000 that we are at present sending to America for petrol. We should be providing our own power from our own material by our own people in our own Commonwealth. That ought to, appeal to my honourable friends opposite. If it is not an Australian policy, I do not know what is. I hold very definite views about the attitude which ought to be adopted by the CommonAvealth Government in regard to land and income taxation. The Commonwealth ought to get right out.of this field of taxation. I consider that it would be far better for - us to cease the per capita payments, and give the states the sole right to collect the land and income taxation. The State authorities know better than the Commonwealth possibly can the abilities of their various peoples to pay taxation, ancl we should resign to the. states these avenues Of taxation rather than continue our present cumbersome Commonwealth machinery. To have the two authorities collecting these taxes must necessarily involve a great deal of overlapping. If the Commonwealth were to hand over to the states its authority in respect to land and income taxation the change would result in the loss of only about £3,600,000 in revenue. The figure might be slightly less than that, for si nee it was estimated the Federal income - taxation rates have been reduced by 10 per cent., and the statutory exemption has been raised. The people of Australia ; would be pleased, I am sure, if the Commonwealth Government ceased to impose land and income taxation. 'It is gratifying to learn that the Government intends to submit to Parliament a practical s'cheme of railway development. I am glad that' it has ohtained the concurrence of the South Australian Government to proceed with the construction of the North-South line- a work that has been delayed for altogether too lung. I am also pleased to note that the determination of the route of the proposed line is to be left to the Commonwealth. I apologize to honourable members for having spoken at such length, and I shall conclude by saying that I am satisfied that if even a fair proportion of the measures forecast in the Governor General's Speech are enacted, we shall, this session, make a valuable contribution to the development of this country. Even allowing for disagreement on a portion of the programme a sufficient number of proposals will remain on which all parties should agree to make possible a useful session which will he beneficial to the whole of the people of Australia. In conclusion may I appeal to honourable members for their loyal and sympathetic support of the Temporary Chairmen of Committees. I appeal for this, for I am one myself. I trust that members on all sides of the House will assist in expediting the business, and that "" stone-walling"" tactics will not be in dulged in , for it is absolutely imperative that many of the matters referred to in the Governor General's Speech should be dealt with as soon as possible in the in terests of the advancement of this great young country.",26

97,Mr GARDNER,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"Robertson) [7.47] I regard as an honour the request to me cation in the country. to second the motion for the adoption the Address-in-Reply. The occasion unique from two points of view. In first place the Speech is the last that w i be delivered in this Parliament Excellency the Governor General. I feel that I am voicing the opinion not only honourable members of this House, but in those services. also of the people of Australia, when I ' say that they appreciate the splendid vices that have been rendered to this country by both Lord and Lady Forster. In the discharge of their high functions they have endeared themselves to Austo tralians, and we gladly recognize that tries. when His Excellency returns to Englaud he will continue to take a keen interest in the affairs of the Commonwealth. The occasion is also unique-unles s the eleworks ments have been too severe at Canberrain that this will be the last address of its kind discussed in this Parweeks in arrear. liament. I , therefore, regard it a great honour for me to be assotends ciated with the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. It is interestthe ing to recall that the first motion for adoption of an Address-in-Reply in this Parliament was moved by the late W. H . Groom, of Queensland, the father Austin Chapman). of the present Attorney-General, and seconded by Mr Crouch, of Victoria. It certainly a great privilege for me to associated in this way with the eminent men, who, imbued as they were with the true patriotic spirit, played so prominent a part in the early stages of federation. The people of Australia owe a debt of gratitude to those who founded the Federal Parliament, an institution which stood the test when war broke out and the British Empire was in danger. At that time in this chamber were found men who ranked with the highest statesmen in the Empire. I trust that, should Parliament assemble at Canberra next session, the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply will be dealt with in a true Federal spirit, so that the national destinies of this Commonwealth may progress as rapidly and successfully as they have done in the past. I must apologize if I touch upon some of the ground covered by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Cook) this afternoon. I wish to refer first to the past and contemplated action of the Government respecting facilities for communiI congratuof late the Government for having exis tended the postal and telephonic serthe vices. These works have been of the l l greatest benefit to the people who bear the by His heat and burden of the day.",31
98,Sir AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,On e would need of a microscope to detect much improvement,31
99,Mr GARDNER,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"I , myself, when sertravelling through sparsely populated areas cannot fail to notice the numerous telephone offices which have been erected, and which mean so much the people engaged in primary indusI congratulate the Postmaster General (Mr Gibson) on his efforts to overtake. the arrears of work in his department. When he assumed office postal were six months in arrear, but now, owing to the progressive policy carried out by .the department, they are only six If the Government as during the rest of its term of office exthe country telephonic and postal services to the same extent as it has in past, those facilities will be almost the doubled. That is a very good answer to to the interjection made by the honorMr able member for Eden-Monaro (Sir As the honourable member is a representative of country inis terests, I should have expected that in be stead of criticizing he would be throwing work of up his hat for glee. Another cause for satisfaction to the country people is the action taken by the Government in the last budget to allow as a deduction from income the cost of the erection of fences to combat the rabbit and dingo peats. Another benefit conferred at that time, which, I believe, emanated from the Opposition, waa the deduction in taxation allowed for medical expenses of a member of the family. I am glad to know that as far as vermin-proof fencing is concerned financial assistance is to be given the states to help the man on the land. At present the anomaly exists of the Government of New South Wales' making grants chargeable with interest when the Commonwealth Government is making grants without interest. trust that the action contemplated by the Government means that financial assistance only will be given, and that the administration will be left in the hands of the states. I wish now to refer to the Dairy Produce Export Control Board. I compliment the dairy farmers of Australia on having given such a fine vote of approval to the action taken by Parliament last year in placing the Dairy Produce Export Control A ct on the statute-book.",31
100,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"Onl y about 20 per cent, of them voted.",32
101,Mr GARDNER,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"That is not an un- vitally affects industrialists. common experience. In conversation with those engaged in this industry in my electorate, I found that they were very grateful to the Government for the action taken; and now that some f r u it s of its work are apparent, they realise that the board is functioning properly, and that machinery by which the dairying industry will be greatly improved has been set in motion. No men are more worthy of the full f r u it s of their labour than those engaged in the dairying industry. The Government is to be congratulated on its recognition of the fact that the main and arterial roads of the Commonwealth are a national concern. For some time it has been realized that, with the revolution in transport which has been Jirought about by motor traction, it is impossible for the shires and municipal councils, or even the States, to provide the necessary finance to maintain the roads in a proper condition. therefore, glad that a larger sum than previously is to be provided this year by the Commonwealth for arterial roads in order to ensure that 'easier access to markets which is essential to the well-being of the primary producers and the progress of Australia. [2] Nor has the Government been unmindful of the secondary industries. It realizes that while the primary industries are the chief sources of our wealth, if our industries are to expand and employment found for those who constitute our best market-the home market-reasonabl e encouragement must be given to our secondary industries also. Now that the Tariff Board's reports are coming to hand, it is to be hoped that there will be a review of the Industries Preservation 1 Act, and that,, by the removal of existing anomalies, our secondary industries will be greatly assisted. I have endeavoured to show that, both by its past actions and the legislation foreshadowed for this session, the Government gives evidence of its desire to deal fairly and squarely with the primary and secondary industries. I now wish to refer to the industrial section of the community. It is to * be regretted that we have not had a more definite pronouncement of the intention of the Government regarding national insurance! This is a matter which It means much in times of temporary sickness and in maternity cases, but in an even greater measure will a proper scheme of national insurance relieve them from the nightmare of unemployment. The full report of the commission has not yet been presented, but I trust that when it comes to hand the Government will give it the fullest consideration, so that a well-thought-out scheme will result. I shall now deal with the subject of arbitration. The Governor General's Speech does not give very much detail of the Government's intentions, but it has long been recognized that this is a very delicate and difficult subject. Constitutional authorities have pointed out what little power Parliament possesses in regard to industrial disputes, in that before any action can be taken by Parliament a dispute must be of a federal nature; that is to say, it. must extend beyond the I am, borders of one state. It may yet be found necessary to submit to the people a proposal for an alteration of the Constitution main and in this connection. Honourable members have only to recall the shipping strike to realise that a very serious position has already arisen. It is time that both parties to a dispute recognized that they cannot have a thing both A dispute is either a matter for arbitration or it is not. It is to be regretted that in the ment of their unions the moderate men have not a greater influence. remarkable that foreigners who have nothing in common with the citizens of Australia, and have no respect for our K in g or our flag, or for established British in stitutions, car. enter this country and exercise over their members a power that is detrimental to employers and employees alike.",32
102,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,Are not the to blame also 1,33
103,Mr GARDNER,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"I holdno brief for the ship-owners, but I repeat that it is to be regretted that men of the Walsh type can so influence a union that the shipping of this country is held up, Australian workmen kept unemployed, and our produce left to rot on the wharfs. From such action nothing but what is detrimental to' the best interests of Australia can accrue. The Prime Minister gave an assurance recently- I do not think that it was necessary-that he would not interfere with legitimate trade unionism. At the same time the position that has arisen in connection with the shipping strike leads one to the conclusion that, while it is impossible for us to pass legislation which will protect our industries, the members of the unions and the public generally, the demand from the people of Australia will tend in that direction. Honourable members on the other side seem to think that if the terms of the new migration agreement are to be carried out unemployment must necessarily ensue, but when we consider that it is only about 150 years since the first axe was laid to the trees in this country, we must be proud of the progress that Australia has made. No other community can boast of greater progress. We are proud, not only of our great cities, but also of the development that taken place in . country I maintain that that has been achieved by a policy of individualism, for which honourable members on this side stand. The pioneers who blazed the track would not have launched out in the way they did if they had not believed that they had a wide field for the exercise of their ambition, and possessed the right to hold for themselves, and to hand down to ways. those who followed them, whatever they should honestly gain. The history of the past is not such as to indicate that a manage- change in that respect is desirable. On the contrary, it furnishes proof that we It seems should encourage individualism. I know that labour plays an equal part with capital in the development of any country, the two being interdependent, but I still maintain that had capital not been brought to Australia from the Old Land and invested here, we should not have made the progress which has been made. I believe that the effect of the new imship-owners migration agreement will be the investment in Australia of a great deal more capital, and that the terms upon which it will be secured will be more liberal than they have been in the past. _ I fai l to understand in what way that will act detrimentally to the working class section of the community. In Australia, we have democratic rule, and must bow to the will of the majority. There has now been established in New South Wales a Labour Government. I have read the platform upon which the Labour party went to the country there, and the schemes which its leader, Mr Lang, demanded should be carried out, and I shall be more than surprised if he turns down the new immigration agreement. He would not be able to obtain capital on such favourable terms in any other way, and if he did not take advantage of the opportunity that presents itself, he would be recreant to the trust that has been reposed in him . I sincerely trust, and I really believe, that he will sign the agreement. Immigration is inseparable from defence and the maintenance of our policy of a White Australia. England's position' has been considerably altered since the termination of the war. In the past th© strength of England's Navy has been the protection of Australia, and that protection has allowed us to progress in serenity. It seems has to me that in order to hold this districts. country and maintain a White Australia, we must extend the right hand of friendship to our kinsmen from across the sea. I think that, before long, the ideas propounded by honourable members of the Opposition in relation to defence will be exploded. Even though there are Labour - Governments in the majorit y of the states, I do hot believe that they will be so short-sighted as to neglect an opportunity to carry out big developmental works, and thus give employment to thousands of their people. The State Governments have erred sadly in their administration of soldier settlements. they have learnt a lesson by those failures, and now take advantage of the loan that is being arranged between Great Britain and .the Commonwealth, there will be nothing to complain of in the matter of public works and land settlement. That leads me to the subject of defence. I think that the Government will receive the approval of the citizens of Australia for having realized that, having reached the status of nationhood, very great responsibilities devolve upon us. various treaties, England's naval power has been reduced below the twopower standard. The scene of naval activity has changed from the No r t h Sea to the Pacific Ocean. I believe that the people of Australia will realise that the Government has laid down for the defence of Australia a"" sane and definite programme, which is limited only by its financial responsibilities. It is proposed to have constructed two 10,000-ton cruisers. Honourable members on this side claim to possess as true an Australian spirit as do honourable members opposite. H a d it been reasonably possible for one of those cruisers to be built in Australia that decision would have had our fullest support. The facts, however, revealed the unwisdom of such a course. The Government has not only to consider the industries of Australia; it has to remember also that it is the trustee of the people's money. The building of a cruiser in Australia would have assisted Australian industries to the extent of only about 15 per cent, of the cost. The work would have been one almost wholly of assembling the different parts in Australia, and therefore no new in dustry would have been created. I have no qualms regarding the view which my constituents will take, because I think that the Government acted in a purely Australian spirit when it considered the pecuniary interests of the taxpayers. It must be remembered that Opposition moved an amendment which, if carried, wouid have prevented the building of cruisers either in Australia or anywhere else. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) probably hopes that next year he will be Prime Minister of Australia. In such an event, had a start been made with the construction of cruisers in Australia, the unfortunate workers in the industry If would have been thrown out of employment, and would have lived to curse the Laboiir party. A sea-plane carrier is to be built at Cockatoo Island dockyard, and the Commonwealth Government proposes to assist the Government of the State of New South Wales in the construction of a floating dock at Newcastle. I do not wish to detain the House longer, and, in conclusion, I would say that in the Governor General's speech and the proUnder spective legislation indicated I have no difficulty, as a Nationalist, in concluding that Nationalist principles are being maintained. A sound and sane defence policy is being evolved. Encouragement is being given to primary industries, and reasonable protection to secondary industries. The Government stands squarely for the peaceful settlement of industrial disputes and even-handed justice to employer and employee alike. In view also of the in vestment of capital in the expansion and development of our industries, which may be expected to accrue from the new migration agreement, the future would appear to hold in store probably a greater measure of progress than we have known for a considerable time, and, so far as it is possible for the Government to bring it about, equal opportunity will remain to the people of Australia.",33
104,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"Hunter ) [8.17] I desire to congratulate the mover and seconder of the Address-in-Reply on their speeches. I do not know that there is much in the Governor General's speech that requires consideration at the hands of this House. I confess that to me it is rather disappointing. We have for some years past had what we might term a continuous session. Although I was not here at the close of last session, on looking up the records I found that, at its last sitting, the House adjourned u n t il members should be called together by Mr . ihe Speaker by wire or letter. The Government has seen fit to alter that arrangement and, only a few weeks ago, after a long recess extending over seven months, it caused the issue of a proclamation proroguing Parliament. As a conseqtience, we are in the position today that we must practically go over our work de novo, because, by this action of the Government, all business has been wiped off the notice-paper. occurs to me to ask whether there was 1 any necessity for the adoption of this procedure. I do not for a moment contend . that the Government had not the right and the power to do what it has done, but let honourable members peruse the Governor General's speech, and say' what there is in it . I ask any honourable mem-' ber to read it through, and then ask himself whether there is anything in the speech which warrants the disturbance of the business-paper of the House.",34
105,Mr GHEGORY,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,Where is the disturbance?,35
106,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"B y the action taken by the Government the business paper has been cleared, and we must reinstate the entries upon it . The House was in recess for seven months at a time when urgent work required the attention of Parliament. I remind the honourable member for Swan that if we were to debate the motion adoption of the Address-in-Reply a week or two might be spent in that way, and I say that there is nothing in the Governor General's speech to warrant such a debate. Each proposal contained in the. speech has been made known to the people of Australia during the last month or two by the Prime Minister and other members of the Government. We knew what we had to expect. There are to be certain amendments of various acts, and one or two new matters are to be introduced. There is nothing startling announced in the Speech, and no surprise's indicated, and we might have gone on with business without going through the ceremony which we are going through today. I am aware that the procedure in connection with the opening of a session has been handed down to us as a British institution, and that it is customary to have an Address-in-Reply to the opening speech of the session. We are very conservative as a people, and - old customs apparently have to be adhered to. Tliat accounts for the present position. But no honourable member can justify the prorogation. If we have gone on for years as we have done since the war, without the adoption of this procedure, what compelled the Government to follow it at this particular time. If the proclamation proroguing Parliament was not made u n t i l six or seven months after the adjournment of It the House, I venture to say that this is not helping the business of the country. The Government was not justified in closing this House down for seven months and more when there was urgent business to attend to. We have had put into the mouth of the Governor General the statement that the Government decided not to recommend to Parliament approval of the d r a ft Protocol drawn up at the f if t h assembly of the League of Nations. I have never made this a party question. I have always claimed that it should be considered non-party. It is no excuse for the Government to contend that the reason why it abandoned the provisions of the Protocol was because it was unable to bring the matter before the House. The House might have been called together at any time under the motion carried for its adjournment at the close of last session. There is no justification for the high handed action of the Government in this for the matter. It should have permitted this House to discuss that particular question as well as other urgent matters that require the attention of this Parliament. In the circumstances, I do not feel inclined to waste time on the Governor General's Speech. I - invite honourable members to consider the promised bills that are enumerated in it . There is, for instance, the Arbitration Bill . But we cannot deal with the proposed amendments of the existing law u n t i l we have the bill before us. The real debate on the subject must take place on the bill itself. The same remark applies to the Migration Bill ; to the proposal for the.construction of the North-South Railway, and to that for - the administration of the Northern Territory. Why should we be occupied after so long a recess in discussing the Governor General's Speech when we must deal with the matters contained in it in the very near future, and before the expiration of this Parliament. In the circumstances, I do not intend to take up time unnecessarily in discussing the Speech. I am not satisfied with the conduct of public business, and I do not think that the people of this country are satisfied with it . There is a proper time, however, to deal with that. I do not think it. is to be dealt with on the motion for the adoption of the Addressin-Reply, and, therefore, I shall not longer detain the House now.

107,Mr MAHONY,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"Dalley) [ 8 . 3 2 ] - I wish to direct the attention of the Minister for Defence (Sir Neville Howse) to the dismissal of employees at the Garden 12 Island Naval Depot. Between 250 and 260 of these men have been thrown out of AYES. work within the last couple of weeks, and I urge upon the Minister that immediate steps be taken to relieve their distress. Every representative of a metropolitan constituency knows how prevalent unemployment is today; yet these men are being thrown upon an already overcrowded labour market. If there is one Prowse, J. H. department more than another which should be called to account for its utter disregard of the working men it is the Navy Department. Naval work is being discontinued right and left, with the result that hundreds of men are losing their employment. While Ministers talk glibly about making adequate provision for the defence of the Commonwealth, the very men whose technical skill is essential to NOES. adequate preparation for defence are being allowed to starve. The officials of the Navy Department seem to have an undying hatred of their own country. Mr E . RILEY - Australi a is not their country.",36
108,Mr MAHONY,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"At any rate, it is the country that provides them with f at billets. Old employees who have served at Garden Island for 30 or 40 years, and are still willing and able to work, are, in the declining years of their life, being thrown PAIRS. upon a congested labour market. These men are being thrown out of employment in the declining years of their lives. I know, of course, that the Minister will listen courteously to any representations made on their behalf, but courtesy does not go far enough. These men, with wives and children to care for, require work. I trust, therefore, that the policy of the department will be altered immediately. The Minister should have a heart-to-heart talk with certain officials of the Navy Department, and give them clearly to understand that they must pay some regard to the wishes of the people of Australia.",36
109,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"East Sydney) [8.36] I endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony). is a shame that these men should be faced with dismissal at a time when there is so much unemployment in the iron trade, Unfortunately, Ministerial supporters are not mechanics, and do not realise the seriousness of the position. Skilled workmen, who have been in the service of the state for many years, will find it extremely hard to obtain employment outside at the present time. The Government, to retain the services of these skilled men, should arrange for a continuity of work, as was done wihen a Labour Ministry was in power in New South Wales. Unfortu nately, there seems to be an agreement among employers of labour throughout the Commonwealth to defeat the objects of the Arbitration Act, but I hope that, before the session closes, we shall be able to persuade honourable members opposite that it is no part of their duty to punish wage earners who soil their hands in the pursuit of their avocation. I intend to refer again to a question which I put to the Postmaster-General (Mr Gibson) this afternoon concerning the notice of dismissal received by a number of men engaged in laying cables in the streets of Sydney and its suburbs. This course has not been rendered necessary owing to lack of material. It is believed that the Treasurer is curtailing departmental expenditure wherever possible in order to show a larger surplus at the end of the nnancial year. This is not the way to conduct the business of the country. It would appear that Mr Brown, who was brought from England to occupy the position of permanent head of the department, is in reality the Postmaster-General. I hope the House will not tolerate this state of affairs. The Postmaster-General may tell me that he is unaware of the dismissal of these men, and that he has issued no instructions to that effect. It is a fact, nevertheless,, that some have received notices of dismissal.",37
110,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"I have already told the the K in g . "" honourable member that it is not so.",37
111,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"Then I am afraid that do not know what black and white mean, because it has been done. Unfortunately for me, I am in the confidence of these men, so whilst I know what is happening, I am unable to disclose the source of information.",37
112,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,The honourable member has been misinformed. It Mr WEST - But these men are preparing to leave their work. Mr GIBSON. - I have given the honourable member the assurance that they are not.,37
113,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"It is all very well for the Minister to say that. It will not improve the position of men who have been discharged. I am not referring to permanent employees, but to temporary hands, many of whom were taken on prior to the war, some, I believe, on my recommendation that they were suitable for the class of work referred to. If these men are discharged they will be in a very awkward position.",37
114,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,They will not be discharged.,37
115,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"I am willing to allow the matter to stand over to give the Minister an opportunity to clear himself. I know the unfortunate position in which these men will find themselves, and I am only doing my duty in bringing the subject under the notice of the Postmaster General.",37
116,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"Calare-Min ister for Defence) [ 8 . 4 7 ] - I can assure honourable members that, to my knowledge, no dismissals have occurred at Garden Island or elsewhere except of men who have reached the retiring age of 65 years.",37
117,Mr ANSTEY,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"Bourke) [8.48] - The motion is for the adjournment. of the House. I am in favour of an adjournment, for nothing else can be done in the circumstances. Honourable members were "" called together to consider matters of importance to the welfare of the people and the development of the Commonwealth."" Some very important things have been done up to now! There have been a lot of ceremonial functions, such as flag waving, the marching backwards and forwards of armed soldiers, cheers for the Empire, and the singing of "" G o d save The Governor General has been made to perambulate about the buildI ing in order that there may be a new session,, and that there may be an Address-inReply debate. This House has been dead for seven months, and in ordinary circumstances would have re-assembled without my all this ceremonial. But for reasons of its own the Government, without explain.ing its motives, caused Parliament to be prorogued. Why did it do that? For some time past a vicious political propaganda has been carried on in the press of this country. The publicists of the other side have been using the newspapers of New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria, to promulgate the idea that the Labour party would waste three or four weeks of valuable time in discussing the Addressin-Reply. The newspapers have been tubthumping and endeavouring to create the impression that the Opposition would prevent this great Government from carrying on the business of the country. Apparently the Government had not, even as late as three weeks ago, thought of the ruse of an Address-in-Reply debate. The excuse has been put forward that the Governor General was anxious to open Parliament again before leaving Australia. That statement is an insult to His Excellency. He never thought of it. He is naturally a timid and bashful man, but the Government seized him, and made him a dummy and an instrument to further its own ends. It. held him up to public ridicule by making him parade in Parliament this afternoon to read a speech. It thought that members of the Opposition would do the barnstorming for two or three weeks, at the end of which time it would be able to blame them for its own inactivity. In this way members of the Government, while they talk of their Imperialism, disgrace their position. They have brought obloquy upon the GovernorGenei-al by making him a mere stop-gap.",37
118,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt). - I remind the honourable member that it is not orderly to reflect upon the representative of the King.,38
119,Mr ANSTEY,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"I am not reflecting upon the representative of the King, for that is the last thing I wish to do. I am defending him, and endeavouring to exalt his prestige. I am protesting against the degrading action of the Government, in using him to serve its own base ends. Every one knows that the Governor General had no desire for this function. He is a backward, bashful, timid gentleman, with no desire to be brought out of his obscurity and paraded in public. His only desire is faithfully to represent His Majesty the King in this country, and, when his term of office has expired, to depart peacefully for the country from which he came. The Government, however, dragged him out of his obscurity and made him parade here in order to deliver a speech. By the terms of the adjournment of last October, the Government could have called the House together at any time. You, Mr Speaker, were instructed to calf it together on a day and at an hour that you thought fit. The Government did not consult you on the subject of calling Parliament together, but caused Parliament to be prorogued and has now brought down an Address-in-Reply. What matters of importance to the welfare of the people and the development of the Commonwealth have we considered on this, the first day of our reassembling? We have been called together to witness a parade of uniforms, and this marching up and down stairs. We suspended our sitting for dinner, and certain gentlemen having made speeches from the other side of the House, we are now asked to adjourn the House. The honourable member for Indi (Mr Cook) made a speech. He talked of various things-nava l engagements and armies-and proceeded to close with a remarkable peroration. He was followed by another honourable member.",38
120,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,I direct the attention of the honourable member and the House to the fact that it is not parliamentary or permissible to refer to an order of the day that has been listed for tomorrow. It will not he in order to traverse the Governor General's Speech or to debate the Address-in-Reply until after 2.30 p.m. tomorrow.,38
121,Mr ANSTEY,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,I am sorry to offend.,38
122,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"The honourable membei-, as an old parliamentarian, should not offend so often.",38
123,Mr ANSTEY,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"I thank you for your leniency, and shall endeavour not to offend so often in future. The reason for the adjournment is that we shall be able to meet tomorrow, and I have to consider whether the business 'for which we are asked to meet tomorrow is of sufficient importance to justify our meeting. I understand that a speech is to be delivered by the Attorney-General (Sir Littleton Groom) in continuance of the debate on the Address-in-Reply, and I feel quite sure that he is now in the f u ll process of incubating a speech to justify the actions of the Government. It has pursued a most unusual course. It imagined that the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply would be the bait at which honourable members of the Opposition would bite, and that expectation has ignominiously failed. I did not expect for a moment that we should be able to catch the Government for the third time in this way. I did not imagine that Ministers would be so stupid as not to anticipate what the Opposition would endeavour to do. Had we not trapped the Government we should have been caught in the snare laid by it, for it has set the papers throughout the country working overtime in telling the people that the Opposition would discuss the motion for - the adoption of the Address-in-Reply for three or four weeks, andmove a series of amendments to it. Now, however, the Government is not prepared to go on with the business of the country,. although it tells us that Parliament has been - called together to consider matters relating to the development and welfare of this country. Why does the Government wish to shut up the House at -9 p.m., and leave the consideration of the welfare of the country until tomorrow? Why does the Government not tell' the House today something of the wonderful things it proposes to do? Why does it not tell us how it saved the banks? Let the Leader of the Government disclose how he is going to save Australia? Why does he not tell us about the speeches he made at Frankston and Ballarat? Is there no frui t to be gathered on this first day of the session? The truth is that this is a hopeless and helpless Government. It is composed of gentlemen who set out to do things but never accomplish them. They make trips to Great Britain, and they work up Addresses-in-Reply with the idea that members of the Opposition are all flies to be caught. Ministers have still a lot to learn. We on this side may be very foolish, but we can teach them something in connection with the management of ' the country's affairs. Thank God, however, we shall have some business to consider tomorrow! Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [9.0] The Minister for Defence (Sir Neville Howse) must be greatly mistaken, or he must have been misled by his officers, if he declares that no men have been put off at Garden Island.",38
124,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"I said, "" Except men who had arrived at the age of 65 years."" Mr E. RILEY - I am speaking of other men, such as young mechanics, who' have been put off on the ground that the vote has run out, and that there is no money to enable them to be kept in employment until the Estimates are passed. Surely it will be a mistake if the services of these men are not retained. If , as was stated by the honourable member for news- Robertson (Mr Gardner), the country needs protection, why have over 200 men been put off at Garden Island ? I am surprised that the Minister for Defence seems to be unaware of the true position. Surely he should have been .consulted before such action was taken. The excuse given by the foreman is that the Government have not sufficient money available to keep these men in employment, but . surely the Treasurer could provide an advance for the purpose.",39
125,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [9.1] - It is very regrettable . that the Opposition is so completely blind to the national interests that in the pursuit of party aims, and from an amazingly misguided idea that it could thereby achieve some party advantage, it declines to show any interest in the Governor General's Speech. Honourable members opposite have not dealt with the matters touched upon in that Speech, and they allege as their reason that those matters are so utterly unimportant that it would be a waste of their time to consider them.",39
126,Mr GABB,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,In their present form.,39
127,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"Such a declaration is a - little appalling when one considers the nature of the subjects referred to in the Speech. I do not ask the Opposition to accept the views of the Government as set forth in the Speech, but have honourable members opposite no interest in the important subjects therein referred to? Is migration, for instance, a matter of no interest to them? Have they nothing at all to say with regard to the agreement recently entered into between the British and Commonwealth Governments? Have they no interest in the welfare of our great secondary industries? Are they not concerned about the alien immigration into this country? I have heard them talk of the necessity for the maintenance of racial purity, and of the result of the introduction of aliens. Are they in no way concerned with the Geneva Protocol?",39
128,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"I rise to a point of order. Tho Prime Minister is referring to the Governor General's Speech .paragraph by paragraph, although your ruling, Mr Speaker, was that honourable members nrc debarred from discussing the Speech at this stage.",40
129,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"My ruling was pevfectly clear. The resumption of the debate on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply has heen fixed for tomorrow, and, therefore, honourable members may not now traverse the contents of the address. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition did traverse them in defiance of my ruling.",40
130,Mr ANSTEY,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"No , Mr Speaker; in ignorance.",40
131,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"I am afraid that sometimes I do not know the difference when the honourable member is concerned. The Prime Minister, apparently, is now replying to what he said, and I urge him to keep strictly within the ruling given.",40
132,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH SHIPPING,"I bow to your ruling, sir, but I think that I am quite in order in referring to the fact that the Opposition complains that the House is adjourning early to-night because the Government has no business to do: On the contrary, we have a great deal of business to transact, as the Opposition will very soon discover. But out of courtesy to honourable members opposite, we have tried to facilitate their work in a manner that has become almost traditional in this Parliament. As I intimated to the Leader of the Opposition, the Government, not for its convenience, but for his, proposed to do no more today than to take the speeches of the mover and seconder of the Address-in-Reply, and then give him the adjournment, so that he would have ample opportunity to consider the Governor General's Speech, and deal with it in any way that he might desire. But now the Leader of the Opposition has said that there is nothing in the Governor General's Speech which interests him or this Parliament. I am very content to leave the matter there. The country will judge the Opposition, on its declaration that it takes no interest in the important matters that are mentioned in the Speech, and I am sure will come to the conclusion that honourable members opposite are not sincere, but desire to gain some party advantage. Taking fhis view, the countiy will regard the attitude of honourable members as an absolute dereliction of duty on the part of His Majesty's Opposition. Question resolved in the affirmative. House ndjouraed at 9.7 p.m.",40
